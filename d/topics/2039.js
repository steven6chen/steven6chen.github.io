Injury is usually considered irreversible (cell death), but definitive proof that cell death is an inevitable consequence of the process is not available. </p><p>Causes of cardiac injury include trauma, toxins, and viral infection, but ischemia or infarction consequent to an imbalance between the supply and demand of oxygen (and nutrients) is the most common cause.</p><p>When a sufficient number of myocytes have died (myocyte necrosis) or lost function, acute clinical disease is apparent; examples include myocardial infarction (MI) or myocarditis. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=criteria-for-the-diagnosis-of-acute-myocardial-infarction\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Criteria for the diagnosis of acute myocardial infarction&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-myocarditis-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of myocarditis in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The biochemical characteristics and utility of myoglobin, fatty acid binding protein, lactate dehydrogenase, and creatine kinase for the diagnosis of and prognosis after acute MI will be reviewed here. Troponins, which are the preferred biomarkers for diagnosis and prognosis, are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=troponin-testing-clinical-use\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Troponin testing: Clinical use&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H516920712\"><span class=\"h1\">CREATINE KINASE AND CK-MB</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Creatine kinase (CK) and its MB isoenzyme (CK-MB) were the most commonly used serologic tests for the diagnosis of myocardial infarction prior to the widespread adoption of troponin. Their use has markedly diminished over time. They are discussed here predominantly for those areas of the world where cardiac troponin assays are not yet in use. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=troponin-testing-clinical-use\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Troponin testing: Clinical use&quot;</a>.)</p><p>It is difficult to find any situation in which CK-MB adds anything other than cost to the clinical utility of cardiac troponin (cTn) if that marker is used properly [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/biomarkers-of-cardiac-injury-other-than-troponin/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Thus, many recommend it no longer be used [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/biomarkers-of-cardiac-injury-other-than-troponin/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. However, some experts continue to advocate for measurement of CK-MB in the setting of assessment of periprocedural (percutaneous coronary intervention [PCI] or coronary artery bypass graft surgery [CABG]) myocardial infarction (MI) for epidemiological reasons. Also, some clinicians prefer the use of CK-MB for the detection of early reinfarction, although this is not guideline recommended. Nonetheless, there are data to support the usefulness of cTn for each of these applications. Some have even argued that using it at all will reduce the ability of clinicians to use cTn properly. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H516920732\"><span class=\"h2\">CK basics</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The enzyme CK (formerly referred to as creatine phosphokinase) exists as isoenzymes, which are dimers of M and B chains and exist in three combinations: MM, MB, and BB [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/biomarkers-of-cardiac-injury-other-than-troponin/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. These isoenzymes reside in the cytosol and facilitate the egress of high-energy phosphates into and out of mitochondria. CK isoenzyme activity is distributed in many tissues, including skeletal muscle, but there is more of the CK-MB fraction in the heart [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/biomarkers-of-cardiac-injury-other-than-troponin/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Most muscles have more CK per gram than heart tissue [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/biomarkers-of-cardiac-injury-other-than-troponin/abstract/4,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,5</a>]. Thus, skeletal muscle breakdown can lead to absolute increases in CK-MB in the plasma. In addition, in response to organ damage, including vigorous exercise [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/biomarkers-of-cardiac-injury-other-than-troponin/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>], there is regeneration of skeletal muscle fibers and re-expression of proteins that existed during ontogeny, resulting in increased production of B chain CK protein [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/biomarkers-of-cardiac-injury-other-than-troponin/abstract/5,7,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,7,8</a>]. A large percentage of the CK that is released is degraded locally or in lymph [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/biomarkers-of-cardiac-injury-other-than-troponin/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. Reperfusion truncates this process and increases the rapidity and magnitude of egress of CK into plasma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/biomarkers-of-cardiac-injury-other-than-troponin/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H516920862\"><span class=\"h2\">Total CK measurements for the detection of cardiac damage</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Elevations in total serum CK lack specificity for cardiac damage, which improves with measurement of the MB fraction. The normal range of CK also varies considerably; a twofold or greater increase in the CK concentration is required for diagnosis. This criterion can be problematic in older individuals who, because of their lower muscle mass, may have low baseline serum total CK and, during MI, may have elevated serum CK-MB with values of total CK that rise but remain within the normal range [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/biomarkers-of-cardiac-injury-other-than-troponin/abstract/11-13\" class=\"abstract_t\">11-13</a>]. For these reasons, total CK has not been used in the diagnosis of myocardial damage for years.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H516920910\"><span class=\"h2\">CK-MB fraction for diagnosis of acute MI</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>When cTn is available, CK-MB should not be used for the initial diagnosis of acute MI. If it is the only assay available, it can be used but is far less sensitive and specific. </p><p>Most assays measure CK-MB mass because they are more sensitive than activity assays. In addition, mass assays avoid, for the most part, detection of macrokinases (CK linked to IgG and dimers of mitochondrial CK) that can confound diagnosis with activity assays. The presence of macrokinases should be considered as one possibility when CK-MB is a very high percentage (&gt;20 percent) of total CK [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/biomarkers-of-cardiac-injury-other-than-troponin/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. However, patients with chronic skeletal muscle disease often have falsely positive CK-MB results when percentage criteria are used [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/biomarkers-of-cardiac-injury-other-than-troponin/abstract/8,15-17\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,15-17</a>]. The proportion of CK that is CK-MB can be as high as 50 percent with chronic skeletal muscle injury, such as <span class=\"nowrap\">dermatomyositis/polymyositis,</span> due to increased production of B chain CK protein [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/biomarkers-of-cardiac-injury-other-than-troponin/abstract/5,8,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,8,15</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H516921034\"><span class=\"h3\">Specificity and sensitivity</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>CK-MB has high specificity for cardiac tissue and was the preferred marker of cardiac injury for many years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/biomarkers-of-cardiac-injury-other-than-troponin/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. CK-MB typically begins to rise four to six hours after the onset of infarction but is not elevated in all patients until about 12 hours (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F89580\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef89580 \">figure 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/biomarkers-of-cardiac-injury-other-than-troponin/abstract/18,19\" class=\"abstract_t\">18,19</a>].</p><p>An elevated CK-MB is relatively specific for myocardial injury, particularly in patients with ischemic symptoms, when skeletal muscle damage is not present. Elevations return to baseline within 36 to 48 hours, in contrast to elevations in troponin, which can persist for as long as 10 to 14 days [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/biomarkers-of-cardiac-injury-other-than-troponin/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. This means that CK-MB, unlike troponins, cannot be used for the late diagnosis of an acute MI but can be used to suggest infarct extension if levels rise again after declining. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=criteria-for-the-diagnosis-of-acute-myocardial-infarction\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Criteria for the diagnosis of acute myocardial infarction&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Gender specific values are essential for diagnostic use [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/biomarkers-of-cardiac-injury-other-than-troponin/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. </p><p>Because CK-MB can be released from skeletal muscle, its diagnostic use is impaired when skeletal muscle injury is present [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/biomarkers-of-cardiac-injury-other-than-troponin/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. Some have suggested using a ratio of CK-MB to total CK to improve specificity, but that approach markedly reduces the sensitivity. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H516921205\"><span class=\"h2\">CK-MB fraction for prognosis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There is a relationship between infarct size, which can be estimated by CK-MB and prognosis. Peak values are less precise, but if adequate numbers of samples are obtained, they can provide a reasonable estimate. Comparisons with cTn suggest that cTn provides better estimates [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/biomarkers-of-cardiac-injury-other-than-troponin/abstract/23-27\" class=\"abstract_t\">23-27</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H516921297\"><span class=\"h2\">CK and coronary reperfusion</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The time to peak CK-MB levels and the slope of CK-MB release can be used to assess whether reperfusion has occurred after fibrinolysis and, when used in conjunction with clinical variables, can predict whether TIMI 0 or 1 and TIMI 2 or 3 grade flow is present [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/biomarkers-of-cardiac-injury-other-than-troponin/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. However, CK-MB criteria cannot identify the presence of TIMI 3 flow, which is the only level of perfusion associated with improved survival after fibrinolysis and this approach is not necessary at all with primary PCI. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H516921317\"><span class=\"h2\">Reinfarction and late diagnosis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Since CK-MB levels return to baseline 36 to 48 hours after infarction, resampling can be used to detect very early reinfarction. Since cTn does not normalize that rapidly, it has been suggested that CK-MB might be of value in this area. It is now clear that cTn increases rapidly, albeit from an abnormal baseline in patients with reinfarction. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H543378319\"><span class=\"h2\">After myocardial revascularization</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>CK-MB still has advocates for its use to define MI after myocardial revascularization with either PCI or CABG. As it detects larger infarcts, CK-MB holds more &ldquo;weight&rdquo; with some clinicians and trialists. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H516921337\"><span class=\"h2\">Why troponin is preferred</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H516921343\"><span class=\"h3\">Diagnosis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Because of their increased sensitivity and specificity compared with CK-MB and other markers, troponins are preferred for the diagnosis of MI in most settings. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=troponin-testing-clinical-use#H3700263609\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Troponin testing: Clinical use&quot;, section on 'Diagnosis of acute MI'</a>.)</p><p>The basis for the consistent observation that troponin is more sensitive than CK-MB relates to the fact that more troponin is found in the heart per gram of myocardium and that a greater percentage depleted from the heart by cardiac injury arrives in the blood [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/biomarkers-of-cardiac-injury-other-than-troponin/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p>With regard to specificity, troponin elevations are almost always specific for cardiac injury, except for the infrequent analytical false positives caused by fibrin interference <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> cross-reacting antibodies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/biomarkers-of-cardiac-injury-other-than-troponin/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. As mentioned above, CK-MB is not specific for cardiac injury, as a small amount is found in skeletal muscle. (See <a href=\"#H516920732\" class=\"local\">'CK basics'</a> above.)</p><p>It is difficult today to find any situation in which CK-MB adds anything other than cost to the clinical utility of cTn if that marker is used properly [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/biomarkers-of-cardiac-injury-other-than-troponin/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].

This was illustrated in a review of almost 30,000 such patients from the multicenter CRUSADE initiative in the United States [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/biomarkers-of-cardiac-injury-other-than-troponin/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. The following findings were noted:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The results were discordant in 28 percent of patients. Troponin was more sensitive, as 18 percent had elevated troponin but normal CK-MB values. In addition, 10 percent had false positive CK-MB elevations, as defined by normal troponin values.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Compared with patients who were negative for both biomarkers, in-hospital mortality was not increased in patients who were troponin-negative and CK-MB-positive (ie, false positives; 3.0 versus 2.7 percent, adjusted odds ratio 1.02, 95 percent CI 0.75-1.38).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Compared with patients who were negative for both biomarkers, there was a nonsignificant trend toward increased mortality in patients who were <span class=\"nowrap\">troponin-positive/CK-MB-negative</span> (4.5 versus 2.7 percent, adjusted odds ratio 1.15, 95% CI 0.86-1.54) and a significant increase in mortality in patients who were positive for both biomarkers (5.9 versus 2.7 percent, adjusted odds ratio 1.53, 95% CI 1.18-1.98).</p><p/><p>These differences in outcomes could not be explained by differences in therapy since the two discordant groups were treated similarly with antithrombotic agents and PCI. Thus, an isolated CK-MB elevation has limited prognostic value in patients with a non-ST elevation ACS, while an isolated troponin elevation was associated with increased risk.</p><p>Similar findings have been noted in other studies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/biomarkers-of-cardiac-injury-other-than-troponin/abstract/29,31,32\" class=\"abstract_t\">29,31,32</a>]. In a report of over 10,000 patients with an ACS from the multicenter GRACE registry, 1110 (10.4 percent) were <span class=\"nowrap\">troponin-positive/CK-MB-negative</span> and 822 (7.7 percent) were <span class=\"nowrap\">troponin-negative/CK-MB-positive</span> (false positives) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/biomarkers-of-cardiac-injury-other-than-troponin/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>]. In-hospital mortality was highest when both troponin and CK-MB were positive (7.7 percent), intermediate in <span class=\"nowrap\">troponin-positive/CK-MB-negative</span> patients (3.9 percent), and lowest in patients in whom both markers were negative and those who were <span class=\"nowrap\">troponin-negative/CK-MB-positive</span> (1.7 and 2.3 percent, respectively).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">MYOGLOBIN</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Myoglobin is a ubiquitous heme protein that is rapidly released from damaged tissue because of its small size [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/biomarkers-of-cardiac-injury-other-than-troponin/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>]. Its half-life in plasma is in the range of nine minutes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/biomarkers-of-cardiac-injury-other-than-troponin/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>]. Due to its early appearance in the serum, myoglobin was postulated to be a useful adjunct to either troponin or creatine kinase MB (CK-MB) for the early diagnosis of myocardial infarction (MI) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/biomarkers-of-cardiac-injury-other-than-troponin/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>].

Thus, there is little advantage for the use of myoglobin as a marker of early injury unless an insensitive cTn assay is being employed. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=troponin-testing-clinical-use\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Troponin testing: Clinical use&quot;</a>.) In addition, the prior use of myoglobin <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> biomarkers in general for the detection of reperfusion is no longer used.

In CHOPIN, 1967 patients with chest pain presenting to an emergency department within six hours of pain onset underwent evaluation with clinical examination, serial sensitive troponin, measurements, and electrocardiograms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/biomarkers-of-cardiac-injury-other-than-troponin/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>]. Copeptin was measured simultaneously with each troponin. A negative copeptin and cardiac troponin (cTn) I at baseline ruled out acute MI for 58 percent of patients, with a negative predictive value of 99.2 percent. It was estimated that the average time-to-decision could be reduced by 43 percent by the simultaneous use of these two biomarkers. We have some concerns regarding the way in which the gold standard diagnosis was achieved and specifically what cut-off values were used for cTn. Data from this trial have suggested that second values may also be of help [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/biomarkers-of-cardiac-injury-other-than-troponin/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>].</p><p>A randomized emergency department (ED) trial using this marker was also reported (BIC-8) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/biomarkers-of-cardiac-injury-other-than-troponin/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>]. In this trial, 902 patients with possible acute MI were evaluated for possible early discharge using a troponin assay and a new, more sensitive copeptin assay. Event rates at 30 days were similar (5.17 percent in the standard group and 5.19 percent in the copeptin group). However, those with a normal copeptin value (&lt;10 <span class=\"nowrap\">pmol/L)</span> had an event rate of 3.01 percent. Half of the patients with events in the copeptin arm had normal values but were kept in the ED by physicians who were concerned that the results were inaccurate. However, in the copeptin group, 80 percent of patients were discharged compared to only 11 percent in the standard group. These data were argued to indicate the ability of copeptin to identify a low-risk group to discharge. Some would argue that astute ED physicians are key to avoiding morbidity from this approach. It also could be argued that many of the patients in the standard group should have been discharged early as well had that been part of the approach being studied.</p><p>An evaluation from a large data set from the APACE trial failed to find benefit with the use of copeptin as an adjunct to high sensitivity (hs) cTnT in the evaluation of patients with possible acute MI [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/biomarkers-of-cardiac-injury-other-than-troponin/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>].</p><p>In summary, the cautious use of copeptin in association with close physician scrutiny may be helpful when using contemporary cTn assays to allow some patients to be sent home earlier from the ED.

There were 68 patients who presented within two hours of symptoms, 37 of whom had a final diagnosis of MI. The sensitivity for MI at two-hour measurement was significantly higher with serum H-FABP compared to cardiac troponin T or myoglobin (89 versus 22 and 38 percent, respectively). However, cardiac troponin T had a significantly higher specificity (94 versus 52 percent). In a study, H-FABP performed much better with respect to detection of acute coronary syndrome (ACS), but an insensitive troponin assay was used as the comparator [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/biomarkers-of-cardiac-injury-other-than-troponin/abstract/46\" class=\"abstract_t\">46</a>].</p><p>In addition to a possible role in diagnosis, H-FABP has been touted to help predict prognosis in patients with an ACS.

In these same studies, prognosis is worse with higher peak values even in those with elevated troponin values but this effect may be due to differences in the extent of the injury, which might also be evaluated easily by peak troponin values had they been obtained [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/biomarkers-of-cardiac-injury-other-than-troponin/abstract/47,48\" class=\"abstract_t\">47,48</a>] (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=risk-factors-for-adverse-outcomes-after-non-st-elevation-acute-coronary-syndromes#H21\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Risk factors for adverse outcomes after non-ST elevation acute coronary syndromes&quot;, section on 'Heart-type fatty acid binding protein'</a>).</p><p>Numerous studies have compared H-FABP to troponin for diagnosis or prognosis. However, they used high cut-off values for troponin or insensitive assays. Good comparison studies using contemporary troponin assays that are sensitive with the recommended cut-off values are needed to confirm these claims.</p><p>Measurement of H-FABP has not been widely evaluated or adopted as a biomarker of cardiac injury and is not approved for clinical use in the United States.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h1\">LACTATE DEHYDROGENASE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Lactate dehydrogenase (LD, formerly abbreviated LDH) was commonly used in the past in combination with aspartate aminotransferase (AST or SGOT) and creatine kinase MB (CK-MB) to diagnose an acute myocardial infarction (MI).</p><p>LD consists of M (muscle) and H (heart) subunits that give rise to five isoenzymes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/biomarkers-of-cardiac-injury-other-than-troponin/abstract/49\" class=\"abstract_t\">49</a>]. The heart primarily contains LD1 and some LD2. Red cells, kidney, stomach, and pancreas are other important sources of LD1. In contrast, LD5 predominates in skeletal muscle and liver [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/biomarkers-of-cardiac-injury-other-than-troponin/abstract/50\" class=\"abstract_t\">50</a>].</p><p>LD activity rises to abnormal levels approximately 10 hours after the onset of MI, peaks at 24 to 48 hours, and remains elevated for six to eight days [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/biomarkers-of-cardiac-injury-other-than-troponin/abstract/47\" class=\"abstract_t\">47</a>]. However, since troponins are more specific than LD and remain elevated for 5 to 10 days, current recommendations suggest that LD no longer has a role in the diagnosis of MI [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/biomarkers-of-cardiac-injury-other-than-troponin/abstract/51\" class=\"abstract_t\">51</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2067906772\"><span class=\"h1\">SOCIETY GUIDELINE LINKS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Links to society and government-sponsored guidelines from selected countries and regions around the world are provided separately.
