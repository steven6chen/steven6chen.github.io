However, the endograft remains a dynamic entity, and late complications are more likely. Complications associated with endovascular abdominal aortic repair are usually related to some technical aspect of endograft placement, such as problems with vascular access, or to the structural integrity and stability of the endograft, such as endoleak, endograft migration, or endograft collapse. </p><p>Endograft complications rarely lead to a need to convert to open surgery at the time of placement and when they occur late can usually be managed using endovascular means [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complications-of-endovascular-abdominal-aortic-repair/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Device-related complications are the main reason for reintervention (including late conversion), which is required in up to 30 percent of patients. The overall incidence of conversion is approximately 2 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complications-of-endovascular-abdominal-aortic-repair/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Ischemic complications are often related to embolism but may also be due to positioning the endograft and can affect the extremities, intestine, pelvic organs, spinal cord, or kidneys. Renal insufficiency can also be caused by the administration of intravenous contrast (eg, allergic reaction, contrast-induced nephropathy). The risk of ischemic complications increases with more complex endovascular repairs.</p><p>The complications associated with abdominal aortic endografting will be reviewed here. The indications for abdominal aortic endografting and technical aspects of endograft placement are discussed elsewhere.

The abdominal aorta lies slightly left of the midline to accommodate the inferior vena cava, which is in close apposition. The branches of the aorta (superior to inferior) include the left and right inferior phrenic arteries, left and right middle suprarenal arteries, the celiac axis, superior mesenteric artery, and left and right renal arteries in addition to occasional accessory renal arteries, left and right gonadal arteries, the inferior mesenteric artery, left and right common iliac artery, middle sacral artery, and paired lumbar arteries (L1-L4) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F51087\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef51087 \">figure 1</a>). </p><p>The common iliac arteries most often arise at the level of the fourth lumbar vertebra. The common iliac artery bifurcates into the external iliac and internal iliac arteries at the pelvic inlet (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F60420\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef60420 \">figure 2</a>). The internal iliac artery gives off branches to the pelvic viscera and also supplies the musculature of the pelvis. The external iliac artery passes beneath the inguinal ligament to become the common femoral artery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complications-of-endovascular-abdominal-aortic-repair/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1191828436\"><span class=\"h1\">ENDOVASCULAR AORTIC REPAIR</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Endovascular grafts are used to exclude the native aortic wall from aortic blood flow and pressure and, in the abdominal aorta, are used primarily for the management of abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA). Endovascular repair involves the insertion of endovascular graft components, usually via a femoral approach. The endovascular graft is constructed by the delivery and deployment of these components in vivo. The indications for abdominal aortic endografts are discussed elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-asymptomatic-abdominal-aortic-aneurysm#H611107773\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of asymptomatic abdominal aortic aneurysm&quot;, section on 'Introduction'</a>.)</p><p>Endografts for the abdominal aorta are generally modular, bifurcated devices. Devices available in the United States to treat the abdominal aorta include the Zenith, Excluder, AFX, PowerLink, Talent, Ovation, Aorfix, and Endurant grafts. Controlled comparisons of abdominal aortic stent-grafts have not been performed. The details of these devices are discussed elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=endovascular-devices-for-abdominal-aortic-repair#H1191828485\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Endovascular devices for abdominal aortic repair&quot;, section on 'Abdominal devices'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H958070867\"><span class=\"h1\">ENDOGRAFT COMPLICATIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Although the technical success rate for abdominal aortic endografting is high (99 percent), endograft-related complications are common, with an incidence that ranges from 11 to 30 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complications-of-endovascular-abdominal-aortic-repair/abstract/4-10\" class=\"abstract_t\">4-10</a>]. The incidence of complications at initial repair appears to be higher with larger-diameter aneurysms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complications-of-endovascular-abdominal-aortic-repair/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. Technical complications associated with endografts include vascular injury (eg, iliac, femoral) during access or device deployment; endoleak from inadequate fixation, sealing of the graft to the vessel wall, or breakdown of the graft material; stent fractures; component separations; and endograft collapse. These problems occur with varying frequency and timing relative to endograft placement. Their occurrence depends upon many factors, including anatomic suitability for endograft placement, graft choice, and proper measurement for the specific device chosen. Anatomic suitability and endograft choice are discussed elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=endovascular-repair-of-abdominal-aortic-aneurysm#H440175\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Endovascular repair of abdominal aortic aneurysm&quot;, section on 'Anatomic suitability'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=endovascular-devices-for-abdominal-aortic-repair#H620225163\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Endovascular devices for abdominal aortic repair&quot;, section on 'Choice of device'</a>.) </p><p>An analysis of 22,830 matched Medicare beneficiaries who underwent open or endovascular aneurysm repair showed that reintervention related to aneurysm was significantly more likely with endovascular compared with open repair (9.0 versus 1.7 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complications-of-endovascular-abdominal-aortic-repair/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. The details of AAA-related reintervention are discussed by etiology below. (See <a href=\"#H1191826906\" class=\"local\">'Endoleak'</a> below and <a href=\"#H958077298\" class=\"local\">'Device migration'</a> below and <a href=\"#H436304863\" class=\"local\">'Separation of components'</a> below and <a href=\"#H436304870\" class=\"local\">'Limb kinking and occlusion'</a> below and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=endoleak-following-endovascular-aortic-repair#H3722227337\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Endoleak following endovascular aortic repair&quot;, section on 'Etiology and classification'</a>.)</p><p>Some reported endograft complications are device-specific and have led to device modifications by manufacturers and, in some cases, to public health notifications in the United States and the United Kingdom and withdrawal of several devices from the market [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complications-of-endovascular-abdominal-aortic-repair/abstract/13,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,14</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=endovascular-devices-for-abdominal-aortic-repair#H861292399\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Endovascular devices for abdominal aortic repair&quot;, section on 'Withdrawn/investigational devices'</a>.)</p><p>The importance of strict adherence to anatomic suitability in preventing complications during endovascular repair of abdominal aortic aneurysm (EVAR) was evaluated in a series of 10,228 patients treated with a variety of endografts who underwent pre-EVAR and at least one post-EVAR computed tomography scan [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complications-of-endovascular-abdominal-aortic-repair/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. This multicenter observational study found a low compliance with manufacturer&rsquo;s instructions for device use and a high rate of post-EVAR aneurysm sac enlargement, raising concern for an increased long-term risk of aneurysm rupture when adherence to device-specific criteria is not strict. The manufacturer&rsquo;s most conservative indications for anatomic suitability were met in 42 percent of patients, but 31 percent did not meet the manufacturer&rsquo;s most liberal criteria. The rate of aortic sac enlargement was 41 percent at five-year follow-up. Independent predictors of AAA sac enlargement included endoleak, age &ge;80 years, aortic neck diameter &ge;28 mm, aortic neck angle &gt;60&deg;, and common iliac artery diameter &gt;20 mm. </p><p>The ability of anatomic criteria to predict future EVAR complications was evaluated in a study using the ENGAGE (Endurant Stent Graft Natural Selection Global Postmarket) registry [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complications-of-endovascular-abdominal-aortic-repair/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. Preoperative aneurysm morphology obtained from the database was used to calculate the St George&rsquo;s Vascular Institute (SGVI) score. Freedom from reintervention and freedom from a composite outcome measure of reintervention or endograft complications were significantly lower for patients with a low-risk SGVI score versus a high-risk SVGI score (91 versus 79 percent and 75 versus 66 percent, respectively). </p><p>Immediate problems during endograft placement are common and are often not predictable. In most cases, these issues are corrected at the initial procedure and initial technical success rates are high, typically approximately 99 percent. In a survey that included data from 1696 procedures from 11 centers, between 2.7 and 69 percent of cases were reported to have immediate technical issues [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complications-of-endovascular-abdominal-aortic-repair/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. Problems related to insertion of the delivery system were the most common, occurring in 7.7 percent of patients. Arterial rupture (eg, aorta, iliac artery) occurred in 0.7 percent and arterial dissection in 0.9 percent. Problems related to endograft deployment occurred in approximately 0.4 percent of patients, and retrieval was a problem in another 0.4 percent. Visceral vessels were unintentionally covered in 0.8 percent, and the hypogastric artery required exclusion in 2.7 percent, in spite of efforts to preserve it. Atheroembolism occurred in 0.5 percent. Lower limb ischemia was due to graft limb kinks in 0.7 percent and to graft limb occlusion in 0.9 percent. </p><p>Following endovascular aortic aneurysm repair, the aneurysm sac typically thromboses, and approximately 50 percent of aneurysm sacs have decreased in diameter at one-year follow-up. However, the endograft remains a dynamic entity and may respond to the new mechanical stresses and the changing configuration of the aorta. Late endograft complications develop and require reintervention in up to 30 percent of cases. As examples, changes in the aneurysm sac may lead to endograft angulation, kinking, migration, or thrombosis (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F68430\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef68430 \">image 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F81240%7ECARD%2F61381\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef81240 graphicRef61381 \">image 2A-B</a>). EVAR in patients with large-diameter necks also appears to be associated with neck-related adverse events in midterm follow-up [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complications-of-endovascular-abdominal-aortic-repair/abstract/18,19\" class=\"abstract_t\">18,19</a>]. As an example, in a series of 118 patients who underwent EVAR for AAA with large (&ge;28 mm) infrarenal neck, there was significant infrarenal aortic neck enlargement at 24 months as well as proximal type I endoleak and proximal neck-related reintervention [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complications-of-endovascular-abdominal-aortic-repair/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H958077298\" class=\"local\">'Device migration'</a> below.)</p><p>Changes in endograft configuration can be easily evaluated with abdominal plain films. The identification of any abnormalities should prompt follow-up evaluation with computed tomography [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complications-of-endovascular-abdominal-aortic-repair/abstract/20-22\" class=\"abstract_t\">20-22</a>]. The importance of ongoing surveillance following endograft placement to detect and correct endograft problems cannot be overstressed. Endograft surveillance is discussed in detail elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=endovascular-repair-of-abdominal-aortic-aneurysm#H2369876318\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Endovascular repair of abdominal aortic aneurysm&quot;, section on 'Endograft surveillance'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H958076382\"><span class=\"h2\">Access site complications</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Access site complications are among the most common problems after endovascular aortic repair, occurring in 9 to 16 percent of patients following endovascular AAA repair [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complications-of-endovascular-abdominal-aortic-repair/abstract/17,23\" class=\"abstract_t\">17,23</a>]. Access site complications including hematoma, acute thrombosis of the accessed vessel, distal embolization, dissection, pseudoaneurysm, and arteriovenous fistula have all been reported. The management of arteriovenous fistula and acute limb ischemia due to thrombosis, dissection, or embolization are discussed elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acquired-arteriovenous-fistula-of-the-lower-extremity\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Acquired arteriovenous fistula of the lower extremity&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H958076389\"><span class=\"h3\">Percutaneous access</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Percutaneous access for abdominal aortic endografting eliminates the groin incision that is used to access the femoral vessels. Early attempts at percutaneous access for endovascular abdominal aortic repair using various techniques were disappointing, but improvement of percutaneous device delivery systems appears to have led to reduced complication rates [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complications-of-endovascular-abdominal-aortic-repair/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. A systematic review identified one randomized trial and seven studies that compared complications associated with percutaneous access with open access. Access-related complications occurred in 4.4 percent of patients, a rate that was significantly lower compared with open femoral access (relative risk [RR] 0.47, 95% CI 0.28-0.78). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=endovascular-repair-of-abdominal-aortic-aneurysm#H841452056\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Endovascular repair of abdominal aortic aneurysm&quot;, section on 'Vascular access'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1191826906\"><span class=\"h2\">Endoleak</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Endoleak is defined as persistent flow of blood into the aneurysm sac after device placement and indicates a failure to completely exclude the aneurysm [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complications-of-endovascular-abdominal-aortic-repair/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. The types of endoleak (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F64707\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef64707 \">figure 3</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F109609\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef109609 \">table 1</a>) are discussed in detail separately [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complications-of-endovascular-abdominal-aortic-repair/abstract/26,27\" class=\"abstract_t\">26,27</a>]. Following completed endovascular repair, the diagnosis of endoleak is made either with completion arteriography or on follow-up imaging, usually computed tomography (CT), that demonstrates blood outside the bounds of the endograft. For some types of endoleak, the source can be difficult to determine. Color flow duplex or selective arteriography may be needed to establish the diagnosis. Endoleak is associated with a continued risk for aneurysm expansion or rupture. The most common types of endoleak (I and II) are usually managed successfully with the placement of additional stents or embolization techniques, but sometimes open surgery is needed. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=endoleak-following-endovascular-aortic-repair\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Endoleak following endovascular aortic repair&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H958077298\"><span class=\"h2\">Device migration</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Device migration is one of the major causes of secondary intervention after endovascular aneurysm repair [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complications-of-endovascular-abdominal-aortic-repair/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. Device migration is due to proximal aortic neck dilation, which may be related to continued aneurysmal degeneration of the aortic wall or possibly a consequence of excessive oversizing of the main body graft diameter. There are no data to suggest that aortic dilation is device dependent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complications-of-endovascular-abdominal-aortic-repair/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. If untreated, potential complications include endoleak, aneurysm expansion, and rupture. </p><p>A case series illustrates typical findings. The incidence of migration was evaluated for two different endografts (AneuRx and Zenith) in 130 patients treated for AAA [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complications-of-endovascular-abdominal-aortic-repair/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. Migration was defined as caudal movement of the endograft &ge;10 mm or any migration distance associated with a related clinical event. </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>With AneuRx, device migration was identified in 14 of 130 patients. Freedom from device migration was 96, 90, 78, and 72 percent at one, two, three, and four years, respectively. The initial neck length was shorter in patients with migration compared with patients who did not demonstrate migration (22 versus 31 mm). Aortic neck dilation (&ge;3 mm) occurred in 22 percent of patients. Twelve of the 14 patients underwent 14 secondary procedures (13 endovascular, 1 open conversion).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>With Zenith, freedom from device migration (&ge;10 mm or a clinical event) was 100, 98, 98, and 98 percent at one, two, three, and four years, respectively. The single patient with stent migration did not require treatment.</p><p/><p>The authors concluded that careful surveillance for stent migration is an essential component of follow-up in patients receiving stent-grafts. Data regarding stent-graft migration for other devices approved in the United States (eg, Medtronic Talent, Gore Excluder, Cook Zenith, Endologix) can be found on the respective company websites.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H436304863\"><span class=\"h2\">Separation of components</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Endograft component separation is a consequence of modular endograft design and was more prevalent with earlier-generation endografts. Component separation can be due to inadequate overlap of the components during placement or may be a problem of device integrity. Component separation can also be related to shrinking of the aneurysm sac over time, producing new forces that can pull the iliac limbs apart. Component separation can result in type III endoleak and is important to identify on routine post-EVAR surveillance imaging. Component separation is repaired by using a bridging stent-graft or performing an aorto-uni-iliac conversion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complications-of-endovascular-abdominal-aortic-repair/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>].

Using these criteria, 217 of 1000 patients undergoing endovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR) and 483 of 2831 patients undergoing open surgical repair were deemed high risk. The EVAR patients were approximately two years older, and renal insufficiency and diabetes mellitus were more common compared with the open surgical patients.

Postprocedure acute kidney injury developed in 6.7 percent of patients overall. Compared with open surgical repair, endovascular repair was associated with lower risk of acute kidney injury (odds ratio [OR] 0.42, 95% CI 0.33-0.53) and lower risk of acute kidney injury requiring dialysis (OR 0.30, 95% CI 0.15-0.63).</p><p>Inadvertent coverage of the origin of the renal arteries is most likely to occur with endograft placement in the setting of a short aortic neck. If the kidney is not visualized on completion arteriography, renal salvage can be attempted by repositioning the graft inferiorly. Stenting the occluded renal artery may be possible from a femoral or a brachial approach if the graft cannot be repositioned, but surgical bypass may be needed if renal function deteriorates. The mid-to-distal renal artery often remains patent.</p><p>Proximal endograft migration or unrecognized partial renal artery coverage may lead to delayed deterioration in renal function. Although rare, renal artery occlusion has been reported in the first week following endovascular aneurysm repair in spite of a completion aortogram demonstrating patent bilateral renal arteries [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complications-of-endovascular-abdominal-aortic-repair/abstract/64\" class=\"abstract_t\">64</a>].

Transrenal bare stents may limit endograft migration, particularly in patients with short or flared proximal aortic necks, but a disadvantage may be worsening renal function, particularly in patients with preexisting renal insufficiency. In a study that reviewed 705 patients who underwent endovascular repair of abdominal aortic aneurysm, patients with infrarenal fixation devices were compared with transrenal fixation devices [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complications-of-endovascular-abdominal-aortic-repair/abstract/66\" class=\"abstract_t\">66</a>]. Although mean serum creatinine and creatinine clearance did not change in the immediate postoperative period, with longer follow-up, a mild decrease in renal function developed for either type of fixation. There were no significant differences in serum creatinine, creatinine clearance decrease, or incidence of small renal infarcts between the groups. The risk for worsening renal insufficiency and need for dialysis was only slightly but not significantly greater in patients with baseline renal dysfunction compared with patients with normal renal function. Other studies have reported transient renal dysfunction with EVAR using devices with suprarenal fixation, with stabilization or improvement within one to two years postrepair [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complications-of-endovascular-abdominal-aortic-repair/abstract/65,67\" class=\"abstract_t\">65,67</a>].

Suparenal fixation had a higher risk of renal complications (1.1 versus 0.1 percent) and prolonged length of stay.

Most limb occlusions occur within six months after endovascular repair. In one multivariate analysis using ENGAGE registry data, the following factors were associated with graft limb occlusion: placement of the distal end of the device in the external iliac artery, diameter of the external iliac artery &lt;10 mm, maximum diameter of aneurysm &lt;59 mm, correction of endoleak, and presence of stent-graft kinking [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complications-of-endovascular-abdominal-aortic-repair/abstract/71\" class=\"abstract_t\">71</a>].

Due to the presence of chronic component, endograft limb occlusion cannot usually be managed successfully using interventions commonly used in native vessels or with open aortofemoral grafts, such as mechanical thrombectomy or thrombolysis. Endograft occlusions usually require a cross-over femoral bypass. In this study, limb occlusions were managed with femorofemoral bypass in 47 percent, thrombectomy and stent placement in 27 percent, and expectant management in 20 percent (all with intermittent claudication), and one patient required endograft explantation because of persistent endoleak. </p><p>For patients with lower extremity ischemia due to embolization or common femoral artery injury, the presentation is typically acute.

Portions of the graft that are adherent to surrounding structures are best left in place. A poorly adherent graft may be infected.</p><p>The perioperative morbidity and mortality associated with elective conversion of endovascular to open AAA repair appears to be increased in both the emergency and elective setting, particularly if the patient was originally deemed high risk for open surgery. In retrospective reviews, the mortality rate for open conversion is 10 to 13 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complications-of-endovascular-abdominal-aortic-repair/abstract/42,97,98\" class=\"abstract_t\">42,97,98</a>]. In a review of the National Surgical Quality Improvement Program, 300 patients underwent open conversion, which was associated with a significantly higher 30-day mortality compared with standard open repair (10.0 versus 4.2 percent; odds ratio [OR] 2.4, 95% CI 1.6-3.6) and EVAR (10.0 versus 1.7 percent; OR 7.2, 95% CI 4.8-10.9). Conversion surgery also increased risk for any complication compared with open surgery (OR 1.5, 95% CI 1.2-1.9) or EVAR (OR 7.8, 95% CI 6.1-9.9) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complications-of-endovascular-abdominal-aortic-repair/abstract/98\" class=\"abstract_t\">98</a>].

The technical success rate for abdominal aortic endografting is high, and, compared with open surgical repair, the overall incidence of severe perioperative complications is lower. However, the endograft remains a dynamic entity, and late complications are more likely with endovascular repair. Complications associated with endovascular abdominal aortic repair are most commonly related to some technical aspect of the endograft placement. (See <a href=\"#H1191825497\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above and <a href=\"#H1191828436\" class=\"local\">'Endovascular aortic repair'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Endograft-related complications are common, occurring in 16 to 30 percent of patients following endovascular repair of AAA. Technical complications associated with endografts include vascular injury during access or device deployment; endoleak from inadequate fixation, poor sealing of the graft to the vessel wall, or breakdown of the graft material; stent fractures; component separations; and endograft kinking or collapse. These problems occur with varying frequency and timing relative to endograft placement. Their occurrence depends upon many factors, including anatomic suitability for endograft placement and proper measurements for the chosen device. (See <a href=\"#H958070867\" class=\"local\">'Endograft complications'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Endoleak is a term that describes the presence of persistent flow of blood into the aneurysm sac after endograft placement. Endoleaks are associated with a continued risk for aneurysm expansion or rupture. Five types of endoleaks (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F64707\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef64707 \">figure 3</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F109609\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef109609 \">table 1</a>) are described. The diagnosis and management of endoleak is reviewed separately. (See <a href=\"#H1191826906\" class=\"local\">'Endoleak'</a> above and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=endoleak-following-endovascular-aortic-repair\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Endoleak following endovascular aortic repair&quot;</a>.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Endograft infection is an uncommon complication of abdominal aortic aneurysm repair and has been reported with an incidence that ranges from 0.4 to 3 percent following endovascular repair. As with infected aneurysm or graft infection associated with open surgical repair of abdominal aortic aneurysm, the mortality rate is high at approximately 25 percent. (See <a href=\"#H958077232\" class=\"local\">'Endograft infection'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The incidence of systemic complications (cardiopulmonary, ischemia-related, renal) following endovascular aneurysm repair ranges from 3 to 12 percent, which is lower than open surgical repair of AAA. (See <a href=\"#H958076529\" class=\"local\">'Systemic complications'</a> above and <a href=\"#H958076543\" class=\"local\">'Intravenous contrast complications'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Other complications related to endovascular repair of abdominal aortic aneurysm include abdominal compartment syndrome and postimplantation syndrome. Abdominal compartment syndrome is more likely following endovascular repair of ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm but can theoretically occur following elective aneurysm repair. Postimplantation syndrome was a transient condition of unknown etiology associated with earlier endografts. (See <a href=\"#H958077032\" class=\"local\">'Other'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Despite advances in endovascular salvage techniques for endograft complications, some circumstances require conversion to open repair. The overall incidence of conversion (early or late) is approximately 2 percent. Elective open surgical conversion following failed endovascular repair may be associated with increased morbidity and mortality, particularly if the patient was deemed at high risk for open surgery, but some studies have reported mortality rates comparable to open abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) repair. (See <a href=\"#H1191825949\" class=\"local\">'Conversion to open repair'</a> above.)</p></div><div id=\"topicAgreement\">Use of UpToDate is subject to the <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/legal/license\" class=\"licenseLink\" id=\"sla_in_page\">Subscription and License Agreement</a>.</div><div id=\"references\" class=\"headingAnchor\"><h1>REFERENCES</h1><ol id=\"reference\"><li><a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complications-of-endovascular-abdominal-aortic-repair/abstract/1\" class=\"nounderline abstract_t\">Gabrielli L, Baudo A, Molinari A, Domanin M.
