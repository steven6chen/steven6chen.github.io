Obesity-related anatomic and physiologic changes make airway management more difficult, and studies have shown a correlation between obesity and difficulty with endotracheal intubation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/emergency-airway-management-in-the-morbidly-obese-patient/abstract/1-4\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-4</a>].</p><p>This topic will review emergency airway management in obese and morbidly obese patients outside of the operating room.

A brief overview and aspects of obesity of particular relevance to airway management are reviewed here.

Obesity is defined as an abnormally high percentage of body weight as fat. Body mass index (BMI) is used to distinguish between the two terms and also determines the degree of excess weight.</p><p>BMI = body weight (in kg) &divide; height (in meters) squared</p><p>Using the BMI, obesity is then classified as follows:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Overweight</strong> &ndash; BMI &ge;25.0 to 29.9 <span class=\"nowrap\">kg/m&sup2;</span>.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Class I obesity</strong> &ndash; BMI of 30.0 to 34.9 <span class=\"nowrap\">kg/m&sup2;</span>.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Class II obesity (formerly known as morbid obesity)</strong> &ndash; BMI of 35.0 to 39.9 <span class=\"nowrap\">kg/m&sup2;</span>.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Class III obesity (formerly known as severe obesity)</strong> &ndash; BMI &ge;40 <span class=\"nowrap\">kg/m&sup2;</span>.

Aspects of obesity of particular relevance to emergency airway management are reviewed briefly here. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=genetic-contribution-and-pathophysiology-of-obesity#H2993585007\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Genetic contribution and pathophysiology of obesity&quot;, section on 'Physiology and pathophysiology of obesity'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=anesthesia-for-the-obese-patient#H1556761\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Anesthesia for the obese patient&quot;, section on 'Physiologic changes'</a>.)</p><p>Several physiologic and anatomic changes occur in obese patients that are important for airway management. Both oxygen consumption and carbon dioxide production are increased. These increases result from metabolic activity in excess adipose tissue and from the increased work required of supportive tissues [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/emergency-airway-management-in-the-morbidly-obese-patient/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. As a consequence, desaturation time and thus, the &quot;safe apnea period&quot; during rapid sequence intubation, are decreased. The attached figure illustrates time to desaturation for obese patients compared with others (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F56716\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef56716 \">figure 1</a>). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=rapid-sequence-intubation-for-adults-outside-the-operating-room\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Rapid sequence intubation for adults outside the operating room&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Morbidly obese patients have increased airway resistance, an abnormally elevated diaphragm, and increased work of breathing secondary to abnormal chest wall elasticity and resistance to caudal excursion of the diaphragm. In addition, the added weight of abdominal fat on inferior portions of the lung can reduce functional residual capacity (FRC). These alterations result in shallow, rapid breathing, reductions in the capacity to pre-oxygenate, and limited ventilatory capacity, all of which are more pronounced when the patient is supine [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/emergency-airway-management-in-the-morbidly-obese-patient/abstract/2,5,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,5,6</a>].</p><p>Obesity alters upper airway anatomy. Increased fat deposition in pharyngeal tissues increases the likelihood of pharyngeal wall collapse, which can complicate the performance of rapid sequence intubation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/emergency-airway-management-in-the-morbidly-obese-patient/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].</p><p>Obesity contributes to the development of many diseases and increases not only the morbidity and mortality from such diseases, but also the incidence of complications from managing them [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/emergency-airway-management-in-the-morbidly-obese-patient/abstract/2,8-10\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,8-10</a>]. Obesity plays a significant role in atherosclerosis, hypertension, diabetes, cardiomyopathy, and arrhythmias, such as bradycardia, second-degree heart block, and ventricular arrhythmias [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/emergency-airway-management-in-the-morbidly-obese-patient/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Obese patients are also at increased risk of aspiration pneumonitis secondary to an excess volume of gastric acid and increased intraabdominal pressure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/emergency-airway-management-in-the-morbidly-obese-patient/abstract/5,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,11</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overweight-and-obesity-in-adults-health-consequences\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overweight and obesity in adults: Health consequences&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The metabolism and pharmacokinetics of commonly used drugs are altered by the physiologic changes of obesity. Lipophilic drugs have a larger volume of distribution (Vd), since the Vd is dependent upon the amount of adipose tissue [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/emergency-airway-management-in-the-morbidly-obese-patient/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. Obese patients are known to have higher glomerular filtration rates, and renally excreted drugs may have shorter half-lives since their elimination is directly proportional to creatinine clearance. Obesity does not generally affect the clearance of drugs that are metabolized by the liver. Because of the complexity of obesity-related pharmacokinetic changes and because detailed data are lacking for many drugs, individual drug dosing for obese patients remains controversial [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/emergency-airway-management-in-the-morbidly-obese-patient/abstract/12,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,13</a>]. Drugs that depress the central nervous system, such as opioids, benzodiazepines, and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=propofol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">propofol</a>, can both depress respiratory drive and increase the tendency for collapse of the pharyngeal wall [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/emergency-airway-management-in-the-morbidly-obese-patient/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h1\">AIRWAY ASSESSMENT</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Obesity and airway difficulty</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The goal of airway assessment is to identify clinical features that predict difficulty in any of the following areas of emergency airway management:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Ventilation with bag-mask or extraglottic device</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Laryngoscopy and endotracheal intubation</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Surgical airway performance</p><p/><p>Obesity may complicate the performance of any of these tasks, and therefore, airway management in obese patients should always be considered potentially difficult [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/emergency-airway-management-in-the-morbidly-obese-patient/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. However, obese patients are also subject to the same risk factors for difficult airway management as nonobese patients, and whenever possible, a careful evaluation for such factors should be conducted before undertaking airway management.</p><p>After assessing the patient, the clinician must decide whether to use an awake approach or to proceed with rapid sequence intubation (RSI). This decision hinges on the number and severity of difficult airway attributes. Airway assessment and the approach to the difficult airway are discussed in detail separately (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=approach-to-the-difficult-airway-in-adults-outside-the-operating-room\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Approach to the difficult airway in adults outside the operating room&quot;</a>). Aspects of particular relevance to obesity are reviewed below.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Bag-mask ventilation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Obesity makes bag-mask ventilation more difficult [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/emergency-airway-management-in-the-morbidly-obese-patient/abstract/1,2,9,10,15,16\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2,9,10,15,16</a>]. Redundant upper airway soft tissue coupled with increased body mass results in increased airway resistance. Higher pressures are required to ventilate effectively, and this can lead to difficulty maintaining a mask seal. Oxygen consumption is increased in obese patients, and target oxygen saturations may be difficult to achieve or maintain. Other predictors of difficult bag-mask ventilation are shown in the table (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F73627\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef73627 \">table 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/emergency-airway-management-in-the-morbidly-obese-patient/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>].

Such patients may have altered upper airway anatomy resulting in a poor view of the glottis despite optimal laryngoscopic technique. In addition, short, thick necks may limit mobility and make it difficult to place the patient in the optimal sniffing position. General indicators of difficult intubation are shown in the table (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F64336\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef64336 \">table 2</a>). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=direct-laryngoscopy-and-endotracheal-intubation-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Direct laryngoscopy and endotracheal intubation in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Studies assessing emergency airway management in obese patients are scarce. Nevertheless, a few studies in the emergency setting and multiple studies performed in the operating room have found an association between obesity and difficult laryngoscopy and endotracheal intubation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/emergency-airway-management-in-the-morbidly-obese-patient/abstract/3,4,18-25\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,4,18-25</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A large retrospective study using the Danish Anesthesia Database found that patients with a BMI above 35 were more likely to be difficult to intubate compared with those with a lower BMI [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/emergency-airway-management-in-the-morbidly-obese-patient/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. When controlling for other risk factors, researchers found the odds ratio for the obese patients to be 1.34 (95% CI 1.19-1.51).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>One observational study compared the incidence of difficult endotracheal intubation in consecutive obese (n = 129) and lean (n = 134) patients undergoing elective surgery using a validated difficulty score (The Intubation Difficulty Scale, or IDS) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/emergency-airway-management-in-the-morbidly-obese-patient/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. The rate of difficult intubation was 15 percent for obese patients versus 2 percent for lean patients. In obese patients, a Mallampati score of III or IV was the only independent risk factor for difficult intubation (odds ratio [OR] 12.51; 95% CI 2.01-77.81) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F75229\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef75229 \">figure 2</a>).

The researchers of the latter study found that large neck circumference and high Mallampati score were the only predictors of difficult intubation in this population.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h2\">Surgical airway</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Excessive soft tissue in the anterior neck limits access to the cricothyroid membrane and makes it difficult to identify the anatomic landmarks needed to perform a cricothyrotomy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/emergency-airway-management-in-the-morbidly-obese-patient/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. Therefore, surgical airways can be extremely difficult in morbidly obese patients.

This approach allows for better patient positioning and mask seal. In a crossover randomized trial of 81 anesthesia patients with an average BMI of 37, the thenar grip technique for two-person BMV was found to be more effective than the standard two-hand technique [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/emergency-airway-management-in-the-morbidly-obese-patient/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>].

An upright position improves respiratory function by allowing the diaphragm to fall downward and reducing the weight on the chest wall. Even in trauma patients requiring cervical spine stabilization, the stretcher can be tilted with the head elevated to improve breathing while preparations are made for intubation.

In the ramped position, blankets or commercially available beds are used to elevate the head and torso such that the external auditory meatus and the sternal notch are horizontally aligned (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F72755\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef72755 \">picture 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ANEST%2F95285\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef95285 \">figure 3</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/emergency-airway-management-in-the-morbidly-obese-patient/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>].</p><p>The sniffing position has traditionally been recommended to optimize glottic visualization during direct laryngoscopy, but the ramped position appears to be more effective in the obese patient [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/emergency-airway-management-in-the-morbidly-obese-patient/abstract/29-34\" class=\"abstract_t\">29-34</a>].

The significance and techniques of preoxygenation are discussed separately.

Thus, it is important to preoxygenate as well as possible. Techniques to optimize preoxygenation include the following:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Administer the highest possible concentration of oxygen via the best available means.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Remember that the traditional non-rebreather (NRB) mask provides about 70 percent oxygen when attached to a standard wall spigot set at a flow rate of 15 <span class=\"nowrap\">L/minute</span>.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>A properly configured bag-valve-mask unit can provide 90 to 100 percent oxygen during active breathing, even without bag assist.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Place the obese patient in an upright position whenever possible.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Use lubricated, bilateral nasal trumpets to assist with oxygenation when needed.</p><p/><p>Oxygen reserves can generally be maximized by administering high-flow oxygen for three to five minutes while the patient breathes their normal tidal volumes. Patients should be allowed to breathe spontaneously without assistance unless adequate oxygen saturation cannot be achieved. Maximal ambient pressure preoxygenation is best achieved by having the patient passively breathe through a bag and mask apparatus as opposed to facemask oxygen.</p><p>When time allows, noninvasive positive pressure ventilation can be used to improve preoxygenation in the morbidly obese [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/emergency-airway-management-in-the-morbidly-obese-patient/abstract/37,38\" class=\"abstract_t\">37,38</a>]. This approach is best suited to patients who do not achieve adequate oxygen saturation with standard techniques and are judged capable of tolerating positive pressure support. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=noninvasive-ventilation-in-acute-respiratory-failure-in-adults#H2\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Noninvasive ventilation in acute respiratory failure in adults&quot;, section on 'Patient selection'</a>.)</p><p>A systematic review concluded that preoxygenation in morbidly obese adults is more effective when performed with the patient in the head-up position rather than a supine position [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/emergency-airway-management-in-the-morbidly-obese-patient/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>]. Among several studies that have investigated the effects of positioning on preoxygenation, one assessed the time necessary for desaturation to occur in 40 obese patients undergoing elective surgery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/emergency-airway-management-in-the-morbidly-obese-patient/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>]. After preoxygenation, induction, and intubation, patients were left apneic until their SpO2 dropped to 90 percent. Preoxygenation in the sitting position increased the mean time needed to desaturate to 90 percent by almost one minute. Other studies have reported similar results [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/emergency-airway-management-in-the-morbidly-obese-patient/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>].</p><p>The angle of head elevation that enables optimal preoxygenation while still permitting a good intubating position remains unclear. One option is to preoxygenate with the patient positioned as close to 90 degrees as possible (ie, sitting upright) and then to intubate in the ramped position once induction and paralysis are complete.

Awake intubation offers superior visualization without the time pressure inherent in the use of neuromuscular blockade, and intubation can be accomplished while the patient continues to maintain respiratory drive and protective airway reflexes.</p><p>An awake approach usually requires sedation and topical anesthesia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/emergency-airway-management-in-the-morbidly-obese-patient/abstract/69\" class=\"abstract_t\">69</a>].

When a flexible endoscopic laryngoscope is used, the procedure continues until the glottis is traversed, the scope is advanced to the carina, and the endotracheal tube is introduced over the endoscope into the trachea. If the vocal cords are adequately visualized during the &quot;awake look,&quot; the operator may opt to proceed with intubation during awake laryngoscopy or to perform RSI. Immediate intubation may be best in dynamic situations where the airway may degenerate quickly (eg, neck trauma, thermal burns, anaphylaxis).</p><p>Awake intubation requires careful use of medications because obese patients, particularly those with obstructive sleep apnea, have an increased risk of upper airway obstruction precipitated by opioids or sedatives, particularly when these are used in combination [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/emergency-airway-management-in-the-morbidly-obese-patient/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. When performing awake intubation in the obese, physicians should use medications with which they are familiar and titrate them to achieve a level of sedation similar to that needed for a painful procedure.
