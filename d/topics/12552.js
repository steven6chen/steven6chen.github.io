While sexual dysfunction can be directly related to the primary diagnosis of cancer, aspects of male sexuality are often impacted to a greater extent by treatment than by disease. While men treated for cancer who complain of sexual dysfunction are often assumed to have a purely physical issue (and predominantly related to erectile dysfunction [ED]), a biopsychosocial model has been proposed, in which male sexual function after cancer is a complex interplay in which physical, interpersonal, and psychological issues all play a role [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-sexual-dysfunction-in-male-cancer-survivors/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. This includes incorporation of one&rsquo;s sexual self-schema, broadly understood as an individual&rsquo;s own characterization of sexuality, which in turn influences their own behavior, affect, and the way they process sexually relevant information [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-sexual-dysfunction-in-male-cancer-survivors/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p>Most of the data on male sexual dysfunction are derived from men with a history of prostate cancer, though research suggests that men with other types of malignancies are also impacted negatively. This topic will discuss sexual dysfunction in male cancer survivors. A separate topic for female cancer survivors and a general overview of male sexual dysfunction are covered separately.

ED is defined as the persistent or recurrent inability to attain <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> maintain penile erection sufficient for sexual activity that persists for at least three months [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-sexual-dysfunction-in-male-cancer-survivors/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. While ED is common, it may be secondary to another issue, such as the lack of desire or orgasmic issue, medications, or depression or issues with a negative body image. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-male-sexual-dysfunction#H2095590\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of male sexual dysfunction&quot;, section on 'Erectile dysfunction'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H605835031\"><span class=\"h2\">Sexual bother</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>When sexual dysfunction is perceived as a problem, causes embarrassment or shame, or reduces one's ability to enjoy life, it is often characterized as sexual bother. While it is associated with the presence of ED, bother can be identified in the absence of ED as well. In one study that included over 180 men who underwent a radical prostatectomy, sexual bother (measured using a validated instrument) increased from baseline at 12 months and was sustained at 24 months in men with and without ED [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-sexual-dysfunction-in-male-cancer-survivors/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. Of concern, only 7 percent of men with ED moved from &quot;bothered&quot; at 12 months to &quot;not bothered&quot; at 24 months. No clinical factors that predicted bother were identified.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11755133\"><span class=\"h2\">Loss of libido</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Loss of libido can be seen in men treated for cancer as a primary consequence of androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) or secondary to ED. Most men are used to living with a robust interest in sex, even though it does decrease with age, and loss of libido causes significant distress. Loss of libido may result in loss of masculine self-image and relationship conflict due to lack of emotional intimacy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-sexual-dysfunction-in-male-cancer-survivors/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].

These include [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-sexual-dysfunction-in-male-cancer-survivors/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Disorders of ejaculation, mostly comprising the inability to ejaculate rather than premature ejaculation</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Reduced penile length</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H95556972\"><span class=\"h1\">PREVALENCE AND RISK FACTORS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Sexual dysfunction is a common concern for men diagnosed with cancer. This was shown in a 2009 Needs Assessment survey done to inform the benefit of a sexual health clinic in a major cancer center in the United States<strong> </strong>[<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-sexual-dysfunction-in-male-cancer-survivors/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. Among male respondents, 49 and 30 percent reported the onset of erectile dysfunction (ED) and <span class=\"nowrap\">orgasmic/ejaculatory</span> concerns, respectively, after their cancer was diagnosed. In addition, only 60 percent reported continued and ongoing sexual activity, which was down from a self-recalled sexual activity rate of 80 percent before cancer.</p><p>Overall, the prevalence of sexual dysfunction varies according to the type of cancer a man has. Sexual problems are most commonly reported amongst men in the genitourinary cancers, but also affect a large proportion of men with gastrointestinal and other cancers.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H190294043\"><span class=\"h2\">Prostate cancer</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>For men with prostate cancer, a reduction in sexual activity, function, and satisfaction has been noted before treatment, with 15 percent of men reporting no sexual activity in the prior month [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-sexual-dysfunction-in-male-cancer-survivors/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. Thirty-seven percent reported ED, and 48 percent reported decreased sexual desire more than 50 percent of the time. However, sexual dysfunction in survivors of prostate cancer also arises from the treatment modalities that exist for the disease, specifically prostatectomy, radiation therapy (RT), and androgen deprivation therapy (ADT).</p><p>ED is common after radical prostatectomy, with estimates ranging from 27 to 77 percent after radical prostatectomy. Radical prostatectomy, no matter what the surgical approach (open, laparoscopic, or robotic-assisted), places traction on the cavernosal nerves, which may induce neurological damage. In addition, electrocautery in the vicinity of these nerves during the surgery can also cause damage [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-sexual-dysfunction-in-male-cancer-survivors/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. While bilateral nerve-sparing surgery may reduce the incidence of ED, there is wide variation in the prevalence of ED reported after this type of surgery, and it is still not a rare outcome [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-sexual-dysfunction-in-male-cancer-survivors/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. There can be improvement over time, although recovery can be delayed and can continue even beyond two years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-sexual-dysfunction-in-male-cancer-survivors/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=radical-prostatectomy-for-localized-prostate-cancer#H24077796\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Radical prostatectomy for localized prostate cancer&quot;, section on 'Impotence'</a>.)</p><p>Other sexual side effects reported after prostatectomy include subjective loss of penile length (47 percent), penile curvature (10 percent), and sensory changes (25 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-sexual-dysfunction-in-male-cancer-survivors/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. Men also report altered experience of orgasm with lack of pleasurable orgasm (anorgasmia) reported in 5 percent, decreased intensity of orgasm in 60 percent, and delayed orgasm in 57 percent.</p><p>Radiation to the pelvis has similar effects on erections, although they are slower in onset. RT for prostate cancer is theorized to cause ED through damage to the neurovascular bundles, interior and accessory pudendal arteries, the corpora cavernosa, and the penile bulb [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-sexual-dysfunction-in-male-cancer-survivors/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. In series of RT for prostate cancer, 30 to 45 percent of men who are potent prior to RT become impotent after therapy, with the frequency increasing over time. The onset of ED may be delayed up to two years after treatment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-sexual-dysfunction-in-male-cancer-survivors/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=external-beam-radiation-therapy-for-localized-prostate-cancer#H23\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;External beam radiation therapy for localized prostate cancer&quot;, section on 'Sexual dysfunction'</a>.)</p><p>Finally, ADT is a treatment for men with advanced or recurrent prostate cancer that can affect sexual function. Unfortunately, sexual dysfunction is a direct consequence of ADT and men report significant issues related to both libido and erections [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-sexual-dysfunction-in-male-cancer-survivors/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H190294062\"><span class=\"h2\">Testicular cancer</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Testicular cancer affects a predominantly young population and is the most common cancer in men between the ages of 20 and 34 years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-sexual-dysfunction-in-male-cancer-survivors/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. While the cancer itself is not associated with sexual dysfunction, treatment is associated with sexual dysfunction in about one-third of patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-sexual-dysfunction-in-male-cancer-survivors/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. As an example, in a prospective study that included over 160 men treated for early-stage seminoma with orchiectomy and RT [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-sexual-dysfunction-in-male-cancer-survivors/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Over 60 percent reported changes in their body image following orchiectomy</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Over 20 percent complained of reductions in sexual interest, activity, and pleasure six months following treatment</p><p/><p>Gonadal effects of treatment include reduced spermatogenesis and impaired fertility, and hormonal changes that may be due to surgery (especially retroperitoneal surgery), RT, or chemotherapy. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-related-toxicity-in-men-with-testicular-germ-cell-tumors#H12\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment-related toxicity in men with testicular germ cell tumors&quot;, section on 'Gonadal effects'</a>.)</p><p>Serial evaluation of hormone levels should be performed as part of the long-term follow-up of testicular cancer survivors.

In one study, for example, the prevalence of overall sexual dysfunction reported by survivors was not much different than a normative sample (39 versus 36 percent, respectively), although specific scores related to ejaculation were lower [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-sexual-dysfunction-in-male-cancer-survivors/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>].</p><p>While rare, bilateral testicular cancer is seen with an incidence reported to be &lt;2 percent, although only 0.56 percent present as synchronous tumors. For these men, bilateral orchiectomy may be necessary, and as a result, they require long-term testosterone supplementation. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=testosterone-treatment-of-male-hypogonadism\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Testosterone treatment of male hypogonadism&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H190294079\"><span class=\"h2\">Penile cancer</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There are limited data on the sexual outcomes of this rare cancer; however, for men with low-risk tumors, organ-sparing treatments (eg, laser therapy, brachytherapy) appear to have few sexual side effects [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-sexual-dysfunction-in-male-cancer-survivors/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. On the other hand, men who have partial penectomy experience problems with orgasm and body image [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-sexual-dysfunction-in-male-cancer-survivors/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. Men may also lose confidence in their masculinity, although some are able to resume an active sex life after treatment; this is in part dependent on age, relationship status, and treatment modality [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-sexual-dysfunction-in-male-cancer-survivors/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>].

Orgasmic dysfunction is also a common problem after such procedures.

These include decreased libido, ED, and ejaculatory disorders, including retrograde ejaculations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-sexual-dysfunction-in-male-cancer-survivors/abstract/24-27\" class=\"abstract_t\">24-27</a>].</p><p>Men with colorectal cancer who undergo surgical resection of disease experience similar effects to radical prostatectomy due to proximity of the bowel to the prostate. Damage to the periprostatic plexus results in partial or complete ED, and damage to the sympathetic fibers can result in ejaculatory disorders [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-sexual-dysfunction-in-male-cancer-survivors/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>].

Risk factors for sexual dysfunction include: preoperative treatment in the form of RT, lower tumor location, older age, presence of a stoma, and complications during and after surgery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-sexual-dysfunction-in-male-cancer-survivors/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>].</p><p>In general, sexual dysfunction is more common in patients treated for rectal than colon cancer [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-sexual-dysfunction-in-male-cancer-survivors/abstract/31,32\" class=\"abstract_t\">31,32</a>]. In addition, certain types of treatment for these cancers, such as RT or an abdominoperineal resection approach, are major risk factors.

Overall, 32 percent of those who were sexually active before treatment were not at three months and out to two years following surgery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-sexual-dysfunction-in-male-cancer-survivors/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. Men who were sexually active prior to cancer surgery also reported general sexual function deterioration postoperatively that did not improve over time. Among the main risk factors for sexual dysfunction were pelvic RT and the presence of a stoma.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Others also report higher rates of sexual dysfunction after abdominoperineal resection (APR) than after sphincter-sparing surgery (SSS).

At one year, compared with patients who underwent an SSS, those who underwent APR reported significantly worse body image and, for men, significantly worse sexual enjoyment.</p><p/><p>The majority of male anal cancer survivors who are treated with combined-modality radiation and chemotherapy report inability to achieve or sustain an erection, difficulty with climaxing, lack of interest in sex, and less energy.

While, in practice, screening may be more commonly performed for men with tumors involving the pelvis, it should be offered to all men with cancer, given the prevalence of sexual dysfunction across all cancer types. Many of the common side effects of cancer, including fatigue, pain, and altered body image, may affect sexual functioning, especially libido. Additionally, screening should be ongoing following treatment, both in the tertiary and primary care settings, as sexual dysfunction may be a late effect of cancer treatment.</p><p>Assessing these aspects may identify sexual problems, especially if the man does not volunteer information about sexual issues.

In this study, 58 men who did not respond to oral <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sildenafil-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">sildenafil</a> were instructed to use ICI (three times a week).

Despite data that it may be as effective as oral treatment, discomfort with insertion of the agent appears to limit its acceptability. This was shown in a trial that included 139 men with ED one month after radical prostatectomy who were randomly assigned to treatment with IU alprostadil or oral <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sildenafil-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">sildenafil</a> for nine months followed by on-demand treatment using sildenafil for one month.

However, these conditions can result in the avoidance of sexual activity altogether. Sexual counseling or therapy and psychosexual education may be helpful to correct misunderstanding.

This may be achieved with the use of a vibrator at the base of the penis or on the scrotum. Pelvic floor physiotherapy may also be useful because laxity in these muscles can be associated with weaker or absent sensations of orgasm. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-male-sexual-dysfunction#H2096118\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of male sexual dysfunction&quot;, section on 'Delayed ejaculation, anejaculation, and male anorgasmia'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Low libido &ndash;</strong> Reactive loss of libido is seen in men with ED after treatment; this is psychological and may improve with sexuality counseling and encouragement to explore non-penetrative activities. For men on androgen deprivation therapy (ADT), intermittent therapy may be helpful in the return of libido; however, this may not be possible due to disease factors. Men with low libido should be evaluated for hypogonadism, in which case they may be candidates for testosterone therapy. However, if considered, a discussion must take place between the sexual health specialist and the oncologist to ensure that the benefits and risks of treatment are consistently documented.

In addition to individual counseling, for patients with a partner, involving both parties is important. Although limited, data suggest that patients who hold back discussion of sexual concerns with their partner also are more likely not to discuss cancer-specific concerns, including fear of recurrence [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-sexual-dysfunction-in-male-cancer-survivors/abstract/56\" class=\"abstract_t\">56</a>]. Therefore, involvement of both individuals may not only improve the man&rsquo;s sexual health, but may also improve intimacy and overall couple satisfaction, although much more work in this area is needed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-sexual-dysfunction-in-male-cancer-survivors/abstract/57\" class=\"abstract_t\">57</a>]. Referral to a counselor or therapist who is knowledgeable about cancer and its treatment as part of a comprehensive team approach is encouraged.</p><p>Loss of confidence, performance anxiety, and loss of masculine self-image are common in men treated for cancer who experience sexual side effects of treatment. Penile shrinkage after radical prostatectomy and climacturia may further exacerbate psychological distress. In addition, men treated with ADT may also experience body image issues due to loss of upper body muscle mass, central adiposity, and loss of body hair. This can lead to decreased quality of life [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-sexual-dysfunction-in-male-cancer-survivors/abstract/58\" class=\"abstract_t\">58</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H95558030\"><span class=\"h2\">Caution with testosterone replacement therapy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In men without cancer, testosterone replacement is sometimes used for sexual dysfunction in the setting of sufficiently low testosterone levels. However, there are only limited data on the safety of testosterone in men treated for cancer, especially those men diagnosed with prostate cancer. We agree with the findings of the 2009 International Consultation on Sexual Dysfunctions and do not recommend testosterone supplementation in men with active prostate cancer [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-sexual-dysfunction-in-male-cancer-survivors/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. For men with other cancers, consideration of supplemental testosterone should be individualized, taking into account the general health of the patient and the potential side effects of testosterone treatment.
