Vegetations can be associated with valvular dysfunction, most commonly regurgitation. (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Verrucous endocarditis (Libman-Sacks endocarditis)'</a> below.)</p><p>Systolic murmurs have been noted in 16 to 44 percent of patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/non-coronary-cardiac-manifestations-of-systemic-lupus-erythematosus-in-adults/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].

They often reflect aortic regurgitation, which occasionally requires valve replacement.</p><p>Mitral valve involvement is most common. A mild to moderate regurgitant murmur may be heard, but most patients remain asymptomatic [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/non-coronary-cardiac-manifestations-of-systemic-lupus-erythematosus-in-adults/abstract/10,14,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,14,15</a>]. Mitral valve prolapse appears to occur with increased frequency in lupus, occurring in 21 percent of cases versus 5.5 percent of controls in one study [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/non-coronary-cardiac-manifestations-of-systemic-lupus-erythematosus-in-adults/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=definition-and-diagnosis-of-mitral-valve-prolapse\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Definition and diagnosis of mitral valve prolapse&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Transesophageal echocardiography, which is more sensitive than transthoracic echocardiography for the assessment of left-sided valve disease, was used to determine the frequency, clinical course, and complications of valvular disease in 69 patients with SLE, most of whom underwent a second study at a mean of 29 months later [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/non-coronary-cardiac-manifestations-of-systemic-lupus-erythematosus-in-adults/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. The following findings were noted:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Thickening of the valve leaflets was the most common abnormality, occurring in 51 and 52 percent of patients at the two study times, and it was noted to affect primarily the left-sided valves.

After a mean follow-up of almost five years, the combined incidence of stroke, peripheral embolism, heart failure, infective endocarditis, and death was 22 percent versus 15 percent in the 13 patients without valvular disease. The incidence of stroke in patients with valvular disease was 13 percent.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Verrucous endocarditis (Libman-Sacks endocarditis)</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Historically, Libman-Sacks endocarditis designates verrucous sterile valvular lesions. In one report of 342 patients, 38 (11 percent) had verrucous lesions detected by transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/non-coronary-cardiac-manifestations-of-systemic-lupus-erythematosus-in-adults/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. Similar point prevalence rates (6 to 10 percent) have been noted in other studies using TTE [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/non-coronary-cardiac-manifestations-of-systemic-lupus-erythematosus-in-adults/abstract/10,14,17,18\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,14,17,18</a>]. As noted above, however, a higher prevalence (43 percent) has been noted when more sensitive transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) is performed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/non-coronary-cardiac-manifestations-of-systemic-lupus-erythematosus-in-adults/abstract/11,17\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,17</a>]. Valve thickening is also detected more frequently by TEE (70 percent) than by TTE (52 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/non-coronary-cardiac-manifestations-of-systemic-lupus-erythematosus-in-adults/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nonbacterial-thrombotic-endocarditis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Nonbacterial thrombotic endocarditis&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The verrucae (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RHEUM%2F79709\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef79709 \">picture 1</a>) are usually near the edge of the valve and consist of accumulations of immune complexes, mononuclear cells, hematoxylin bodies, and fibrin and platelet thrombi. The mitral, aortic, and tricuspid valves are more often involved [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/non-coronary-cardiac-manifestations-of-systemic-lupus-erythematosus-in-adults/abstract/1,3\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,3</a>].</p><p>Healing usually leads to fibrosis, scarring, and, in some cases, calcification. If the verrucal lesions are extensive, the healing process can produce deformity of the valve, leading to mitral or aortic regurgitation.</p><p>Verrucous endocarditis is typically asymptomatic. However, the verrucae can fragment and produce systemic emboli, and infective endocarditis can develop on already damaged valves [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/non-coronary-cardiac-manifestations-of-systemic-lupus-erythematosus-in-adults/abstract/11,19\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,19</a>].</p><p>Unlike many other manifestations of SLE that are more frequent and severe during flares of disease activity, valvular lesions in SLE may occur at any time, and their presence does not correlate with disease activity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/non-coronary-cardiac-manifestations-of-systemic-lupus-erythematosus-in-adults/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Antiphospholipid antibodies and valvular disease</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Valvular nodules, regurgitation, and verrucous endocarditis are more prevalent among patients with significantly elevated levels of antiphospholipid antibodies (aPL). Many reports support an association [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/non-coronary-cardiac-manifestations-of-systemic-lupus-erythematosus-in-adults/abstract/14,18,21-24\" class=\"abstract_t\">14,18,21-24</a>]. A meta-analysis of 23 primary studies, including 1656 SLE patients (668 with and 988 without aPL) and 508 cases of heart valvular disease, found a greater than threefold significantly elevated risk of valvular disease and 3.5-fold elevated risk of Libman-Sacks endocarditis among those with aPL, compared with those without aPL. The risk of valvular disease was the highest for lupus anticoagulant (OR 5.9, 95% CI 2.9 -11.8) and IgG anticardiolipin antibodies (OR 5.6, 95% CI 3.5-9.0) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/non-coronary-cardiac-manifestations-of-systemic-lupus-erythematosus-in-adults/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>].</p><p>The following studies are illustrative of those suggesting an association between aPL and valvular heart disease:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In one report, 78 percent with high levels of aPL had at least one cardiac abnormality, including valvular lesions, pericardial effusions, and myocardial dysfunction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/non-coronary-cardiac-manifestations-of-systemic-lupus-erythematosus-in-adults/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In another report, 61 patients with SLE were followed with serial transthoracic echocardiograms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/non-coronary-cardiac-manifestations-of-systemic-lupus-erythematosus-in-adults/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. Initially, 24 patients (39 percent) had valvular abnormalities, primarily mitral, including 19 (31 percent) with regurgitant lesions. After a mean of eight years of observation, 73 percent had valvular abnormalities, including 56 percent with regurgitation. Seven patients developed severe regurgitation, a finding that was strongly associated with high titers of antibodies to cardiolipin.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients with pulmonary hypertension, a less common complication of lupus, are also more likely to have aPL [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/non-coronary-cardiac-manifestations-of-systemic-lupus-erythematosus-in-adults/abstract/18,25\" class=\"abstract_t\">18,25</a>].

A high index of suspicion should be present in SLE, particularly in patients with aPL, and cardiac auscultation should be performed at regular visits, followed by echocardiography in patients with significant or changing murmurs or changing cardiac function.

Although the valvular lesions that are most frequently seen in patients with SLE are not among the structural heart problems that are at highest risk of poor outcomes, it is appropriate to prescribe prophylaxis for bacterial endocarditis for immunosuppressed SLE patients with valvular lesions undergoing procedures that may result in transient bacteremia.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Therapy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Glucocorticoid <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> cytotoxic therapy does not appear to have an effect upon valvular lesions, although there have been no trials [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/non-coronary-cardiac-manifestations-of-systemic-lupus-erythematosus-in-adults/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. In patients without infective endocarditis, antiplatelet or anticoagulation therapy should be considered for those patients with vegetations or significant valvular thickening, and certainly for all patients with thromboembolic events. The suggested approach is similar to that in patients with valvular disease in the antiphospholipid syndrome. Whether anticoagulation should be recommended for patients with aPL-associated vegetations who have never had any thromboembolic event has not been studied.

Pericarditis, as with other types of serositis, most often occurs when SLE is active in other organs as well [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/non-coronary-cardiac-manifestations-of-systemic-lupus-erythematosus-in-adults/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>].</p><p>Symptomatic pericarditis typically presents with pleuritic substernal chest pain with an audible rub on auscultation. There may also be signs of serositis at other sites (such as pleural effusion and ascites). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acute-pericarditis-clinical-presentation-and-diagnostic-evaluation#H3\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Acute pericarditis: Clinical presentation and diagnostic evaluation&quot;, section on 'Clinical features'</a>.)</p><p>Purulent pericarditis may occur, typically in an immunosuppressed, debilitated patient [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/non-coronary-cardiac-manifestations-of-systemic-lupus-erythematosus-in-adults/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. Large effusions, suggestive of tamponade, and constrictive pericarditis are rare in SLE [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/non-coronary-cardiac-manifestations-of-systemic-lupus-erythematosus-in-adults/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>].</p><p>The pericardial fluid may contain antinuclear antibodies (ANA), phagocytic cells containing nuclei (LE cells), low complement levels, and immune complexes similar to those seen in lupus pleural effusions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/non-coronary-cardiac-manifestations-of-systemic-lupus-erythematosus-in-adults/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>]. However, in clinical practice, measuring ANA, measuring complement components, or assaying for immune complexes in pericardial fluid adds little to similar tests on serum samples. The glucose concentration is normal, and the protein concentration is variable, being low with a transudate and elevated with an exudate. The pericardium may reveal foci of inflammatory lesions with immune complexes. There is usually a predominance of mononuclear cells, but scarring may be the primary finding in healed disease.</p><p>Pericardiocentesis may be indicated to exclude potentially life-threatening causes of pericarditis (eg, purulent, tuberculous, or neoplastic pericarditis) or to drain the fluid if there are signs of tamponade.
