Most early postoperative fever is caused by the inflammatory stimulus of surgery and resolves spontaneously [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/postoperative-fever/abstract/3-7\" class=\"abstract_t\">3-7</a>]. However, postoperative fever can be a manifestation of a serious complication.</p><p>A thorough differential diagnosis of postoperative fever includes infectious and noninfectious conditions that occur following surgery. Fever may arise due to a surgical site infection (SSI), or from other hospital-related conditions, including nosocomial pneumonia, urinary tract infection, drug fever, and deep vein thrombosis (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F69959\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef69959 \">table 1</a>). In evaluating a postoperative patient with fever, it is important to consider a broad differential, and not to assume that fever is due to infection.</p><p>Fever as a manifestation of infection may be reduced or absent in immunocompromised patients, including those receiving glucocorticoids, cancer chemotherapy, post-transplant immunosuppression, and also in some patients who are elderly or have chronic renal failure.</p><p>The evaluation of fever in immunocompromised patients is discussed elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fever-and-rash-in-immunocompromised-patients-without-hiv-infection\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Fever and rash in immunocompromised patients without HIV infection&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=approach-to-the-immunocompromised-patient-with-fever-and-pulmonary-infiltrates\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Approach to the immunocompromised patient with fever and pulmonary infiltrates&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-neutropenic-fever-syndromes\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of neutropenic fever syndromes&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diagnostic-approach-to-the-adult-cancer-patient-with-neutropenic-fever\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Diagnostic approach to the adult cancer patient with neutropenic fever&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">PATHOPHYSIOLOGY OF POSTOPERATIVE FEVER</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Fever is a manifestation of cytokine release in response to a variety of stimuli [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/postoperative-fever/abstract/8-10\" class=\"abstract_t\">8-10</a>]. Fever-associated cytokines, including interleukin (IL)-1, IL-6, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha, and interferon (IFN)-gamma, are produced by a variety of tissues and cells (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F80455\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef80455 \">algorithm 1</a>). There is some evidence that IL-6 is the cytokine most closely correlated with postoperative fever [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/postoperative-fever/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pathophysiology-and-treatment-of-fever-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pathophysiology and treatment of fever in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Fever-associated cytokines are released by tissue trauma and do not necessarily signal infection. The magnitude of the trauma is correlated with the degree of the fever response. For example, laparoscopic cholecystectomy is associated with less tissue trauma and fewer episodes of postoperative fever than is open cholecystectomy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/postoperative-fever/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. Similarly, there is less postoperative fever when coronary artery grafting is performed without the use of a cardiopulmonary bypass pump [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/postoperative-fever/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>].</p><p>Genetic factors may influence the magnitude of the cytokine release in response to tissue trauma and thus the magnitude of self-limited postoperative fever. For example, children with osteogenesis imperfecta undergoing orthopedic surgery appear to have a greater and more sustained febrile response than matched controls [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/postoperative-fever/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>].</p><p>Bacterial endotoxins and exotoxins can stimulate cytokine release and cause postoperative fever. Bacteria or fragments of bacteria translocated from the colon (eg, as a consequence of perioperative ileus or hypotension) may be responsible for some episodes of self-limited postoperative fever. Elevated levels of bacterial DNA have been demonstrated with polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing of blood from surgical patients, even in patients whose blood cultures are negative [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/postoperative-fever/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>].</p><p>Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agents (NSAIDs) and glucocorticoids suppress cytokine release and thereby reduce the magnitude of the febrile response [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/postoperative-fever/abstract/16,17\" class=\"abstract_t\">16,17</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">TIMING OF FEVER</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The timing of fever after surgery is one of the most important factors to consider in generating a prioritized differential diagnosis of postoperative fever (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F51666\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef51666 \">figure 1</a>). The timing of postoperative fever can be usefully described as: </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Immediate &ndash; Onset in the operating suite or within hours after surgery</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Acute &ndash; Onset within the first week after surgery</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Subacute &ndash; Onset from one to four weeks following surgery</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Delayed &ndash; Onset more than one month after surgery</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Immediate</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The potential causes of fever in the immediate operative and postoperative period are mainly limited to medications or blood products to which the patient was exposed during perioperative care either in the operating room or in the recovery area, trauma suffered prior to surgery or as part of surgery, infections that were present prior to surgery, and, rarely, malignant hyperthermia.</p><p>Adverse medication reactions that produce immediate fever include immune-mediated reactions, such as reactions to antimicrobials and to transfused blood products. The vasodilation that often accompanies these reactions makes hypotension a common presenting sign; rash may accompany fever in some patients with medication reactions. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=drug-fever\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Drug fever&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The initial clinical signs (ie, hypercarbia) of malignant hyperthermia typically present within 30 minutes following the administration of a triggering agent (eg, inhaled anesthetics, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=succinylcholine-suxamethonium-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">succinylcholine</a>) but have been reported later in the operative course and also following cessation of anesthesia. If the malignant hyperthermia response is not recognized and aborted with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dantrolene-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">dantrolene</a>, high fever may develop as a result of hypermetabolism. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=malignant-hyperthermia-clinical-diagnosis-and-management-of-acute-crisis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Malignant hyperthermia: Clinical diagnosis and management of acute crisis&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Fever due to the trauma of surgery usually resolves within two to three days. The severity and duration of these self-limited postoperative fevers depends on the type of surgery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/postoperative-fever/abstract/18,19\" class=\"abstract_t\">18,19</a>] but tends to be greater in patients with longer and more extensive surgical procedures [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/postoperative-fever/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. Fever caused by severe head trauma can be persistent and may resolve gradually over days or even weeks [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/postoperative-fever/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Acute</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There are many causes of fever in the first week after surgery. Nosocomial infections are common during this period. Occasionally, fever or other symptoms predate surgery and are manifestations of community-acquired infection, such as a viral upper respiratory tract infection.</p><p>While surgical site infection (SSI) and intravascular catheter infections can cause acute postoperative fever, other infections are more frequently identified, including pneumonia and urinary tract infection (UTI).</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients receiving mechanical ventilation during surgery are at risk for ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). The risk of VAP increases with the duration of mechanical ventilation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/postoperative-fever/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. The risk of pneumonia tapers to a stable, lower rate over the first postoperative week and with the discontinuation of mechanical ventilation. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-presentation-and-diagnostic-evaluation-of-ventilator-associated-pneumonia\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical presentation and diagnostic evaluation of ventilator-associated pneumonia&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients with depressed mental status or gag reflex due to anesthesia and analgesia are more susceptible to aspiration if they vomit after surgery. A nasogastric tube also increases gastroesophageal reflux and the risk for aspiration [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/postoperative-fever/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aspiration-pneumonia-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Aspiration pneumonia in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>UTI is a frequent cause of postoperative fever in patients with indwelling urethral catheters. The risk of UTI increases with the duration of catheterization [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/postoperative-fever/abstract/23,24\" class=\"abstract_t\">23,24</a>]. UTI is more common in patients who have undergone a genitourinary procedure and in those who have chronic, indwelling catheters prior to surgery. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=catheter-associated-urinary-tract-infection-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Catheter-associated urinary tract infection in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>SSI most often presents in the subacute period, one week or more after surgery. However, two organisms, group A streptococcus (GAS) and <em>Clostridium perfringens</em>, can cause fulminant SSI within a few hours after surgery. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=necrotizing-soft-tissue-infections\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Necrotizing soft tissue infections&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clostridial-myonecrosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clostridial myonecrosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Catheter exit site infections and bacteremia associated with intravascular catheters also tend to occur subacutely but should be considered as sources of fever in any patient with a catheter in place, especially if insertion was performed under emergent or nonsterile conditions. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epidemiology-pathogenesis-and-microbiology-of-intravascular-catheter-infections\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Epidemiology, pathogenesis, and microbiology of intravascular catheter infections&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p>Acute fever can also be caused by noninfectious conditions. Pancreatitis, myocardial infarction, pulmonary embolism, thrombophlebitis, alcohol withdrawal, and acute gout can complicate the acute postoperative period.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Subacute</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>SSI is a common cause of fever more than one week after surgery; many patients have already been discharged from the hospital by this time [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/postoperative-fever/abstract/25-28\" class=\"abstract_t\">25-28</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=complications-of-abdominal-surgical-incisions\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Complications of abdominal surgical incisions&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Central venous catheters, if used, can be a source of infection and fever. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epidemiology-pathogenesis-and-microbiology-of-intravascular-catheter-infections\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Epidemiology, pathogenesis, and microbiology of intravascular catheter infections&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Fever from antibiotic-associated diarrhea, typically attributed to <em>Clostridium difficile</em>, also occurs more commonly during this period.

Beta-lactam antibiotics and sulfa-containing products are commonly implicated, but other medications, such as H2-blockers, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=procainamide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">procainamide</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=phenytoin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">phenytoin</a>, and heparin, should be considered.</p><p>Thrombophlebitis should be considered as a cause of subacute fever in a patient with impaired mobility. Deep venous thrombosis and pulmonary embolism can cause fever and are more frequent in patients who are debilitated either by chronic medical problems or by the surgery.</p><p>Patients who require critical care after surgery are at higher risk for the development of subacute fever [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/postoperative-fever/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. These patients typically develop a variety of postoperative complications. Nosocomial infections are more common in these patients because of their treatment with invasive medical devices. Device-related infections due to bacteria and fungi include intravascular catheter-related infection with or without bacteremia, VAP, UTI, and sinusitis. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=infections-and-antimicrobial-resistance-in-the-intensive-care-unit-epidemiology-and-prevention\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Infections and antimicrobial resistance in the intensive care unit: Epidemiology and prevention&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Delayed</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Most delayed postoperative fevers are due to infection, although fever due to postpericardiotomy syndrome should be considered in patients following cardiac surgery.</p><p>Viral infections from blood products, including cytomegalovirus (CMV), hepatitis viruses, and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), can arise late in postoperative patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/postoperative-fever/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. Parasitic infections (eg, toxoplasmosis, babesiosis, <em>Plasmodium malariae </em>infection) can also rarely be transmitted via transfusion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/postoperative-fever/abstract/30-33\" class=\"abstract_t\">30-33</a>].</p><p>SSIs due to more indolent microorganisms (eg, coagulase-negative staphylococci) can cause delayed fever, especially in patients with implanted medical devices or grafts.

Nosocomial bacterial and fungal pathogens are usually implicated. The infecting microorganisms generally are found as endogenous flora of the skin or bowel, but the flora change as patients are hospitalized for longer periods and receive antimicrobial therapy.</p><p>When patients are readmitted to the hospital, organisms acquired in the community may also be involved. As an example, <em>Pasteurella multocida </em>SSIs have been caused by pet cats and dogs licking a surgical site [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/postoperative-fever/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>].</p><p>Viral infections in the postoperative patient are usually associated with the transfusion of blood products. However, blood for transfusion is routinely screened for only a discrete number of agents (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F106595\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef106595 \">table 2</a>). Donated blood is screened by immunoassay techniques for a number of viruses (eg, HIV, human T-lymphotropic virus [HTLV], hepatitis C, hepatitis B, cytomegalovirus [CMV], Zika). Other infective agents may be transmitted and cause fever in the postoperative period. As an example, Babesia is screened for only by questioning potential blood donors. Transfusion-related babesiosis was responsible for 4 of the 15 transfusion-related deaths in the United States in 2014 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/postoperative-fever/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>].

Finally, postoperative viral infections such as VAP can occasionally be caused by the reactivation of latent viruses, such as CMV or herpes simplex virus (HSV), especially in immunosuppressed patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/postoperative-fever/abstract/39-41\" class=\"abstract_t\">39-41</a>].</p><p>Other postoperative infections include [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/postoperative-fever/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Sinusitis and, less commonly, otitis media, especially in patients with nasotracheal or nasogastric tubes.

It is probably appropriate to suppress the fever in most patients with one or two days of scheduled <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acetaminophen-paracetamol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">acetaminophen</a> to minimize patient discomfort and the physiologic stress and metabolic demands of fever and shivering [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/postoperative-fever/abstract/118\" class=\"abstract_t\">118</a>]. This approach is unlikely to mask a significant pathologic condition. Additional treatment depends upon the cause of the fever.</p><p>The decision to administer antibiotics to a patient with postoperative fever depends upon careful clinical assessment including an appraisal of the patient's stability. Moreover, it is important to highlight that most cases of postoperative fever are due to noninfectious causes. Patients who have undergone major surgery and are receiving intensive care and patients with hemodynamic instability generally should be treated empirically with broad-spectrum antibiotics after cultures have been obtained. As an example, a patient with a suspected intra-abdominal or pelvic infection should be treated with a regimen effective against aerobic Gram-negative enteric bacilli and anaerobes. Empiric antifungal therapy should not be included unless the patient is at high risk for fungal infection. </p><p>Nosocomial pathogens are often resistant to many antimicrobials; hospital antibiograms can be useful for selecting an appropriate broad-spectrum regimen. If a source of fever is not apparent and blood cultures show no growth after 48 hours, then discontinuation of antimicrobials should be seriously considered.</p><p>If a site of infection is identified <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> cultures are positive, the broad-spectrum regimen should be focused to cover the probable or known causative organism(s). Antimicrobial treatment beyond the empiric period of 48 hours should be reserved for patients in whom an infection has been identified. Gram stain findings and hospital antibiograms can be used to guide empiric antimicrobial selection, but definitive treatment should be based upon antimicrobial susceptibility results from cultured organisms. Carefully selecting antimicrobial treatment can help to avoid adverse medication reactions and can help to minimize the prevalence of resistant organisms in the hospital.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H36\"><span class=\"h1\">SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Postoperative fever (&gt;38&deg;C, 100.4&deg;F) is common in the first few days after surgery and usually resolves spontaneously.

Although atelectasis is often cited as a cause of postoperative fever, the association is probably coincidental and not causal. (See <a href=\"#H21\" class=\"local\">'Atelectasis (not causal)'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Fever occurring in a patient who is otherwise doing well clinically within two days following cardiovascular surgery probably does not need further evaluation. A more delayed fever can be due to a variety of causes. Pneumonia occurs in more than 5 percent of sternotomy patients, and sternal complications in 1 to 5 percent. Mediastinitis is a serious complication and is usually due to <em>Staphylococcus</em> species. The postpericardiotomy fever syndrome may occur weeks after surgery. (See <a href=\"#H24\" class=\"local\">'Cardiothoracic surgery'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Meningitis may be difficult to diagnose following neurosurgery, because neurosurgery can cause meningeal irritation without infection. Cerebrospinal fluid should be obtained for glucose concentration and microbiologic studies (gram stain and bacterial culture) to help determine the need for empiric antimicrobial therapy. (See <a href=\"#H26\" class=\"local\">'Neurosurgery'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Vascular graft infections are more common after revascularization involving the groin or lower extremities. In patients undergoing endovascular aortic aneurysm repair, a postimplantation syndrome with fever but no infection is uncommon but has been described. (See <a href=\"#H27\" class=\"local\">'Vascular surgery'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Fever following abdominal surgery may be due to intra-abdominal abscess, and exploration may be necessary if needle aspiration and imaging studies are inconclusive. Pancreatitis more frequently complicates upper abdominal surgery than other surgeries. (See <a href=\"#H28\" class=\"local\">'Abdominal surgery'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Endometritis is more common following complicated deliveries. Fever soon after pelvic surgery is most often transient but may be due to urinary tract infection, cellulitis, abscess, or pelvic thrombophlebitis. (See <a href=\"#H29\" class=\"local\">'Obstetric and gynecologic surgery'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Fever evaluation in the post-transplant patient is complicated by the increased likelihood of opportunistic infections due to concomitant immunosuppression. (See <a href=\"#H32\" class=\"local\">'Transplantation'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Chest X-ray, urinalysis, and blood cultures are not indicated for most febrile postoperative patients. Evaluation should be tailored to the individual patient based on history, symptoms, and physical findings. (See <a href=\"#H33\" class=\"local\">'Approach to the patient with fever after surgery'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>All unnecessary treatments, including medications, nasogastric tubes, and intravascular and urinary catheters should be discontinued in the febrile patient. Treating the fever with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acetaminophen-paracetamol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">acetaminophen</a> is often appropriate. Antibiotics are not routinely indicated for most patients with fever in the early postoperative period, but hemodynamically unstable patients should be treated empirically with broad-spectrum antibiotics, which should be discontinued after 48 hours if no source of infection has been identified. (See <a href=\"#H35\" class=\"local\">'Treatment'</a> above.)</p></div><div id=\"topicAgreement\">Use of UpToDate is subject to the <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/legal/license\" class=\"licenseLink\" id=\"sla_in_page\">Subscription and License Agreement</a>.</div><div id=\"references\" class=\"headingAnchor\"><h1>REFERENCES</h1><ol id=\"reference\"><li><a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/postoperative-fever/abstract/1\" class=\"nounderline abstract_t\">Garibaldi RA, Brodine S, Matsumiya S, Coleman M.
