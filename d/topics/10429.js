The workgroup recommended that people with diabetes become concerned about the possibility of hypoglycemia at a self-monitored blood glucose (SMBG) level &le;70 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> (3.9 <span class=\"nowrap\">mmol/L)</span>. While that value is higher than the value used to diagnose hypoglycemia in people without diabetes, it approximates the lower limit of the physiologic fasting nondiabetic range, the normal glycemic threshold for glucose counterregulatory hormone secretion, and the highest antecedent low glucose level reported to reduce sympathoadrenal responses to subsequent hypoglycemia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-hypoglycemia-during-treatment-of-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p>This cut-off value has been debated, with some favoring a value of &lt;63 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> (3.5 <span class=\"nowrap\">mmol/L)</span> to avoid overclassification of hypoglycemia in asymptomatic patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-hypoglycemia-during-treatment-of-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/5-8\" class=\"abstract_t\">5-8</a>]. However, when an SMBG value is &le;70 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL,</span> it does not mean that patients should always self-treat.

Although the cause of excess mortality could not be ascribed to recognized hypoglycemia, unrecognized iatrogenic hypoglycemia may have resulted in arrhythmias and been a possible contributor. These trials are discussed in detail elsewhere.

Autonomic symptoms include sweating, tremor, hunger, and anxiety, while neuroglycopenic symptoms include difficulty concentrating, incoordination, weakness, lethargy, blurred vision, and confusion. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=physiologic-response-to-hypoglycemia-in-normal-subjects-and-patients-with-diabetes-mellitus#H3\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Physiologic response to hypoglycemia in normal subjects and patients with diabetes mellitus&quot;, section on 'Response to hypoglycemia in normal subjects'</a>.)</p><p>However, the exact set of symptoms perceived varies between patients and also within the same patient on different occasions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-hypoglycemia-during-treatment-of-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>]. Factors such as alcohol, fatigue, and beta blockers can affect which symptoms occur and how well they are recognized.

Furthermore, this increase in recognition may be associated with long-term improvement in A1C values and a reduction in the number of severe hypoglycemic events. Blood glucose awareness training involves techniques in which patients are asked to guess their blood glucose concentration, record their symptoms, and then verify the blood glucose values with a glucose meter. Patients also can be taken through hypoglycemic thresholds in a controlled hospital setting while recording the symptoms they notice at different times. Using these techniques, the most frequently helpful symptoms were, in rank order, difficulty concentrating, trembling, feeling uncoordinated, pounding heart, slowed thinking, feeling nervous and tense, and sweating [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-hypoglycemia-during-treatment-of-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>].

A study of 21 patients with type 1 diabetes managed with intensive insulin regimens found that a bedtime snack, a snack plus <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acarbose-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">acarbose</a>, or a cornstarch snack were not more effective than no intervention in preventing nocturnal hypoglycemia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-hypoglycemia-during-treatment-of-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>].</p><p>Sensor-augmented CSII using an insulin pump that stops infusing insulin for up to two hours when the sensor detects a predetermined low glucose level (a threshold-suspend feature) has been shown to reduce nocturnal hypoglycemia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-hypoglycemia-during-treatment-of-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/51\" class=\"abstract_t\">51</a>].

In addition, exercise, like hypoglycemia, can shift the glycemic threshold for the sympathoadrenal response to subsequent hypoglycemia to a lower plasma glucose concentration hours later. This shift causes defective glucose counterregulation by reducing epinephrine responses in the setting of absent insulin and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=glucagon-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">glucagon</a> responses. It also causes hypoglycemia unawareness by reducing autonomic symptom responses.

At its best, this concern should prompt diabetic patients to be aware of early symptoms and to ingest carbohydrate before symptoms progress. In some cases, however, fear of hypoglycemia can become a major barrier to lowering blood glucose concentrations substantially. In one survey, patients who had a frightening episode of severe hypoglycemia in the previous year often became so fearful that they kept their blood glucose excessively high for several months afterwards [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-hypoglycemia-during-treatment-of-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/52\" class=\"abstract_t\">52</a>].
