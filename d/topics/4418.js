A concussion can happen as a result of a fall or other type of accident. But it can also happen during participation in sports. Among adolescents who play sports, concussion is one of the most common injuries.</p><p>If your child gets a concussion &ndash; either on or off the field &ndash; it's very important that he or she stop playing sports until the doctor says it's safe to start again. Be aware that kids sometimes lie about their symptoms if they are afraid that they will not be allowed to play if they tell the truth.</p><p>Among boys, the sports most often linked to concussions are American football, ice hockey, and lacrosse. Among girls, the sports most often linked to concussions are soccer, lacrosse, and field hockey.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H24542688\"><span class=\"h1\">What are the symptoms of a concussion?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Symptoms that can happen minutes to hours after a concussion include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Memory loss &ndash; Kids sometimes forget what caused their injury, as well as what happened right before and after the injury.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Confusion</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Headache</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Dizziness or trouble with balance</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Nausea or vomiting</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Feeling sleepy</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Acting cranky, strangely, or out of sorts</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Passing out (but this is not very common)</p><p/><p>Symptoms that can happen hours to days after a concussion include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Trouble walking or talking</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Memory problems or problems paying attention</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Trouble sleeping</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Mood or behavior changes</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Vision changes</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Being bothered by noise or light</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H24542694\"><span class=\"h1\">Will my child need tests?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>It depends on your child's injury and symptoms. To check if your child has a concussion, the doctor will ask about his or her symptoms and behavior, and do an exam. The doctor will also ask your child questions to check that he or she is thinking clearly.</p><p>If the doctor suspects a serious injury, he or she might order an imaging test of the brain, such as a CT or MRI scan. These tests create pictures of the skull and inside of the brain. But these tests are not usually needed for a routine concussion. In fact, a CT scan can be risky, because it involves radiation. Studies show that doing unnecessary CT scans in children and adolescents increases the risk of cancer later on.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H24542700\"><span class=\"h1\">How is a concussion treated?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Your child should see a doctor who has experience treating concussions. This might be your child's regular doctor, or he or she might refer you to a different doctor.</p><p>The most important part of treatment is rest. Most concussions get better on their own, but it can take time. While your child is healing, it's important that he or she not do too much and not play any sports. Having a second injury while the brain is healing from a concussion can seriously damage the brain. Even if your child seems fine, do not let him or her go back to school or sports until the doctor says it's OK.</p><p>Your child's doctor will decide which activities are safe for your child. This is different for each child with a concussion. In general, a child or adolescent who is healing from a concussion should:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Not go to school until he or she is able to stay focused and concentrate for at least 30 to 45 minutes</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Not play sports, do any heavy exercise, or do any activities that risk a head injury (such as ride a bike or skateboard)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Not spend a lot of time playing video games, sending and receiving text messages, or working at the computer -&mdash; If a child's concussion symptoms get worse while doing any of these activities, the child should not do them at all.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Not listen to loud music</p><p/><p>If your child still has symptoms after 2 or 3 weeks, he or she might need additional treatment. Along with a doctor who has experience treating concussions, other specialists might see your child, too. These include a physical therapist (exercise expert) and a person who is an expert on the brain and behavior.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H24542706\"><span class=\"h1\">When can my child play sports or do usual activities again?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Ask your child's doctor when he or she can play sports or do usual activities again. It will depend on your child's injury and symptoms, as well as the type of sport your child plays. Most children get better within 2 weeks.</p><p>Do not rush it. Your child's brain needs to heal completely after a concussion. If your child gets another concussion before his or her brain has healed, it could lead to serious brain problems.</p><p>When your child does return to his or her usual activities, he or she might need to slowly ease into them. That might mean going for a half-day at school, or doing less schoolwork than the other kids at first. The same goes for going back to sports. He or she might need to start with just light jogging and slowly add in other activities.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H24542712\"><span class=\"h1\">When should I call the doctor or nurse?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Call the doctor or nurse if any of the following happen after a concussion:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Your child vomits more than 3 times</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Your child has a severe headache, or a headache that gets worse</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Your child has a seizure</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Your child has trouble walking or talking</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Your child's vision changes</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Your child feels weak or numb in part of the body</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Your child loses bladder or bowel control</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>You cannot wake your child</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H24542724\"><span class=\"h1\">More on this topic</span></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=head-injury-in-children-and-adolescents-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Head injury in children and adolescents (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=closed-head-injury-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Closed head injury (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=headaches-in-adults-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Headaches in adults (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=vertigo-a-type-of-dizziness-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Vertigo (a type of dizziness) (The Basics)</a></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=head-injury-in-children-and-adolescents-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Head injury in children and adolescents (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=headache-treatment-in-adults-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Headache treatment in adults (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=dizziness-and-vertigo-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Dizziness and vertigo (Beyond the Basics)</a></p></div><div id=\"reviewProcess\"><span>All topics are updated as new evidence becomes available and our <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/home/editorial-policy\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"policy policy_editorialpolicy\">peer review process</a> is complete.</span></div><div id=\"topicRetrievedDate\"><span class=\"emphasis\">This topic retrieved from UpToDate on: </span>Apr 02, 2018.</div><div id=\"disclaimer\">The content on the UpToDate website is not intended nor recommended as a substitute for medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.
