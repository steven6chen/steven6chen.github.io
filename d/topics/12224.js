There are dozens of types of arthritis. Osteoarthritis is the most common type. It often comes with age, and it often affects the hands, knees, and hips.</p><p>The place where 2 bones meet is normally covered with a rubbery material called cartilage. This material allows the bones to slide over each without causing pain. When osteoarthritis sets in, the cartilage begins to break down. As it wears away, the bones in the joint start to rub against each other (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RHEUM%2F115065\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef115065 \">figure 1</a>). This can cause pain, stiffness, and swelling (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F77930\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef77930 \">table 1</a>).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H475075125\"><span class=\"h1\">What can I do to feel better?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>To ease your symptoms:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Rest for several minutes when your pain is at its worst</strong> &ndash; But don't rest too long. That can make your muscles weak and your pain worse.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Lose weight (if you are overweight)</strong> &ndash; Being heavy puts extra strain on your joints.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Get some physical therapy and exercise</strong> &ndash; Having strong muscles takes some of the strain off of your joints. It can reduce your pain in the long run, even though it hurts to do at first.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Use shoe inserts, splints, canes, walkers, or any other devices that help you</strong> &ndash; These devices can help keep your joints stable or take weight off them.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Use hot or cold packs</strong></p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Learn about arthritis</strong> &ndash; That way you can work with your doctor or nurse to find the things that will help you.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H475075132\"><span class=\"h1\">Can herbs, vitamins, or supplements help?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There is no strong evidence that supplements of any sort work on arthritis symptoms. That's true even for glucosamine and chondroitin. Those are 2 supplements people seem to think help with arthritis. If you decide to try any supplements or herbs, check with your doctor or nurse before taking them.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H475075139\"><span class=\"h1\">Are there medicines I can take?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There are lots of medicines that can help you manage your osteoarthritis symptoms. Some simply reduce pain; others reduce swelling and pain. There are also creams and gels you can put on your skin to reduce pain. Plus, there are shots that go into the joint that can help with pain.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H475075146\"><span class=\"h1\">What about surgery?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>When other treatments do not help enough, some people with osteoarthritis get surgery. For instance, some people have surgery to replace a knee or a hip. Surgeons are working on other types of surgery for arthritis, too.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H475075153\"><span class=\"h1\">Try different things until you find what works</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The symptoms of osteoarthritis can be hard to handle. But don't lose hope. You might need to try different combinations of medicines, exercises, and devices to find the approach that works for you. But most people do find ways to go back to doing many of things they like to do.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H475075202\"><span class=\"h1\">More on this topic</span></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=rheumatoid-arthritis-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Rheumatoid arthritis (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=gout-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Gout (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=hand-pain-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Hand pain (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=paget-disease-of-bone-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Paget disease of bone (The Basics)</a></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=arthritis-and-exercise-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Arthritis and exercise (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=joint-infection-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Joint infection (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=nonsteroidal-antiinflammatory-drugs-nsaids-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=osteoarthritis-symptoms-and-diagnosis-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Osteoarthritis symptoms and diagnosis (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=osteoarthritis-treatment-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Osteoarthritis treatment (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=shoulder-osteoarthritis-treatment-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Shoulder osteoarthritis treatment (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=total-hip-replacement-arthroplasty-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Total hip replacement (arthroplasty) (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=total-knee-replacement-arthroplasty-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Total knee replacement (arthroplasty) (Beyond the Basics)</a></p></div><div id=\"reviewProcess\"><span>All topics are updated as new evidence becomes available and our <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/home/editorial-policy\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"policy policy_editorialpolicy\">peer review process</a> is complete.</span></div><div id=\"topicRetrievedDate\"><span class=\"emphasis\">This topic retrieved from UpToDate on: </span>Apr 03, 2018.</div><div id=\"disclaimer\">The content on the UpToDate website is not intended nor recommended as a substitute for medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.
