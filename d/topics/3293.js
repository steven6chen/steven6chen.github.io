Tobacco smoking is responsible for most cases of lung cancer (approximately 90 percent for men and 70 to 85 percent for women). The risk of lung cancer with chronic marijuana smoking and use of electronic nicotine delivery devices remains to be determined.</p><p>Never smoking or smoking cessation for smokers is the only proven means to decrease the risk of developing lung cancer. Former smokers continue to have an elevated risk of developing lung cancer for at least 30 years after stopping smoking, making these individuals an important target group for further efforts at mortality reduction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chemoprevention-of-lung-cancer/abstract/2,3\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,3</a>].

Currently, however, there is no convincing evidence that any approach (other than smoking cessation) can decrease the risk of lung cancer.</p><p>Multiple agents have been studied to decrease the incidence of lung cancer, particularly in those at high risk for the development of this disease.

However, it is likely that many of these associations are confounded by covarying factors, such as socioeconomic status, education, and smoking. Diets high in fruit and vegetables have been consistently associated with reduced lung cancer risk [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chemoprevention-of-lung-cancer/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>]. However, no trials of dietary intervention to decrease the risk of lung cancer have been reported. Reduced serum levels of antioxidants and vitamins, particularly <a href=\"topic.htm?path=vitamin-a-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">vitamin A</a>, have been reported in patients with lung cancer, further supporting the concept that supplementation might be protective. Unfortunately, randomized trials of chemoprevention with vitamins and antioxidants have not been successful.

An analysis of patients at Veterans Affairs Medical Centers who were prescribed inhaled corticosteroids for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and were highly compliant revealed a significantly reduced risk of lung cancer [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chemoprevention-of-lung-cancer/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">The effect of inhaled corticosteroids on the natural history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease has been studied in several double blinded, randomized trials.

The analysis included 23,535 patients with 657 cancer deaths, of which 198 were from lung cancer. Benefit was only seen after five years or more follow-up; lung cancer showed a consistent reduced hazard ratio across various time periods ranging from 0.68 to 0.75, with statistically significant values at 0 to 10 years and 0 to 20 years follow up. The potential benefit was only observed for adenocarcinoma, not other cell types. A further analysis of this study showed similar reductions in lung cancer metastasis, suggesting that at least some of the effect may have been due to suppression of metastasis, rather than interference in earlier stages of carcinogenesis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chemoprevention-of-lung-cancer/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Results from the Women&rsquo;s Health Study add further support to a possible chemopreventive activity of low-dose <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aspirin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">aspirin</a> for lung cancer.

Lung cancer chemoprevention has considerable potential, as high-risk individuals can be readily identified among current and former smokers. Indeed, there is considerable evidence that chemoprevention will be more successful in former than current smokers.

At the present, chemoprevention of lung cancer remains experimental. With the advent of computed tomography (CT) screening for lung cancer, the number of patients cured of early-stage disease or exhibiting ground-glass nodules likely to represent adenocarcinoma in situ should increase, providing ideal populations for additional chemoprevention studies.
