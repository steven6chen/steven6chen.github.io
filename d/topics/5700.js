The few studies of the mechanism of bone loss have revealed decreased bone formation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/drugs-that-affect-bone-metabolism/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>], increasing bone resorption, or both [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/drugs-that-affect-bone-metabolism/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].</p><p>Since heparin is usually given for brief periods of time, its adverse effect on the skeleton should be trivial. However, it may be given for a prolonged period during pregnancy since <a href=\"topic.htm?path=warfarin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">warfarin</a> is relatively contraindicated in the first trimester due to its teratogenic effects [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/drugs-that-affect-bone-metabolism/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. As a result, most of the information concerning the adverse effects of heparin on bone comes from studies of pregnant women requiring anticoagulation.</p><p>Chronic heparin therapy reduces bone mineral density (BMD) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/drugs-that-affect-bone-metabolism/abstract/6-8\" class=\"abstract_t\">6-8</a>]. In one study, for example, in 14 heparin-treated pregnant women and 14 untreated pregnant women, mean hip density fell significantly by approximately 5 percent in the women receiving heparin; there was no change in the control group [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/drugs-that-affect-bone-metabolism/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. Hip density decreased by more than 10 percent in 5 of the 14 women taking heparin (36 percent) versus none of the control group. Similar results were reported in another controlled study, which examined the effect of heparin on forearm density [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/drugs-that-affect-bone-metabolism/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].</p><p>There are many case reports and series of pregnant women with osteoporotic fractures during and after prolonged heparin therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/drugs-that-affect-bone-metabolism/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. One of the largest studies followed 184 pregnant women who were given heparin: four (2.2 percent) had osteoporotic vertebral fractures [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/drugs-that-affect-bone-metabolism/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. Although the incidence of fractures was low, they occurred in young women in whom osteoporotic fractures are extremely rare.

Noncarboxylated clotting factors do not bind to calcium and, therefore, cannot participate in the coagulation cascade. Similarly, warfarin inhibits the gamma-carboxylation of osteocalcin (a major protein of bone); noncarboxylated osteocalcin cannot to bind calcium effectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/drugs-that-affect-bone-metabolism/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>].

This hypothesis is indirectly supported by the following findings:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Mean serum vitamin K concentrations in patients who have fractures are lower than in normal subjects [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/drugs-that-affect-bone-metabolism/abstract/14,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">14,15</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The percentage of noncarboxylated osteocalcin in the serum of older women (who have a greater fracture risk) is higher than in young women [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/drugs-that-affect-bone-metabolism/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The risk of hip fracture in women with high serum concentrations of noncarboxylated osteocalcin is higher (relative risk [RR] 5.9) than in women with low concentrations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/drugs-that-affect-bone-metabolism/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Treatment of postmenopausal women with vitamin K reduces urinary excretion of hydroxyproline, a marker of bone resorption [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/drugs-that-affect-bone-metabolism/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>].</p><p/><p>The clinical importance of these observations is uncertain. Some cross-sectional studies have found that mean bone density in warfarin-treated patients was lower than in control patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/drugs-that-affect-bone-metabolism/abstract/19,20\" class=\"abstract_t\">19,20</a>], and a retrospective cohort study found that long-term exposure to <a href=\"topic.htm?path=warfarin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">warfarin</a> was associated with an increased risk of vertebral and rib fractures [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/drugs-that-affect-bone-metabolism/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. Low bone density was also reported in a small case-control study of children on long-term warfarin versus control children [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/drugs-that-affect-bone-metabolism/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. In a retrospective cohort study of hospitalized patients with atrial fibrillation, men, but not women, who had taken warfarin for more than one year were at increased risk for osteoporotic fracture (odds ratio [OR] 1.63, 95% CI 1.26-2.10) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/drugs-that-affect-bone-metabolism/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>].</p><p>However, in other studies, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=warfarin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">warfarin</a> had no adverse effect on bone density [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/drugs-that-affect-bone-metabolism/abstract/24,25\" class=\"abstract_t\">24,25</a>] or fracture rates [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/drugs-that-affect-bone-metabolism/abstract/26-28\" class=\"abstract_t\">26-28</a>]. In a prospective observational study of women aged 65 years and older, for example, those taking warfarin (n = 149) and those not taking it (n = 6052) had similar rates of bone loss at the hip (1.1 and 0.8 percent, respectively) over two years and similar fracture rates over 3.5 years of follow-up [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/drugs-that-affect-bone-metabolism/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>].</p><p>We currently do not recommend any specific treatment directed toward bone in patients treated with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=warfarin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">warfarin</a>.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Cyclosporine</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Abundant animal data suggest that <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cyclosporine-ciclosporin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cyclosporine</a> adversely affects bone. Administration of cyclosporine to rats, for example, causes an increase in both bone resorption and bone loss, or &quot;high-turnover&quot; osteoporosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/drugs-that-affect-bone-metabolism/abstract/29-31\" class=\"abstract_t\">29-31</a>].</p><p>There is some evidence that <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cyclosporine-ciclosporin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cyclosporine</a> may increase bone turnover in humans as it does in rats [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/drugs-that-affect-bone-metabolism/abstract/32,33\" class=\"abstract_t\">32,33</a>]. However, the effect of cyclosporine on bone metabolism in humans is less clear, being confounded by the presence of other illnesses or drugs that affect bone, particularly glucocorticoids (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=osteoporosis-after-solid-organ-or-stem-cell-transplantation\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Osteoporosis after solid organ or stem cell transplantation&quot;</a>). As an example, one study evaluated BMD and bone histology in 20 living-related donor renal transplant recipients treated with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=azathioprine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">azathioprine</a>, cyclosporine, and low-dose <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prednisone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">prednisone</a> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/drugs-that-affect-bone-metabolism/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>]. These patients lost 6.8 percent of their initial bone mass during the first six months after transplantation due to a low-turnover bone disorder resembling that induced by glucocorticoids. By 18 months, bone density had decreased 9.0 percent from baseline, and 60 percent of the patients had BMD values below the fracture threshold. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=persistent-hyperparathyroidism-after-renal-transplantation\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Persistent hyperparathyroidism after renal transplantation&quot;</a>.)</p><p>In contrast, another randomized study compared <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cyclosporine-ciclosporin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cyclosporine</a> with placebo in patients with primary biliary cholangitis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/drugs-that-affect-bone-metabolism/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>]. Patients receiving cyclosporine had evidence of increased bone turnover; however, cyclosporine decreased the bone loss that normally occurs in this disorder. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-and-treatment-of-low-bone-mass-in-primary-biliary-cholangitis-primary-biliary-cirrhosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation and treatment of low bone mass in primary biliary cholangitis (primary biliary cirrhosis)&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Thus bone loss is common in many of the illnesses treated with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cyclosporine-ciclosporin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cyclosporine</a>, but the role of cyclosporine alone has not been determined. We currently do not recommend any specific treatment directed toward bone in patients taking cyclosporine.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Medroxyprogesterone acetate</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The low doses (5 to 10 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day)</span> of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=medroxyprogesterone-acetate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">medroxyprogesterone acetate</a> (Provera) that are typically used in combination with estrogen as part of a regimen of postmenopausal hormone therapy have no effect on the ability of estrogen to prevent bone loss. This issue was best addressed in the Postmenopausal <span class=\"nowrap\">Estrogen/Progestin</span> Interventions (PEPI) Trial in which 875 women were randomly assigned to placebo or one of four treatment arms consisting of conjugated estrogens (0.625 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day)</span> alone or with three different progestin regimens [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/drugs-that-affect-bone-metabolism/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>]. At three years, BMD increased similarly in all treatment groups and fell in the placebo group. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=postmenopausal-hormone-therapy-in-the-prevention-and-treatment-of-osteoporosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Postmenopausal hormone therapy in the prevention and treatment of osteoporosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p>In contrast, the higher doses of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=medroxyprogesterone-acetate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">medroxyprogesterone acetate</a> that have been used to treat gynecologic disorders or that have been given for contraception have been associated with increased bone loss, presumably due to the induction of estrogen deficiency. In 2004, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) required additional labeling recommending that DepoMPA (DMPA) be used as a long-term birth control method (eg, longer than two years) only if other birth control methods are inadequate and, if used long-term, BMD should be evaluated.

The data in humans have been conflicting, but at least four studies have found an association between excess vitamin A intake and osteoporotic fracture:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The first was a nested case-control study in Sweden, where both <a href=\"topic.htm?path=vitamin-a-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">vitamin A</a> intake and the incidence of hip fracture are high [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/drugs-that-affect-bone-metabolism/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>]. In this report, there was a 10 percent reduction in femoral BMD and a doubling in the risk of hip fracture (OR 2.1, 95% CI 1.1-4.0) among women who consumed more than 1500 mcg retinol per day compared with women who consumed less than 500 mcg per day. The risk was graded; for every 1 mg increase in daily retinol intake, the risk for hip fracture increased by 68 percent (95% CI 18 to 140 percent).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The same group in Sweden reported similar findings in men.

Because calcium absorption decreases with aging, a further reduction in calcium absorption with the addition of such drugs may have an adverse impact on skeletal health, particularly in older individuals.</p><p>Some [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/drugs-that-affect-bone-metabolism/abstract/52\" class=\"abstract_t\">52</a>], but not all [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/drugs-that-affect-bone-metabolism/abstract/53\" class=\"abstract_t\">53</a>], studies with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=omeprazole-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">omeprazole</a> showed that fractional absorption of calcium was reduced in postmenopausal women.

In meta-analyses of case-control and cohort studies, there was an increased risk of fracture (predominantly hip and nonvertebral fracture) in patients who had taken an SSRI (RR 1.72, 95% CI 1.51-1.95) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/drugs-that-affect-bone-metabolism/abstract/72,73\" class=\"abstract_t\">72,73</a>]. Similarly, in a separate meta-analysis of case-control and cohort studies examining the association between TCAs and risk of fracture, there was an increased risk of fracture in users of TCAs compared with nonusers (adjusted RR 1.36, 95% CI 1.24-1.50) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/drugs-that-affect-bone-metabolism/abstract/74\" class=\"abstract_t\">74</a>]. The rise in fracture risk was very rapid and decreased with time, suggesting that the effect was not due to a reduction in BMD. In both meta-analyses, the increased risk persisted after confining the analysis to studies that adjusted for important risk factors for fracture (age, comorbidities, medications known to increase fracture risk, BMD).</p><p>The results from these studies do not prove causality, and other confounders not controlled for during statistical analysis may explain the observed association. However, one mechanism to explain the possible association between antidepressants and fracture is the adverse effects of the drugs, including sedation and postural hypotension, which may increase risk of falls. Nevertheless, in some large cross-sectional and prospective cohort studies, use of SSRIs, but not TCAs, has been associated with reduced BMD in older men [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/drugs-that-affect-bone-metabolism/abstract/75\" class=\"abstract_t\">75</a>] and increased rates of bone loss at the hip in older women [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/drugs-that-affect-bone-metabolism/abstract/76\" class=\"abstract_t\">76</a>]. Thus, an alternative possibility is a direct effect of SSRIs on bone metabolism, although studies in this regard are preliminary and not supported by limited randomized controlled trials [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/drugs-that-affect-bone-metabolism/abstract/77,78\" class=\"abstract_t\">77,78</a>].</p><p>Prospective trials are needed to definitively determine the relationship between antidepressants and fracture. In the interim, we recommend that the risks of potential fracture be balanced against the benefits gained from treating depression, especially in older persons who are already at increased risk for osteoporosis and fracture. The decision to prescribe SSRIs versus TCAs should not be driven by fracture data, since there is only observational data that either may increase risk of fracture.</p><p>We also recommend counseling regarding fall prevention, adequate calcium and vitamin D supplementation, and smoking cessation, which are important lifestyle changes that may prevent fracture. BMD testing should be considered in patients receiving SSRIs, especially when other risk factors for fracture are present, such as advanced age or prior history of fragility fracture.

Data in humans are inconsistent with some studies showing a lower risk of fracture with current use of beta blockers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/drugs-that-affect-bone-metabolism/abstract/106,107\" class=\"abstract_t\">106,107</a>] and another showing no effect [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/drugs-that-affect-bone-metabolism/abstract/108\" class=\"abstract_t\">108</a>]. A meta-analysis of 16 observational studies showed a significant reduction in fracture risk in patients receiving beta blockers, a finding primarily driven by a reduction in risk of hip fracture [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/drugs-that-affect-bone-metabolism/abstract/109\" class=\"abstract_t\">109</a>]. The meta-analysis was limited by significant heterogeneity in the results.</p><p>Given the limitations of the observational data and the absence of clinical trial data, beta blockers have no current role in osteoporosis management.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H27\"><span class=\"h1\">SUMMARY</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>There are several drugs that have been associated with a decrease in bone mineral density (BMD) and an increase in the risk of fracture, whereas other drugs appear to improve BMD and decrease the risk of fracture. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Drugs that may have adverse effects'</a> above and <a href=\"#H20\" class=\"local\">'Drugs that may have beneficial effects'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In observational studies, commonly used medications, such as proton pump inhibitors (PPIs), antidepressants, anticoagulants, and loop diuretics have been associated with an increased risk of fracture. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Drugs that may have adverse effects'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>When these medications are given for a brief period of time, the adverse skeletal effects are of less concern. Because long-term therapy may have detrimental skeletal effects, older patients should be evaluated for other risk factors for osteoporosis and fracture and counseled regarding fall prevention, adequate calcium and vitamin D supplementation, and smoking cessation, which are important lifestyle changes that may prevent fracture. BMD testing should be considered in some patients, especially when other risk factors for fracture are present, such as advanced age or prior history of fragility fracture.
