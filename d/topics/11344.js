The high sensitivity of MRI for breast cancer has led to the increasing use of MRI for breast cancer detection, assessment, and treatment monitoring, although appropriate indications, scanning technique, and interpretation remain variable among facilities.</p><p>This topic will review breast MRI technique, interpretation, and indications as well as emerging tools for breast cancer detection. Issues regarding screening for breast cancer, the role of mammography and ultrasound in women with suspected disease, surveillance for patients with known breast cancer, and the physics of MRI are discussed separately.

By utilizing the differences in tissue relaxation characteristics, an image is acquired by processing the signal changes that occur following application of pulses of energy. The physics of MRI is discussed in detail elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=principles-of-magnetic-resonance-imaging#H2\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Principles of magnetic resonance imaging&quot;, section on 'MR physics'</a>.)</p><p>Breast MRI for the detection of breast cancer requires administration of the contrast agent gadolinium. The use of MRI for breast cancer detection is based on the concept of tumor angiogenesis or neovascularity. Tumor-associated blood vessels have increased permeability, which leads to prompt uptake and release of gadolinium within the first one to two minutes after administration, leading to a pattern of rapid enhancement and washout on MRI (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F74017\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef74017 \">figure 1</a>). This dynamic rapid enhancement pattern helps to distinguish breast cancers from benign lesions. Breast MRI techniques continue to evolve, but some general recommendations can be made based on minimum standards used by the American College of Radiology Imaging Network (ACRIN) 6667 Trial [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mri-of-the-breast-and-emerging-technologies/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>] and the European Society of Breast Imaging [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mri-of-the-breast-and-emerging-technologies/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Bilateral breast examination</strong> &ndash; Both breasts should be evaluated in an MRI study, for comparison purposes, even when concern about possible pathology involves only one breast.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Magnet &ndash;</strong> The magnet field strength recommended for breast MRI is &ge;1.5-Tesla. &#160;</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Coil &ndash; </strong>A dedicated breast coil should be used for breast MRI. The breast coil is designed to receive signals generated from breast tissue and permits imaging of both breasts simultaneously. Surface coils are necessary to achieve adequate spatial resolution while maintaining high signal-to-noise levels.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Positioning &ndash;</strong> Patients are placed in the prone position, over the breast coil, which has openings for the patient&rsquo;s breasts. The coils surround the breasts and detect the magnetic signals from the breast. Some centers image the patient with the breasts in mild compression, which minimizes motion artifact and aids in biopsy planning. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Patient comfort</strong> &ndash; Patients are given ear plugs before the exam begins to help diminish the loud &ldquo;knocking&rdquo; sounds that are typically heard during an MRI exam. Claustrophobia can be diminished with a short-acting anxiolytic prior to the exam. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Contrast &ndash;</strong> Intravenous gadolinium contrast must be used to maximize cancer detection and is administered before breast MRI to highlight the neovascularity associated with cancers. Contrast is <strong>not</strong> necessary when the study is performed to evaluate silicone implant integrity.<br/><br/>Allergic and anaphylactoid reactions to gadolinium are rare, but can occur. In addition, in patients with renal failure, gadolinium can cause contrast nephropathy <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> nephrogenic systemic fibrosis. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=principles-of-magnetic-resonance-imaging#H39\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Principles of magnetic resonance imaging&quot;, section on 'MR contrast agent'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">A few studies have also reported gadolinium deposition in the brain from repeated intravenous administration, with the degree of deposition varying based on the specific contrast agent. The clinical significance of this deposition remains unknown, and no data for humans exist to show any adverse effects at this time [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mri-of-the-breast-and-emerging-technologies/abstract/4,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,5</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Imaging &ndash; </strong>Images are acquired within 45 seconds of contrast injection and then every one to two minutes with completion within four minutes in order to observe the early preferential signal enhancement associated with the hypervascularity of malignant tumors. Slice thickness should be &le;3 mm.<br/><br/>After the first few minutes following contrast injection, benign breast tissue may also enhance. This time constraint means that a compromise must be reached between temporal and spatial resolution. Imaging strategies such as high spatial resolution and the use of fat-suppression techniques improve the sensitivity of breast MRI for small or multifocal lesions, but also increase scan times [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mri-of-the-breast-and-emerging-technologies/abstract/6,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,7</a>]. Dynamic techniques, in which images are acquired at intervals of one minute or less, achieve higher temporal resolution and improve specificity by allowing the time course of contrast uptake to be better defined [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mri-of-the-breast-and-emerging-technologies/abstract/8-10\" class=\"abstract_t\">8-10</a>]. Alternative approaches combine low temporal resolution kinetic information with high spatial resolution anatomic information as a means of achieving high sensitivity and specificity in a single-scan technique [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mri-of-the-breast-and-emerging-technologies/abstract/11-14\" class=\"abstract_t\">11-14</a>]. Most centers compromise by acquiring temporal resolution at 1 to 1 minute 30 seconds with higher spatial resolution.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1930682\"><span class=\"h1\">MRI INTERPRETATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Breast MRI images are analyzed for morphology and initial and delayed contrast enhancement. Lesions are categorized as mass or non-mass lesions. The sensitivity of breast MRI is reported as 71 to 100 percent; however, the specificity is less than 65 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mri-of-the-breast-and-emerging-technologies/abstract/15,16\" class=\"abstract_t\">15,16</a>]. The low specificity is due to the overlap in the enhancement pattern of benign and malignant lesions. Positive findings are more likely to be accurate for mass lesions than non-mass lesions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mri-of-the-breast-and-emerging-technologies/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. Breast MRI findings must be correlated with the patient&rsquo;s mammographic <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> sonographic imaging.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Mass lesions are assessed for shape, margin characteristics, and enhancement patterns. Margin characteristics, such as smooth, irregular, or spiculated margins, are significant predictors of malignant versus benign diagnoses. As with mammography, masses with irregular or spiculated margins are worrisome for malignancy. Rapid uptake and washout of gadolinium is seen more commonly in malignant lesions. Progressive enhancement over time is most often encountered in benign lesions or normal breast tissue. In one study of 266 lesions detected on breast MRI, progressive enhancement was seen with 83 percent of the benign lesions as compared with 9 percent of the malignant lesions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mri-of-the-breast-and-emerging-technologies/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Non-mass lesions are characterized by spatial distribution and patterns of enhancement within the breast. Spatial distribution can be diffuse, regional, segmental, or linear. A stippled enhancement pattern is a predictor of malignant versus benign diagnoses. The non-mass lesions present substantial diagnostic challenges and account for a high percentage of false positives. As an example, in one study of 132 patients who underwent 151 biopsies for breast lesions detected on breast MRI, non-mass lesions represented only 20 percent of all lesions detected, but accounted for almost half of the false positive interpretations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mri-of-the-breast-and-emerging-technologies/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6635177\"><span class=\"h2\">MRI of high-risk breast lesions identified by core biopsy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Breast MRI is sometimes used as an adjunct to further assess high-risk proliferative breast lesions with or without atypia, including papillomas, radial sclerosing lesions, lobular neoplasias, and atypical hyperplasias, identified by core needle biopsy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mri-of-the-breast-and-emerging-technologies/abstract/19-21\" class=\"abstract_t\">19-21</a>]. In a retrospective review of MRI assessment of 227 high-risk breast lesions, contrast enhancing lesions (n=155) were significantly more likely to be associated with a breast malignancy (invasive or noninvasive) compared with nonenhancing lesions (18 versus 3 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mri-of-the-breast-and-emerging-technologies/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. Diagnosis was confirmed by an excision of the lesion. Cancer probability was also greater for non-mass lesions compared with mass lesions (43 versus 14 percent). </p><p>However, the negative predictive value (NPV) is low for proliferative lesions with atypia, including lobular neoplasias (NPV 88 percent) and atypical ductal hyperplasia (NPV 90 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mri-of-the-breast-and-emerging-technologies/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. These lesions should be excised when identified on a core needle biopsy. In comparison, the NPV for proliferative lesions without atypia (papilloma and radial scar) was 97.4 and 97.6 percent, respectively. Patients with these lesions may be safely observed with repeat annual mammographic, ultrasound or MRI imaging, depending upon patient and clinician preference. </p><p>(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-benign-breast-disease#H8\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of benign breast disease&quot;, section on 'Proliferative breast lesions without atypia'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-benign-breast-disease#H15\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of benign breast disease&quot;, section on 'Atypical hyperplasia'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H536410\"><span class=\"h2\">Limitations of breast MRI</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Hormonal changes and cancer treatments can affect the accuracy of breast MRIs and should be taken into account when scheduling and interpreting the study.

It is not known how recent chemotherapy impacts gadolinium uptake, although there are reports that selective estrogen receptor modulators (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tamoxifen-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">tamoxifen</a>) and aromatase inhibitors (eg, Arimidex) can cause malignancies to appear smaller or even undetectable on mammography [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mri-of-the-breast-and-emerging-technologies/abstract/30,31\" class=\"abstract_t\">30,31</a>].<strong> </strong>Based upon a prospective study that included 40 women, tamoxifen, and to a lesser extent aromatase inhibitors, substantially suppress background enhancement, making it challenging to detect even benign breast lesions by MRI imaging [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mri-of-the-breast-and-emerging-technologies/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>MRI reporting</strong> &ndash; Breast MRIs are increasingly reported using the Breast Imaging Reporting and Data System (BI-RADS) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mri-of-the-breast-and-emerging-technologies/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>]. The BI-RADS system was originally developed by the American College of Radiology to standardize mammography reporting, but is now also used for breast ultrasound and MRI (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F100197\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef100197 \">table 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mri-of-the-breast-and-emerging-technologies/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>]. However, the probability of malignancy for these assessment codes for ultrasound and MRI are not as well established, although it is believed that they are likely similar to that with mammography. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=breast-imaging-for-cancer-screening-mammography-and-ultrasonography#H15\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Breast imaging for cancer screening: Mammography and ultrasonography&quot;, section on 'The BI-RADS categories'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Standardization &ndash; </strong>The specific sequences acquired during the examination vary between facilities [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mri-of-the-breast-and-emerging-technologies/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>]. In addition, the dynamic enhancement data often are not archived with the image files. The lack of standardization in breast MRI impairs the ability to compare studies from different institutions, thus leading to repeat MRIs when patients seek second opinions.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Biopsy capability &ndash;</strong> Based on current National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) guidelines, imaging centers that perform MRI should have the ability to perform MRI guided needle sampling <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> wire localization of MRI detected findings [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mri-of-the-breast-and-emerging-technologies/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>]. Almost half of abnormal findings on MRI may not be evident on other imaging studies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mri-of-the-breast-and-emerging-technologies/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Cost &ndash;</strong> In the United States, MRI of the breast is expensive, costing approximately 10 to 15 times more than mammography or ultrasound, and is not uniformly reimbursed by insurance. In addition, for 10 to 30 percent of all women who undergo MRI, the study results in recommendation for follow up MRI in six months to reassess nonspecific, but probably benign findings. &#160;</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Menopause status</strong> &ndash; Postmenopausal patients with breast cancer more commonly exhibit slow initial-phase contrast uptake and persistent enhancement on delayed imaging rather than the classic early rapid contrast uptake with washout on delayed MR sequences. In a retrospective review of 273 patients with breast cancer (153 intraductal cancers, 24 lobular cancers, and 4 mixed histology), typical kinetic findings (rapid contrast uptake) were less likely to be seen in postmenopausal patients (n = 155) compared with premenopausal (n = 110) and postmenopausal patients using hormone replacement therapy (n = 8) (56.8 versus 80.9 versus 50.0 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mri-of-the-breast-and-emerging-technologies/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>].

Breast MRI has been used for the assessment of silicone implant integrity, diagnosis of occult primary breast cancers, determination of disease extent in newly diagnosed breast cancer patients (when indicated), documentation of response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy, diagnosis of recurrence, clarification of inconclusive clinical or mammographic findings, and screening of high-risk patients. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H633682\"><span class=\"h2\">Assessment of breast implants</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Breast MRI is useful for detection of silicone implant rupture and diagnosis of masses caused by free silicone injection.

Intracapsular ruptures are defined as rupture of the silicone shell or envelope around the liquid silicone, with an intact fibrous capsule. Extracapsular ruptures are defined as rupture of both the envelope and fibrous capsule, allowing leakage into surrounding tissue. Both types of rupture usually require surgical removal of the implant. Surgical excision of an extracapsular rupture is technically more challenging because of the silicone leakage into surrounding tissue.</p><p>Breast MRI is the most useful imaging test for detecting both intracapsular and extracapsular ruptures of a silicone breast implant with a sensitivity and specificity of over 90 percent (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F53026\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef53026 \">image 4</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mri-of-the-breast-and-emerging-technologies/abstract/41-45\" class=\"abstract_t\">41-45</a>]. The most reliable sign of rupture on MRI is the presence of multiple curvilinear lines, which represent the collapsed implant shell floating inside the silicone gel, referred to as the &ldquo;linguine sign.&rdquo;</p><p>The most important risk factor for silicone breast implant rupture is time since placement, since 50 percent of implants rupture after 12 years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mri-of-the-breast-and-emerging-technologies/abstract/46\" class=\"abstract_t\">46</a>]. The United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) recommends that regular MRI screening be performed for asymptomatic women with silicone implants three years after implantation and every two years thereafter [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mri-of-the-breast-and-emerging-technologies/abstract/47\" class=\"abstract_t\">47</a>]. However, there is little evidence to support a recommendation for regular MRI screening, which is expensive and may lead to anxiety and false positive results, and result in unnecessary surgery. Therefore, most experts agree that breast MRI should be used as a confirmatory diagnostic test and not be used to screen asymptomatic women for implant rupture [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mri-of-the-breast-and-emerging-technologies/abstract/47,48\" class=\"abstract_t\">47,48</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H633711\"><span class=\"h3\">Free silicone injections</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Direct injection of liquid silicone into the breast tissue for breast augmentation was done in the 1950&rsquo;s [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mri-of-the-breast-and-emerging-technologies/abstract/49,50\" class=\"abstract_t\">49,50</a>]. This practice led to the development of painful hard silicone masses in the breast, termed silicone granulomas or siliconomas. Although this practice was banned by the FDA in the United States in 1965, free silicone injections were performed in other countries and women still present with sequelae of this technique [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mri-of-the-breast-and-emerging-technologies/abstract/50\" class=\"abstract_t\">50</a>].

If a biopsy is necessary for a lesion not seen on other imaging modalities, a PEM-compatible biopsy system is used to direct tissue sampling.</p><p>In several observational studies of breast cancer patients, PEM has 86 to 91 percent sensitivity and 91 to 93 percent specificity for detection of disease (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F56543\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef56543 \">image 13</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mri-of-the-breast-and-emerging-technologies/abstract/146-149\" class=\"abstract_t\">146-149</a>]. However, PEM does not reliably detect low grade malignancies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mri-of-the-breast-and-emerging-technologies/abstract/141\" class=\"abstract_t\">141</a>]. Thus, while PEM is promising for the preoperative assessment of disease extent in breast cancer patients, PEM cannot be used for screening or to exclude breast cancer in patients with suspicious breast masses or abnormal mammography. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1930703\"><span class=\"h1\">SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) may be used in select circumstances for breast cancer detection, assessment, and treatment monitoring, although appropriate indications, standardization of technique, and interpretation remain variable among facilities. MRI of the breast is also an important tool for the assessment of silicone implant integrity. (See <a href=\"#H1930667\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The use of MRI for breast cancer detection is based on the concept of tumor angiogenesis or neovascularity. Tumor associated blood vessels have increased permeability, which leads to prompt take up and release of the contrast agent and helps to distinguish breast cancers from benign growths. (See <a href=\"#H10606309\" class=\"local\">'Breast MRI technique'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A dedicated breast coil should be used for breast MRI. The breast coil is designed to receive signals generated from breast tissue and permits imaging of both breasts simultaneously. (See <a href=\"#H10606309\" class=\"local\">'Breast MRI technique'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Intravenous gadolinium contrast must be used to maximize cancer detection and is administered during breast MRI to highlight neovascularity associated with cancers. Contrast is <strong>not</strong> necessary when the study is performed to evaluate silicone implant integrity. Gadolinium is contraindicated in patients with compromised renal function. (See <a href=\"#H10606309\" class=\"local\">'Breast MRI technique'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Breast MRI images are analyzed for morphology and initial and delayed contrast enhancement. Lesions are categorized as mass or non-mass lesions. The sensitivity of breast MRI is high, but the specificity is lower due to the overlap in the enhancement pattern of benign and malignant lesions. (See <a href=\"#H1930682\" class=\"local\">'MRI interpretation'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Hormonal changes and cancer treatments can affect the accuracy of breast MRIs. Although there is variation in the performance of breast MRIs, reporting should follow standard guidelines. Facilities that perform breast MRI should have MRI-biopsy capability. (See <a href=\"#H536410\" class=\"local\">'Limitations of breast MRI'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Contraindications for breast MRI include pregnancy, implanted devices and foreign bodies, and any prior history of gadolinium allergy or diminished renal function. (See <a href=\"#H3948722\" class=\"local\">'Precautions'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The appropriate use of breast MRI is evolving and some indications remain controversial. Breast MRI has been used for the assessment of silicone implant integrity, diagnosis of occult primary breast cancers, determination of disease extent in newly diagnosed breast cancer patients (when indicated), documentation of response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy, diagnosis of recurrence, clarification of inconclusive clinical or imaging findings, and screening of high risk patients. (See <a href=\"#H633667\" class=\"local\">'Indications for breast MRI'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Recognition of the limitations of mammography, ultrasound, and breast MRI has led to investigation of other promising breast imaging techniques including high-field strength MRI, magnetic resonance spectroscopy, diffusion weighted imaging, breast-specific gamma imaging, and positron emission mammography. (See <a href=\"#H10606365\" class=\"local\">'Emerging imaging technology for breast cancer detection'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H440138241\"><span class=\"h1\">ACKNOWLEDGMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The editorial staff at UpToDate would like to acknowledge Elaine Iuanow, MD, who contributed to an earlier version of this topic review.</p></div><div id=\"topicAgreement\">Use of UpToDate is subject to the <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/legal/license\" class=\"licenseLink\" id=\"sla_in_page\">Subscription and License Agreement</a>.</div><div id=\"references\" class=\"headingAnchor\"><h1>REFERENCES</h1><ol id=\"reference\"><li><a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mri-of-the-breast-and-emerging-technologies/abstract/1\" class=\"nounderline abstract_t\">Heywang SH, Hahn D, Schmidt H, et al.
