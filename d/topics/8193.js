In some cases, hereditary pancreatitis may follow an autosomal recessive pattern of inheritance. When caused by mutations in the <em>PRSS1 </em>gene, this disorder has high penetrance and causes recurrent acute and chronic pancreatitis in both children and adults. &#160;</p><p>Familial pancreatitis refers to pancreatitis from any cause that occurs in a family with an incidence that is greater than would be expected by chance alone, given the size of the family and the standardized incidence of pancreatitis within a defined population. Familial pancreatitis may or may not be caused by a genetic defect.</p><p>Issues related to hereditary pancreatitis will be reviewed here.

In addition, cases of pancreatitis without a family history may have a genetic basis (simplex case).</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Autosomal dominant hereditary pancreatitis &mdash; This is most often associated with mutations in the serine protease 1 gene (<em>PRSS1</em>) on chromosome 7q35, which encodes trypsin-1 (cationic trypsinogen) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hereditary-pancreatitis/abstract/1-3\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-3</a>]. Rarely, autosomal-dominant-appearing hereditary pancreatitis is identified in a kindred that does not have an identifiable <em>PRSS1</em> mutation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hereditary-pancreatitis/abstract/4-6\" class=\"abstract_t\">4-6</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'PRSS1'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Autosomal recessive pancreatitis &mdash; Chronic pancreatitis associated with cystic fibrosis is the most common example. Mutations in the <strong>s</strong>erine <strong>p</strong>rotease <strong>in</strong>hibitor <strong>K</strong>azal type <strong>1 gene</strong> (<em>SPINK1</em>, also called pancreatic secretory trypsin inhibitor gene) also may present in an autosomal recessive pattern. CFTR-associated disorders include chronic pancreatitis with minimal lung disease, and this trait may occur in multiple family members. (See <a href=\"#H16024358\" class=\"local\">'CFTR'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Complex genetics &mdash; Multiple family members may have recurrent acute or chronic pancreatitis associated with a combination of genetic and environmental factors. This is the case for patients with heterozygous <em>SPINK1</em> mutations, in which the <em>SPINK1</em> mutation probably acts as a disease modifier, lowering the threshold for developing pancreatitis from other genetic (eg, <em>CFTR</em> mutations) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hereditary-pancreatitis/abstract/7,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,8</a>] or environmental factors (see <a href=\"#H16023350\" class=\"local\">'SPINK1'</a> below). Some apparently sporadic cases of pancreatitis have complex genetic risk. </p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">PRSS1</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Mutations in the serine protease 1 gene (<em>PRSS1</em>), which encodes trypsin-1 (cationic trypsinogen), are present in up to 80 percent of patients with autosomal dominant hereditary pancreatitis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hereditary-pancreatitis/abstract/9-14\" class=\"abstract_t\">9-14</a>]. <em>PRSS1</em> mutations are also occasionally identified in cases of apparently idiopathic acute recurrent or chronic pancreatitis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hereditary-pancreatitis/abstract/15,16\" class=\"abstract_t\">15,16</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pathogenesis-of-acute-pancreatitis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pathogenesis of acute pancreatitis&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=causes-and-contributing-risk-factors-for-chronic-pancreatitis-in-children-and-adolescents#H3734723367\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Causes and contributing risk factors for chronic pancreatitis in children and adolescents&quot;, section on 'Idiopathic'</a>.) </p><p>Cationic trypsin is the most abundant form of trypsin produced by the pancreas and is the primary catalyst for the conversion of pancreatic zymogens into pancreatic digestive enzymes after they are secreted into the duodenum. Premature activation of digestive enzymes in the pancreas is the major cause of pancreatic injury and immune system activation, leading to acute pancreatitis and later chronic pancreatitis. The primary defense against pancreatitis is to control trypsin activity, either through prevention of premature activation of trypsinogen to trypsin, or by the destruction, inhibition, or elimination of trypsin from the pancreas. These defenses are weakened by mutations in <em>PRSS1</em>, or in genes coding for molecules that protect the pancreas from active trypsin (eg, <em>SPINK1</em>, <em>CTRC</em>, <em>CFTR</em>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hereditary-pancreatitis/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. </p><p>Trypsin has two regulatory regions that are controlled by corresponding calcium-binding pockets, one regulating the activation site (changing trypsinogen into trypsin with the release of trypsinogen activation peptide) and the other regulating the autolysis site (leading to trypsin destruction). Nearly all of the pathogenic genetic variants associated with hereditary pancreatitis are clustered in these two regions. </p><p>The most common pancreatitis-associated mutations in <em>PRSS1</em> are the p.R122H (at the autolysis site) and p.N29I mutations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hereditary-pancreatitis/abstract/2,3,9,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,3,9,13</a>]. As an example, in a national series of 200 patients from 78 families with hereditary pancreatitis in France, <em>PRSS1</em> mutations were detected in 68 percent; among these patients, p.R122H and p.N291 were present in 78 and 12 percent, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hereditary-pancreatitis/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. The estimated prevalence of hereditary pancreatitis in this study was at least 0.3 per 100,000. A research <a href=\"http://www.pancreasgenetics.org/&amp;token=oLXb6NSMOZdF35h7AB6nuS2pVldzli66NVGjKcnUPjPN95q8VKoiASC/GweIcIVH&amp;TOPIC_ID=5884\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">website on chronic pancreatitis genetics</a> maintains and updates a lists of the <em>PRSS1</em> variants, among other genes, including functional studies to help classify the mutations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hereditary-pancreatitis/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. </p><p>The p.R122H and p.N291 mutations have high penetrance (80 and 93 percent in two series) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hereditary-pancreatitis/abstract/9,19\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,19</a>]. It remains unclear why some family members with these mutations do not develop chronic pancreatitis. A possible contributing factor for the occasionally decreased penetrance of pancreatitis is the presence of mutations that protect against the development of chronic pancreatitis. One such mutation has been described in the anionic trypsinogen gene (<em>PRSS2</em>), resulting in the loss of trypsin activity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hereditary-pancreatitis/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>].</p><p>Other kindreds carry <em>PRSS1</em> mutations at different sites, and new mutations continue to be described [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hereditary-pancreatitis/abstract/15,21-25\" class=\"abstract_t\">15,21-25</a>]. One such mutation causes misfolding and intracellular retention of cationic trypsinogen [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hereditary-pancreatitis/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>], while a second stabilizes trypsinogen, protecting against autocatalytic degradation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hereditary-pancreatitis/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>], and a third increases trypsin activation from trypsinogen [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hereditary-pancreatitis/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. These mutations may not have the same high penetrance that has been seen with p.R122H and p.N291 mutations.</p><p>Risk of pancreatitis is also associated with copy number variants. Copy number variants are uncommon. Cases have been reported in both Europe [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hereditary-pancreatitis/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>] and the United States [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hereditary-pancreatitis/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. The risk appears to be a dose-effect, since decreased <em>PRSS1</em> expression is associated with a reduced risk of pancreatitis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hereditary-pancreatitis/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H16023350\"><span class=\"h2\">SPINK1</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The <strong>s</strong>erine <strong>p</strong>rotease <strong>in</strong>hibitor <strong>K</strong>azal type <strong>1 </strong>gene (<em>SPINK1</em>) encodes a pancreatic secretory trypsin inhibitor and that is regulated as an acute phase reactant. It is expressed in pancreatic acinar cells during an inflammatory process where it normally serves as a critical suicide inhibitor of trypsin. Mutations in <em>SPINK1</em> interfere with this protective action and predispose to pancreatitis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hereditary-pancreatitis/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. Thus, pathogenic variants in <em>SPINK1</em> are of minimal consequence unless there is premature and excessive activation of trypsin and inflammation. <em>SPINK1</em> mutations can cause familial pancreatitis with an autosomal recessive pattern in families in which both parents have a mutation. However, the majority of patients with <em>SPINK1</em> mutations and chronic pancreatitis are heterozygous, resulting in complex inheritance patterns. </p><p><em>SPINK1</em> mutations are fairly common in the general population (2 percent of healthy individuals carry a &quot;high risk&quot; mutation) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hereditary-pancreatitis/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>], but less than 1 percent of carriers develop pancreatitis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hereditary-pancreatitis/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. Nonetheless, mutations in <em>SPINK1</em> increase the risk for chronic pancreatitis about 12-fold over the general population. In three series of patients with apparent idiopathic chronic pancreatitis, mutations in <em>SPINK1</em> were detected in 16 to 23 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hereditary-pancreatitis/abstract/24,30,31\" class=\"abstract_t\">24,30,31</a>]. In one of these reports, <em>SPINK1</em> mutations were more common in patients with idiopathic chronic pancreatitis or recurrent acute pancreatitis than in controls (19.5 versus 2.6 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hereditary-pancreatitis/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]. A <em>SPINK1</em> high-risk haplotype containing N34S is the most common variant in the United State and Europe, while a <em>SPINK1</em> IVS3 +2T&gt;C variant is also common in Japan, China, and Korea [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hereditary-pancreatitis/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>]. <em>SPINK1</em> variants have been linked to idiopathic pancreatitis, alcoholic pancreatitis, familial pancreatitis, and tropical pancreatitis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hereditary-pancreatitis/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>]. </p><p>Patients with heterozygous <em>SPINK1</em> mutations and pancreatitis typically have complex genetics (eg, gene x gene, gene x environment) since <em>SPINK1</em>, as a specific trypsin inhibitor, is only required if there is an upstream problem causing recurrent trypsin activation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hereditary-pancreatitis/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>]. Thus, the <em>SPINK1</em> mutation probably acts as a disease modifier, lowering the threshold for developing pancreatitis from other genetic or environmental factors. The most common genetic variant seen with <em>SPINK1</em> is <em>CFTR</em>, which is described below [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hereditary-pancreatitis/abstract/7,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,8</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H16024358\"><span class=\"h2\">CFTR</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Mutations in the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator gene (<em>CFTR</em>) can cause pancreatitis with or without associated manifestations of cystic fibrosis. Over 2000 different genetic variants in <em>CFTR</em> have been identified, and disease manifestations depend on the severity of the mutation and zygosity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hereditary-pancreatitis/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cystic-fibrosis-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis#H10\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Cystic fibrosis: Clinical manifestations and diagnosis&quot;, section on 'Pancreatic disease'</a>.)</p><p>The association between <em>CFTR</em> mutations and pancreatitis fall into one of four patterns:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Classic cystic fibrosis &ndash; Caused by homozygous or compound heterozygous mutations for two &quot;severe&quot; <em>CFTR</em> mutations. The presence of two severe <em>CFTR</em> mutations, such as <span class=\"nowrap\">F508del/F508del,</span> results in absence of functional CFTR protein on the duct cell apical membrane and is associated with typical cystic fibrosis. Affected patients have classic manifestations of cystic fibrosis including abnormal sweat chloride measures, and often develop chronic pancreatitis and pancreatic insufficiency early in life [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hereditary-pancreatitis/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>]. A minority of these patients may have pancreatic exocrine sufficiency during childhood, and these patients are at risk for acute pancreatitis and progression to chronic pancreatitis. In patients with cystic fibrosis, the risk of acute pancreatitis is linked with pancreatic <strong>sufficiency</strong> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hereditary-pancreatitis/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Atypical cystic fibrosis &ndash; Caused by homozygous or compound heterozygous genotypes in which at least one of the <em>CFTR</em> gene copies is a functionally &quot;mild&quot; variant. This genotype results in some retained CFTR function and milder or limited features of cystic fibrosis (atypical cystic fibrosis). Affected patients have normal or borderline sweat chloride testing, but may have recurrent acute or chronic pancreatitis, congenital absence of the vas deferens <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> chronic sinusitis, especially if the variant specifically alters CFTR bicarbonate conductance. The risk for chronic pancreatitis is increased 40- to 80-fold over the general population [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hereditary-pancreatitis/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>]. The primary example is <em>CFTR</em> R75Q mutation, which causes a selective defect in bicarbonate secretion but does not interfere with chloride secretion as seen in classic cystic fibrosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hereditary-pancreatitis/abstract/7,38\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,38</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cystic-fibrosis-overview-of-gastrointestinal-disease#H21\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Cystic fibrosis: Overview of gastrointestinal disease&quot;, section on 'Pancreatitis'</a>.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>CFTR-related disorders &ndash; A new class of CFTR variants has been identified that causes selective deficiency in bicarbonate conductance (CFTR-BD) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hereditary-pancreatitis/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>]. Subjects with at least one CFTR-BD variant had increased risk of recurrent acute pancreatitis and chronic pancreatitis, male infertility and chronic sinusitis, but minimal lung disease. The sweat chloride levels are normal or slightly abnormal. The nine variants were previously classified as variable (R117H) or benign (R74Q, R75Q, R170H, L967S, L997F, D1152H, S1235R, and D1270N) based on risk of classic CF. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cystic-fibrosis-overview-of-gastrointestinal-disease#H21\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Cystic fibrosis: Overview of gastrointestinal disease&quot;, section on 'Pancreatitis'</a>.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>CFTR-related pancreatitis &ndash; Associated with heterozygous <em>CFTR</em> mutations (ie, cystic fibrosis carriers). The risk for chronic pancreatitis in this group is increased three- to four-fold over the general population, although 99 percent of the carriers are healthy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hereditary-pancreatitis/abstract/38,40,41\" class=\"abstract_t\">38,40,41</a>]. Those who do develop chronic pancreatitis have a very high rate of coexisting <em>SPINK1</em> or chymotrypsinogen C (<em>CTRC</em>) mutations, suggesting epistasis between these genes and complex genetics [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hereditary-pancreatitis/abstract/7,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,8</a>]. Heterozygous <em>CFTR</em> variants may also contribute to pancreatitis in the presence of pancreatic divisum [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hereditary-pancreatitis/abstract/42,43\" class=\"abstract_t\">42,43</a>].</p><p/><p>Several studies have shown that carriage of <em>CFTR</em> mutations, including uncommon and mild mutations, is more common among patients with idiopathic chronic pancreatitis than among controls [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hereditary-pancreatitis/abstract/35,40,44\" class=\"abstract_t\">35,40,44</a>]. However, in studies of populations known to be cystic fibrosis carriers (eg, parents of patients with cystic fibrosis), the prevalence of chronic pancreatitis is only slightly increased [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hereditary-pancreatitis/abstract/40,41,45\" class=\"abstract_t\">40,41,45</a>]. Together, these observations suggest that pancreatitis develops among <em>CFTR</em> mutation carriers primarily in the presence of additional genetic or environmental disease modifiers. Thus, testing is more useful in determining the etiology of early pancreatitis than for predicting pancreatitis in an asymptomatic person. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4975285\"><span class=\"h2\">CTRC</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Mutations in the chymotrypsin C gene (<em>CTRC</em>) confer a moderate risk for chronic pancreatitis, usually in conjunction with other heterogeneous pancreatitis susceptibility variants, such as <em>CFTR</em> or <em>SPINK1 </em>[<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hereditary-pancreatitis/abstract/8,46-49\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,46-49</a>]. Chymotrypsin C is a digestive enzyme that cooperates with active trypsin in solutions with lower calcium concentrations to degrade trypsin [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hereditary-pancreatitis/abstract/50\" class=\"abstract_t\">50</a>]. Thus, it is an intrapancreatic antitrypsin protective mechanism that complements <em>SPINK1</em>. Several rare mutations in <em>CTRC</em> have been linked with chronic pancreatitis in children, while the common G60G variant is associated with chronic pancreatitis in adults, especially smokers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hereditary-pancreatitis/abstract/48\" class=\"abstract_t\">48</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2377612830\"><span class=\"h2\">Additional genes associated with recurrent acute and chronic pancreatitis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Two genes have been reported that are associated with chronic alcoholic pancreatitis and pediatric idiopathic chronic pancreatitis, respectively. These are important because the mechanism is not dependent on trypsin activation, and because they are either common modifier genes, or confer very high risk.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>CLDN2 &mdash; The most important are the high-risk haplotype at the claudin-2 (<em>CLDN2</em>) locus associated with chronic pancreatitis, especially in patients with an alcohol etiology [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hereditary-pancreatitis/abstract/51-53\" class=\"abstract_t\">51-53</a>]. The high-risk locus is on the X chromosome, with the haplotype-defining variant, rs12688220 C, in 26 percent of control alleles. Since men are hemizygous for the X chromosome, the risk appears dominant, whereas it is inherited as a recessive trait in women. If 16 percent of men and 10 percent of woman are at-risk alcohol drinkers it suggests that 4 percent of men (0.16 x 0.26) are at high risk of alcoholic chronic pancreatitis, as compared with 0.7 percent of women (0.10 x 0.26 x 0.26). </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>CPA1 &mdash; Carboxypeptidase A1 (CPA1) is a pancreatic digestive enzyme that is second in abundance in pancreatic juice after trypsinogen. Mutations in the <em>CPA1</em> gene are linked to nonalcoholic chronic pancreatitis, especially with early age of onset [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hereditary-pancreatitis/abstract/54\" class=\"abstract_t\">54</a>]. Risk of chronic pancreatitis is unrelated to trypsin activation or failed inhibition. In a study involving 944 cases and 3.938 controls in Germany, investigators performed standard DNA sequencing of all ten <em>CPA1</em> exons, and identified 35 novel or rare mutations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hereditary-pancreatitis/abstract/54\" class=\"abstract_t\">54</a>].&nbsp;Functional studies showed that many of the variants had less than 20 percent of expected activity and were not secreted from experimental cells. This suggests that the mutated peptides were misfolding, causing stress inside of the endoplasmic reticulum. The low-activity mutants were found in 3.1 percent of cases compared with 0.1 percent of controls (OR = 25). The finding was replicated in three other groups, and found to be especially prevalent in children with idiopathic chronic pancreatitis.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2377612838\"><span class=\"h2\">Genetic variants conferring protection from pancreatitis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There are two genetic variants that protect people from pancreatitis. The first is the PRSS2 G191R mutation. This introduces a trypsin cut site into anionic trypsin so that overall activity is reduced. This may be present in up to 3 percent of some populations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hereditary-pancreatitis/abstract/20,55\" class=\"abstract_t\">20,55</a>]. Second, a protective haplotype at the <em>PRSS1-PRSS2</em> locus was found that is present in about 42 percent of controls, but only 38 percent of cases with pancreatitis, suggesting that risk was reduced by up to 40 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hereditary-pancreatitis/abstract/27,51\" class=\"abstract_t\">27,51</a>]. &#160;</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL PRESENTATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients with autosomal dominant hereditary pancreatitis present clinically with recurrent acute pancreatitis in childhood or early adolescence, chronic pancreatitis in late adolescence or early adulthood, and an increased risk for pancreatic cancer beginning in the fifth decade of life.</p><p>The clinical presentation of patients with hereditary pancreatitis, familial pancreatitis, and sporadic pancreatitis with a strong genetic etiology (simplex case) can begin with episodes of acute pancreatitis, or with chronic pancreatitis.

A number of other variants have been reported, but their functional significance is unknown. In addition, <em>PRSS1</em> copy number variants are associated with autosomal dominant hereditary pancreatitis. Because these are gain-of-function mutations, a heterozygote genotype indicates marked increased risk for disease (60 to 80 percent penetrance).

Interpretation of results must be done in the context of clinical setting. Patients with two severe <em>CFTR</em> mutations, or a severe and mild-variable <em>CFTR</em> mutation, should be referred to a cystic fibrosis center for formal testing because management requires a structured, multidisciplinary approach. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><em>SPINK1</em> mutations are believed to limit the inflammation-associated feedback inhibition of intrapancreatic trypsin activity. Heterozygous <em>SPINK1</em> mutations are benign, unless there is a problem causing recurrent intrapancreatic trypsin activation. Homozygote or compound heterozygote <em>SPINK1</em> mutations cause sufficient loss of trypsin inhibiting function to explain the etiology of recurrent pancreatitis. Heterozygous <em>SPINK1</em> mutations typically cause pancreatitis only if they are associated with another predisposing factor, such as mutations in <em>CFTR</em>, calcium sensing receptor (<em>CaSR</em>), or chymotrypsinogen C (<em>CTRC</em>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hereditary-pancreatitis/abstract/68\" class=\"abstract_t\">68</a>]. Patients with <em>SPINK1</em> mutations typically have a more severe clinical course.

A positive test result confers approximately 80 percent risk of developing pancreatitis.

There is no known quantity of alcohol that is safe for patients with hereditary pancreatitis, so patients are typically counseled to abstain from consuming any alcoholic beverages. In addition, smoking increases the risk of pancreatic cancer [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hereditary-pancreatitis/abstract/62\" class=\"abstract_t\">62</a>]. Thus, patients with hereditary pancreatitis, members of affected families, and individuals in whom a specific <em>PRSS1</em> mutation has been identified should be counseled to avoid these triggers.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h2\">Antioxidants and analgesics</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>One two-year crossover study of antioxidants and analgesics in three children from the same Italian hereditary pancreatitis family suggested significant improvement in pain with the antioxidants [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hereditary-pancreatitis/abstract/71\" class=\"abstract_t\">71</a>]. We have observed similar improvement in a subset of patients with non-alcoholic pancreatitis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hereditary-pancreatitis/abstract/72\" class=\"abstract_t\">72</a>], although the components, dose, and frequency have not been standardized.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4975358\"><span class=\"h2\">Pancreatic surgery</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A small study from Austria reported the outcomes of 12 pediatric patients aged 4 to 15 years with hereditary pancreatitis who were managed with a step-up approach of endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatogram (ERCP), followed by surgery when necessary [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hereditary-pancreatitis/abstract/73\" class=\"abstract_t\">73</a>]. The etiology included no mutations, <em>SPINK1</em>, <em>CFTR</em> and <em>PRSS1</em> variants. Patients underwent early ERCP for management of pain. Obstructive etiologies were identified in 10 patients, and 8 patients were successfully treated endoscopically, with both pain control and elimination of recurrent acute pancreatitis. Two patients underwent surgery because of technical failure of the ERCP. Overall, good pain control was achieved using the step-up approach. While this is a very small and highly heterogenous group for a clinical study, this report suggests that endoscopic therapy may play an important role in selected patients with hereditary pancreatitis caused by obstructions. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h2\">Pancreatectomy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There is a more current debate over the use of pancreatectomy or pancreatectomy with islet autotransplantation for selected patients with hereditary pancreatitis. The procedure is irreversible, and associated with multiple risks and has not been proven to protect islet cells and delay development of diabetes. Furthermore, the risk of cancer occurs late in life; the published risk may be higher than real risk because of selection bias. Finally, new treatments are being evaluated that may further reduce risk of pancreatitis and pancreatic cancer. Enthusiasm for doing this procedure should therefore be tempered with caution. Two conferences were held to debate the role of total pancreatectomy with islet autotransplantation in management of disabling recurrent acute pancreatitis or painful chronic pancreatitis, and these produced recommendations for follow-up of these patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hereditary-pancreatitis/abstract/74,75\" class=\"abstract_t\">74,75</a>]. </p><p>In younger patients who have functional islet cells, pancreatectomy with islet autotransplantation is believed by many to preserve islet function and can relieve intractable, narcotic-dependent pancreatic pain [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hereditary-pancreatitis/abstract/76,77\" class=\"abstract_t\">76,77</a>]. Outcomes based on case series show moderate levels of success. As an example, in a series of 75 children undergoing this procedure, 90 percent experienced sustained improvement in pancreatic pain and almost all of these patients were successfully weaned from narcotics [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hereditary-pancreatitis/abstract/78\" class=\"abstract_t\">78</a>]. Insulin independence was achieved in 41 percent of patients (31 of 75 subjects). Insulin independence was typically achieved during the first 12 months after the transplant procedure and was sustained for at least three years in most (28 of 31 subjects). Factors predicting insulin independence included younger age (&lt;12 years), male sex, and the number of islets transplanted. In a small series of younger children (ages three to eight years), outcomes were somewhat better, with 82 percent achieving insulin independence with median follow up 2.2 years, and all patients experiencing pain relief [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hereditary-pancreatitis/abstract/79\" class=\"abstract_t\">79</a>]. These outcomes are generally better than in series of adults undergoing the same procedure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hereditary-pancreatitis/abstract/76,77\" class=\"abstract_t\">76,77</a>]. </p><p>Based on these results, we offer islet autotransplantation for younger patients with chronic pancreatitis. The typical candidate is a child with an established genetic cause for chronic pancreatitis (<em>PRSS1</em> or <em>SPINK1</em> mutation), severe pain leading to narcotic dependence, and residual islet cell function. The optimal timing for this procedure requires consideration of the disability of the patient from pancreatitis, the exclusion of treatable etiologies, prognosis, and islet cell mass. Earlier surgery may provide more islets and diminish months of suffering, but as noted above, the procedure is also irreversible, is associated with uncommon but serious risk, and commits the patient to a lifetime of full-dose pancreatic enzyme replacement therapy. Furthermore, the long-term survival of islets and consequences of islets in the liver are not fully defined, and the clock begins as soon as the procedure is performed.</p><p>Older patients with long-standing chronic pancreatitis (eg, those who have had chronic pancreatitis for 20 years or more) are occasionally candidates for total pancreatectomy to treat pain or reduce the risk of developing pancreatic cancer. Screening for pancreatic cancer in these high-risk patients can be particularly difficult because the pancreas is scarred and disfigured [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hereditary-pancreatitis/abstract/63\" class=\"abstract_t\">63</a>]. Islet autotransplantation is not done in patients with long-standing chronic pancreatitis in some centers because of precancerous lesions and potential cancers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hereditary-pancreatitis/abstract/80\" class=\"abstract_t\">80</a>], and there is concern that these malignant cells may be reinfused with the islets. Furthermore, the potential benefit of islet autotransplantation is limited if the patient has marked fibrosis or is already diabetic. However, other centers have performed islet autotransplantation on these patients, and no cases of pancreatic cancer development have yet been reported [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hereditary-pancreatitis/abstract/81\" class=\"abstract_t\">81</a>]. </p><p>A patient's level of concern about pancreatic cancer varies substantially. A high level of patient concern may outweigh the risk and expense of performing a total pancreatectomy. Thus, the decision as to whether or not to perform total pancreatectomy in these older patients should be individualized, depending on the patient's values and preferences, and particularly their level of concern about pancreatic cancer.

Pancreatectomy can markedly improve the quality of life in selected patients, but the procedure is irreversible, is associated with significant perioperative risk, has uncertain long-term consequences related to islet cell function in the liver, and results in complete pancreatic exocrine insufficiency that requires lifelong, full-dose pancreatic enzyme replacement therapy. (See <a href=\"#H11\" class=\"local\">'Pancreatectomy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Hereditary pancreatitis is associated with a significant increased risk of pancreatic cancer. The cumulative risk of developing pancreatic cancer within 70 years appears to be between 19 and 40 percent (with high confidence intervals), but this statistic includes patients with other risk factors for pancreatic cancer, including smoking, diabetes, and a family history of cancer. Smokers from pancreatic cancer-prone families develop cancer on average a decade earlier than non-smokers. Patients who do not smoke and have not developed diabetes likely have less than a 20 percent chance of developing pancreatic cancer. Consensus panels have recommended screening for pancreatic cancer in individuals with hereditary pancreatitis, but there is no consensus as to the optimal age to start screening. (See <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Pancreatic cancer'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In older patients with longstanding inflammation and diabetes mellitus, pancreatectomy with or without islet autotransplantation should be considered if the patient has a high level of concern about pancreatic cancer.
