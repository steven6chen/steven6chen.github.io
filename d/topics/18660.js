This precedes a primary viremia that signals the onset of illness and subsequent seeding of other organs. Except for neonatal HSV infection, most viruses reach the CNS during a second viremia that follows viral replication in other organs, particularly the liver and spleen [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/viral-meningitis-epidemiology-pathogenesis-and-etiology-in-children/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].</p><p>The mechanisms involved in viral transport from the circulation to the brain are not clearly understood.

Nonpolio-EV serotypes cycle from year to year; however, certain serotypes have remained prevalent. Coxsackieviruses A9, B5, and B1 and echoviruses 6, 9, 13, 18, and 30 were the most common serotypes isolated in the United States from 2000 to 2005 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/viral-meningitis-epidemiology-pathogenesis-and-etiology-in-children/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. Aseptic meningitis in infants under three months of age has been associated mainly with group B coxsackieviruses and parechoviruses [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/viral-meningitis-epidemiology-pathogenesis-and-etiology-in-children/abstract/5-7\" class=\"abstract_t\">5-7</a>].

It has been responsible for major outbreaks in Asia and sporadic cases in the United States and Europe [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/viral-meningitis-epidemiology-pathogenesis-and-etiology-in-children/abstract/8-12\" class=\"abstract_t\">8-12</a>].

More common clinical presentations in susceptible individuals are asymptomatic infections, minor illness or abortive poliomyelitis, and aseptic meningitis or nonparalytic poliomyelitis. With successful vaccine eradication campaigns, polioviruses are no longer recovered from patients with aseptic meningitis in developed countries, and only rarely in developing countries where poliomyelitis still occurs. Vaccine strains from the oral polio vaccine have rarely been recovered from the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of patients with aseptic meningitis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/viral-meningitis-epidemiology-pathogenesis-and-etiology-in-children/abstract/13-15\" class=\"abstract_t\">13-15</a>].

A few members of the EV can be acquired by inhalation of infected droplets. Transplacental transmission resulting in stillbirth, abortion, or neonatal infection has been described with many different EV, including polioviruses, coxsackieviruses, and EV 71 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/viral-meningitis-epidemiology-pathogenesis-and-etiology-in-children/abstract/16,17\" class=\"abstract_t\">16,17</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Seasonality, risk factors, and incubation &ndash; In temperate climates, most EV infections occur in outbreaks during the warmest months; however, sporadic cases can develop throughout the year.

In tropical and subtropical regions, the incidence of EV infections remains stable throughout the year. Individual host factors, such as immunodeficiency and age, can predispose to more severe nonpolio EV infections. Furthermore, children with a deficient humoral immunodeficiency, especially X-linked agammaglobulinemia, are at risk for developing chronic meningoencephalitis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/viral-meningitis-epidemiology-pathogenesis-and-etiology-in-children/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. The incubation period for EV infection is approximately three to six days.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pathogenesis &ndash; The pathogenesis of EV infections has been extensively studied; however, many questions remain unsolved [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/viral-meningitis-epidemiology-pathogenesis-and-etiology-in-children/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. Following exposure, viral particles bind to specific receptors on enterocytes and traverse the intestinal lining cells to reach the Peyer's patches in the lamina propia, where they replicate [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/viral-meningitis-epidemiology-pathogenesis-and-etiology-in-children/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. Few viral particles may replicate in the nasopharynx with subsequent spread to the respiratory tract lymphatics. An initial viremia spreads the virus to other organs, such as liver, spleen, and heart where further replication occurs generating a second major viremia that is associated with signs and symptoms of infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/viral-meningitis-epidemiology-pathogenesis-and-etiology-in-children/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. Seeding of the central nervous system (CNS) can occur during the first or second viremia; however, the mechanisms by which the virus enters the CNS remain unknown [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/viral-meningitis-epidemiology-pathogenesis-and-etiology-in-children/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. An alternative path involving neural spread has been proposed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/viral-meningitis-epidemiology-pathogenesis-and-etiology-in-children/abstract/19,20\" class=\"abstract_t\">19,20</a>]. The molecular determinants of neurotropism and neurovirulence have been extensively studied for polioviruses and are now under investigation for nonpolio EVs. Genomic differences among EV serotypes might explain the tendency of some strains to cause aseptic meningitis and encephalitis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/viral-meningitis-epidemiology-pathogenesis-and-etiology-in-children/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Human parechoviruses</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span><em>Parechovirus</em> is a genus of the Picornaviridae virus family.

(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=arthropod-borne-encephalitides\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Arthropod-borne encephalitides&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Arboviruses have a worldwide distribution, with a highest incidence in tropical and developing regions. In the United States, arboviruses constitute most of the cases of aseptic meningitis that are not due to EV [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/viral-meningitis-epidemiology-pathogenesis-and-etiology-in-children/abstract/70,71\" class=\"abstract_t\">70,71</a>].

(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=arthropod-borne-encephalitides\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Arthropod-borne encephalitides&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Most arboviruses are maintained in nature in a cycle involving a nonhuman primary vertebrate host and a primary arthropod vector that determine their geographic and seasonal distribution [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/viral-meningitis-epidemiology-pathogenesis-and-etiology-in-children/abstract/72\" class=\"abstract_t\">72</a>]. Human infections are seen most frequently at the peak of mosquito and tick activity during summer and fall, or sporadically when the virus is brought into the peridomestic environment by a bridge vector [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/viral-meningitis-epidemiology-pathogenesis-and-etiology-in-children/abstract/72\" class=\"abstract_t\">72</a>].

St. Louis encephalitis (SLE) virus is the most common arboviral infection causing aseptic meningitis, and aseptic meningitis accounts for 15 percent of all symptomatic cases of SLE virus infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/viral-meningitis-epidemiology-pathogenesis-and-etiology-in-children/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>].

WNV persists in nature as part of an enzoonotic cycle among wild birds, the primary reservoir, and Culex spp., the main mosquito vector.
