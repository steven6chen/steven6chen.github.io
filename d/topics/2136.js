In the past, blunt carotid injury was associated with mortality rates ranging from 23 to 28 percent, with 48 to 58 percent of survivors suffering permanent severe neurologic deficits [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/blunt-cerebrovascular-injury-mechanisms-screening-and-diagnostic-evaluation/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. </p><p>The overall incidence is low in patients sustaining blunt trauma. Clinical studies in the early 1990s suggested that these injuries were being under-diagnosed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/blunt-cerebrovascular-injury-mechanisms-screening-and-diagnostic-evaluation/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Increased recognition through screening (arteriography, computed tomographic angiography) based upon specific clinical criteria has increased the reported incidence to approximately 1 percent in patients with blunt trauma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/blunt-cerebrovascular-injury-mechanisms-screening-and-diagnostic-evaluation/abstract/1,3-5\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,3-5</a>].

The circle of Willis connects the anterior and posterior circulations, but is completely intact and symmetric in only approximately 20 percent of individuals [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/blunt-cerebrovascular-injury-mechanisms-screening-and-diagnostic-evaluation/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. The anatomic variability of the collateral circulation helps explain the clinical presentations of patients with cerebrovascular injuries, and underscores the need for complete imaging of cerebral circulation when injury is suspected.

Injury to the vessels of the anterior circulation can lead to ischemic or hemorrhagic hemispheric stroke.

The CCA divides into the internal carotid artery (ICA) and external carotid artery (ECA) at the level of the superior border of the thyroid cartilage corresponding to the disc space between the third and fourth cervical vertebral bodies <span class=\"nowrap\">(C3/C4)</span>.</p><p>The external carotid artery (ECA) has multiple branches which supply the face and scalp (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F50495\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef50495 \">figure 2</a>) and provide collateral circulation to the brain. Traumatic injuries to the ECA are usually tolerated neurologically with the occasional exception of patients with pre-existing cerebrovascular disease. When the ICAs or vertebral arteries (VA) have significant stenoses or occlusion, the ECA branches may provide critical collateral pathways for cerebral blood flow (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F82579\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef82579 \">figure 3</a>). </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2918748\"><span class=\"h3\">Internal carotid artery segments</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The ICA (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F63286\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef63286 \">figure 4</a>) is divided into four segments based upon anatomic landmarks.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Cervical &ndash; The cervical portion usually has no named branches as it ascends anterior to the spine.

Fracture of the sphenoid bone may injure the cavernous portion. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Cerebral<strong> </strong>&ndash; The ICA perforates the dura mater at the anterior clinoid process to become the cerebral (or supraclinoid) segment which divides into the anterior and middle cerebral arteries [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/blunt-cerebrovascular-injury-mechanisms-screening-and-diagnostic-evaluation/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3979568\"><span class=\"h2\">Posterior circulation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The posterior circulation supplies the midbrain, cerebellum, occipital lobe and medial temporal lobes. Injuries to the vessels that supply these regions can lead to a variety of syndromes depending upon the specific nature of the injury (See <a href=\"#H3979590\" class=\"local\">'Clinical presentation'</a> below and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=etiology-classification-and-epidemiology-of-stroke\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Etiology, classification, and epidemiology of stroke&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=posterior-circulation-cerebrovascular-syndromes\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Posterior circulation cerebrovascular syndromes&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The VAs most commonly originate from the subclavian arteries, although some variation can occur. The VAs originate directly from the aortic arch in 3 to 5 percent of individuals [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/blunt-cerebrovascular-injury-mechanisms-screening-and-diagnostic-evaluation/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. The VAs are commonly asymmetric in diameter and it is not uncommon for one VA to be atretic, a finding that is slightly more common on the left than the right [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/blunt-cerebrovascular-injury-mechanisms-screening-and-diagnostic-evaluation/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. </p><p>The VA traverses the neck anterior to the scalene muscle, enters the vertebral foramina of the sixth cervical vertebra and exits the transverse foramina of the second cervical vertebra. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2918703\"><span class=\"h3\">Vertebral segments</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The VA is divided into four anatomic segments (V1-V4) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F56466\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef56466 \">figure 5</a>). </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>V1 &ndash; Origin of the vessel to the foramina of the sixth cervical (C6) transverse process. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>V2 &ndash; Intraforaminal segment from the sixth to the second cervical vertebral body (C6 to C2). </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>V3 &ndash; From the second cervical (C2) foramina to the base of the skull.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>V4 &ndash; Intracerebral segment of the vertebral artery.

Carotid injuries appear to occur more frequently than vertebral injuries. In a retrospective review of 171 patients found to have blunt cerebrovascular injury, 114 patients had 157 carotid artery injuries and 79 patients had 97 vertebral artery injuries [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/blunt-cerebrovascular-injury-mechanisms-screening-and-diagnostic-evaluation/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. However, some studies have shown equal number or a preponderance of vertebral injuries [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/blunt-cerebrovascular-injury-mechanisms-screening-and-diagnostic-evaluation/abstract/10,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,11</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H219286045\"><span class=\"h1\">MECHANISMS OF INJURY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A variety of trauma mechanisms including motor vehicle crashes, falls, assaults, and suicide attempts can result in blunt cerebrovascular injury. Motor vehicle crashes account for more than half of blunt cerebrovascular injuries [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/blunt-cerebrovascular-injury-mechanisms-screening-and-diagnostic-evaluation/abstract/2,3,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,3,9</a>]. The absence of trauma from an individual's history does not exclude trauma as an etiology, because patients often consider the inciting event to be insignificant or too embarrassing to tell their physician.</p><p>Blunt injury to the carotid or vertebral arteries is usually the result of a significant force that twists or stretches the vessel, or impinges the vessel against the underlying bone, often for only a brief period of time. The carotid or vertebral artery may also be lacerated by bone that has fractured. </p><p>Four fundamental mechanisms of blunt carotid injuries are described [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/blunt-cerebrovascular-injury-mechanisms-screening-and-diagnostic-evaluation/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]: </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Type I carotid injuries involve the direct application of force to the neck (eg, seatbelt, strangulation, near-hanging) and account for up to approximately 10 percent of blunt carotid injuries.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Type II carotid injuries are due to hyperextension and contralateral rotation of the head and neck (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F56047\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef56047 \">figure 6</a>). This is probably the most common mechanism of injury. The lateral articular processes and pedicles of the upper three cervical vertebrae (C1-C3) project more anteriorly than those of the lower four cervical (C4-C7) vertebrae. Thus, in the upper region, the cervical internal carotid artery (ICA) can be stretched across the lateral processes with cervical hyperextension. Rotation at the atlanto-axial joint aggravates stretch injury because it can cause anterior movement of the contralateral C1 transverse process [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/blunt-cerebrovascular-injury-mechanisms-screening-and-diagnostic-evaluation/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Type III carotid injuries involve intraoral trauma that affect the internal carotid artery at the angle of the jaw (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F56047\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef56047 \">figure 6</a>). This type of injury is seen in patients who fall with a hard object in the mouth such as in children who have fallen with a toothbrush in their mouth [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/blunt-cerebrovascular-injury-mechanisms-screening-and-diagnostic-evaluation/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Type IV injuries are due to laceration of the carotid artery resulting from basilar skull fracture, most commonly in the region of the carotid canal [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/blunt-cerebrovascular-injury-mechanisms-screening-and-diagnostic-evaluation/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. </p><p/><p>Regardless of the underlying mechanism of injury, the pathologic insult in most cases is an intimal tear. The exposed subendothelial collagen promotes platelet aggregation and thrombus formation, which may occlude the vessel altogether or embolize to the cerebral circulation.</p><p>The intimal tear may remain static or there may be a subintimal dissection that progresses cranially, which can cause luminal narrowing or acute vessel occlusion as the false lumen collapses against the true lumen. Less commonly, partial or complete transection of the artery occurs, resulting in pseudoaneurysm formation or free rupture. A pseudoaneurysm may increase in size to compress and occlude the vessel lumen, or rupture; if it contains thrombus, it may be a source of platelet thromboembolism. Rupture may result in intracranial or extracranial hemorrhage, or formation of an arteriovenous fistula.</p><p>Other cerebrovascular injury mechanisms have been reported. As an example, numerous case reports document blunt injuries (mostly dissection) following mechanisms that would not typically raise a suspicion for injury, so-called &quot;trivial trauma.&quot; These mechanisms include chiropractic manipulation, hyperflexion or hyperextension during hair washing, &quot;head banging&quot; to music, &quot;bottoms-up&quot; drinking, rapid head turning, virtually any athletic endeavor, and everyday activities such as coughing, shaving, vomiting, and nose-blowing [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/blunt-cerebrovascular-injury-mechanisms-screening-and-diagnostic-evaluation/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. </p><p>&quot;Spontaneous&quot; carotid and vertebral artery dissections occur in the absence of apparent etiologic factors and account for approximately 2 to 3 percent of primary strokes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/blunt-cerebrovascular-injury-mechanisms-screening-and-diagnostic-evaluation/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. Risk factors include hypertension, Marfan syndrome, fibromuscular dysplasia, syphilis, arteriopathies, and Erdheim's cystic medial necrosis. Some speculate that the presence of these medical risk factors (whether or not their presence is known) predisposes these patients to cerebrovascular injury following lesser degrees of trauma. Spontaneous carotid and vertebral artery dissections are discussed separately.

The initial resuscitation and evaluation of the patient with blunt trauma is discussed elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=initial-evaluation-and-management-of-blunt-abdominal-trauma-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Initial evaluation and management of blunt abdominal trauma in adults&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=initial-evaluation-and-management-of-blunt-thoracic-trauma-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Initial evaluation and management of blunt thoracic trauma in adults&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=initial-evaluation-and-management-of-facial-trauma-in-adults#H25\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Initial evaluation and management of facial trauma in adults&quot;, section on 'Midface'</a>.)</p><p>Delayed recognition of blunt cerebrovascular injury may result from the need for clinicians to manage life-threatening thoracic or abdominal injuries. In some cases, a meaningful neurologic examination is not possible due to head injuries or the need to sedate or intubate the patient. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H219286132\"><span class=\"h2\">Associated injuries</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Blunt cerebrovascular injury is associated with mechanisms that can cause severe head, facial, spine, chest, and abdominal injuries [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/blunt-cerebrovascular-injury-mechanisms-screening-and-diagnostic-evaluation/abstract/7,17\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,17</a>]. In a review of 171 patients with blunt cerebrovascular injury, the average injury severity score was 28&plusmn;1, which is consistent with other reports. Associated injuries included the brain (57 percent), spine (44 percent), chest (43 percent), and face (34 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/blunt-cerebrovascular-injury-mechanisms-screening-and-diagnostic-evaluation/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].

Mandibular and LeFort fractures were the most common isolated craniomaxillofacial injury associated with blunt cerebrovascular injury. </p><p>Cervical spine fracture has the strongest association with blunt cerebrovascular injury [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/blunt-cerebrovascular-injury-mechanisms-screening-and-diagnostic-evaluation/abstract/18-20\" class=\"abstract_t\">18-20</a>]. A systematic review and meta-analysis identified only cervical spine injury and thoracic injury as significantly increasing the risk for blunt cerebrovascular injury (odds ratio [OR] 5.45, 95% CI 2.24-13.27, OR 1.98, 95% CI 1.35-2.92, respectively) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/blunt-cerebrovascular-injury-mechanisms-screening-and-diagnostic-evaluation/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. In a review from the American College of Surgeons trauma registry, predictors of vertebral artery injury on multivariable analysis of the 253 patients (21 percent) who underwent screening included fracture displacement into the transverse foramen of one or more millimeters (odds ratio [OR] 3.29, 95% CI 1.15-9.41) and basilar skull fracture (OR 4.25, 95% CI 1.3-14.47) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/blunt-cerebrovascular-injury-mechanisms-screening-and-diagnostic-evaluation/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. </p><p>Vertebral artery injuries are associated with cervical spine injuries at all levels [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/blunt-cerebrovascular-injury-mechanisms-screening-and-diagnostic-evaluation/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. The risk of vertebral artery injury may be higher for cervical spine fractures of the upper three vertebral bodies as well as dislocations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/blunt-cerebrovascular-injury-mechanisms-screening-and-diagnostic-evaluation/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>].

In a review that stratified cervical spine fractures as high-risk (C1-C3) or low-risk (isolated, low [C4-C7]) for blunt cerebrovascular injury, the incidence of blunt cerebrovascular injury was 8 and 2 percent, respectively, suggesting the need to screen all cervical spine injuries [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/blunt-cerebrovascular-injury-mechanisms-screening-and-diagnostic-evaluation/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>].

A latent period between the time of injury and the appearance of clinical manifestations is typically seen. Unless the vessel immediately occludes, time is required for thrombus formation that might limit flow or lead to distal embolization. In various studies, 25 to 50 percent of patients first developed signs or symptoms of blunt carotid injury more than 12 hours after the traumatic event [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/blunt-cerebrovascular-injury-mechanisms-screening-and-diagnostic-evaluation/abstract/2,4,26-28\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,4,26-28</a>].</p><p>The following observations have been made in studies in which screening for cerebrovascular injury was performed in patients with blunt trauma:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In 17 patients diagnosed with blunt cerebrovascular injury identified from 3480 blunt trauma admissions, 10 deaths were attributable to the injury [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/blunt-cerebrovascular-injury-mechanisms-screening-and-diagnostic-evaluation/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].

Moreover, treatment with systemic anticoagulation in acutely injured patients based upon positive screening findings was thought to be heretical. Screening has clearly increased the number of blunt cerebrovascular injuries being diagnosed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/blunt-cerebrovascular-injury-mechanisms-screening-and-diagnostic-evaluation/abstract/3,5,10,32,36-38\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,5,10,32,36-38</a>]. In the earliest study of screening, 171 patients with indications to exclude thoracic aortic injury using arteriography also underwent carotid arteriography. Although these patients had no symptoms or signs to suggest blunt cerebrovascular injury, 3.5 percent of the studies were positive [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/blunt-cerebrovascular-injury-mechanisms-screening-and-diagnostic-evaluation/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>]. Subsequently, using defined clinical criteria, blunt cerebrovascular injury was identified in 27 percent of the asymptomatic patients screened [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/blunt-cerebrovascular-injury-mechanisms-screening-and-diagnostic-evaluation/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. After instituting a policy of screening, the incidence of blunt carotid injury increased from 0.1 to 1.6 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/blunt-cerebrovascular-injury-mechanisms-screening-and-diagnostic-evaluation/abstract/1,3\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,3</a>]. In separate review of 8292 patients screened for blunt cerebrovascular injury, 47 (0.5 percent) had blunt vertebral artery injury [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/blunt-cerebrovascular-injury-mechanisms-screening-and-diagnostic-evaluation/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>]. These findings have been replicated at several other trauma centers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/blunt-cerebrovascular-injury-mechanisms-screening-and-diagnostic-evaluation/abstract/5,10,32,34,36,37\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,10,32,34,36,37</a>]. </p><p>Some investigators have suggested that blunt cerebrovascular injury cannot be reliably predicted based upon the injury mechanism and clinical presentation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/blunt-cerebrovascular-injury-mechanisms-screening-and-diagnostic-evaluation/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>]. However, others have critically evaluated specific injury mechanisms, patterns of injury, and clinical symptoms and signs of blunt cerebrovascular injury to define criteria by which to perform diagnostic testing. A multivariate analysis identified independent risk factors for blunt carotid injury (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F78174\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef78174 \">algorithm 1</a>) that included Glasgow coma scale (GCS) &lt;6 (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F81854\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef81854 \">table 1</a>), petrous bone fracture, diffuse axonal brain injury, and LeFort II or LeFort III fracture (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F55687\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef55687 \">figure 7</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/blunt-cerebrovascular-injury-mechanisms-screening-and-diagnostic-evaluation/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. If one of these high-risk factors was present, the patient had a 41 percent chance of having an injury, whereas if all four factors were present, the likelihood of injury increased to 93 percent. On the other hand, 20 percent of patients who had blunt cerebrovascular injury did not have any of these risk factors. The only independent predictor of blunt vertebral artery injury was cervical spine fracture. (See <a href=\"#H4011653\" class=\"local\">'Indications for imaging'</a> below.)</p><p>Another retrospective review used the above criteria to screen patients for blunt cerebrovascular injury and included additional criteria to capture specific cervical spine fracture patterns (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F78174\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef78174 \">algorithm 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/blunt-cerebrovascular-injury-mechanisms-screening-and-diagnostic-evaluation/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>]. Of those who met the screening criteria, 244 patients had a blunt cerebrovascular injury for an incidence of 1.5 percent. Carotid and vertebral injuries were seen nearly equally (141 carotid, 124 vertebral). More than one injury was seen in 37 percent of the patients. </p><p>While many trauma centers have embraced screening, the optimal screening criteria continue to be debated [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/blunt-cerebrovascular-injury-mechanisms-screening-and-diagnostic-evaluation/abstract/19,22,23,32,42-44\" class=\"abstract_t\">19,22,23,32,42-44</a>]. More restrictive criteria might yield a higher proportion of positive results, decreased complications related to arteriography, and lower cost, but an increase in the likelihood of missing an injury in an unscreened patient. With the use of noninvasive studies for screening, particularly computed tomography (CT), the criteria used for screening have been broadened [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/blunt-cerebrovascular-injury-mechanisms-screening-and-diagnostic-evaluation/abstract/45\" class=\"abstract_t\">45</a>]. Still, investigators are reporting that 30 to 37 percent of patients with blunt cerebrovascular injuries have none of the reported clinical or radiographic risk factors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/blunt-cerebrovascular-injury-mechanisms-screening-and-diagnostic-evaluation/abstract/38,46\" class=\"abstract_t\">38,46</a>]. It has been suggested that noninvasive screening for blunt cerebrovascular injury be performed in any patient who has sustained a mechanism of injury sufficient to warrant either a CT of the cervical spine or a CT angiography of the chest [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/blunt-cerebrovascular-injury-mechanisms-screening-and-diagnostic-evaluation/abstract/46\" class=\"abstract_t\">46</a>].

In another retrospective review that used defined criteria to perform screening arteriography in 727 of 15,767 patients with blunt trauma (4.6 percent), blunt cerebrovascular injury was identified in 244 (34 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/blunt-cerebrovascular-injury-mechanisms-screening-and-diagnostic-evaluation/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>]. Antithrombotic therapy was initiated in 187 asymptomatic patients with heparin (117), low molecular-weight heparin (11), or antiplatelet agents (59). The following findings were noted:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>One of the treated patients suffered a stroke (0.5 percent).

This is primarily because patients who are candidates for screening often have indications for scanning other regions of the body such as the head, face, cervical spine, chest and abdomen. Another benefit of CT is a reduction in the volume of contrast needed to perform these studies which can be up to half that needed for arch aortography and four-vessel cerebral arteriography.

Whole-body multidetector-row CT has now been adopted in some centers. It offers more rapid imaging, with a single dose of intravenous contrast.

Injuries were identified in 46 patients (20 carotid, 26 vertebral). The sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, negative predictive value, and accuracy of CT angiography were 98, 100, 100, 99, and 99 percent, respectively. The single false positive results occurred in a patient with a grade I vertebral artery injury. Another study screened 372 blunt trauma patients with 16-slice CT angiography identifying 271 normal studies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/blunt-cerebrovascular-injury-mechanisms-screening-and-diagnostic-evaluation/abstract/55\" class=\"abstract_t\">55</a>]. Arteriography was performed on a subset (82 patients) with normal CT angiography and identified 7 missed blunt cerebrovascular injuries. However, on re-review of the CT images, the injuries were evident in six of the seven patients; the seventh patient's abnormality was most likely not traumatic in origin. The inaccuracy of CT angiography appeared to be related, in part, to the radiologists' experience, as all of the missed blunt cerebrovascular injury occurred in the first half of the study period. </p><p>A systematic review pooled the results of eight studies for CT angiography (1-, 4-, 8-, 16-, 32-, and 64-slice scanners) using digital subtraction angiography (DSA) as the standard [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/blunt-cerebrovascular-injury-mechanisms-screening-and-diagnostic-evaluation/abstract/58\" class=\"abstract_t\">58</a>]. The pooled sensitivity and specificity for blunt cerebrovascular injury for CT angiography was 66 percent and 97 percent, respectively. Sensitivities varied with the number of available CT slices, the training of interpreting radiologists, and the diagnostic threshold for judging a study as positive. The sensitivity remained &le;80 percent among studies that used scanners with 16 or more slices and where the CTA was read by neuroradiologists. Although CT angiography may lack sensitivity to rule out blunt cerebrovascular injury, it remains the best screening study to rule in blunt cerebrovascular injury among trauma patients with a high pretest probability of injury (ie, appropriate risk factors) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/blunt-cerebrovascular-injury-mechanisms-screening-and-diagnostic-evaluation/abstract/60\" class=\"abstract_t\">60</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2918853\"><span class=\"h3\">Digital subtraction arteriography</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>CT angiography has largely supplanted four-vessel biplanar cerebral digital subtraction arteriography (DSA), which remains the gold standard for the diagnosis of blunt cerebrovascular injury; however, DSA is necessary when the suspicion remains high in spite of other imaging, or when findings on other imaging are equivocal (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F78174\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef78174 \">algorithm 1</a>).

Although duplex ultrasound can provide indirect evidence of distal injuries (eg, obstructive waveforms proximal to a flow limiting lesion), indirect findings are not reliable when the degree of stenosis is less significant (ie, &lt;60 percent).

A relatively high false positive rate is reported in some series, and thus, follow-up arteriography may be warranted to definitively exclude an injury, or provide a diagnosis when a high clinical suspicion remains but the CT study is normal. (See <a href=\"#H19564062\" class=\"local\">'CT angiography'</a> above.)</p><p>As discussed above, the sensitivity for CT angiography for blunt cerebrovascular injury depends upon the number of scanner slices. Thus, the evaluation of blunt cerebrovascular injury at a given institution will depend upon the available resources; arteriography should be used if an appropriately sensitive CT scanner is not available. If arteriography and high quality CT scanning are not available, the patient should be transferred to a trauma center for further evaluation. (See <a href=\"#H2918853\" class=\"local\">'Digital subtraction arteriography'</a> above.)</p><p>Duplex ultrasonography may play a role in the long-term follow-up of cervical carotid injuries; however, duplex ultrasound and magnetic resonance imaging are not sufficiently sensitive to be used for screening. (See <a href=\"#H19564076\" class=\"local\">'Duplex ultrasonography'</a> above and <a href=\"#H19564069\" class=\"local\">'MR angiography'</a> above.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H19564083\"><span class=\"h2\">Injury grading</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Grading the injury based upon its appearance on imaging was created to standardize clinical communication and guide therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/blunt-cerebrovascular-injury-mechanisms-screening-and-diagnostic-evaluation/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. The treatment of blunt cerebrovascular also depends, in part, on the grade of injury. Injury grading is discussed in detail elsewhere.

The overall incidence of these injuries is approximately 1 percent of all blunt trauma admissions. (See <a href=\"#H19563948\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The circulation to the brain originates from the carotid and vertebral arteries comprising the anterior and posterior circulations, respectively. The circle of Willis, which provides communication between the anterior and posterior circulation, is completely intact and symmetric in only approximately 20 percent of individuals. Because of the inconsistency, the neurologic presentation of patients with blunt cerebrovascular injury is highly variable. (See <a href=\"#H19563955\" class=\"local\">'Cerebrovascular anatomy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients sustaining blunt trauma who have the following clinical symptoms or signs should undergo <span class=\"nowrap\">urgent/emergent</span> imaging to evaluate for cerebrovascular injury (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F78174\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef78174 \">algorithm 1</a>): </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Potential arterial hemorrhage from the neck, mouth, nose, or ear </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Expanding cervical hematoma </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Cervical bruit in patients &lt;50 years old </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Focal or lateralizing neurologic deficits</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Neurologic deficit inconsistent with head computed tomography (CT) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Stroke on CT or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Presence of major thoracic trauma</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We screen for blunt cerebrovascular injury in asymptomatic patients who have the risk factors for blunt cerebrovascular injury listed below (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F78174\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef78174 \">algorithm 1</a>).
