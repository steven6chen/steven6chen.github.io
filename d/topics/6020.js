Non-resectoscopic endometrial ablation is performed with a device that is inserted into the uterine cavity and delivers energy to uniformly destroy the uterine lining. Non-resectoscopic techniques are also referred to as second generation ablation.</p><p>Resectoscopic endometrial ablation techniques, on the other hand, are performed under hysteroscopic visualization, using resectoscopic instruments to ablate or resect the endometrium. Non-resectoscopic endometrial ablation techniques are more widely practiced than resectoscopic ablation, since they require less specialized training and have a shorter operative time [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endometrial-ablation-non-resectoscopic-techniques/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p>Non-resectoscopic techniques for endometrial ablation will be reviewed here. General principles (eg, indications, contraindications, preoperative and postoperative care) of endometrial ablation, techniques for resectoscopic endometrial ablation or resection, as well as other management options for abnormal uterine bleeding, are discussed separately.

For other techniques, preoperative hysteroscopy is necessary only if the uterine cavity has not been assessed for leiomyomas or endometrial polyps in the preoperative period. Also of note, the manufacturer of the microwave ablation system advises hysteroscopic evaluation before and after ablation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endometrial-ablation-non-resectoscopic-techniques/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p>The endometrial cavity should be assessed preoperatively in all patients undergoing endometrial ablation. Performing this assessment of the uterus during the preoperative evaluation is optimal, since it helps to guide surgical planning (eg, preparing for myomectomy if a submucosal fibroid is present). If the uterine cavity has not been assessed preoperatively, a diagnostic hysteroscopy should be performed just prior to the ablation procedure. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=an-overview-of-endometrial-ablation#H23\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;An overview of endometrial ablation&quot;, section on 'Assessment of the uterus'</a>.)</p><p>Postoperative hysteroscopy is potentially useful to identify areas of remaining endometrium or detect uterine perforation. Some surgeons ablate endometrial remnants using resectoscopic instruments. However, the clinical benefit of hysteroscopy for these indications is uncertain. There are no data regarding whether small amounts of residual endometrium following non-resectoscopic ablation impact treatment success; data suggest that partial resectoscopic ablation is successful [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endometrial-ablation-non-resectoscopic-techniques/abstract/3,4\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,4</a>].

(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=uterine-perforation-during-gynecologic-procedures#H16\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Uterine perforation during gynecologic procedures&quot;, section on 'Diagnosis'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h1\">ABLATION METHODS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>This section will review the energy sources and technical specifications for current non-resectoscopic endometrial ablation devices. Uterine requirements and operative duration for each procedure are listed in the table (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F56492\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef56492 \">table 1</a>).

The NovaSure generator applies up to 180 watts of power. </p><p>The device is inserted into the uterine cavity and the mesh is expanded until it is in contact with the endometrium. Suction is then applied to the endometrial cavity, thereby drawing the endometrium closer to the bipolar mesh probe. The suction also removes debris and vapor that can increase impedance and reduce the depth of energy penetration. The system will shut down when complete desiccation has occurred (calculated at a tissue impedance of 50 ohms of resistance) or after a total treatment time of two minutes. The average treatment time is just over one minute and the average depth of ablation is 4 to 5 millimeters.</p><p>The system also evaluates cavity integrity by emitting carbon dioxide and assessing for leaks. If the integrity check fails, the user will not be able to activate the ablation phase of the procedure.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h3\">Uterine requirements</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Uterine cavity and cervical dilation parameters for NovaSure ablation are [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endometrial-ablation-non-resectoscopic-techniques/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Diameter of device 7.5 mm</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Sounded cavity length &ge;6 to &le;10 cm; alternatively, &ge;4 cm from internal cervical os to fundus</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Cornua to cornua distance &ge;2.5 cm</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Women with submucosal leiomyomas or with endometrial polyps &gt;2 cm were excluded from the FDA approval studies</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>No irregularly shaped cavities</p><p/><p>Intraoperative predictors for failure of radiofrequency endometrial ablation were evaluated in a retrospective cohort study (n = 1178) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endometrial-ablation-non-resectoscopic-techniques/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. Failure was defined as subsequent development of abnormal uterine bleeding, pelvic pain, or dysmenorrhea that necessitated surgical intervention or medical intervention. Predictors for ablation failure were uterine sounding length &gt;10.5 cm (2.6-fold increased risk), uterine cavity length (from fundus to endocervix) &gt;6 cm (2-fold), uterine width &gt;4.5 cm (2-fold), uterine surface area (uterine cavity length multiplied by uterine width) &gt;25 cm<sup>2 </sup>(2-fold), procedure duration &lt;93 seconds (2.6-fold), and radiofrequency ablation index (procedure duration divided by the surface area) (3.1-fold).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h3\">Outcome</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Studies in which women who underwent NovaSure ablation were followed for five or more years reported high rates of reduced uterine bleeding (97 to 98 percent) and amenorrhea (75 to 97 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endometrial-ablation-non-resectoscopic-techniques/abstract/7,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,8</a>].

A prospective series of 65 women with endometrial polyps or fibroids up to 3 cm who underwent bipolar radiofrequency ablation reported, at one-year follow-up, that 95 percent had improvement in uterine bleeding [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endometrial-ablation-non-resectoscopic-techniques/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h2\">Microwave</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Microwave Endometrial Ablation (MEA) is a 9.2 GHz, 30 watt, microwave system (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F82626\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef82626 \">figure 2</a>). When inserted into the uterine cavity, this energy will produce a tissue temperature of 75 to 85&ordm;C at a depth of 6 mm. In order to treat the entire uterine cavity, the surgeon moves the probe from cornu to cornu and across the lower uterine segment until the entire endometrium has reached the desired temperature.

Perioperative complications included a uterine perforation in each treatment group. Excessive intraoperative bleeding occurred in five women in the resection group and none in the MEA group; however, three women treated with MEA were readmitted with secondary hemorrhage. In women followed for 10 or more years, those treated with MEA compared with resection had similar rates of amenorrhea (83 and 88 percent). The rate of repeat ablation was similar in women treated with MEA compared with resection (1 versus 2 percent); however, the hysterectomy rate differed significantly (17 versus 28 percent).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h3\">Advantages/disadvantages</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The labeling from the manufacturer of this device includes the treatment of women with small submucosal leiomyomas (&le;3 cm).

These may serve as barriers for the use of this method for surgeons and patients.</p><p>These requirements were likely added because prior to the introduction of MEA in the United States, there were case reports from Europe in which bowel burns occurred in women with no perforation of the uterus [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endometrial-ablation-non-resectoscopic-techniques/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. The etiology was presumed to be passage of microwave energy through the uterine walls. As a result, the FDA trial required that ultrasound be performed prior to the procedure and that the myometrium be at least 1 cm in thickness in all areas. The potential risk of ablation-associated injury in women with thinning of the myometrium is not limited to microwave ablation.

The balloon is expanded to a pressure of 160 to 220 mmHg with either 5 percent dextrose in water (ThermaChoice), glycine (Cavaterm), or glycerine (Thermablate EAS). For ThermaChoice and Cavaterm, the fluid is heated to approximately 68 to 87&ordm;C and ablation requires 8 to 10 minutes.

In women who underwent hot liquid filled balloon ablation with either ThermaChoice, Cavaterm, or an unspecified device and were followed for four or more years, there was reduced uterine bleeding in 22 to 81 percent and amenorrhea in 23 to 58 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endometrial-ablation-non-resectoscopic-techniques/abstract/16-18\" class=\"abstract_t\">16-18</a>]. Repeat ablation was performed in 5 to 11 percent, and hysterectomy in 2 to 13 percent.</p><p>It is unclear whether these long-term data apply to current versions of the hot liquid filled balloon devices, since two of the devices have been revised (ThermaChoice III and Cavaterm plus) and Thermablate was introduced later than the other devices and follows a different protocol.

The likely mechanism of this is the stimulation of pain fibers by both the heat and uterine distention pressure produced during the procedure. However, with adequate preoperative analgesia (eg, nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs, oral narcotics) and a paracervical block, the procedure can be performed in an office setting in appropriately selected patients.</p><p>ThermaChoice was not evaluated in the FDA approval studies for use in women with intracavitary lesions. However, some data suggest that hot liquid filled balloon ablation is successful in this population. Hot liquid filled balloon ablation was used successfully in 45 women with submucosal fibroids &le;3 cm in a randomized trial comparing balloon versus rollerball ablation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endometrial-ablation-non-resectoscopic-techniques/abstract/22,23\" class=\"abstract_t\">22,23</a>].</p><p>An additional disadvantage is that hot liquid filled balloon techniques cannot be used in women with intracavitary lesions, since ablation occurs only where the balloon is in contact with the endometrium.</p><p>While there is one report of successful use of a liquid balloon in a woman with bicornuate uterus, endometrial ablation in women with uterine anomalies is not standard practice [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endometrial-ablation-non-resectoscopic-techniques/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>].

The probe is cooled either by liquid nitrogen or by differential gas exchange. An elliptical ice ball approximately 3.5 by 5 centimeters forms around the probe when it is cooled to less than -90&ordm;C. At the edge of the ice ball, the tissue temperature is 0&ordm;C, which is nondestructive. A temperature of &ndash;20&ordm;C is lethal to tissue; this temperature is reached approximately 3 to 5 mm from the edge of the ice ball. Therefore, the endometrial tissue exposed to this low temperature, including the basalis layer of the endometrium (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F54487\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef54487 \">figure 5</a>), is permanently destroyed.</p><p>The number of ice balls that must be created to destroy the entire uterine cavity is dependent upon the size of the cavity.

Ideally, this should be performed with enough time to receive the results and cancel the procedure, if neoplasia is found. However, if sampling has not yet been performed by the day of the procedure, it should be done just prior to the ablation. Some clinicians elect to perform a routine dilation and curettage (D&amp;C) at the time of endometrial ablation in addition to the office endometrial sampling. Routine D&amp;C should not be considered necessary in all cases, as this surgery is often performed in the office setting with mild or moderate sedation, which may not be appropriate pain control for D&amp;C. However, it is reasonable to consider a D&amp;C if there is adequate pain control, and if there is concern about the accuracy of the office endometrial sampling, or if there are additional risk factors for endometrial hyperplasia or endometrial cancer, as clearly, there are cases of endometrial ablation in patients with existing endometrial cancer. For example, in a systematic review of endometrial cancer after endometrial ablation, 22 cases of endometrial cancer were found, the time of diagnosis ranging from two weeks to 10 years postoperatively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endometrial-ablation-non-resectoscopic-techniques/abstract/46\" class=\"abstract_t\">46</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H31\"><span class=\"h2\">Operative duration</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A shorter procedure is easier for a patient to tolerate under local anesthesia.
