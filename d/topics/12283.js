Acute lower extremity ischemia is overwhelmingly related to arterial occlusion, though extensive venous occlusion can lead to extremity ischemia as well (ie, phlegmasia), but this is rare. This topic will focus on arterial occlusion. The incidence of acute peripheral arterial occlusion causing acute lower extremity ischemia is approximately 1.5 cases per 10,000 persons per year [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-acute-lower-extremity-ischemia/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. The clinical presentation depends upon the etiology and whether the patient has underlying peripheral artery disease (PAD). Patients who present later than two weeks after the onset of the acute event are considered to have chronic lower extremity ischemia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-acute-lower-extremity-ischemia/abstract/3-5\" class=\"abstract_t\">3-5</a>]. </p><p>The management of acute lower extremity ischemia remains a challenge for vascular specialists. Surgical or catheter-based thromboembolectomy and bypass grafting have been the mainstays of therapy for many years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-acute-lower-extremity-ischemia/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. Subsequently, thrombolytic therapy and percutaneous transluminal angioplasty (PTA) have become treatment options for selected patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-acute-lower-extremity-ischemia/abstract/7,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,8</a>].</p><p>Despite these advances, the morbidity, mortality, and limb loss rates from acute lower extremity ischemia remain high [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-acute-lower-extremity-ischemia/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. Thus, regardless of the treatment modality used, early diagnosis and rapid initiation of therapy are essential to provide the best chance for limb salvage.</p><p>The etiologies, clinical features, and diagnosis of acute lower extremity ischemia will be reviewed here. The management of embolic disease, peripheral artery disease, and other causes of acute limb ischemia (eg, aneurysmal disease) are reviewed separately.

Venous occlusion is discussed briefly below and in separate topic reviews. (See <a href=\"#H2851902660\" class=\"local\">'Phlegmasia'</a> below and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-the-treatment-of-lower-extremity-deep-vein-thrombosis-dvt#H15184017\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of the treatment of lower extremity deep vein thrombosis (DVT)&quot;, section on 'Phlegmasia cerulea dolens'</a>.) </p><p>Acute arterial occlusion is most commonly related to acute thrombosis of a diseased but previously patent, often atherosclerotic artery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-acute-lower-extremity-ischemia/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>] but can also be due to acute thrombosis of a stent or graft, dissection of an artery, direct trauma to an artery, or the result of an embolus from a proximal source lodging into a more distal vessel (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F58846\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef58846 \">table 1</a>). </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3568428049\"><span class=\"h2\">Native arterial thrombosis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Acute thrombosis of a native lower extremity artery is most likely to occur at the site of a preexisting atherosclerotic plaque. Thrombosis can also occur at the location of an aneurysm, or at sites previously affected by dissection. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3336551590\"><span class=\"h3\">Atherosclerotic plaque</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Thrombosis of a previously patent but stenotic artery is a well-known complication of atherosclerosis. Occlusion of atherosclerotic vessels may occur by two mechanisms:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Progressive atherosclerotic narrowing of the artery, with resultant low flow, stasis, and eventual thrombosis</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Intraplaque hemorrhage and local hypercoagulability </p><p/><p>The clinical manifestations of lower extremity ischemia resulting from arterial thrombosis in the face of underlying atherosclerosis are usually less dramatic in onset and less severe compared with those following an acute embolism or vascular thrombosis in individuals without atherosclerosis. This difference is primarily due to the collateral circulation that develops over time in patients with chronically narrowed vessels (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F72956\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef72956 \">figure 1</a>). Collaterals are frequently so extensive that the patient notices no change or only a mild increase in <span class=\"nowrap\">his/her</span> symptoms of chronic ischemia when an atherosclerotic vessel becomes occluded. (See <a href=\"#H29757669\" class=\"local\">'Acute-on-chronic limb ischemia'</a> below.)</p><p>Acute thrombosis of diseased iliac arteries can lead to occlusion of the distal aorta, with retrograde propagation, typically to the level of the renal arteries. In addition to limb ischemia, organ ischemia (gastrointestinal, renal) and paralysis or paresis from spinal cord ischemia can also occur [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-acute-lower-extremity-ischemia/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. Acute aortic occlusion due to saddle embolus can also occur but is much less common in modern case series.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H479432136\"><span class=\"h3\">Aneurysm</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Acute thrombosis of an aneurysm can lead to profound lower extremity ischemia, a clinical scenario that is most commonly associated with popliteal artery aneurysm. Distal embolization can also occur. For other peripheral aneurysm sites, ischemic complications are less common but have been reported. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=popliteal-artery-aneurysm#H1314534\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Popliteal artery aneurysm&quot;, section on 'Acute ischemia'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=femoral-artery-aneurysm#H3568670871\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Femoral artery aneurysm&quot;, section on 'Clinical presentation'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=iliac-artery-aneurysm#H41367779\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Iliac artery aneurysm&quot;, section on 'Aneurysm thrombosis and thromboembolism'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3813423469\"><span class=\"h3\">Dissection</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Acute aortic or peripheral artery (eg, isolated iliac) dissection can result in acute malperfusion of extremities, as well as organs. Leg ischemia caused by acute aortic dissection is a marker of extensive dissection and is associated with greater patient morbidity and mortality. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-acute-aortic-dissection#H9442181\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical features and diagnosis of acute aortic dissection&quot;, section on 'Pulse deficit'</a>.) </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4289605688\"><span class=\"h3\">Thrombophilia</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Thrombosis can also affect a previously normal artery in patients with arteritides, ergotism, and hypercoagulable states, and low flow. Although these conditions most frequently affect the venous circulation, certain hypercoagulable states are associated with arterial thrombosis as well (eg, antiphospholipid antibodies, malignancy, hyperhomocysteinemia, heparin-induced thrombocytopenia). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-of-antiphospholipid-syndrome\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations of antiphospholipid syndrome&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H862988\"><span class=\"h2\">Injury</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3775261820\"><span class=\"h3\">Iatrogenic</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Acute arterial occlusion at the arterial access site (eg, femoral) as a complication of a vascular or cardiac diagnostic or interventional procedure has become a more frequent cause of acute extremity ischemia. The incidence of arterial complications following interventional cardiac catheterization (including hematomas, arteriovenous fistulas, pseudoaneurysms, arterial occlusion, and cholesterol emboli) has been reported to range from 1.5 to 9 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-acute-lower-extremity-ischemia/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. While the use of closure devices has reduced bleeding complications at the arterial access site, the incidence of arterial obstruction may be increased due to device malfunction. Thromboemboli can also develop at the sheath site or catheter tip, with embolization occurring during sheath removal. When access site complications occur following interventional catheterization procedures, immediate surgical consultation is warranted [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-acute-lower-extremity-ischemia/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. Intimal flaps and dissections are frequently the cause of the occlusion, and reintervention or operative repair of the vessel is often required. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=complications-of-diagnostic-cardiac-catheterization\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Complications of diagnostic cardiac catheterization&quot;</a>.) </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1731575722\"><span class=\"h3\">Traumatic</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Arterial injury due to extremity trauma (blunt or penetrating) can also lead to acute lower extremity ischemia from either direct arterial injury or from traumatic arterial dissection with subsequent thrombosis or thromboembolism. This can be especially prevalent in traumatic posterior knee dislocations. The diagnosis and management of arterial injury in association with severe extremity injury is discussed in detail elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=severe-extremity-injury-in-the-adult-patient\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Severe extremity injury in the adult patient&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=knee-tibiofemoral-dislocation-and-reduction\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Knee (tibiofemoral) dislocation and reduction&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H659199735\"><span class=\"h2\">Thrombosis following intervention</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Thrombosis can complicate vascular reconstruction. Immediate failure of a bypass graft can result in acute ischemia, but late thrombosis of an autogenous bypass graft due to progressive intimal hyperplasia (over months), or progressive atherosclerosis (over years), rarely results in acute ischemia. For vein grafts, immediate graft thrombosis is typically related to retained valves or compression or narrowing at the anastomosis, but kinks or twisting of the vein graft can also occur. Prosthetic grafts can thrombose at any site along their length and are often associated with outflow artery thrombosis and more severe ischemia compared with late vein graft thrombosis.</p><p>Acute thrombosis of vascular stents can also lead to acute lower extremity ischemia, which can be a complication of aortic stent-grafts or peripheral arterial stents. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=complications-of-endovascular-abdominal-aortic-repair\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Complications of endovascular abdominal aortic repair&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1835256254\"><span class=\"h2\">Embolism</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3749981443\"><span class=\"h3\">Arterial embolism</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The majority of arterial emboli that travel to the extremities originate in the heart, with the lower extremities affected more frequently than the upper extremities [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-acute-lower-extremity-ischemia/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. Thromboemboli typically lodge where there is an acute narrowing of the artery, such as an atherosclerotic plaque or a vessel branch point. The common femoral, common iliac, and popliteal artery bifurcations are frequent locations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-acute-lower-extremity-ischemia/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. Improvements in anticoagulation therapy and advancements in the treatment of cardiac disease have reduced the proportion of acute limb ischemia events related to arterial embolism. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=embolism-to-the-lower-extremities\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Embolism to the lower extremities&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Potential sources of emboli from the heart include atrial thrombus formation due to atrial fibrillation, left ventricular thrombus formation following myocardial infarction or left ventricular dysfunction, and debris from prosthetic valves and infected cardiac valves (septic emboli). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=left-ventricular-thrombus-after-acute-myocardial-infarction\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Left ventricular thrombus after acute myocardial infarction&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=echocardiography-in-detection-of-cardiac-and-aortic-sources-of-systemic-embolism\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Echocardiography in detection of cardiac and aortic sources of systemic embolism&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Arterial-to-arterial embolization of thrombus or plaque originating from aneurysms or atherosclerotic lesions is well described and accounts for approximately 20 percent of peripheral emboli. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=embolism-from-aortic-plaque-thromboembolism\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Embolism from aortic plaque: Thromboembolism&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-abdominal-aortic-aneurysm#H181175588\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical features and diagnosis of abdominal aortic aneurysm&quot;, section on 'Limb ischemia'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=popliteal-artery-aneurysm#H1314534\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Popliteal artery aneurysm&quot;, section on 'Acute ischemia'</a>.)</p><p>Compared with thromboemboli, atheroemboli are less likely to produce symptoms of acute limb ischemia. Small vessel rather than large vessel occlusion is the usual cause of blue toe syndrome, which is usually due to embolic occlusion of digital arteries with atherothrombotic material from proximal arterial sources [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-acute-lower-extremity-ischemia/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. Blue toe syndrome is characterized by the sudden appearance of a cool, painful, cyanotic toe(s) or forefoot in the often perplexing presence of strong pedal pulses and a warm foot (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F58761\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef58761 \">picture 1</a>). There may also be scattered areas of petechiae or cyanosis of the soles of the feet. Bilateral lower extremity involvement usually indicates an embolic source that is located above the aortic bifurcation. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=embolism-from-atherosclerotic-plaque-atheroembolism-cholesterol-crystal-embolism\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Embolism from atherosclerotic plaque: Atheroembolism (cholesterol crystal embolism)&quot;</a>.) </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2887824032\"><span class=\"h3\">Paradoxical embolism</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Although more commonly associated with cryptogenic stroke, paradoxical emboli (venous thrombus that traverses a cardiac defect to access the arterial circulation) can also cause acute lower extremity ischemia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-acute-lower-extremity-ischemia/abstract/17-23\" class=\"abstract_t\">17-23</a>]. One series found that 2 to 4 percent of embolic events over an eight-year period were due to paradoxical emboli; however, the source remained unknown in 20 percent of patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-acute-lower-extremity-ischemia/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. Patients with paradoxical emboli are typically younger compared with those who develop other forms of arterial thromboembolization (39 versus 68 years). Patients with paradoxical emboli may present with acute ischemia of an extremity, and they typically have little evidence of cardiac or peripheral artery disease. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H304903565\"><span class=\"h2\">Vasospasm</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Conditions that cause vasospasm can lead to nonocclusive arterial ischemia. These include the Raynaud phenomenon and the administration of vasoactive drugs (eg, ergotamines), which may have been given in a hospital setting or self-administered. If prolonged, arterial thrombosis may be superimposed. The Raynaud phenomenon typically presents with digital ischemia and can be distinguished from arterial thromboembolism by medical history and preserved proximal pulses. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-the-raynaud-phenomenon\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of the Raynaud phenomenon&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL PRESENTATIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Arterial occlusion results in a sudden cessation of blood supply and nutrients to the tissues in the distribution of the vessel, including skin, muscle, and nerves. The clinical presentation of acute arterial occlusion depends upon the time course of vessel occlusion; the location of the affected vessels, ranging from proximal large vessel occlusion resulting in ischemia of the entire extremity to distal small vessel occlusion resulting in digital ischemia; whether there is underlying vascular disease; and the ability to recruit collateral channels to provide flow around the occlusion (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F72956\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef72956 \">figure 1</a>). Symptoms can develop over a period of hours to days and can range from new or worsening claudication to relatively sudden paralysis of the affected limb. </p><p>It is important to determine if the patient had symptoms of chronic ischemia prior to the acute event. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-lower-extremity-peripheral-artery-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical features and diagnosis of lower extremity peripheral artery disease&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H29757669\"><span class=\"h2\">Acute-on-chronic limb ischemia</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In patients with known peripheral artery occlusive disease or those who have undergone prior revascularization (eg, arterial repair, arterial bypass, arterial stent), symptoms of arterial occlusion can develop over a variable time period (hours to days). Suddenly increasing symptoms in a patient with a history of peripheral artery disease is indicative of arterial thrombosis. </p><p>Some patients with occlusion of an arterial bypass will experience symptoms similar to those prior to revascularization, while others will have symptoms that are worse, and potentially limb threatening, due to concomitant occlusion of vessels proximal or distal to the revascularized segment.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3006009970\"><span class=\"h2\">Acute limb ischemia</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In patients with otherwise normal underlying vasculature who experience acute arterial occlusion, collateral blood vessels cannot be recruited quickly enough to circumvent the occluded artery, and the signs of acute ischemia most often develop rapidly. The sudden and dramatic development of ischemic symptoms in a previously asymptomatic patient is most consistent with an embolus. Patients with an extremity embolus can frequently pinpoint the exact time that symptoms began. The six Ps (pain, pallor, poikilothermia, pulselessness, paresthesia, paralysis) are the classic presentation of acute arterial occlusion in patients without underlying occlusive vascular disease. (See <a href=\"#H403210236\" class=\"local\">'Six Ps'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H29757569\"><span class=\"h1\">PHYSICAL EXAMINATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A careful examination of both lower extremities is necessary to detect signs of ischemia. The level of arterial obstruction is usually one joint above the line of demarcation between the normal and ischemic tissue. </p><p>The neurologic examination should assess sensation and muscle strength. The quality and character of the peripheral pulses in the affected extremity, as well as the contralateral extremity, are evaluated and compared. The vascular examination should include palpation of all pulses, including the femoral, popliteal, dorsalis pedis, and posterior tibial pulses as well as the upper extremity pulses (ie, subclavian, axillary, brachial, radial, and ulnar). Since the quality of the pulse examination can vary, a handheld Doppler should be used to confirm the presence of distal pulses (eg, dorsalis pedis, posterior tibial Doppler signals). The operator should listen for arterial and venous signals (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F75112\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef75112 \">table 2</a>). If Doppler signals are present, the ankle-brachial index (ABI) should be obtained. The manner of obtaining the ABI and interpretation is discussed separately. In general, the absence of any distal Doppler signals (arterial and venous) indicates severe ischemia. For the lower extremity, although the ABI may vary significantly depending upon the location of the thrombus or embolus, a value &lt;0.4 is indicative of severe ischemia. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=noninvasive-diagnosis-of-arterial-disease#H58544655\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Noninvasive diagnosis of arterial disease&quot;, section on 'Ankle-brachial index'</a>.) </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H403210236\"><span class=\"h2\">Six Ps</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The six Ps of acute ischemia include pain, pallor, poikilothermia, pulselessness, paresthesia, and paralysis. </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pain &ndash; <strong>P</strong>ain associated with acute arterial occlusion is usually located distally in the extremity, gradually increases in severity, and progresses proximally with increased duration of ischemia.

The skin of the ischemic extremity is typically cool (<strong>P</strong>oikilothermic) and <strong>P</strong>ale or mottled with delayed capillary filling. Blistering of the skin is an ominous sign of advanced ischemia. Both extremities should also be examined for signs of chronic ischemia such as atrophy of the skin, hair loss, and thickened nails.

Normal pulses in the contralateral extremity suggest the absence of chronic arterial occlusive disease and suggest that an embolus is the etiology of the acute ischemia.

Major loss of sensory or motor function (<strong>P</strong>aralysis) is indicative of advanced ischemia. In the lower extremity, the anterior compartment (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F68629\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef68629 \">figure 2</a>) of the leg is most sensitive to ischemia, and sensory deficits over the dorsum of the foot are often the earliest neurologic sign of acute vascular insufficiency.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H403210800\"><span class=\"h1\">DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A diagnosis of acute extremity ischemia can generally be made based upon the history and physical examination, including assessment of the ankle-brachial index bilaterally.

Patients with viable or marginally threatened limbs are usually candidates for urgent vascular imaging (typically computed tomographic [CT] angiography, or catheter-based arteriography) to evaluate arterial anatomy and to potentially institute thrombolytic therapy. However, patients with an immediately threatened extremity should preferentially undergo further evaluation and treatment in a surgical suite. (See <a href=\"#H518287604\" class=\"local\">'Clinical categories of ischemia'</a> above.)</p><p>Important factors that impact the timing and method of revascularization include the following:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Presumed etiology (embolus versus thrombus) </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Lesion location and length </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Duration of symptoms</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Availability of autologous vein for bypass grafting</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Suitability of the patient for surgery or intervention</p><p/><p>These clinical and radiographic features help determine whether catheter-directed thrombolysis (with or without endovascular intervention) or surgical revascularization is the most appropriate initial treatment. When thrombolysis is more suitable, proceeding directly to catheter-based arteriography expedites treatment and minimizes overall intravenous contrast load. As an example, for occlusion of a distal vessel (eg, to the tibial artery) or one that is more difficult to expose, thrombolysis may be the best initial treatment. </p><p>Although noninvasive vascular imaging studies (eg, duplex ultrasonography, CT angiography, magnetic resonance [MR] angiography) may be reasonable for some patients with acute limb ischemia, catheter-based arteriography (digital subtraction arteriography) provides the most useful information. CT and MR angiography can reliably diagnose the location and severity of arterial stenosis or occlusion (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RADIOL%2F98593\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef98593 \">image 1</a>) with high sensitivity and specificity, but these modalities do not offer a treatment option (eg, thrombolysis, angioplasty). </p><p>In addition to demonstrating arterial anatomy, arteriography can usually distinguish between thrombosis and embolism.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Arterial thrombosis is usually seen as a sharp or tapered, but not rounded, cutoff on arteriography.

However, the pain of a compartment syndrome is more severe, more localized, and is likely to be elicited during palpation of the muscle or passive stretching. In addition, leg swelling is usually evident. It is important to note that patients with severe acute limb ischemia can have concomitant acute compartment syndrome. In addition, acute compartment syndrome frequently complicates reperfusion after resolution of the acute ischemic insult, resulting in recurrence of limb ischemia once the tissue pressure exceeds perfusion pressure.

Acute arterial occlusion is most commonly related to acute thrombosis of a diseased but previously patent, often atherosclerotic artery but can also be due to acute thrombosis of a stent or graft, dissection of an artery, direct trauma to an artery, or the result of an embolus from a proximal source lodging into a more distal vessel (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F58846\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef58846 \">table 1</a>).

Subjective sensory deficits are signs of early nerve dysfunction, and major sensory or motor loss is indicative of advanced ischemia. The level of arterial obstruction is usually one joint above the line of demarcation between the normal and ischemic tissue.
