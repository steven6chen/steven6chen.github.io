It happens when the tubes that carry air into the lungs, called the &quot;bronchi,&quot; get infected (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F67527\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef67527 \">figure 1</a>).</p><p>Usually, bronchitis happens after a person gets a cold or the flu. The viruses that cause the cold or flu infect the bronchi and irritate them. People often wonder if taking antibiotics will help with their bronchitis. But the answer is <strong>no</strong>, because it is usually caused by a virus. Antibiotics kill bacteria, not viruses.</p><p>Bronchitis can also happen when a person gets an infection called &quot;whooping cough,&quot; but this is much less common. Whooping cough is caused by bacteria that can infect the bronchi. Most people get vaccines that prevent whooping cough, but the vaccine doesn't always work. Your doctor will be able to tell if you have whooping cough by doing an exam and listening to way your cough sounds.</p><p>This article is about &quot;acute&quot; bronchitis. This is different from &quot;chronic&quot; bronchitis, which is an illness in smokers who have a long-lasting cough.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H30928689\"><span class=\"h1\">What are the symptoms of bronchitis?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The most common symptoms of bronchitis are:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A nagging cough that can last up to a few weeks</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Coughing up mucus that is clear, yellow, or green &ndash; Some people think green mucus means you have a bacterial infection. But this is not always true.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>You might also have normal cold or flu symptoms, like a stuffy nose, sore throat, or headache. People with bronchitis do not usually get a fever.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H30928696\"><span class=\"h1\">When should I call the doctor or nurse?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Most people who have a cough that lasts longer than their other cold or flu symptoms do not need to see a doctor. The cough can take up to 3 weeks to get better, sometimes even longer. But you should call your doctor or nurse if you have:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A fever higher than 100.4&deg;F (38&deg;C)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Chest pain when you cough, trouble breathing, or coughing up blood</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A barking cough that makes it hard to talk</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A cough and weight loss that you cannot explain</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Symptoms that are not getting better after 3 weeks </p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H30928703\"><span class=\"h1\">Is there a test for bronchitis?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>People do not usually need a test. But your doctor or nurse might do a test, such as a chest X-ray, if the cause of your cough isn't clear.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H30928710\"><span class=\"h1\">How is bronchitis treated?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Bronchitis almost always goes away on its own, although it can take a few weeks. Doctors do <strong>not</strong> usually treat bronchitis with antibiotic medicines. That's because bronchitis is usually caused by a virus, and antibiotics kill bacteria, not viruses. Antibiotics will not help your bronchitis go away faster, and they can actually cause other problems. So it's not a good idea to take them if you don't really need them.</p><p>To feel better, you can treat your cold and flu symptoms. Different treatments you can try include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Getting lots of rest and drinking plenty of liquids</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Drinking hot tea</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Sucking on cough drops or hard candy</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Taking over-the-counter cough and cold medicines</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Breathing in warm, moist air, such as in the shower, over a kettle, or from a humidifier</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Taking a pain-relieving medicine if you have cold or flu symptoms like headache, muscle aches, or joint pain</p><p/><p>It's also important to avoid smoking or being around others who smoke. This can make your cough worse.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H30928717\"><span class=\"h1\">How can I keep from getting bronchitis again?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>You can reduce your chance of getting bronchitis again by keeping the germs that cause bronchitis out of your body. One of the best ways to do this is to wash your hands often with soap and water. If there is no sink nearby, you can use a hand gel with alcohol in it to clean your hands.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H30928724\"><span class=\"h1\">How can I keep from spreading my germs?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In addition to washing your hands often, you should cover your mouth with your elbow when you sneeze or cough. Using your elbow keeps you from getting germs on your hands. If you use a tissue, throw the tissue away and wash your hands.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H30928731\"><span class=\"h1\">More on this topic</span></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=cough-runny-nose-and-the-common-cold-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Cough, runny nose, and the common cold (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=flu-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Flu (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=cough-in-adults-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Cough in adults (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=cough-in-children-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Cough in children (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=what-you-should-know-about-antibiotics-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: What you should know about antibiotics (The Basics)</a></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=acute-bronchitis-in-adults-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Acute bronchitis in adults (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=the-common-cold-in-adults-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: The common cold in adults (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=influenza-symptoms-and-treatment-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Influenza symptoms and treatment (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=chronic-cough-in-adults-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Chronic cough in adults (Beyond the Basics)</a></p></div><div id=\"reviewProcess\"><span>All topics are updated as new evidence becomes available and our <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/home/editorial-policy\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"policy policy_editorialpolicy\">peer review process</a> is complete.</span></div><div id=\"topicRetrievedDate\"><span class=\"emphasis\">This topic retrieved from UpToDate on: </span>Apr 02, 2018.</div><div id=\"disclaimer\">The content on the UpToDate website is not intended nor recommended as a substitute for medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.
