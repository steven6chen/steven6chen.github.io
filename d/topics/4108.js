It became evident that these entities are actually part of a spectrum of neoplastic diseases known as the ES family of tumors (EFT), which also includes extraosseous ES (EES), PNET, malignant small-cell tumor of the thoracopulmonary region (Askin tumor), and atypical ES. Because of their similar histologic and immunohistochemical characteristics, and shared nonrandom chromosomal translocations, these tumors are considered to be derived from a common cell of origin. Although the histogenetic origin has been debated over the years, increasing evidence from immunohistochemical, cytogenetic, and molecular genetic studies supports a mesenchymal progenitor cell origin for all EFT [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-staging-and-prognostic-factors-of-the-ewing-sarcoma-family-of-tumors/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].

Although overt metastatic disease is found in fewer than 25 percent at the time of diagnosis, subclinical metastatic disease is presumed to be present in nearly all patients because of the 80 to 90 percent relapse rate in patients undergoing local therapy alone. As a result, systemic chemotherapy has evolved as an important component of treatment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-staging-and-prognostic-factors-of-the-ewing-sarcoma-family-of-tumors/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p>Advances in multidisciplinary management of EFT over the past 30 years have resulted in a marked improvement in survival and a greater likelihood of limb-sparing surgery rather than amputation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-staging-and-prognostic-factors-of-the-ewing-sarcoma-family-of-tumors/abstract/3-6\" class=\"abstract_t\">3-6</a>] (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=bone-sarcomas-preoperative-evaluation-histologic-classification-and-principles-of-surgical-management\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Bone sarcomas: Preoperative evaluation, histologic classification, and principles of surgical management&quot;</a>). In data derived from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) program of the National Cancer Institute, five-year survival rates for patients with ES rose from 36 to 56 percent during the periods 1975 to 1984 and 1985 to 1994 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-staging-and-prognostic-factors-of-the-ewing-sarcoma-family-of-tumors/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].

In a compilation of data from 975 patients from the European Intergroup Cooperative Ewing Sarcoma Studies (EI-CESS) trials, the distribution of primary sites was as follows [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-staging-and-prognostic-factors-of-the-ewing-sarcoma-family-of-tumors/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Axial skeleton &ndash; 54 percent (pelvis 25 percent, ribs 12 percent, spine 8 percent, scapula 3.8 percent, skull 3.8 percent, and clavicle 1.2 percent)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Appendicular skeleton &ndash; 42 percent (femur 16.4 percent, fibula 6.7 percent, tibia 7.6 percent, humerus 4.8 percent, foot 2.4 percent, radius 1.9 percent, and hand 1.2 percent) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Other bones &ndash; 0.7 percent</p><p/><p>A minority of Ewing sarcomas (ES) arise in soft tissue. Compared to undifferentiated ES of bone, patients with extraosseous ES (EES) are more frequently older, more likely to be female, and arise more often within the axial, rather than the appendicular, skeleton [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-staging-and-prognostic-factors-of-the-ewing-sarcoma-family-of-tumors/abstract/8,10-12\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,10-12</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Signs and symptoms</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients with EFT typically present with localized pain or swelling of a few weeks' or months' duration [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-staging-and-prognostic-factors-of-the-ewing-sarcoma-family-of-tumors/abstract/13-15\" class=\"abstract_t\">13-15</a>]. Trauma, often minor, may be the initiating event that calls attention to the lesion. The pain may be mild at first but intensifies fairly rapidly; it may be aggravated by exercise and is often worse at night. A distinct soft tissue mass can sometimes be appreciated. When present, it is usually firmly attached to the bone and moderately to markedly tender to palpation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-staging-and-prognostic-factors-of-the-ewing-sarcoma-family-of-tumors/abstract/16,17\" class=\"abstract_t\">16,17</a>]. Swelling of the affected limb with erythema over the mass is not uncommon.</p><p>Patients with juxta-articular lesions may present with loss of joint motion, while lesions involving the ribs can be associated with direct pleural extension and large extraosseous masses [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-staging-and-prognostic-factors-of-the-ewing-sarcoma-family-of-tumors/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. When the spine or sacrum is involved, nerve root irritation or compression can result in back pain, radiculopathy, or symptoms of spinal cord compression (eg, weakness or loss of bowel <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> bladder control). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-neoplastic-epidural-spinal-cord-compression-including-cauda-equina-syndrome\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical features and diagnosis of neoplastic epidural spinal cord compression, including cauda equina syndrome&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Constitutional symptoms or signs, such as fever, fatigue, weight loss, or anemia, are present in approximately 10 to 20 percent of patients at presentation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-staging-and-prognostic-factors-of-the-ewing-sarcoma-family-of-tumors/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. Fever is related to cytokines produced by the tumor cells and, along with other systemic symptoms, is associated with advanced disease.</p><p>Approximately 80 percent of patients present with clinically localized disease, although as noted previously, subclinical metastatic disease is presumed to be present in nearly all. Overt metastases may become evident within weeks to months in the absence of effective therapy. The significance of this lies in the frequent delay between the onset of symptoms and diagnosis, which in one report averaged over nine months [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-staging-and-prognostic-factors-of-the-ewing-sarcoma-family-of-tumors/abstract/15,19\" class=\"abstract_t\">15,19</a>].</p><p>Patients with primary pelvic tumors are significantly more likely to present with metastatic disease compared to other sites (25 versus 16 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-staging-and-prognostic-factors-of-the-ewing-sarcoma-family-of-tumors/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. Other factors that may be associated with clinically evident metastatic disease at presentation include high level of lactic dehydrogenase (LDH), the presence of fever, an interval between onset of symptoms and diagnosis less than three months, and age older than 12 years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-staging-and-prognostic-factors-of-the-ewing-sarcoma-family-of-tumors/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. In one series, the rate of metastatic disease at presentation in the subset of patients with none of these risk factors was only 4 percent, with two factors it was 23 percent, while it was almost double (44 percent) if three or four factors were present.</p><p>Sites of metastatic disease at diagnosis are similar to those seen with recurrent disease; lung and <span class=\"nowrap\">bone/bone</span> marrow metastases predominate in roughly equal proportions. The spine is the most frequently involved bone [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-staging-and-prognostic-factors-of-the-ewing-sarcoma-family-of-tumors/abstract/21,22\" class=\"abstract_t\">21,22</a>]. Lung metastases represent the first site of distant spread in 70 to 80 percent of cases and are the leading cause of death for patients with EFT. Lymph node, liver, and brain involvement are distinctly uncommon [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-staging-and-prognostic-factors-of-the-ewing-sarcoma-family-of-tumors/abstract/14,23\" class=\"abstract_t\">14,23</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h1\">STAGING EVALUATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The goals of the initial evaluation are to establish the diagnosis, evaluate local disease extent, and determine the presence and sites of metastatic spread. Clinical staging includes all of the data obtained prior to definitive therapy, including the results of imaging, laboratory studies, physical examination, and tissue biopsy.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Radiographic studies</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The diagnostic work-up is usually initiated with a plain radiograph of the affected area. Ewing sarcoma (ES) involving bone typically presents as a poorly marginated destructive lesion, most often associated with a soft tissue mass. The tumors tend to be large and, in long bones, are metaphyseal or diaphyseal in location (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F62643\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef62643 \">image 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F50795\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef50795 \">figure 1</a>).</p><p>The radiographic appearance has been described as &quot;permeative&quot; or &quot;moth-eaten,&quot; indicative of a series of finely destructive lesions that become confluent over time. The cortex at the site of the lesion is often expanded and the periosteum displaced by the underlying tumor, resulting in the clinical sign of Codman's triangle. The characteristic periosteal reaction produces layers of reactive bone, deposited in an &quot;onion peel&quot; appearance (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F61818\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef61818 \">image 2</a>). The soft tissue component of the tumor rarely shows any calcification or ossification. Sclerosis, if present, represents a secondary bone reaction rather than the primary bone formation that characterizes osteosarcoma. A pathologic fracture is present at diagnosis in 10 to 15 percent of cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-staging-and-prognostic-factors-of-the-ewing-sarcoma-family-of-tumors/abstract/13,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,15</a>].</p><p>Compared to plain radiographs, a computed tomography (CT) scan of the primary site better delineates the extent of cortical destruction and soft tissue disease (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F56503\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef56503 \">image 3</a>). A multi-institutional study of 387 patients that included both children and adults concluded that CT and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) were equally accurate for local staging of bone and soft tissue tumors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-staging-and-prognostic-factors-of-the-ewing-sarcoma-family-of-tumors/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. However, MRI is preferred in most cases because of its superior definition of tumor size, local intraosseous and extraosseous extent, and the relationship of the tumor to fascial planes, vessels, nerves, and organs (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F64832\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef64832 \">image 4</a>). Imaging of the entire involved bone is necessary to exclude the presence of skip lesions (ie, medullary disease within the same bone but not in direct contiguity with the primary lesion).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h3\">Differential diagnosis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>For the ES family of tumors (EFT) presenting as primary bone tumors, the differential diagnosis includes both benign and malignant conditions. The most common nonmalignant possibility is subacute osteomyelitis, which may present similarly (especially the presence of fever and an elevated sedimentation rate), and be associated with intense radiotracer uptake on bone scan and a soft tissue mass on other imaging studies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-staging-and-prognostic-factors-of-the-ewing-sarcoma-family-of-tumors/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. Aspiration of a tumor may yield purulent-appearing material; however, it will be sterile on culture. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hematogenous-osteomyelitis-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Hematogenous osteomyelitis in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p>&quot;Benign&quot; bone tumors that can present as lytic lesions include eosinophilic granuloma and giant cell tumor of bone. Destructive eosinophilic granulomas usually occur at a younger age and are not associated with a sizable soft tissue mass.</p><p>Malignant tumors that should be considered in the differential include other common solid tumors of childhood, including osteosarcoma, primary lymphoma of bone, undifferentiated high-grade pleomorphic sarcoma of bone (previously termed malignant fibrous histiocytoma of bone or spindle cell sarcoma), acute leukemia, and metastasis from a non-bone tumor, particularly neuroblastoma (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F81481\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef81481 \">table 1</a>). A primarily lytic osteosarcoma may be difficult to distinguish from ES on imaging studies. Most often, however, osteosarcoma is located in the metaphysis and usually has a rim of bone formation, which is very uncommon in ES. Primary lymphoma of bone occurs in an older age group and is generally associated with less bone destruction than ES. Chondrosarcoma is uncommon in this age group; furthermore, the soft tissue mass usually contains calcifications. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=bone-tumors-diagnosis-and-biopsy-techniques\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Bone tumors: Diagnosis and biopsy techniques&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=primary-lymphoma-of-bone#H6\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Primary lymphoma of bone&quot;, section on 'Imaging studies'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=chondrosarcoma\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Chondrosarcoma&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Extraosseous ES (EES) and soft tissue peripheral primitive neuroectodermal tumors (PNETs) must be distinguished from a variety of benign and malignant soft tissue tumors.

At least three series note better sensitivity for PET over bone scan or other conventional imaging modalities for detection of bone metastases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-staging-and-prognostic-factors-of-the-ewing-sarcoma-family-of-tumors/abstract/32,34,35\" class=\"abstract_t\">32,34,35</a>]. However, one potential problem is that because integrated PET-CT scanning usually scans from the neck through the femurs, the bones are not all visualized as they would be with a bone scan. PET has not yet replaced radionuclide bone scan for initial staging at many institutions. In contrast to the situation with bone metastases, the sensitivity of PET for detection of lung metastases appears to be lower than that of thoracic CT [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-staging-and-prognostic-factors-of-the-ewing-sarcoma-family-of-tumors/abstract/32,33\" class=\"abstract_t\">32,33</a>], although integrated <span class=\"nowrap\">PET/CT</span> is superior to CT alone in this regard [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-staging-and-prognostic-factors-of-the-ewing-sarcoma-family-of-tumors/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>].

These translocations result in the fusion of distinct genes on different chromosomes, and these fused genes then encode hybrid proteins, which are thought to be involved in tumorigenesis. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epidemiology-pathology-and-molecular-genetics-of-the-ewing-sarcoma-family-of-tumors#H8\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Epidemiology, pathology, and molecular genetics of the Ewing sarcoma family of tumors&quot;, section on 'Molecular genetics'</a>.)</p><p>At least 18 different structural possibilities for gene fusions have been reported in these tumors. There are two sources of variability: the EWS fusion partner (eg, FLI1, ERG, ETV1, E1A, or FEV) and the breakpoint locations within the genes. This molecular heterogeneity may have some influence on the prognosis of EFT [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-staging-and-prognostic-factors-of-the-ewing-sarcoma-family-of-tumors/abstract/72-75\" class=\"abstract_t\">72-75</a>]. As an example, a better outcome has been reported for patients with localized tumors expressing the most common chimeric transcript (the so-called type I transcript in which EWS exon 7 is fused to FLI1 exon 6, which is present in approximately 60 percent of cases) compared to other fusion types [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-staging-and-prognostic-factors-of-the-ewing-sarcoma-family-of-tumors/abstract/73,74\" class=\"abstract_t\">73,74</a>]. However, more recent treatment protocols appear to have eliminated prognostic differences based upon fusion type [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-staging-and-prognostic-factors-of-the-ewing-sarcoma-family-of-tumors/abstract/76\" class=\"abstract_t\">76</a>]. </p><p>Studies evaluating the prognostic significance of other cytogenetic and molecular alterations in EFT are limited. However, deletion of the short arm of chromosome 1p, homozygous deletions of CDKN2A and <span class=\"nowrap\">p16/p14ARF,</span> and p53 mutations have all been associated with poor response to chemotherapy and a worse prognosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-staging-and-prognostic-factors-of-the-ewing-sarcoma-family-of-tumors/abstract/72,77,78\" class=\"abstract_t\">72,77,78</a>].

One of the most important uses of a staging system is to stratify patients for treatment purposes, based upon expected outcome. Because of the very powerful prognostic power of the presence of metastatic disease, most studies in EFT have stratified patients by the presence or absence of metastatic disease. Although the primary site (ie, extremity versus pelvis or spine) also has prognostic significance, only a few studies have used site as the basis for determining the aggressiveness of therapy. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-the-ewing-sarcoma-family-of-tumors\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of the Ewing sarcoma family of tumors&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Some investigators consider patients with localized disease, but who show features of poor prognosis (eg, pelvic primary site, older age), as &quot;advanced&quot; or &quot;high-risk,&quot; grouping them for the purposes of treatment with others who have overt metastatic disease. The selection of treatment based upon individual prognostic factors is referred to as risk-adapted therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-staging-and-prognostic-factors-of-the-ewing-sarcoma-family-of-tumors/abstract/56\" class=\"abstract_t\">56</a>]. Using several indicators of prognosis in addition to the presence of metastatic disease, a prognostic model was developed using data from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) database and applied to 1680 patients who were enrolled in COG trials for Ewing sarcoma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-staging-and-prognostic-factors-of-the-ewing-sarcoma-family-of-tumors/abstract/79\" class=\"abstract_t\">79</a>]. These investigators were able to identify five distinct prognostic groups based upon age, pelvic location, ethnicity, and the presence of metastatic disease. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-the-ewing-sarcoma-family-of-tumors#H9\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of the Ewing sarcoma family of tumors&quot;, section on 'Treatment for metastatic disease'</a>.)</p><p>The data indicating prognostic differences among patients with varying fusion genes raise the possibility that heterogeneity in the structure of chimeric transcripts may also be used to define clinically distinct risk groups. As an example, a direct comparison between treatment response and EWS fusion type may reveal a role of certain chimeras in therapy resistance. However, prospective clinical studies are just beginning to be performed to address this hypothesis.

Because of their similar histologic and immunohistochemical characteristics, and shared nonrandom chromosomal translocations, these tumors are considered to be derived from a common cell of origin, although its histogenic origin is debated. (See <a href=\"#H1\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above.)</p><p>EFT most often arises in the long bones of the extremities (predominantly the femur but also the tibia, fibula, and humerus) and the bones of the pelvis. The spine, hands, and feet are affected considerably less often. (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Primary sites'</a> above.)</p><p>Patients with EFT typically present with localized pain or swelling of a few weeks' or months' duration. Trauma, often minor, may be the initiating event that calls attention to the lesion. Constitutional symptoms or signs, such as fever, fatigue, weight loss, or anemia, are present in approximately 10 to 20 percent of patients at presentation. (See <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Signs and symptoms'</a> above.) </p><p>The goals of the initial evaluation are to establish the diagnosis, evaluate local disease extent, and determine the presence and sites of metastatic spread. (See <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Staging evaluation'</a> above.)</p><p>The diagnostic work-up is usually initiated with a plain radiograph of the affected area. EFT involving bone typically presents as a poorly marginated destructive lesion with a permeative or &quot;moth-eaten&quot; appearance, most often associated with a soft tissue mass. While computed tomography (CT) scan better delineates the extent of cortical destruction and soft tissue disease, definition of tumor size, local intraosseous and extraosseous extent, and the relationship of the tumor to fascial planes, vessels, nerves, and organs are best achieved by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). (See <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'Radiographic studies'</a> above.)</p><p>The metastatic work-up includes a CT scan of the chest to evaluate the thorax for metastatic disease and a radionuclide bone scan to evaluate the entire skeleton for the presence of multiple lesions. Positron emission tomography (PET) or <span class=\"nowrap\">PET/CT</span> is increasingly used for the initial staging and response assessment of EFT, and may be able to replace the need for radionuclide bone scan for detection of bone metastases in selected patients with lytic disease. Some clinicians advocate bone marrow biopsy (at least unilateral) in all patients to exclude widespread metastatic disease. (See <a href=\"#H8\" class=\"local\">'Metastatic work-up'</a> above and <a href=\"#H10\" class=\"local\">'Bone marrow aspirate and biopsy'</a> above.)</p><p>A biopsy should be carefully planned to obtain adequate diagnostic tissue without compromising a later operation, particularly the opportunity for limb salvage. (See <a href=\"#H11\" class=\"local\">'Tumor biopsy'</a> above.)</p><p>Several clinical and biologic characteristics can assist in defining prognosis and directing the intensity of therapy. These include the presence or absence of metastases, primary tumor location and size, age, the response to therapy, and the presence of certain chromosomal translocations.

It became evident that these entities are actually part of a spectrum of neoplastic diseases known as the ES family of tumors (EFT), which also includes extraosseous ES (EES), PNET, malignant small-cell tumor of the thoracopulmonary region (Askin tumor), and atypical ES. Because of their similar histologic and immunohistochemical characteristics, and shared nonrandom chromosomal translocations, these tumors are considered to be derived from a common cell of origin. Although the histogenetic origin has been debated over the years, increasing evidence from immunohistochemical, cytogenetic, and molecular genetic studies supports a mesenchymal progenitor cell origin for all EFT [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-staging-and-prognostic-factors-of-the-ewing-sarcoma-family-of-tumors/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].

Although overt metastatic disease is found in fewer than 25 percent at the time of diagnosis, subclinical metastatic disease is presumed to be present in nearly all patients because of the 80 to 90 percent relapse rate in patients undergoing local therapy alone. As a result, systemic chemotherapy has evolved as an important component of treatment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-staging-and-prognostic-factors-of-the-ewing-sarcoma-family-of-tumors/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p>Advances in multidisciplinary management of EFT over the past 30 years have resulted in a marked improvement in survival and a greater likelihood of limb-sparing surgery rather than amputation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-staging-and-prognostic-factors-of-the-ewing-sarcoma-family-of-tumors/abstract/3-6\" class=\"abstract_t\">3-6</a>] (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=bone-sarcomas-preoperative-evaluation-histologic-classification-and-principles-of-surgical-management\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Bone sarcomas: Preoperative evaluation, histologic classification, and principles of surgical management&quot;</a>). In data derived from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) program of the National Cancer Institute, five-year survival rates for patients with ES rose from 36 to 56 percent during the periods 1975 to 1984 and 1985 to 1994 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-staging-and-prognostic-factors-of-the-ewing-sarcoma-family-of-tumors/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].

Trauma, often minor, may be the initiating event that calls attention to the lesion. The pain may be mild at first but intensifies fairly rapidly; it may be aggravated by exercise and is often worse at night. A distinct soft tissue mass can sometimes be appreciated. When present, it is usually firmly attached to the bone and moderately to markedly tender to palpation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-staging-and-prognostic-factors-of-the-ewing-sarcoma-family-of-tumors/abstract/16,17\" class=\"abstract_t\">16,17</a>].

Fever is related to cytokines produced by the tumor cells and, along with other systemic symptoms, is associated with advanced disease.</p><p>Approximately 80 percent of patients present with clinically localized disease, although as noted previously, subclinical metastatic disease is presumed to be present in nearly all. Overt metastases may become evident within weeks to months in the absence of effective therapy. The significance of this lies in the frequent delay between the onset of symptoms and diagnosis, which in one report averaged over nine months [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-staging-and-prognostic-factors-of-the-ewing-sarcoma-family-of-tumors/abstract/15,19\" class=\"abstract_t\">15,19</a>].</p><p>Patients with primary pelvic tumors are significantly more likely to present with metastatic disease compared to other sites (25 versus 16 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-staging-and-prognostic-factors-of-the-ewing-sarcoma-family-of-tumors/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. Other factors that may be associated with clinically evident metastatic disease at presentation include high level of lactic dehydrogenase (LDH), the presence of fever, an interval between onset of symptoms and diagnosis less than three months, and age older than 12 years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-staging-and-prognostic-factors-of-the-ewing-sarcoma-family-of-tumors/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. In one series, the rate of metastatic disease at presentation in the subset of patients with none of these risk factors was only 4 percent, with two factors it was 23 percent, while it was almost double (44 percent) if three or four factors were present.</p><p>Sites of metastatic disease at diagnosis are similar to those seen with recurrent disease; lung and <span class=\"nowrap\">bone/bone</span> marrow metastases predominate in roughly equal proportions. The spine is the most frequently involved bone [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-staging-and-prognostic-factors-of-the-ewing-sarcoma-family-of-tumors/abstract/21,22\" class=\"abstract_t\">21,22</a>]. Lung metastases represent the first site of distant spread in 70 to 80 percent of cases and are the leading cause of death for patients with EFT. Lymph node, liver, and brain involvement are distinctly uncommon [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-staging-and-prognostic-factors-of-the-ewing-sarcoma-family-of-tumors/abstract/14,23\" class=\"abstract_t\">14,23</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h1\">STAGING EVALUATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The goals of the initial evaluation are to establish the diagnosis, evaluate local disease extent, and determine the presence and sites of metastatic spread. Clinical staging includes all of the data obtained prior to definitive therapy, including the results of imaging, laboratory studies, physical examination, and tissue biopsy.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Radiographic studies</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The diagnostic work-up is usually initiated with a plain radiograph of the affected area. Ewing sarcoma (ES) involving bone typically presents as a poorly marginated destructive lesion, most often associated with a soft tissue mass. The tumors tend to be large and, in long bones, are metaphyseal or diaphyseal in location (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F62643\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef62643 \">image 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F50795\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef50795 \">figure 1</a>).</p><p>The radiographic appearance has been described as &quot;permeative&quot; or &quot;moth-eaten,&quot; indicative of a series of finely destructive lesions that become confluent over time. The cortex at the site of the lesion is often expanded and the periosteum displaced by the underlying tumor, resulting in the clinical sign of Codman's triangle. The characteristic periosteal reaction produces layers of reactive bone, deposited in an &quot;onion peel&quot; appearance (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F61818\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef61818 \">image 2</a>). The soft tissue component of the tumor rarely shows any calcification or ossification. Sclerosis, if present, represents a secondary bone reaction rather than the primary bone formation that characterizes osteosarcoma. A pathologic fracture is present at diagnosis in 10 to 15 percent of cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-staging-and-prognostic-factors-of-the-ewing-sarcoma-family-of-tumors/abstract/13,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,15</a>].</p><p>Compared to plain radiographs, a computed tomography (CT) scan of the primary site better delineates the extent of cortical destruction and soft tissue disease (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F56503\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef56503 \">image 3</a>). A multi-institutional study of 387 patients that included both children and adults concluded that CT and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) were equally accurate for local staging of bone and soft tissue tumors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-staging-and-prognostic-factors-of-the-ewing-sarcoma-family-of-tumors/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. However, MRI is preferred in most cases because of its superior definition of tumor size, local intraosseous and extraosseous extent, and the relationship of the tumor to fascial planes, vessels, nerves, and organs (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F64832\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef64832 \">image 4</a>). Imaging of the entire involved bone is necessary to exclude the presence of skip lesions (ie, medullary disease within the same bone but not in direct contiguity with the primary lesion).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h3\">Differential diagnosis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>For the ES family of tumors (EFT) presenting as primary bone tumors, the differential diagnosis includes both benign and malignant conditions. The most common nonmalignant possibility is subacute osteomyelitis, which may present similarly (especially the presence of fever and an elevated sedimentation rate), and be associated with intense radiotracer uptake on bone scan and a soft tissue mass on other imaging studies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-staging-and-prognostic-factors-of-the-ewing-sarcoma-family-of-tumors/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. Aspiration of a tumor may yield purulent-appearing material; however, it will be sterile on culture. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hematogenous-osteomyelitis-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Hematogenous osteomyelitis in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p>&quot;Benign&quot; bone tumors that can present as lytic lesions include eosinophilic granuloma and giant cell tumor of bone. Destructive eosinophilic granulomas usually occur at a younger age and are not associated with a sizable soft tissue mass.</p><p>Malignant tumors that should be considered in the differential include other common solid tumors of childhood, including osteosarcoma, primary lymphoma of bone, undifferentiated high-grade pleomorphic sarcoma of bone (previously termed malignant fibrous histiocytoma of bone or spindle cell sarcoma), acute leukemia, and metastasis from a non-bone tumor, particularly neuroblastoma (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F81481\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef81481 \">table 1</a>). A primarily lytic osteosarcoma may be difficult to distinguish from ES on imaging studies. Most often, however, osteosarcoma is located in the metaphysis and usually has a rim of bone formation, which is very uncommon in ES. Primary lymphoma of bone occurs in an older age group and is generally associated with less bone destruction than ES. Chondrosarcoma is uncommon in this age group; furthermore, the soft tissue mass usually contains calcifications.

At least three series note better sensitivity for PET over bone scan or other conventional imaging modalities for detection of bone metastases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-staging-and-prognostic-factors-of-the-ewing-sarcoma-family-of-tumors/abstract/32,34,35\" class=\"abstract_t\">32,34,35</a>]. However, one potential problem is that because integrated PET-CT scanning usually scans from the neck through the femurs, the bones are not all visualized as they would be with a bone scan. PET has not yet replaced radionuclide bone scan for initial staging at many institutions. In contrast to the situation with bone metastases, the sensitivity of PET for detection of lung metastases appears to be lower than that of thoracic CT [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-staging-and-prognostic-factors-of-the-ewing-sarcoma-family-of-tumors/abstract/32,33\" class=\"abstract_t\">32,33</a>], although integrated <span class=\"nowrap\">PET/CT</span> is superior to CT alone in this regard [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-staging-and-prognostic-factors-of-the-ewing-sarcoma-family-of-tumors/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>].

These translocations result in the fusion of distinct genes on different chromosomes, and these fused genes then encode hybrid proteins, which are thought to be involved in tumorigenesis. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epidemiology-pathology-and-molecular-genetics-of-the-ewing-sarcoma-family-of-tumors#H8\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Epidemiology, pathology, and molecular genetics of the Ewing sarcoma family of tumors&quot;, section on 'Molecular genetics'</a>.)</p><p>At least 18 different structural possibilities for gene fusions have been reported in these tumors. There are two sources of variability: the EWS fusion partner (eg, FLI1, ERG, ETV1, E1A, or FEV) and the breakpoint locations within the genes. This molecular heterogeneity may have some influence on the prognosis of EFT [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-staging-and-prognostic-factors-of-the-ewing-sarcoma-family-of-tumors/abstract/72-75\" class=\"abstract_t\">72-75</a>]. As an example, a better outcome has been reported for patients with localized tumors expressing the most common chimeric transcript (the so-called type I transcript in which EWS exon 7 is fused to FLI1 exon 6, which is present in approximately 60 percent of cases) compared to other fusion types [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-staging-and-prognostic-factors-of-the-ewing-sarcoma-family-of-tumors/abstract/73,74\" class=\"abstract_t\">73,74</a>]. However, more recent treatment protocols appear to have eliminated prognostic differences based upon fusion type [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-staging-and-prognostic-factors-of-the-ewing-sarcoma-family-of-tumors/abstract/76\" class=\"abstract_t\">76</a>]. </p><p>Studies evaluating the prognostic significance of other cytogenetic and molecular alterations in EFT are limited. However, deletion of the short arm of chromosome 1p, homozygous deletions of CDKN2A and <span class=\"nowrap\">p16/p14ARF,</span> and p53 mutations have all been associated with poor response to chemotherapy and a worse prognosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-staging-and-prognostic-factors-of-the-ewing-sarcoma-family-of-tumors/abstract/72,77,78\" class=\"abstract_t\">72,77,78</a>]. The association of genetic variants of EFT with clinically significant features will require further study.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H19\"><span class=\"h2\">Use of prognostic factors for treatment stratification</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>As noted previously, there is no widely accepted formal staging system for EFT. One of the most important uses of a staging system is to stratify patients for treatment purposes, based upon expected outcome. Because of the very powerful prognostic power of the presence of metastatic disease, most studies in EFT have stratified patients by the presence or absence of metastatic disease. Although the primary site (ie, extremity versus pelvis or spine) also has prognostic significance, only a few studies have used site as the basis for determining the aggressiveness of therapy. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-the-ewing-sarcoma-family-of-tumors\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of the Ewing sarcoma family of tumors&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Some investigators consider patients with localized disease, but who show features of poor prognosis (eg, pelvic primary site, older age), as &quot;advanced&quot; or &quot;high-risk,&quot; grouping them for the purposes of treatment with others who have overt metastatic disease. The selection of treatment based upon individual prognostic factors is referred to as risk-adapted therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-staging-and-prognostic-factors-of-the-ewing-sarcoma-family-of-tumors/abstract/56\" class=\"abstract_t\">56</a>]. Using several indicators of prognosis in addition to the presence of metastatic disease, a prognostic model was developed using data from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) database and applied to 1680 patients who were enrolled in COG trials for Ewing sarcoma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-staging-and-prognostic-factors-of-the-ewing-sarcoma-family-of-tumors/abstract/79\" class=\"abstract_t\">79</a>]. These investigators were able to identify five distinct prognostic groups based upon age, pelvic location, ethnicity, and the presence of metastatic disease. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-the-ewing-sarcoma-family-of-tumors#H9\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of the Ewing sarcoma family of tumors&quot;, section on 'Treatment for metastatic disease'</a>.)</p><p>The data indicating prognostic differences among patients with varying fusion genes raise the possibility that heterogeneity in the structure of chimeric transcripts may also be used to define clinically distinct risk groups. As an example, a direct comparison between treatment response and EWS fusion type may reveal a role of certain chimeras in therapy resistance. However, prospective clinical studies are just beginning to be performed to address this hypothesis. Inclusion of EWS fusion type determination into future clinical trials is appropriate.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3375947037\"><span class=\"h2\">Other prognostic factors</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>One report identified abnormal body mass index (BMI) as predictive of inferior tumor necrosis after chemotherapy and a worse overall survival [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-staging-and-prognostic-factors-of-the-ewing-sarcoma-family-of-tumors/abstract/80\" class=\"abstract_t\">80</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"PATIENT_INFORMATION\"><span class=\"h1\">INFORMATION FOR PATIENTS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>UpToDate offers two types of patient education materials, &quot;The Basics&quot; and &quot;Beyond the Basics.&quot; The Basics patient education pieces are written in plain language, at the 5<sup>th</sup> to 6<sup>th</sup> grade reading level, and they answer the four or five key questions a patient might have about a given condition.

Because of their similar histologic and immunohistochemical characteristics, and shared nonrandom chromosomal translocations, these tumors are considered to be derived from a common cell of origin, although its histogenic origin is debated. (See <a href=\"#H1\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above.)</p><p>EFT most often arises in the long bones of the extremities (predominantly the femur but also the tibia, fibula, and humerus) and the bones of the pelvis. The spine, hands, and feet are affected considerably less often. (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Primary sites'</a> above.)</p><p>Patients with EFT typically present with localized pain or swelling of a few weeks' or months' duration. Trauma, often minor, may be the initiating event that calls attention to the lesion. Constitutional symptoms or signs, such as fever, fatigue, weight loss, or anemia, are present in approximately 10 to 20 percent of patients at presentation. (See <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Signs and symptoms'</a> above.) </p><p>The goals of the initial evaluation are to establish the diagnosis, evaluate local disease extent, and determine the presence and sites of metastatic spread. (See <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Staging evaluation'</a> above.)</p><p>The diagnostic work-up is usually initiated with a plain radiograph of the affected area. EFT involving bone typically presents as a poorly marginated destructive lesion with a permeative or &quot;moth-eaten&quot; appearance, most often associated with a soft tissue mass. While computed tomography (CT) scan better delineates the extent of cortical destruction and soft tissue disease, definition of tumor size, local intraosseous and extraosseous extent, and the relationship of the tumor to fascial planes, vessels, nerves, and organs are best achieved by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). (See <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'Radiographic studies'</a> above.)</p><p>The metastatic work-up includes a CT scan of the chest to evaluate the thorax for metastatic disease and a radionuclide bone scan to evaluate the entire skeleton for the presence of multiple lesions. Positron emission tomography (PET) or <span class=\"nowrap\">PET/CT</span> is increasingly used for the initial staging and response assessment of EFT, and may be able to replace the need for radionuclide bone scan for detection of bone metastases in selected patients with lytic disease. Some clinicians advocate bone marrow biopsy (at least unilateral) in all patients to exclude widespread metastatic disease. (See <a href=\"#H8\" class=\"local\">'Metastatic work-up'</a> above and <a href=\"#H10\" class=\"local\">'Bone marrow aspirate and biopsy'</a> above.)</p><p>A biopsy should be carefully planned to obtain adequate diagnostic tissue without compromising a later operation, particularly the opportunity for limb salvage. (See <a href=\"#H11\" class=\"local\">'Tumor biopsy'</a> above.)</p><p>Several clinical and biologic characteristics can assist in defining prognosis and directing the intensity of therapy. These include the presence or absence of metastases, primary tumor location and size, age, the response to therapy, and the presence of certain chromosomal translocations.
