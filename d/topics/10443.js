Treatments to modify the course of the disease have not reached a threshold of efficacy to gain regulatory approval, despite numerous efforts.</p><p>There are multiple mechanisms that can contribute to the pain experience, and a holistic assessment of the patient is a paramount component of knee OA treatment. In addition, clinical decision-making is often influenced by specific patient and disease characteristics. This topic will provide an overview of the management of knee OA, with a focus on the management of mild knee OA. Separate topic reviews on OA as well as knee pain include the following:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pathogenesis-of-osteoarthritis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pathogenesis of osteoarthritis&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=risk-factors-for-and-possible-causes-of-osteoarthritis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Risk factors for and possible causes of osteoarthritis&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-osteoarthritis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of osteoarthritis&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-the-management-of-osteoarthritis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of the management of osteoarthritis&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-moderate-to-severe-knee-osteoarthritis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of moderate to severe knee osteoarthritis&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=comorbidities-that-impact-management-of-osteoarthritis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Comorbidities that impact management of osteoarthritis&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=approach-to-the-adult-with-unspecified-knee-pain\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Approach to the adult with unspecified knee pain&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=approach-to-the-adult-with-knee-pain-likely-of-musculoskeletal-origin\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Approach to the adult with knee pain likely of musculoskeletal origin&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3214375075\"><span class=\"h1\">DEFINITIONS</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Mild knee osteoarthritis</strong> &ndash; Patients with mild knee osteoarthritis (OA) have low levels of or intermittent knee pain with relatively well-preserved joint function and quality of life.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Moderate knee osteoarthritis</strong> &ndash; Patients with moderate to severe OA have persistent pain which significantly impairs functionality, activity participation, and quality of life.

The presence of misconceptions, such as that exercise will worsen OA or that OA will inevitably get worse, may attenuate the results of treatment if not properly identified and countered. Patient education about OA and its treatment options can occur during the clinical encounter and can be complemented by provision of written materials and referral to national or rheumatology association websites. Creating realistic and positive expectations for treatment efficacy may enhance adherence, especially to therapies that require lifestyle changes, and has been shown to influence treatment outcomes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-knee-osteoarthritis/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>]. The management principles for OA, including education, self-management, and goal-setting, are discussed in detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-the-management-of-osteoarthritis#H730969074\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of the management of osteoarthritis&quot;, section on 'General principles'</a>.)</p><p>The management of patients with knee OA should include a holistic assessment. Monitoring of the patient's response to therapy should also be done on a regular basis. A detailed discussion on monitoring and assessment of OA patients can be found elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-the-management-of-osteoarthritis#H2272348207\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of the management of osteoarthritis&quot;, section on 'Monitoring and assessment'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H718563178\"><span class=\"h1\">APPROACH BASED ON CLINICAL PRESENTATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients with knee osteoarthritis (OA) may fall into different categories that must be considered when making treatment decisions.</p><p>Our management approach is generally consistent with guidelines developed by professional organizations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-knee-osteoarthritis/abstract/3-8\" class=\"abstract_t\">3-8</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1065224283\"><span class=\"h2\">Mild knee osteoarthritis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Nonpharmacologic therapies alone or in combination with topical therapies or analgesics on an as-needed basis are likely to provide adequate control of symptoms in this group of patients (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RHEUM%2F116141\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef116141 \">algorithm 1</a>).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3409712125\"><span class=\"h2\">Moderate/severe knee osteoarthritis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Nonpharmacologic interventions are the first-line therapy for this group of patients, and aquatic exercises are usually better tolerated than land-based exercises in patients with severe pain (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RHEUM%2F116142\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef116142 \">algorithm 2</a>). Special consideration should be given to extraarticular factors potentially contributing to pain, such as mood disturbances, pain catastrophizing, and sleep problems (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-the-management-of-osteoarthritis#H277527328\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of the management of osteoarthritis&quot;, section on 'Factors affecting response to therapy'</a>). Other treatment alternatives may be required, including oral nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), intraarticular steroids, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=duloxetine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">duloxetine</a>, and surgery.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H211075715\"><span class=\"h2\">Knee osteoarthritis with one or more joints involved</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>OA can be localized in the knee only or occur concomitantly with OA in multiple joints. The best approach for managing patients with multijoint, symptomatic OA is to prioritize therapies that address the pain at the individual level and not at the joint level. Local interventions such as intraarticular steroid injections, topical NSAIDs or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=capsaicin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">capsaicin</a>, and knee braces may help with knee pain but are likely to be insufficient to provide adequate improvement in the patient's OA symptoms as a whole.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1894002817\"><span class=\"h2\">Patients with comorbidities</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Knee OA is often comorbid with other conditions such as cardiovascular disease, diabetes, hypertension, obesity, depression, and peptic ulcer disease. In addition, knee OA is highly prevalent in the older adult population, although it is important to note that its diagnosis usually occurs earlier in life (median age 55 years) and around two-thirds of the patients are younger than 65 years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-knee-osteoarthritis/abstract/9,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,10</a>]. Therapies should be chosen to minimize the potential for adverse events while optimizing function and quality of life. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=comorbidities-that-impact-management-of-osteoarthritis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Comorbidities that impact management of osteoarthritis&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3667641808\"><span class=\"h1\">MILD KNEE OSTEOARTHRITIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Nonpharmacologic interventions are the backbone of knee osteoarthritis (OA) management, irrespective of OA severity, and can be used in combination with pharmacologic therapy (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RHEUM%2F116141\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef116141 \">algorithm 1</a>). The duration of therapy depends upon the individual patient's needs; however, lifelong treatment with nonpharmacologic therapies is generally recommended in order to relieve symptoms and prevent further joint damage.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H24067787\"><span class=\"h2\">Initial nonpharmacologic measures</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Nonpharmacologic interventions in the management of patients with mild OA includes exercise and, when pertinent, weight loss.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H849299743\"><span class=\"h3\">Exercise</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In all patients with knee OA, we recommend ongoing exercise for pain relief and joint protection. Exercise, alongside weight loss when indicated, is a core component of knee OA management [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-knee-osteoarthritis/abstract/1,2,4,11,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2,4,11,12</a>]. All patients with knee OA should be counseled on exercise irrespective of age, radiographic disease severity, pain intensity, functional levels, and comorbidities. A Cochrane review of 54 trials, among which 19 were considered as &quot;low risk of bias,&quot; concluded that there is moderate- to high-quality evidence suggesting that land-based exercise improves knee pain and function with moderate effect size immediately after treatment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-knee-osteoarthritis/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. This magnitude of effect is comparable to that reported for oral nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-knee-osteoarthritis/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. However, the benefits of exercise were not sustained in the long term, which is largely related to the decreasing adherence rates to the exercise program over time [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-knee-osteoarthritis/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. Strategies to improve adherence should be adopted, such as patient education about OA and the benefits of exercise and long-term monitoring. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-the-management-of-osteoarthritis#H730969074\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of the management of osteoarthritis&quot;, section on 'General principles'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-the-management-of-osteoarthritis#H2272348207\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of the management of osteoarthritis&quot;, section on 'Monitoring and assessment'</a>.)</p><p>At present, there is no strong evidence on the best prescription of exercise modalities and dosage (ie, intensity, duration, and frequency) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-knee-osteoarthritis/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. In clinical practice, exercise prescription is frequently personalized according to individual findings. We refer our patients for physical therapy to optimize the effectiveness of the exercise program [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-knee-osteoarthritis/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. We prefer a combination of low-impact aerobic fitness training (eg, walking, cycling, rowing, and deep-water running) and lower-limb strengthening exercises, which addresses the full spectrum of impairments in most patients with knee OA. Nevertheless, exercise choice should be also based on patient's mobility, specific impairments (eg, strength, range of motion, aerobic fitness, and balance), and preferences [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-knee-osteoarthritis/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. Exercises involving high impact on the joints such as running or jumping are usually discouraged in order to avoid further joint damage, especially in cases of more advanced OA, although research evidence demonstrating an association between running and progression of knee OA is scarce [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-knee-osteoarthritis/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. Stretching or flexibility exercises, particularly of the hamstrings to avoid or minimize flexion contracture of the knee, can also be part of the exercise program to increase knee range of motion. [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-knee-osteoarthritis/abstract/13,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,14</a>]</p><p>Aquatic exercise also has clinically relevant effects on knee pain, function, and stiffness, but the effects are small when compared with non-treatment controls [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-knee-osteoarthritis/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. This exercise modality is particularly useful for patients with severe pain <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> poor physical function due to its better tolerance and lower potential to cause adverse events.</p><p>We also consider Tai Chi as a treatment option for the rehabilitation of patients with knee OA, according to patients' preferences. Despite the limited number of large trials investigating the long-term effects of Tai Chi, it has been shown to be as effective as a standard exercise program after 12 weeks in terms of knee pain, physical function, and reduction in analgesic use, in addition to having greater improvement in depression [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-knee-osteoarthritis/abstract/17,18\" class=\"abstract_t\">17,18</a>]. Moreover, Tai Chi improves balance and is associated with a reduced falls risk in older patients with knee OA [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-knee-osteoarthritis/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2301488914\"><span class=\"h3\">Weight loss</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Because of the substantial load placed on the knees during weightbearing activities, maintaining an ideal body weight is critical to preserve joint structures and improve symptoms. In addition to the mechanical consequences of obesity and overweight to the joint, adipokines released by the adipose tissue such as leptin and adiponectin are directly involved in the inflammatory component of OA and cartilage damage [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-knee-osteoarthritis/abstract/20,21\" class=\"abstract_t\">20,21</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pathogenesis-of-osteoarthritis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pathogenesis of osteoarthritis&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=comorbidities-that-impact-management-of-osteoarthritis#H3997438495\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Comorbidities that impact management of osteoarthritis&quot;, section on 'Obesity'</a>.)</p><p>We encourage health care professionals to consult available local community programs or refer patients to a dietitian to ensure that overweight and obese patients are offered optimal support to lose weight [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-knee-osteoarthritis/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=obesity-in-adults-overview-of-management\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Obesity in adults: Overview of management&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Our approach of a combination of a calorie-restricted diet and physical activity to achieve weight loss is supported by several studies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-knee-osteoarthritis/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. As an example, the IDEA trial randomized 454 overweight and obese adults with knee OA into one of three groups: diet plus exercise, diet alone, or exercise alone [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-knee-osteoarthritis/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. Participants in the diet plus exercise group had the highest percentage of weight lost (11.4 percent of body weight) and improvement in pain after 18 months, achieving a decrease in pain scores of approximately 50 percent, with 38 percent of patients reporting no or little pain at the end of the trial.</p><p>Moreover, a dose-response relationship between the extent of percentage change in body weight and improvement in joint symptoms has been demonstrated, with more robust effects achieved when at least a 10 percent reduction in body weight is attained [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-knee-osteoarthritis/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. A reasonable initial target is a 5 to 10 percent weight reduction within a six-month period [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-knee-osteoarthritis/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>], and initial goals should be reassessed periodically and individually for each patient.</p><p>Caloric restriction, particularly in order adults, may contribute to loss of lean mass and lead to muscle weakness and should, therefore, be combined with strengthening exercises to prevent these adverse effects. Other interventions such as anti-obesity drugs (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=orlistat-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">orlistat</a>) and surgical approaches (eg, gastric bypass) are less well studied in the context of OA. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=obesity-in-adults-overview-of-management\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Obesity in adults: Overview of management&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2933843594\"><span class=\"h2\">Inadequate response to nonpharmacologic measures</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Pharmacologic therapy can be started in combination with or after a trial of nonpharmacologic interventions, if satisfactory pain relief is not achieved with these measures alone. Topical therapies (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RHEUM%2F112057\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef112057 \">table 1</a>) for the treatment of mild knee OA are particularly appealing due to the frequent presence of comorbid conditions in this patient population and the relatively common side effects of other systemic treatment options.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3054413191\"><span class=\"h3\">Topical NSAIDs</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>We suggest topical nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) rather than oral NSAIDs for patients with mild OA localized to the knee or with concomitant hand involvement, given the superficial location of the joints in these cases. A Cochrane review found that about 60 percent of patients achieved at least 50 percent improvement in pain with topical NSAIDs, which was comparable to the effect obtained with oral formulations and slightly better than that observed with topical placebo [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-knee-osteoarthritis/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. The risk of gastrointestinal, renal, and cardiovascular toxicity is much lower with topical NSAIDs as compared with its oral formulation due to the reduced systemic absorption (5- to 17-fold lower for topical <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diclofenac-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">diclofenac</a> compared with oral) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-knee-osteoarthritis/abstract/28,29\" class=\"abstract_t\">28,29</a>]. The tolerability profile is also better with topical NSAIDs, with mild skin rashes being the most commonly reported side effect. The drugs studied with the most frequency were diclofenac gel or solution and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ketoprofen-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ketoprofen</a>, applied over the affected knee two to four times daily, for the duration necessary to control symptoms. We most commonly use diclofenac gel, but the choice of topical agent may vary according to local availability and cost.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2586645375\"><span class=\"h3\">Topical capsaicin</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>For patients with mild OA localized to the knee or a few other joints in whom other treatments are ineffective or contraindicated, we suggest topical <a href=\"topic.htm?path=capsaicin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">capsaicin</a>. Capsaicin is a substance derived from hot chili peppers with the potential to alleviate pain through the down-regulation of the TRPV1 receptor activity on nociceptive sensory neurons and the depletion of substance P. Continued use of capsaicin results in desensitization of nociceptive fibers and inhibition of pain stimulus transmission. However, the causative role of substance P depletion on pain reduction associated with capsaicin use has come into question [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-knee-osteoarthritis/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>].</p><p>There are relatively few randomized controlled trials investigating topical <a href=\"topic.htm?path=capsaicin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">capsaicin</a> treatment for knee OA pain, most with a short follow-up (up to 12 weeks) and overall good methodological quality [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-knee-osteoarthritis/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]. In most studies, topical capsaicin was superior to placebo, with an overall 33 percent pain reduction after four weeks in one study, which was significantly greater than placebo [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-knee-osteoarthritis/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>]. In a 12-week randomized, multicenter trial, 113 patients received either capsaicin 0.025% cream four times daily or placebo [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-knee-osteoarthritis/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>]. Capsaicin provided greater pain relief after 4 to 12 weeks and a greater number of patients on capsaicin (81 percent) compared with placebo (54 percent) were improved based on physician's global evaluation.</p><p>Local burning sensation is the most common side effect of topical <a href=\"topic.htm?path=capsaicin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">capsaicin</a> and may occur in over half of patients. However, it is usually mild to moderate and improves with continued application. In addition, topical capsaicin should not come in contact with mucous membranes, abraded skin, eyes, or genital areas. Systemic adverse effects of capsaicin are not significantly higher compared with placebo.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H799961723\"><span class=\"h1\">MODERATE/SEVERE KNEE OSTEOARTHRITIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The management of moderate to severe knee osteoarthritis (OA) is discussed in detail separately.

In addition, there are other therapies in which the benefit remains uncertain. It would be reasonable, however, to try some of the therapies discussed below as adjunctive measures for patients who do not respond to the approach described above after consideration of potential harm, cost, and patient preference.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4102897152\"><span class=\"h2\">Insoles</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Due to the evidence indicating against the use of lateral wedge insole in medial compartment knee OA, we do not recommend their use. However, we consider medially wedged insoles for patients with lateral tibiofemoral OA and valgus deformity based on evidence from one study of significant improvements in pain for these patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-knee-osteoarthritis/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>]. Nevertheless, there are fewer studies investigating medial compared with lateral wedge insoles [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-knee-osteoarthritis/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>].</p><p>Lateral wedge insoles have been shown to modestly reduce the external knee adduction moment and thereby reduce medial knee joint loading. However, compared with control inserts (neutral soles), lateral wedge insoles provided no clinically significant improvement in pain in patients with medial knee OA, as examined in meta-analyses including trials with both neutral and no insole control [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-knee-osteoarthritis/abstract/35,36\" class=\"abstract_t\">35,36</a>]. Moreover, a randomized clinical trial including 200 participants with mild to moderate medial knee OA found no differences between full-length lateral wedged insole and flat insole in medial tibial and femoral cartilage volume loss and change in size of bone marrow lesions on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) over 12 months [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-knee-osteoarthritis/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2096440013\"><span class=\"h2\">Glucosamine and chondroitin</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In our clinical practice, we do not recommend these supplements routinely to all patients; however, we do not discourage their use for patients who are keen to take them, especially if symptomatic benefit is achieved with their use (except for glucosamine hydrochloride, which we recommend against). There have been conflicting results from randomized trials evaluating the efficacy of glucosamine and chondroitin in knee OA [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-knee-osteoarthritis/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>]. Results from reviews with larger, methodologically sound studies found negligible effects of glucosamine hydrochloride on knee pain, while higher doses or higher-grade formulations of glucosamine sulfate (1500 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day)</span> or chondroitin (800 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day)</span> showed more favorable results and may have a statistically significant but small effect on symptoms compared with placebo [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-knee-osteoarthritis/abstract/39-42\" class=\"abstract_t\">39-42</a>]. As an example, in an industry-sponsored randomized trial including 604 patients with symptomatic knee OA who were followed for six months, pharmaceutical-grade chondroitin sulfate was found to be statistically superior to placebo and similar to <a href=\"topic.htm?path=celecoxib-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">celecoxib</a> in reducing pain and improving function [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-knee-osteoarthritis/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>]. Either chondroitin (800 mg), celecoxib (200 mg), or placebo was given once daily in the evening. One important limitation of the study is the uncertain clinical relevance of the statistical significance for the primary outcomes, which were based on a degree of change from baseline on a visual analog scale (VAS) for pain (0 to 100 mm) and the Lequesne index (a composite score of pain and function). Also, the number of patients who achieved the minimal clinically important improvement of 20 mm on the VAS for pain was not different among the three groups. Other meta-analyses also suggested that glucosamine sulfate (1500 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day)</span> and chondroitin (800 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day)</span> may have small effects in delaying structural progression of OA with long-term use (two to three years) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-knee-osteoarthritis/abstract/43,44\" class=\"abstract_t\">43,44</a>].</p><p>A strong placebo effect has been demonstrated in the studies involving these dietary supplements. This is well illustrated by the landmark <span class=\"nowrap\">Glucosamine/Chondroitin</span> Intervention Trial (GAIT), in which around 60 percent of participants experienced at least 20 percent pain reduction irrespective of whether they received placebo, glucosamine hydrochloride, chondroitin, or the combination of both [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-knee-osteoarthritis/abstract/45\" class=\"abstract_t\">45</a>] (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-the-management-of-osteoarthritis#H277527328\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of the management of osteoarthritis&quot;, section on 'Factors affecting response to therapy'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-the-management-of-osteoarthritis#H138459518\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of the management of osteoarthritis&quot;, section on 'Role of placebo effect'</a>). In another multicenter randomized noninferiority trial, 164 patients with moderate to severe knee OA were treated with either chondroitin sulfate plus glucosamine or placebo [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-knee-osteoarthritis/abstract/46\" class=\"abstract_t\">46</a>]. At six months' follow-up, the mean reduction in the global pain score was significantly greater in the placebo group (33 percent) compared with the chondroitin sulfate plus glucosamine group (19 percent). Limitations of the study include the small size and potentially inadequate dosing of chondroitin and glucosamine. However, it is of note that the risk of any adverse event with these supplements is low and comparable to placebo. Due to these contradictory and still uncertain data, glucosamine and chondroitin are not strongly recommended by major OA guidelines [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-knee-osteoarthritis/abstract/3,5,47\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,5,47</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3154930506\"><span class=\"h2\">Other nutritional supplements</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There is limited evidence supporting the use of other nutritional supplements for knee OA. In clinical practice, we often trial supplements such as fish oil, curcumin (active ingredient of turmeric), <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> <em>Boswellia serrata</em> for knee OA patients for symptomatic relief. Of note, as curcumin is poorly absorbed by the gastrointestinal tract, curcumin supplements formulated to enhance absorption and bioavailability are usually preferred (eg, combinations of curcumin with piperine or bioperine, a constituent of black pepper).</p><p>A systematic review and meta-analysis of nutritional supplements for OA of the knee, hand, or hip including 69 studies (20 different supplements) found large and clinically important effects for seven supplements (L-carnitine, Pycnogenol, curcumin, <em>Boswellia serrata</em> extract, <em>Curcuma longa</em> extract, passion fruit peel extract, and collagen hydrolysate) compared with placebo in reducing pain in the short-term (&le;3 months) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-knee-osteoarthritis/abstract/48\" class=\"abstract_t\">48</a>]. Most of these supplements were investigated in only a limited number of small trials, and the quality of evidence for this finding was variable (very low to moderate). Six other supplements (undenatured type II collagen, avocado soybean unsaponifiables, methylsulfonylmethane, diacerein, glucosamine, and chondroitin) were statistically better than placebo, but it was unclear if the effects were clinically important. Among the trials reporting long-term outcomes (&gt;6 months, n = 17), no supplement was found to have clinically important effects on pain. The meta-analysis found no increased risk of side effects of supplements compared with placebo, except for diacerein, although safety profile was investigated in only a limited number of trials. It is also important to note that most trials (64 percent) were industry funded and were considered at high or unclear risk of bias (46 and 44 percent, respectively).</p><p>In another study, vitamin D supplementation had no benefit over placebo on pain and change in tibial cartilage volume over two years in a large clinical trial [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-knee-osteoarthritis/abstract/49\" class=\"abstract_t\">49</a>]. A study assessing the efficacy of low- versus high-dose fish oil (0.45 and 4.5 g omega 3 fatty acids, respectively) on clinical outcomes found greater improvements in pain and function in the group receiving low-dose fish oil at two years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-knee-osteoarthritis/abstract/50\" class=\"abstract_t\">50</a>]. Adverse events were common in both groups, particularly gastrointestinal events (around 60 percent in each group) such as gastrointestinal upset and reflux. Fish oil has also been studied in rheumatoid arthritis with positive results, probably through the antiinflammatory effects of the eicosapentaenoic and docosahexaenoic acids. However, its clinical benefit in OA is still unclear.</p><p>Limited evidence has also suggested that phytoflavonoids, a class of natural compounds with antiinflammatory properties, may have beneficial effects on knee OA symptoms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-knee-osteoarthritis/abstract/51-53\" class=\"abstract_t\">51-53</a>]. <a href=\"topic.htm?path=flavocoxid-united-states-note-fda-has-issued-a-warning-against-use-of-this-product-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Flavocoxid</a>, a specific type of phytoflavonoid, has been associated with reports of serious adverse events related to liver injury and hypersensitivity pneumonitis, and its use is not recommended.

We use it in the lowest dose and duration necessary to control symptoms and monitor common side effects.</p><p>A 2014 meta-analysis revealed an overall small effect size (standardized mean difference [SMD] -0.28, 95% CI -0.35 to -0.20) of non-tramadol opioids on pain reduction, which corresponds to a difference of 0.7 cm on VAS (0 to 10 cm) between opioids and placebo [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-knee-osteoarthritis/abstract/54\" class=\"abstract_t\">54</a>]. Improvement in knee function was also small, and there was no influence of daily <a href=\"topic.htm?path=morphine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">morphine</a> equivalence dose on the benefits on function. Patients receiving opioids were more likely to drop out due to adverse events and more likely to experience side effects (6.5 versus 1.7 percent and 22 versus 15 percent, respectively) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-knee-osteoarthritis/abstract/54\" class=\"abstract_t\">54</a>].

Nevertheless, evidence supporting its efficacy on OA symptoms has been growing rapidly. Injection of intraarticular PRP resulted in significant improvement in knee pain and function over intraarticular placebo and intraarticular HA up to 12 months post-injection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-knee-osteoarthritis/abstract/60\" class=\"abstract_t\">60</a>]. However, evidence is still limited due to overall high risk of bias in previous trials and great variability between studies regarding the number of injections (generally one to four), interval between injections, preparation of the PRP, and volume injected [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-knee-osteoarthritis/abstract/60\" class=\"abstract_t\">60</a>].

Patient education about OA and its treatment options can occur during the clinical encounter and can be complemented by provision of written materials. Monitoring of the patient's response to therapy should also be done on a regular basis.

Nonpharmacologic therapies alone or in combination with topical therapies or analgesics on an as-needed basis are likely to provide adequate control of symptoms (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RHEUM%2F116141\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef116141 \">algorithm 1</a>).

We prefer a combination of low-impact aerobic fitness training (eg, walking, cycling, rowing, and deep-water running) and lower-limb strengthening exercises.
