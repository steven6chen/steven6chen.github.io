Successful strategies for the production of standard dialysis fluid are well established and are discussed elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=maintaining-water-quality-for-hemodialysis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Maintaining water quality for hemodialysis&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Contemporary dialysis machines are designed so that bacteria- and endotoxin-retentive filters can be installed as an integral part of the dialysis fluid pathway [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ultrapure-dialysis-fluid/abstract/17,18\" class=\"abstract_t\">17,18</a>]. This design enables the filters to be sanitized whenever the dialysis machines are disinfected. Because dialysis membranes vary in their capacity to remove microbiologic contaminants [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ultrapure-dialysis-fluid/abstract/17,18\" class=\"abstract_t\">17,18</a>], only filters that have been validated by the manufacturer to remove bacteria and endotoxin for a given period of time or number of dialysis treatments (even with repeated disinfection) should be used for the final filtration step. Even then, those filters do not remove some small bacterial products, such as fragments of bacterial DNA [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ultrapure-dialysis-fluid/abstract/19,20\" class=\"abstract_t\">19,20</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7081050\"><span class=\"h1\">MONITORING DIALYSIS FLUID QUALITY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The microbiologic quality of ultrapure dialysis fluid is monitored by cultures and endotoxin measurements. Samples for determination of the microbiologic quality of ultrapure dialysis fluid should be&nbsp;obtained&nbsp;immediately before system disinfection in order to test the lowest&nbsp;quality conditions.</p><p>Highly sensitive methods are required to determine microbial contaminant levels in ultrapure dialysis fluid. This is because standard techniques that are usually used to quantitate microbial counts (such the spread or pour plate methods) are not sufficiently sensitive for use in ultrapure dialysis fluid.</p><p>The preferred method for testing ultrapure dialysis fluid is the membrane filtration test. The membrane&nbsp;filtration test involves filtering a volume of dialysis fluid through a&nbsp;membrane filter with a pore diameter of 0.45 micrometer or less.&nbsp;After filtration, the membrane filter is applied to the surface of the incubation medium. The volume filtered should be sufficient to yield 20 to 100 colonies per plate under worst-case conditions for ultrapure dialysis fluid. Thus, 200 to 1000 mL of fluid should be filtered to reliably demonstrate a microbial level of &lt;0.1 colony-forming unit <span class=\"nowrap\">(CFU)/mL</span>.&nbsp;In cases where the quality of the&nbsp;fluid is unknown, it might be necessary to prepare&nbsp;several membrane&nbsp;filters with different sample volumes. Such tests are not required, however, if the system is fitted with an endotoxin-retentive filter&nbsp;validated by the&nbsp;manufacturer and that is operated and monitored in accordance&nbsp;with the manufacturer&rsquo;s instructions, unless the&nbsp;manufacturer requires such tests to&nbsp;be performed.</p><p>The filter is cultured in tryptone glucose extract agar (TGEA) supplemented with 4 percent <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sodium-bicarbonate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">sodium bicarbonate</a> or Reasoner's 2A (R2A) culture medium. The period of incubation should be 168 hours (seven days) at an incubation temperature of 17 to 23&deg;C [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ultrapure-dialysis-fluid/abstract/1,3,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,3,5</a>]. The international standard in the United States contains a national deviation that also allows the use of Trypticase Soy Agar or Standard Methods Agar incubated for 48 hours at 35&deg;C [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ultrapure-dialysis-fluid/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. These culturing conditions have not yet been included in the equivalent international standard [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ultrapure-dialysis-fluid/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>], because of an ongoing debate regarding their validation and equivalence to the other conditions listed above.</p><p>Routine microbial checks outlined in standards and practice guidelines do not include testing for mycobacteria or fungi. Fungi are opportunistic pathogens that have been demonstrated in dialysis fluid [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ultrapure-dialysis-fluid/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>] and are involved in the formation of biofilm [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ultrapure-dialysis-fluid/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. While contamination with fungi may present a risk of invasive fungal infection to dialysis patients, there is insufficient knowledge about the contamination threshold at which the risk is conferred, which makes it difficult to require routine monitoring.</p><p>Endotoxin levels are measured with the limulus amebocyte lysate (LAL) assay. Three different versions of the assay are available: gel clot, turbidimetric, and chromogenic assays. The gel-clot version is available in a range of sensitivities (0.015 to 0.5 endotoxin units <span class=\"nowrap\">[EU]/mL)</span> and is adequate to demonstrate that dialysis fluid meets the endotoxin criterion for ultrapure. The kinetic chromogenic assays are the most sensitive and are capable of detecting concentrations as low as 0.001 <span class=\"nowrap\">EU/mL</span>.</p><p>The LAL assay does not detect other proinflammatory bacterial products that can pass through the dialyzer membrane, such as oligonucleotides, peptidoglycans, and fragments of bacterial DNA [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ultrapure-dialysis-fluid/abstract/19,20,22,23\" class=\"abstract_t\">19,20,22,23</a>]. These products have been associated with inflammatory markers (C-reactive protein [CRP] and interleukin-6 [IL-6]) in hemodialysis patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ultrapure-dialysis-fluid/abstract/19,22\" class=\"abstract_t\">19,22</a>]. Laboratory techniques are available for the quantification of such material. Oligonucleotides can be quantified using commercially produced assay kits with an ultrasensitive fluorescent nucleic acid stain, and peptidoglycans can be quantified by the silkworm larvae plasma (SLP) test [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ultrapure-dialysis-fluid/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. Short bacterial DNA fragments can be quantified spectrophotometrically [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ultrapure-dialysis-fluid/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>], or by the use of 16sRNA gene polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ultrapure-dialysis-fluid/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. Such techniques, however, are not currently used in routine clinical practice.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12784512\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL BENEFITS OF ULTRAPURE DIALYSIS FLUID</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In common with the recommendations of clinical practice guidelines [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ultrapure-dialysis-fluid/abstract/6-8\" class=\"abstract_t\">6-8</a>], we suggest the use of ultrapure dialysis fluid for all hemodialysis patients, when possible. The use of ultrapure dialysis fluid may decrease the chronic inflammatory response that is present in hemodialysis patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ultrapure-dialysis-fluid/abstract/19,25-40\" class=\"abstract_t\">19,25-40</a>] (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=inflammation-in-renal-insufficiency\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Inflammation in renal insufficiency&quot;</a>). Decreasing the inflammatory response may improve cardiovascular risk and other morbidities associated with chronic hemodialysis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ultrapure-dialysis-fluid/abstract/41-46\" class=\"abstract_t\">41-46</a>]. However, to date, the benefits of ultrapure dialysis have been demonstrated on surrogate rather than clinical endpoints. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=risk-factors-and-epidemiology-of-coronary-heart-disease-in-end-stage-renal-disease-dialysis#H4\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Risk factors and epidemiology of coronary heart disease in end-stage renal disease (dialysis)&quot;, section on 'Risk factors unique to chronic kidney disease'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=secondary-prevention-of-cardiovascular-disease-in-end-stage-renal-disease-dialysis#H2\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Secondary prevention of cardiovascular disease in end-stage renal disease (dialysis)&quot;, section on 'Coronary heart disease risk equivalent'</a>.)</p><p>The use of ultrapure dialysis fluid has also been associated with improvements in anemia, reduction in dialysis-related amyloidosis, and improved nutritional status. Some studies have suggested a reduction in mortality.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1938084\"><span class=\"h2\">Anemia correction</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The use of ultrapure dialysis fluid has been associated with improved utilization of erythropoietin-stimulating agents (ESAs). Studies have shown that the use of ultrapure dialysis fluid is associated with a decrease in the ESA dose required to achieve a target hematocrit or hemoglobin concentration [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ultrapure-dialysis-fluid/abstract/31,33,35,37,47\" class=\"abstract_t\">31,33,35,37,47</a>]. Other studies have shown that changing to ultrapure dialysis fluid is associated with increases in hematocrit or hemoglobin concentrations with stable ESA doses [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ultrapure-dialysis-fluid/abstract/34,38,48\" class=\"abstract_t\">34,38,48</a>]. In a meta-analysis that included 15 studies, changing to ultrapure dialysis fluid was associated with a 273 unit decrease in the weekly ESA dose (95% CI -420 to -126) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ultrapure-dialysis-fluid/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>]. If the meta-analysis was limited to controlled trials, ultrapure dialysis fluid was associated with an 1188 unit decrease in ESA dose (95% CI -2,371 to -4).</p><p>Two studies have not shown an improvement in ESA utilization [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ultrapure-dialysis-fluid/abstract/49,50\" class=\"abstract_t\">49,50</a>]. It is not clear why these two studies did not find better ESA utilization with ultrapure dialysis fluid, but possible reasons may include other differences in dialysis delivery between groups that were not reported. It may be significant that, in the two negative studies, the introduction of ultrapure dialysis fluid was not associated with a reduction in inflammatory markers. By contrast, reductions in the inflammatory markers, C-reactive protein (CRP) and interleukin-6 (IL-6), were reported for all the studies in which an improvement in ESA utilization was found [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ultrapure-dialysis-fluid/abstract/31,33-35,37,38,48\" class=\"abstract_t\">31,33-35,37,38,48</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1938841\"><span class=\"h2\">Beta2-microglobulin and dialysis-related amyloid</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The use of ultrapure dialysis fluid may decrease the risk of clinical symptoms of dialysis-related amyloidosis, including carpel tunnel syndrome [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ultrapure-dialysis-fluid/abstract/51,52\" class=\"abstract_t\">51,52</a>]. As an example, the incidence of carpal tunnel syndrome was evaluated in 226 patients from two dialysis centers, one of which used ultrapure dialysis fluid, while the other used standard dialysis fluid [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ultrapure-dialysis-fluid/abstract/51\" class=\"abstract_t\">51</a>]. At a follow-up of six years, fewer patients using ultrapure dialysis fluid developed carpal tunnel symptoms compared with standard dialysis fluid (2 of 84 versus 24 of 103 patients) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ultrapure-dialysis-fluid/abstract/51\" class=\"abstract_t\">51</a>].</p><p>The mechanism by which the use of ultrapure dialysis decreases symptoms of amyloidosis is not clear. The use of ultrapure dialysis fluid has been associated with small reductions in predialysis concentrations of serum beta2-microglobulin concentrations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ultrapure-dialysis-fluid/abstract/34,36,39,50\" class=\"abstract_t\">34,36,39,50</a>] and in pentosidine [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ultrapure-dialysis-fluid/abstract/30,37\" class=\"abstract_t\">30,37</a>], both which may contribute to beta2-microglobulin amyloidosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ultrapure-dialysis-fluid/abstract/53\" class=\"abstract_t\">53</a>].

Conflicting findings have been reported concerning the use of ultrapure dialysis fluid. In some studies, ultrapure dialysis fluid has been associated with improvements in nutritional status, including increases in serum albumin [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ultrapure-dialysis-fluid/abstract/31,34,39,48,49\" class=\"abstract_t\">31,34,39,48,49</a>] and muscle mass [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ultrapure-dialysis-fluid/abstract/31,49\" class=\"abstract_t\">31,49</a>]. In a meta-analysis of 14 studies, conversion from standard to ultrapure dialysis fluid was associated with a 0.11 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/dL</span> increase in serum albumin (95% CI 0.02-0.19) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ultrapure-dialysis-fluid/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>].</p><p>However, not all studies have found an association between the use of ultrapure dialysis fluid and an improvement in nutritional status. Several report no change in serum albumin concentration over the 6 to 12 months following the introduction of ultrapure dialysis fluid [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ultrapure-dialysis-fluid/abstract/36,47,49,54\" class=\"abstract_t\">36,47,49,54</a>].</p><p>There is no clear explanation for these disparate findings, except for other differences in dialysis delivery that were not accounted for in the studies.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12785930\"><span class=\"h2\">Mortality</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The use of ultrapure dialysis fluid may be associated with a reduction in cardiovascular mortality in some patients. As an example, in one trial, patients were randomly assigned to either high- or low-flux dialysis and either ultrapure or standard dialysis fluid, using two-by-two factorial design [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ultrapure-dialysis-fluid/abstract/47\" class=\"abstract_t\">47</a>]. At three years of follow-up, there was no difference between standard and ultrapure dialysis fluid groups in the risk of a composite outcome of fatal and nonfatal cardiovascular events. However, in post-hoc analysis, ultrapure dialysis fluid was associated with a decreased risk of cardiovascular events among patients with older dialysis vintage (ie, more than three years on dialysis). Also, a large, retrospective, cohort study from Japan found that patients treated with dialysis fluid containing 0.1 endotoxin unit <span class=\"nowrap\">(EU)/mL</span> or more of endotoxin were at significantly greater risk of all-cause mortality than patients treated with dialysis fluid containing less than 0.001 <span class=\"nowrap\">EU/mL</span> of endotoxin (hazard ratio 1.28, 95% CI 1.10-1.480) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ultrapure-dialysis-fluid/abstract/55\" class=\"abstract_t\">55</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1939541\"><span class=\"h2\">Other clinical outcomes</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The use of ultrapure dialysis fluid has been associated with an improved response to hepatitis B vaccine [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ultrapure-dialysis-fluid/abstract/56\" class=\"abstract_t\">56</a>], improvements in dyslipidemia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ultrapure-dialysis-fluid/abstract/56,57\" class=\"abstract_t\">56,57</a>], and a slower rate of loss of residual renal function [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ultrapure-dialysis-fluid/abstract/58\" class=\"abstract_t\">58</a>].
