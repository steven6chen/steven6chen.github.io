Examples include advances in the scope of prenatal screening, including testing of maternal blood for disorders found in the fetus, diagnosis and molecular classification of rare genetic disease using next-generation sequencing, tumor classification by gene expression analysis, and pharmacogenetic applications for medication dosing. Gene identification for complex traits is also progressing rapidly. Findings from these investigations will undoubtedly translate into changes in clinical diagnostics in due time. A collection of online tutorials and instructional videos are also available at <a href=\"http://learn.genetics.utah.edu/&amp;token=/P1z+fuyqrJx6p35h+w5GgsolJ7WDZzBKXwDtAAMgR95DTRk22AWUS6chbzKy054&amp;TOPIC_ID=2900\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">http://learn.genetics.utah.edu</a>.</p><p>Physicians involved in the care of patients will require knowledge of the basic principles of genetics to adequately incorporate these applications into clinical practice.

(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=genetics-glossary-of-terms\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Genetics: Glossary of terms&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">PRINCIPLES OF MOLECULAR BIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The fundamental processes by which heritable information is stored, transmitted from generation to generation, and translated from genetic code to function in living organisms are common to all eukaryotes. These processes were termed the &ldquo;Central Dogma of Molecular Biology&rdquo; by Francis Crick in 1958 (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F54914\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef54914 \">figure 1</a>), although the use of the word &ldquo;Dogma&rdquo; has been debated subsequently.</p><p>Heritable genetic information is stored as long stretches of deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA), a stable molecule that is replicated and transmitted from one generation to the next. Segments of DNA can encode functional elements called genes that are transcribed into messenger ribonucleic acid (messenger RNA or mRNA). mRNA then serves as the template for protein synthesis in a process called translation.</p><p>The flow of information from DNA to RNA to protein is predominantly unidirectional. It is useful to consider the flow of information as a linear one for understanding how the genetic code translates to the development of an individual and how disruption of the normal DNA sequence can impact health and disease. However, it is understood that proteins and RNA species regulate the expression of specific DNA sequences and interactions between DNA, RNA, and protein are far more complex than suggested by the Central Dogma.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Nucleic acids</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>DNA and ribonucleic acid (RNA) are molecular chains that have a repeating modular structure consisting of 2-deoxyribose (for DNA) and ribose (for RNA) bound to one of four nucleic acids. Both 2-deoxyribose and ribose are five-carbon, ringed sugars (pentoses) and have numbered carbon atoms (1&rsquo; to 5&rsquo;). The sugar moieties are connected to each another by the formation of phosphodiester bonds between the 3rd and 5th positions of adjacent carbon rings (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F62789\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef62789 \">figure 2</a>).</p><p>In RNA, the 2' carbon is hydroxylated, making RNA molecules less stable and more susceptible to environmental damage, such as heat or ultraviolet light. DNA lacks this 2' hydroxyl group and has significantly greater stability. DNA may therefore be better suited for long-term information storage. The relative instability of RNA, in contrast, is ideal for an intermediate moiety involved in gene expression. Expressed genes (that is, genes transcribed from DNA to RNA for protein synthesis) can be readily &quot;turned-off&quot; or inactivated by RNA degradation, mediated through the enzyme ribonuclease (RNase).</p><p>Nucleic acids can be bound to the 1-carbon position of either ribose or 2-deoxyribose. The four bases in DNA are:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Adenine (A)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Guanine (G)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Cytosine (C)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Thymine (T)</p><p/><p>Adenine and guanine are purines; cytosine and thymine are pyrimidines. In RNA, the pyrimidine uracil (U), which lacks a methyl group on its ring, replaces thymine (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F60245\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef60245 \">figure 3</a>).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">The double helix and template-directed nucleic acid synthesis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Eukaryotic DNA exists, in its resting state, as two strands of DNA running antiparallel to each other that are wound into a double helical structure, called the double helix (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F56556\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef56556 \">figure 4</a>). The strands are held together by specific hydrogen bonds that form between the purines and pyrimidines: A and T (2 hydrogen bonds) or G and C (3 bonds).</p><p>The A:T and C:G pairings are specific, and thus the two DNA strands are complementary to each other. Transcription occurs from the antisense strand (3&rsquo; to 5&rsquo; direction). The rule of sequence complementarity provides the basis for accurate DNA replication and transcription, meaning that sequence is conserved both in newly synthesized DNA molecules and in transcribed RNA (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F73442\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef73442 \">figure 5</a>).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Mitosis and DNA replication</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Mitosis (M or M phase) is the stage of the cell cycle during which somatic cells divide. Mitosis produces identical daughter cells from the dividing cell (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F52419\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef52419 \">figure 6</a>).</p><p>Essential to this process is the need to maintain normal, diploid (2n) DNA content and conservation of sequence information among daughter cells. This is facilitated by DNA synthesis during the S phase of cell growth (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F68250\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef68250 \">figure 7</a>).</p><p>DNA replication begins with the separation of DNA strands (denaturation), a process facilitated by DNA helicase (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F73442\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef73442 \">figure 5</a>). The weakness of the hydrogen bonds between strands allows denaturation to occur at physiologic temperatures. DNA polymerase binds to the 3' end of single strand template DNA and proceeds in a 3' to 5' direction, adding nucleic acids that are complementary to the single-stranded template (antisense strand). The nascent DNA chain grows 5' to 3' manner, with DNA polymerase catalyzing the formation of the phosphodiester bonds between the nucleic acids.</p><p>Both strands of the double helix serve as templates. The orientation of the antisense strand (3' to 5') is amenable to continuous DNA replication in a 5' to 3' direction. This strand is referred to as the leading strand. The other strand is termed the lagging strand or sense strand. Its replication is discontinuous, as the replication complex must await exposure of the 3' portion of the strand. Okazaki fragments are the newly synthesized, discontinuous DNA segments on the lagging strand that are then joined together by DNA ligase. In general, DNA replication is semi-conservative, in that each replicated DNA molecule contains one old and one newly synthesized strand.</p><p>DNA replication occurs with high fidelity, with an estimated error rate of 10<sup>(-9)</sup> to 10<sup>(-11)</sup> per incorporated nucleotide in eukaryotes. These low rates reflect the low intrinsic DNA polymerase error rates of 10<sup>(-5)</sup>, and the fidelity of 3' to 5' exonucleases and cellular proofreading machinery.</p><p>Despite this high degree of accuracy, both germline and somatic sequence errors (sequence polymorphisms or mutations) can occur due to the magnitude of DNA sequence replicated over a lifetime (6 x 10<sup>(26)</sup> bases). Some common error types include single base pair substitutions or slipped strand mispairing that can result in missense mutations or insertion deletion mutations or polymorphisms. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-genetic-variation\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of genetic variation&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Meiosis and sustained genetic diversity</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Meiosis is the process of cell division for the purpose of gamete formation (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F61539\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef61539 \">figure 8</a>).</p><p>The goals of meiosis are different from those of mitosis. The goal of mitosis is to generate diploid (2n) progeny cells with identical genetic information. In contrast, the goal of meiosis is to generate genetically distinct haploid (n) cells that can participate in fertilization with other haploid gametes.</p><p>Meiosis differs from mitosis in the following ways:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Two sets of cell division occur, resulting in four haploid cells.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Chromosome information is exchanged between chromosome pairs (typically each comprising a maternally and a paternally inherited chromosome) through the process of recombination (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F59656\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef59656 \">figure 9</a>). This recombination results in swapping of homologous chromosomal material between chromatids and the creation of novel haplotypes that contain genetic information from both chromosomes. A haplotype refers to the specific combination of alleles on a chromosome.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Chromosomes segregate independently from each other during both sets of cell division. As a result, this independent assortment yields four haploid genomes that each contain a mix of maternal and paternal chromosome material.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The combined processes of recombination and independent assortment assures that each gamete is unique, different from that of the individual in which they are formed, and different from those of the individual's parents.</p><p/><p>Chromosomal recombination and independent assortment are the primary forces of ensuring genetic diversity during reproduction.</p><p>Errors during meiosis can introduce structural genetic variation. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-genetic-variation\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of genetic variation&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Non-homologous recombination, often referred to as non-allelic homologous recombination (NAHR), is an error in crossing-over because of faulty chromosome alignment. Non-homologous recombination can lead to the creation of gene duplications or deletions, or more complex chromosome rearrangements. Examples include the exchange between chromosome 9 and chromosome 22 that results in the t(9:22) translocation of chronic myeloid leukemia.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Segregation errors due to nondisjunction can lead to numerical chromosome aberrations, such as monosomies or trisomies. Nondisjunction describes an error in meiosis in which chromosomes or sister chromatids segregate together into one gamete, rather than each segregating into different gametes.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">RNA transcription</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>RNA transcription is template-directed, but differs from DNA replication in several fundamental ways:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>DNA replication is a global and simultaneous process across the genome that occurs during the S phase of the cell cycle. In contrast, RNA transcription is a local and contextual process, occurring at distinct genomic positions at defined times in response to various triggers.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>RNA transcription is regulated through the coordinated actions of cellular machinery that control DNA unfolding and chromatin activation, transcription factor binding, and regulation of mRNA metabolism.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>RNA transcription is initiated by the binding of specific transcription factors to DNA sequence motifs flanking the gene of interest. The binding of these factors initiates a cascade of programmed protein recruitment ultimately leading to the binding of RNA polymerase to the 5' end of the gene DNA sequence.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Like DNA polymerase, RNA polymerase catalyzes RNA chain elongation by reading the DNA template and driving the formation of 3' to 5' phosphodiesterase bonds. However, RNA polymerase substitutes uracil for thymine moieties.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>RNA transcription is frequently under genetic control. Polymorphisms that differentially affect the binding of transcription factors, enhancers, or repressors; or variants that alter chromatin structure, can impede or enhance gene transcription, and contribute substantially to inter-individual differences in gene expression. These polymorphisms are often implicated as susceptibility factors for common, complex genetic traits [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/principles-of-molecular-genetics/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Post-transcription modification of mRNA</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Prior to the process of translation (formation of specific proteins from an RNA template), precursor mRNA (pre-mRNA), the first RNA transcript that contains both exons and introns, undergoes several modifications: splicing, capping, and polyadenylation (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F70605\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef70605 \">figure 10</a>).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h3\">Splicing</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>RNA transcription is a continuous process, yet the DNA sequence that codes for protein (exons) is often interrupted by intervening non-coding sequences (introns). These intron segments must be removed or spliced out of the RNA prior to translation.</p><p>The splicing process can lead to production of several different proteins from one gene. The following factors are involved:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Spliceosomes are enzymatic ribonucleoprotein complexes that remove introns from the primary RNA transcript (pre-mRNA) to produce mature mRNA.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Intron boundaries are marked by conserved splice donor (end of an <span class=\"nowrap\">exon/start</span> of an intron) and splice acceptor (end of an <span class=\"nowrap\">intron/start</span> of an exon) sites. These splice sites provide sequence recognition sites for the spliceosomes. Mutations that alter splice sites can impair normal splicing and can cause disease.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Tissue-specific splicing is regulated by the binding of enhancers and suppressors to DNA. Differential exon splicing leads to formation of related but unique mRNA sequences that encode different proteins, known as protein isoforms.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Differential splicing of coding exons results in differences in the ultimate protein structure. Hence, genes often encode more than one protein (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F68285\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef68285 \">figure 11</a>).</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h3\">Capping</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>To improve transcript stability, the 5' end of mRNA is modified by the linking of an inverted methylated guanosine (m7G). The cap prevents 5' binding to other nucleic acid chains. Other functions include protection from exonucleases, initiation of translation through ribosomal binding, and mRNA translocation from nucleus to cytoplasm.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h3\">Polyadenylation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A long tail of adenine molecules is added to the 3' end of most transcripts (polyA tail). In addition to increasing transcript stability, the polyA tail is needed for proper tertiary structure formation and subsequent initiation of translation.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h2\">Translation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Mature mRNA serves as template to direct the synthesis of proteins [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/principles-of-molecular-genetics/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. Like DNA and RNA, protein is composed of modular units (amino acids) linked together in a chain. The protein backbone is composed of aminocarboxyl moieties linked together, with the chemical characteristics of each amino acid determined by 1 of 20 side chains (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F78753\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef78753 \">figure 12</a>). The mature mRNA dictates the linear sequence of amino acids.</p><p>Proteins differ from each other by their polypeptide sequence. The collective interactions of the various side chains confer tertiary polypeptide structure, which in turn confers distinct functions.</p><p>mRNA is transported from the nucleus to the endoplasmic reticulum in the cytoplasm. The endoplasmic reticulum is composed of ribosomes, complex ribonucleoprotein structures that include the enzymatic machinery for protein synthesis. Ribosomal proteins bind the 5' end of mRNA to initiate translation.</p><p>Protein synthesis is template directed and the base sequence in mRNA specifies the amino acid sequence in the protein. The specific amino acid sequence can be decoded by reading groups of three consecutive bases. These base triplets are known as codons.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>There are 64 codons (each codon is a 3 base triplet and there are 4 possible bases for each position). Almost all codons encode one of the 20 amino acids used in protein synthesis with the exceptions of three stop or termination codons. Most amino acids can be specified by more than one codon, termed functional redundancy or degeneracy (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F73711\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef73711 \">figure 13</a>). One codon, AUG, serves the dual functions of signaling the start of translation and encoding methionine.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Codons differing only at the third base position typically code for the same amino acid or amino acids with similar chemical properties.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Three codons (UGA, UAA, and UAG) do not code for amino acids but signal the end of the protein (stop or termination codons).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>By convention, codons are listed as mRNA sequences, with U for uracil replacing T for thymine. The nucleic acid sequence is written in a 5' to 3' direction, and the protein sequence is recorded from N-terminal to C-terminal. These directions correspond to the direction of synthesis.</p><p/><p>RNA translation is initiated when the ribosomal unit recognizes the initiation or start codon (typically AUG, coding for methionine). The ribosomal unit exposes the AUG codon, enabling binding of transfer RNA (tRNA). tRNAs are RNAs that bind specific codons.</p><p>Each tRNA has a complementary 3-base sequence (the anti-codon) corresponding to the 3-based codon encoding a specific amino acid. The methionine-bound tRNA binds to the initiation codon, facilitating 3' advancement of the ribosomal machinery and in turn exposing the subsequent adjacent 3-base codon for recognition by the appropriate anti-codon tRNA. The corresponding amino acid residue is joined to the methionine. This process is repeated so that successive amino acids are incorporated into the growing polypeptide chain (chain elongation) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F59052\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef59052 \">figure 14</a>). Translation is terminated after one of the three stop codons (UGA, UAA, or UAG) is reached; thereafter, no additional amino acid is added.</p><p>The progressive movement of the ribosome along the RNA molecule allows multiple ribosomes to simultaneously synthesize copies of a protein from a single mRNA molecule. This can be observed microscopically by the presence of polyribosomes, termed polysomes, which represent tight, spatial arrays of ribosomes translating a single mRNA molecule.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h2\">Post-translational modification</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Proteins often undergo additional modifications following translation. Possible protein modifications include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Activation through cleavage of an upstream leader sequence by a protease (eg, the cleavage of proinsulin to active insulin)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Regulatory modification (eg, addition of a small chemical group: glycosylation [addition of a glycosyl group], carboxylation, phosphorylation [addition of a phosphate group], and oxidation)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Structural modifications (eg, attachment of membrane anchoring molecules)</p><p/><p>The general principles regarding the unidirectional flow of biological information (DNA to mRNA to protein) are reflected in most cellular processes. However, exceptions to these principles abound.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Not all functional RNA codes for protein. Many DNA sequences that are actively transcribed to RNA do not encode proteins. In addition to mRNA and tRNA discussed above, other types of RNA include:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Ribosomal RNA (rRNA), the RNA contained within a ribosome. rRNA may combine with ribosomal proteins to facilitate translation.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Small nuclear RNA (snRNA) molecules combine with splicing proteins to form the spliceosome.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Some double stranded RNAs, known as short-interfering RNA (siRNA), direct the targeted degradation of homologous mRNA molecules, interfering with their translation into proteins [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/principles-of-molecular-genetics/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Many viruses store their genetic information as RNA rather than as DNA. Several different mechanisms have been incorporated into viral life cycles to accommodate this difference from the biology of their host cells.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Retroviruses utilize reverse transcription to integrate into the host genome following infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/principles-of-molecular-genetics/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. In these instances, the flow of genetic information is from RNA to DNA, then back to RNA prior to translation.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The mitochondrial genetic code differs from the nuclear genetic code in that UGA encodes tryptophan, rather than a termination codon [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/principles-of-molecular-genetics/abstract/7,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,8</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Epigenetic modifications, including DNA methylation and genetic imprinting, are inherited (transmissible from parent to offspring) changes in gene activity that occur without alterations to DNA sequence.

The mechanisms of template-directed replication and transcription allow for preservation of genetic information that will encode functional proteins.</p><p>Errors in these processes, as well as intrinsic properties of this molecular machinery, have direct implications for the practice of medicine.
