It happens when your adrenal glands are not working right. The adrenal glands are a pair of organs that are located on top of the kidneys (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F67279\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef67279 \">figure 1</a>). These glands make a lot of different hormones, including 2 hormones that are very important for normal body function:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Cortisol &ndash; This hormone helps control how the body uses sugar and how it responds to stress.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Aldosterone &ndash; This hormone helps control the amount of salt and fluid in the body.</p><p/><p>Adrenal crisis happens when the adrenal glands do not release enough cortisol, or cortisol and aldosterone. If you do not have enough of these hormones, your body can go into shock. That is when your blood pressure drops to a dangerously low level and you pass out. Adrenal crisis is a medical emergency.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H112905599\"><span class=\"h1\">What are the symptoms of adrenal crisis?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Adrenal crisis usually comes on suddenly. The symptoms can include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Vomiting</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Belly pain</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Weakness</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Fever</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Confusion</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Passing out</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1671090137\"><span class=\"h1\">What causes adrenal crisis?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Adrenal crisis usually happens in people who already have a medical condition that affects the adrenal glands. For example, it can happen in people who have Addison's disease (also called &quot;adrenal insufficiency&quot;) or congenital adrenal hyperplasia (also called &quot;CAH&quot;).</p><p>People who have these adrenal problems must take hormones to replace the hormones they don't have enough of. But if they get sick, get into an accident, or have surgery, the hormones they normally take are not always enough. That's why people with adrenal problems sometimes have to take extra medicine when they are sick or when they know they are going to have surgery.</p><p>Adrenal crisis can also happen in people who take medicines called steroids at high doses for a long time and suddenly stop taking them. Plus it can happen in people who have bleeding in their adrenal glands because of infection or severe injury, or because they were taking blood thinners.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1671090152\"><span class=\"h1\">Should I see a doctor or nurse?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Yes, if you have symptoms of adrenal crisis, <strong>call for an ambulance (in the US and Canada, dial 9-1-1)</strong>. This is especially important if you already know that you have a medical condition that affects your adrenal glands (such as Addison's disease).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1671090167\"><span class=\"h1\">Will I need tests?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Yes. If your doctor or nurse suspects you have adrenal crisis, he or she will order blood tests to check your blood sugar and hormone levels.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1671090182\"><span class=\"h1\">How is adrenal crisis treated?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Treatment is done at the hospital and involves getting 2 things through a tube in a vein (called an IV):</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Fluids with salt and sugar to replace what has been lost</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Hormone medicines to replace the hormones that are missing</p><p/><p>Once doctors have treated the crisis, they will try to find out what caused the crisis in the first place. For example, they will check for infection or for signs of adrenal gland problems.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1671090197\"><span class=\"h1\">Can adrenal crisis be prevented?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Yes. If you have a medical condition that keeps your adrenal glands from making enough hormones, your doctor will give you hormone medicines to replace what is missing. These medicines can reduce the chances you will have adrenal crisis again.</p><p>People usually need to take these medicines every day for the rest of their life. It is important to let your doctor or nurse know if you have any side effects from the medicines or develop any new symptoms.</p><p>Your doctor might also prescribe emergency medicine that you should keep with you at all times in case you have adrenal crisis again. This medicine comes in the form of a shot. If you think you are having adrenal crisis, use this medicine and then <strong>call for an ambulance (in the US and Canada, dial 9-1-1)</strong>.</p><p>Your doctor might recommend that you also use this emergency medicine if you:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Get very sick with a high fever</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Have a major injury, for example, if you break a bone or lose a lot of blood</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pass out</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Vomit up your daily medicine</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1671090212\"><span class=\"h1\">More on this topic</span></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=addisons-disease-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Addison's disease (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=congenital-adrenal-hyperplasia-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Congenital adrenal hyperplasia (The Basics)</a></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=adrenal-insufficiency-addisons-disease-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Adrenal insufficiency (Addison's disease) (Beyond the Basics)</a></p></div><div id=\"reviewProcess\"><span>All topics are updated as new evidence becomes available and our <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/home/editorial-policy\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"policy policy_editorialpolicy\">peer review process</a> is complete.</span></div><div id=\"topicRetrievedDate\"><span class=\"emphasis\">This topic retrieved from UpToDate on: </span>Apr 02, 2018.</div><div id=\"disclaimer\">The content on the UpToDate website is not intended nor recommended as a substitute for medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.
