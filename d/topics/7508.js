FAPDs involve interplay among regulatory factors in the enteric and central nervous systems [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/functional-abdominal-pain-in-children-and-adolescents-management-in-primary-care/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. FAPD may be associated with visceral hyperalgesia, reduced threshold for pain, abnormal pain referral after rectal distension, or impaired gastric relaxation response to meals [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/functional-abdominal-pain-in-children-and-adolescents-management-in-primary-care/abstract/2-6\" class=\"abstract_t\">2-6</a>].

Individuals with functional gastrointestinal disorders (FGIDs) may have similar troublesome symptoms (eg, abdominal pain, nausea, changes in bowel movements), but different underlying causes. Thus, management is individualized according to child and family behaviors, triggers, and symptoms. Regardless of the type of FAPD identified, the management approach typically involves a combination of the following interventions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/functional-abdominal-pain-in-children-and-adolescents-management-in-primary-care/abstract/13,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,14</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A therapeutic relationship (see <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Therapeutic relationship'</a> below)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patient education (see <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Patient education'</a> below)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Behavior modification (see <a href=\"#H571383545\" class=\"local\">'Behavior modification'</a> below)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Strategies to improve pain tolerance and coping (see <a href=\"#H255397635\" class=\"local\">'Improved coping'</a> below)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Avoidance of triggers (see <a href=\"#H67027703\" class=\"local\">'Management of triggers'</a> below)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Symptomatic management (see <a href=\"#H67028267\" class=\"local\">'Management of symptoms'</a> below)</p><p/><p>More intensive initial intervention (eg, referral to a mental health provider for counseling or therapy and rehabilitation) generally is warranted for children and adolescents with abdominal pain-associated disability (eg, missed school or extracurricular activities, anxiety, depression). (See <a href=\"#H13\" class=\"local\">'Indications for referral'</a> below.)</p><p>Most cases can be managed in the primary care setting [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/functional-abdominal-pain-in-children-and-adolescents-management-in-primary-care/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. Referral may be necessary for children and adolescents who do not improve with primary care interventions. (See <a href=\"#H13\" class=\"local\">'Indications for referral'</a> below.)</p><p>Among patients with visceral hypersensitivity and FAPD, the act of eating may be associated with onset of pain. As a result, it is common for patients, especially adolescents, to skip meals on a recurrent basis in order to avoid symptoms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/functional-abdominal-pain-in-children-and-adolescents-management-in-primary-care/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. This practice should trigger suspicion of an eating disorder when the adolescent also has weight loss and constipation.

Although there are few studies directly comparing psychologic interventions to &quot;standard pediatric care&quot; (which varies from study to study, but typically involves education and reassurance with or without dietary interventions or pharmacotherapy), psychologic interventions appear to be more effective [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/functional-abdominal-pain-in-children-and-adolescents-management-in-primary-care/abstract/17,20,22,25-27\" class=\"abstract_t\">17,20,22,25-27</a>].

Nonetheless, on a case-by-case basis, a time-limited trial of dietary or pharmacologic interventions may be warranted to address specific triggers or symptoms, as part of an overall treatment plan [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/functional-abdominal-pain-in-children-and-adolescents-management-in-primary-care/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].

Their concerns about specific organic diseases must be addressed (generally by reviewing the symptoms and signs of that disease that are absent from their child's presentation) before management of FAPDs can proceed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/functional-abdominal-pain-in-children-and-adolescents-management-in-primary-care/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. The explanation of a biopsychosocial model of functional disease can be helpful, as it frames the disease in terms of being a positive diagnosis rather than a diagnosis of exclusion (with the inherent expectation for extensive evaluation). The family's ability to accept such a biopsychosocial model of pain may be an important factor in the child's recovery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/functional-abdominal-pain-in-children-and-adolescents-management-in-primary-care/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H15\" class=\"local\">'Prognosis'</a> below.)</p><p>The patient and family may be reassured by the clinician's acknowledging that the pain is real and has affected important activities in the child's or adolescent's life. The patient and family should be assured that the clinician will initiate a treatment plan and continue to follow up with the patient on a regular basis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/functional-abdominal-pain-in-children-and-adolescents-management-in-primary-care/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>]. Periodic follow-up validates the clinician's continued support and interest in the patient and family. (See <a href=\"#H12\" class=\"local\">'Follow-up'</a> below.)</p><p>The therapeutic alliance may be strengthened by focusing on the shared goal of return to normal function &ndash; for both the child and family. The child's or adolescent's pain may have become a focal point of the family's life, creating stress for other members. The pediatric care provider can address these effects by prescribing a return to structured activities of daily living, including school attendance (a rehabilitative approach).

A lactose-free diet can be achieved by eliminating milk and milk products or by using lactase enzyme replacements. Patients who eliminate milk and milk products should be educated about adequate calcium and vitamin D intake. Lactose should be reintroduced into the diet if symptoms do not improve with lactose elimination after two weeks. Lactose avoidance may be continued in children whose symptoms improve during a lactose-free diet. For those patients in whom the benefit of lactose avoidance is unclear, it may be helpful to do a lactose hydrogen breath test.

FODMAPs are short-chain carbohydrates that are poorly absorbed by the gastrointestinal system and can lead to gas production, distention of the large intestine, bloating, and abdominal pain. There is some evidence that a diet low in FODMAPs may be helpful in adults with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-irritable-bowel-syndrome-in-adults#H86846749\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of irritable bowel syndrome in adults&quot;, section on 'Low FODMAP diet'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">However, information on the role of FODMAPs in FAPDs in children is limited. Several studies that focused on intolerance to fructose in children with FAPDs reported improvement in pain with fructose restriction, but these studies did not include a control group [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/functional-abdominal-pain-in-children-and-adolescents-management-in-primary-care/abstract/80-82\" class=\"abstract_t\">80-82</a>]. In a randomized crossover trial of 48 hours of a low- versus high-FODMAP diet in 33 children (7 to 17 years) with IBS, the low-FODMAP diet was associated with some improvement in gastrointestinal symptoms (eg, bloating, nausea) and decreased breath hydrogen production [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/functional-abdominal-pain-in-children-and-adolescents-management-in-primary-care/abstract/83,84\" class=\"abstract_t\">83,84</a>]. Mean pain severity scores decreased on both diets compared with baseline. Although FODMAP restriction appears to be promising for adult patients with IBS, additional pediatric studies are necessary before a low FODMAP diet can be recommended for children. FODMAPs are ubiquitous in foods that are essential to a well-balanced diet (eg, wheat, milk, legumes, various fruits and vegetables) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/functional-abdominal-pain-in-children-and-adolescents-management-in-primary-care/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>].

It is important to explain to the patient and parents that screening for anxiety does not imply that the FAPD is a manifestation of a psychologic disorder but rather that anxiety and the FAPD may coexist due to shared causative factors or as a consequence of coping with chronic pain [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/functional-abdominal-pain-in-children-and-adolescents-management-in-primary-care/abstract/50\" class=\"abstract_t\">50</a>].

Follow-up visits allow the parents and primary care provider, and at times the adolescent, to explore anxiety <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> depression as triggers of abdominal pain and nausea. Confirmation of anxiety <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> depression in this context sets the stage for the next step in management (ie, referral to a therapist for evaluation for <span class=\"nowrap\">anxiety/depression)</span>.

Several functional gastrointestinal disorders (FGIDs) of childhood have recognizable patterns of symptoms, including irritable bowel syndrome, functional dyspepsia, and abdominal migraine (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F71435\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef71435 \">table 2</a>). (See <a href=\"#H79257292\" class=\"local\">'Terminology'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The goal of management of FAPDs in children and adolescents is return to normal function rather than complete elimination of pain &ndash; a rehabilitation approach. Management is individualized according to child and family behavior, triggers, and symptoms. Most cases can be managed in the primary care setting. (See <a href=\"#H79257661\" class=\"local\">'Overview'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>FAPDs are best treated in the context of a biopsychosocial model of care. The patient and family must believe that their complaints and concerns are taken seriously. Establishing a therapeutic relationship, patient and family education, and a plan for return to school are important components of management. (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Therapeutic relationship'</a> above and <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Patient education'</a> above and <a href=\"#H255397623\" class=\"local\">'Return to school'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Return to normal function is facilitated by reinforcement of nonpain (healthy or adaptive) behaviors and avoiding reinforcement of pain or pain (sick, illness, maladaptive) behaviors. (See <a href=\"#H571383545\" class=\"local\">'Behavior modification'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We suggest psychologic interventions (eg, relaxation, distraction, guided imagery (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F90731\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef90731 \">table 3</a>), cognitive behavioral therapy) to improve coping and decrease <span class=\"nowrap\">stress/anxiety</span> in children and adolescents with FAPDs (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=5\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2B</a>). (See <a href=\"#H255397635\" class=\"local\">'Improved coping'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We do not routinely suggest dietary restriction for children and adolescents with FAPDs (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). However, on a case-by-case basis, a time-limited trial of avoidance of specific dietary triggers (eg, lactose, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sorbitol-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">sorbitol</a>) may be warranted. (See <a href=\"#H495530705\" class=\"local\">'Dietary triggers'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Medical interventions that may be combined with behavioral interventions include a trial of probiotics, supplementation with water-soluble fiber (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=psyllium-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">psyllium</a><span class=\"nowrap\">/ispaghula</span> husk), or peppermint oil. These interventions may be tried in any order or combination. We typically start with probiotics in patients with normal bowel movements and probiotics plus fiber in patients with constipation. (See <a href=\"#H285364821\" class=\"local\">'Abdominal pain'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We suggest small frequent meals and avoidance of foods, beverages, and medications that aggravate symptoms rather than pharmacologic therapy for the initial management of functional dyspepsia (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). (See <a href=\"#H67028274\" class=\"local\">'Dyspepsia'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We do not routinely suggest antimotility agents for children or adolescents with FAP and diarrhea (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). (See <a href=\"#H67028309\" class=\"local\">'Diarrhea'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Regular follow-up is necessary to maintain the therapeutic relationship, provide continued education and reassurance, monitor the response to intervention, and monitor the development of alarm findings. Children with persistent abdominal pain that affects patient and family function may benefit from referral to a mental health provider or other specialist. Children who develop alarm findings require evaluation for organic disease. (See <a href=\"#H12\" class=\"local\">'Follow-up'</a> above and <a href=\"#H13\" class=\"local\">'Indications for referral'</a> above and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=chronic-abdominal-pain-in-children-and-adolescents-approach-to-the-evaluation#H24\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Chronic abdominal pain in children and adolescents: Approach to the evaluation&quot;, section on 'Patients with alarm findings'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>FAPDs resolve over several months in the majority of children.
