However, despite some histologic similarities, the clinicopathologic manifestations, treatment, and prognosis of IBM are clearly distinct from the other disorders (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RHEUM%2F74076\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef74076 \">table 1</a>). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-of-dermatomyositis-and-polymyositis-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations of dermatomyositis and polymyositis in adults&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=initial-treatment-of-dermatomyositis-and-polymyositis-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Initial treatment of dermatomyositis and polymyositis in adults&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-recurrent-and-resistant-dermatomyositis-and-polymyositis-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of recurrent and resistant dermatomyositis and polymyositis in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The treatment and prognosis of IBM will be reviewed here. The clinical manifestations and diagnosis are presented separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-inclusion-body-myositis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of inclusion body myositis&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H324856754\"><span class=\"h1\">GOALS OF THERAPY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The primary goal of therapy in inclusion body myositis (IBM) is to optimize muscle strength and function. Given the slowly progressive and variable course of the disease, it can be quite challenging to determine if treatment leads to an objective improvement in or stabilization of muscle strength [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-inclusion-body-myositis/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. It is well known that immunosuppressive medications will lower muscle enzyme levels in IBM patients despite continued progression of weakness, and also that creatine kinase (CK) levels decrease with muscle atrophy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-inclusion-body-myositis/abstract/2,3\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,3</a>]. Therefore, CK levels cannot be used to monitor response to therapy in this disease. Based on the existing data, we only consider a trial of immunosuppressive medications in IBM patients with an atypical presentation or in patients with another autoimmune disease.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H327954467\"><span class=\"h1\">OUR APPROACH</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Almost all patients with any degree of limitation in activities of daily living will benefit from physical and occupational therapy evaluation. Patients with dysphagia should be evaluated by a speech therapist. Exercise is likely beneficial in all patients. In contrast to other inflammatory myopathies such as dermatomyositis and polymyositis, inclusion body myositis (IBM) is relatively resistant to standard immunomodulatory therapies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-inclusion-body-myositis/abstract/4,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,5</a>]. However, there is limited evidence that some subgroups of patients may benefit from such therapy, in particular those with another systemic autoimmune disease such as Sj&ouml;gren's syndrome or systemic lupus erythematosus [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-inclusion-body-myositis/abstract/6-8\" class=\"abstract_t\">6-8</a>]. We typically suggest a trial of immunosuppressive treatment when the diagnosis of IBM is uncertain, or in cases where there appears to be overlap with polymyositis as evidenced by early and prominent proximal weakness (ie, neck flexors, arm abductors, hip flexors). (See <a href=\"#H3994418356\" class=\"local\">'Immunosuppressive therapy in selected patients'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H274148797\"><span class=\"h2\">Nonpharmacologic therapy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The optimal treatment for IBM is not known, and most interventions have demonstrated only limited benefit. Nonpharmacologic interventions such as physical therapy, occupational therapy, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> speech therapy can be helpful in all patients to achieve the following:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Provide an exercise program to maintain strength as long as possible</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Address concerns about falling and the use of orthoses and assistive devices such as canes and walkers</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Address difficulties with the activities of daily living such as finger flexor weakness</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Help learn techniques to minimize the risk of aspiration in patients with dysphagia</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Provide nutritional support or dietary counseling in patients with dysphagia or obesity, respectively</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H321937820\"><span class=\"h3\">Exercise</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>All IBM patients should be evaluated by a physical therapist with experience in neuromuscular diseases to develop an individualized exercise program. We favor the combined aerobic and functional muscle strengthening program that is described in a study of IBM patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-inclusion-body-myositis/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. Increasing evidence has shown that exercise is beneficial in IBM [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-inclusion-body-myositis/abstract/9-12\" class=\"abstract_t\">9-12</a>]. Since strenuous exercise has long been known to elevate muscle enzyme levels, there has long been a theoretical but unfounded concern that exercise could accelerate muscle damage in myositis. However, data suggest that frequent, low resistance, endurance exercises are not harmful and in fact are likely beneficial. Although strengthening exercises focus on muscles that are minimally to moderately weak, passive range-of-motion exercises for severely weak muscles are also important to prevent joint contractures. Patient education is critical to avoid tendon injuries and to manage delayed-onset muscle soreness and fatigue with exercise. At our center, we have seen improvement in muscle strength in IBM patients with a supervised exercise program, and we recommend reevaluation by a therapist every four months to assess and potentially adjust the exercise regimen. For ambulatory patients who are unwilling or unable to participate in a regimented daily home exercise program, we recommend frequent, low-impact aerobic exercise such as aquatherapy or use of stationary bike.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4229628357\"><span class=\"h3\">Ambulation and fall prevention</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Gait difficulties and falls are a major source of morbidity in IBM, and older adult patients with gait instability or a history of falls are at high risk for significant falls and fractures. Falls usually occur due to quadriceps weakness causing knees to buckle while standing, turning, or stepping. We refer all patients with prior falls to physical therapy for education regarding interventions to minimize risk of falls. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=falls-in-older-persons-risk-factors-and-patient-evaluation\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Falls in older persons: Risk factors and patient evaluation&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=falls-prevention-in-community-dwelling-older-persons\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Falls: Prevention in community-dwelling older persons&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Many patients will benefit from assistive devices such as a cane or walker. Patients with foot drop should be evaluated for ankle foot orthoses (AFOs) that can improve gait dynamics and knee stability. We favor anterior, carbon fiber ground (floor) reaction AFOs that help keep the knee locked during extension. Stance control orthoses (SCOs) stabilize the knee during extension but release to allow flexion during the swing phase of gait and thereby prevent falls due to knee buckling. In a study of nine subjects with IBM, while most patients who used an SCO felt that it improved stability and prevented falls, most patients complained about the size and weight of the device, as well as difficulty putting it on and taking it off due to finger weakness [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-inclusion-body-myositis/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. While there are many different orthotic devices available, our experience is that most patients with foot drop have reduced frequency of falls with AFOs, whereas the difficulty using SCOs limits their utility. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-geriatric-rehabilitation-program-components-and-settings-for-rehabilitation#H1174941\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of geriatric rehabilitation: Program components and settings for rehabilitation&quot;, section on 'Orthoses'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H729807997\"><span class=\"h3\">Hand strengthening</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The vast majority of IBM patients have significant finger flexor weakness at diagnosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-inclusion-body-myositis/abstract/14,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">14,15</a>]. Occupational therapists, especially certified hand therapists, have expertise in improving hand function with splints, adaptive equipment, and exercises. Many types of grip-strengthening devices exist that may help maintain finger flexor function. A single case of a patient having a tendon transfer surgery to improve grip strength in IBM has been reported [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-inclusion-body-myositis/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. At our center, we have seen several patients benefit from this procedure in which an extensor tendon is transferred to a flexor tendon in the forearm (typically extensor carpi radialis brevis tendon to index finger flexor digitorum profundus tendon), enabling wrist extension to power distal finger flexion. This procedure is often done along with a distal interphalangeal fusion to help improve prehension of the index finger. This procedure can be considered in patients with limitation in activities of daily living due to pincher weakness (such as using utensils, buttoning, or writing) who do not have significant wrist extension weakness. A relative contraindication is an inability to stand without use of the limb undergoing the procedure, since the operated arm cannot be used for about six weeks after surgery.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3085399157\"><span class=\"h3\">Speech therapy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Approximately half of patients develop swallowing difficulty during the course of disease, usually due to a combination of oropharyngeal weakness and upper esophageal sphincter (UES) dysfunction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-inclusion-body-myositis/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. Although there is insufficient evidence to support interventions for dysphagia caused by any chronic, progressive muscle disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-inclusion-body-myositis/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>], we typically refer all patients with any swallowing difficulties to speech therapy for evaluation, and most patients will undergo a video fluoroscopic swallow study with speech therapist guidance. Oropharyngeal weakness may be compensated for by head positioning maneuvers and changes in diet consistency. For UES constriction (typically evidenced by a &quot;cricopharyngeal bar&quot; on swallow study), we recommend balloon dilation by a gastroenterologist [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-inclusion-body-myositis/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. For severe or refractory UES constriction, a cricopharyngeal myotomy can be performed by an experienced otolaryngologist [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-inclusion-body-myositis/abstract/20,21\" class=\"abstract_t\">20,21</a>]. A percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) tube may be required to maintain caloric intake in refractory patients.

Some IBM patients find that creatine monohydrate supplementation improves muscle fatigue. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=muscle-enzymes-in-the-evaluation-of-neuromuscular-diseases#H3\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Muscle enzymes in the evaluation of neuromuscular diseases&quot;, section on 'Creatine kinase'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3994418356\"><span class=\"h1\">IMMUNOSUPPRESSIVE THERAPY IN SELECTED PATIENTS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Most experts do not recommend immunosuppressive therapy for inclusion body myositis (IBM) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-inclusion-body-myositis/abstract/23,24\" class=\"abstract_t\">23,24</a>]. However, in some patients with another systemic autoimmune disease (eg, Sj&ouml;gren's syndrome) or an atypical presentation, such as rapidly progressive proximal limb weakness, markedly elevated creatine kinase (CK; &gt;15x normal), <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> evidence for severe inflammation out of proportion to fibrosis on muscle biopsy <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), we may initiate a trial of immunosuppressive medication.</p><p>We discuss potential side effects of glucocorticoid therapy with patients and involve patients in the decision as to whether the small chance of benefit would potentially outweigh the risks. We typically try <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prednisone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">prednisone</a> at a dose of 1 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> per day for about two to three months. In our experience, some patients will show transient but definite improvement in proximal limb weakness or dysphagia despite continued progression of distal weakness.</p><p>If there is continued decline in strength and function after approximately two to three months of treatment with glucocorticoids, we recommend discontinuation. If there is stabilization or improvement of proximal limb strength, we add <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methotrexate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">methotrexate</a> (starting at 10 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/week)</span> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=azathioprine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">azathioprine</a> (1.5 to 2.5 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> per day) for a trial period of three to six months and slowly taper the <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prednisone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">prednisone</a> dose. There are no data to support the use of one of these agents rather than the other. The choice may be determined, in part, by other factors such as concern about hepatotoxicity with methotrexate in a patient with underlying liver disease. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=use-of-methotrexate-in-the-treatment-of-rheumatoid-arthritis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Use of methotrexate in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pharmacology-and-side-effects-of-azathioprine-when-used-in-rheumatic-diseases\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pharmacology and side effects of azathioprine when used in rheumatic diseases&quot;</a>.)</p><p>All medications should be slowly weaned if there is a continued decline in strength to avoid exposing patients who are non-responders to the toxicity of long-term glucocorticoid and immunosuppressive therapy.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2650077094\"><span class=\"h2\">Glucocorticoids</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Glucocorticoids have not shown efficacy in most studies of IBM patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-inclusion-body-myositis/abstract/2,25-28\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,25-28</a>]. In the largest observational study of 136 IBM patients, 71 patients received immunosuppressants, with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prednisone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">prednisone</a> being the most frequently prescribed drug in over 90 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-inclusion-body-myositis/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. There were no differences in grip strength, CK levels, or deaths between untreated and treated patients, but patients who had been treated were more severely affected on disability scales. In another study of 40 patients with IBM, muscle strength continued to deteriorate in all 25 prednisone-treated patients who were followed for at least two years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-inclusion-body-myositis/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. Some other reports have noted a partial response to glucocorticoids with either mild improvement in or stabilization of muscle strength [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-inclusion-body-myositis/abstract/2,26\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,26</a>]. Serum CK levels often fall and may even normalize with glucocorticoid therapy; however, this biochemical response does not predict clinical benefit [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-inclusion-body-myositis/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. A 12-year observational study showed that patients treated with steroids long-term had a faster rate of progression to disability than untreated patients, possibly due to steroid-induced myopathy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-inclusion-body-myositis/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H187873211\"><span class=\"h2\">Methotrexate or azathioprine</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span><a href=\"topic.htm?path=methotrexate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Methotrexate</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=azathioprine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">azathioprine</a>, alone or in combination, have similarly shown, at best, minor benefit with no complete responses or major improvement [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-inclusion-body-myositis/abstract/2,8,26,29\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,8,26,29</a>].

However, there was a trend toward improvement during IVIG treatment, and nine of the patients continued IVIG therapy independently after the study was concluded because of a sense of improved quality of life [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-inclusion-body-myositis/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>A double-blind, placebo-controlled crossover study of 11 patients did not suggest any benefit from IVIG in muscle strength, symptoms, or myographic test results [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-inclusion-body-myositis/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Statins</strong> &ndash; Because of potential antiinflammatory effects of statins, one small pilot study of 10 patients evaluated the safety and efficacy of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=simvastatin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">simvastatin</a> 40 mg in treatment of IBM [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-inclusion-body-myositis/abstract/45\" class=\"abstract_t\">45</a>]. Though no significant benefit was seen, simvastatin appeared to be safe and well tolerated in this small study. In our experience, statins are generally safe in IBM, though given their potential myotoxicity, we recommend minimizing the statin dose and using medications with the lowest potential of myotoxicity such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pravastatin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">pravastatin</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=rosuvastatin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">rosuvastatin</a>.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Bimagrumab</strong> &ndash; Bimagrumab is a monoclonal antibody that inhibits the myostatin pathway by binding and inhibiting activin type II receptors (ActRII), which mediate the differentiation and growth of skeletal muscle.

Gene therapy using adeno-associated virus (AAV) is a promising therapeutic strategy for muscle disease, and AAV1-Follistatin can be delivered to muscles via intramuscular (IM) injection, thereby minimizing systemic side effects. IM injection of AAV1-Follistatin led to significant muscle hypertrophy in mice and non-human primates [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-inclusion-body-myositis/abstract/49\" class=\"abstract_t\">49</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Arimoclomol</strong> &ndash; Arimoclomol is an orally bioavailable small molecule chaperone inducer that inhibits protein aggregation in stressed cells.

Given the slowly progressive and variable course of the disease, it can be quite challenging to determine if treatment leads to an objective improvement in or stabilization of muscle strength. (See <a href=\"#H324856754\" class=\"local\">'Goals of therapy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The optimal treatment for IBM is not known, and most interventions have demonstrated only limited benefit. Nonpharmacologic interventions such as physical therapy, occupational therapy, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> speech therapy can be helpful in all patients to achieve the following (see <a href=\"#H274148797\" class=\"local\">'Nonpharmacologic therapy'</a> above):</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Provide an exercise program to maintain strength as long as possible</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Address concerns about falling and the use of orthoses and assistive devices such as canes and walkers</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Address difficulties with the activities of daily living such as finger flexor weakness</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Help learn techniques to minimize the risk of aspiration in patients with dysphagia</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Provide nutritional support or dietary counseling in patients with dysphagia or obesity, respectively</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Given negligible side effects and evidence for improved muscle strength in muscular dystrophy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-inclusion-body-myositis/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>], we suggest supplementation with 3 g of creatine monohydrate per day (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). Some IBM patients find that creatine monohydrate supplementation improves muscle fatigue. It is also reasonable not to give creatine monohydrate supplementation.

We only consider a trial of immunosuppressive medications in IBM patients with an atypical presentation or in patients with another systemic autoimmune disease (such as Sj&ouml;gren's syndrome). (See <a href=\"#H3994418356\" class=\"local\">'Immunosuppressive therapy in selected patients'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Many drugs that have an immunomodulatory effect have been studied in IBM.
