These infections can be severe, particularly in the setting of immunosuppression.</p><p>The major clinical manifestations of HSV-1 infection and the methods used to establish the diagnosis will be reviewed here. The manifestations depend upon the anatomic site involved and whether the clinical episode is due to primary infection or reactivation disease. The treatment of HSV-1 related disorders is discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-herpes-simplex-virus-type-1-infection-in-immunocompetent-patients\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of herpes simplex virus type 1 infection in immunocompetent patients&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The clinical manifestations and treatment of HSV-2 infection are discussed elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-genital-herpes-simplex-virus-infection\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Epidemiology, clinical manifestations, and diagnosis of genital herpes simplex virus infection&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-genital-herpes-simplex-virus-infection\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of genital herpes simplex virus infection&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">PRIMARY INFECTION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Inoculation of herpes simplex virus (HSV)-1 at mucosal surfaces or skin sites permits entry of the virus into the epidermis, the dermis, and eventually to sensory and autonomic nerve endings. The onset of clinical illness is usually sudden, with the appearance of multiple characteristic vesicular lesions superimposed upon an inflammatory, erythematous base. Primary infection may also be associated with systemic symptoms, such as fever and malaise. In general, the severity of symptoms and the number of lesions is considerably less with reactivation. (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Recurrent infection'</a> below.)</p><p>The lesions can be painful and last for 10 to 14 days. Vesicles are usually grouped in a single anatomic site; however, autoinoculation of distant locations can occur [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-herpes-simplex-virus-type-1-infection/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>] (see <a href=\"#H14\" class=\"local\">'Other cutaneous manifestations'</a> below).</p><p>Although the symptoms can be severe, most primary HSV-1 infections are asymptomatic. Retrospective studies demonstrate that only 20 to 25 percent of patients with HSV-1 antibodies and 10 to 20 percent of those with HSV-2 antibodies have a history of oral-labial or genital infections [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-herpes-simplex-virus-type-1-infection/abstract/2,3\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,3</a>]. Viral shedding can lead to unsuspected transmission to others via contact with secretions or mucous membranes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-herpes-simplex-virus-type-1-infection/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">RECURRENT INFECTION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Once herpes simplex virus (HSV) infection has occurred, the virus lives in a latent state in nerve cell bodies in ganglion neurons and can reactivate. The frequency and severity of reactivation is determined by many factors, including immunodeficiency or stress [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-herpes-simplex-virus-type-1-infection/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].</p><p>In contrast to primary HSV-1, recurrent HSV-1 is rarely associated with systemic signs or symptoms except for local lymphadenopathy. The majority of patients are aware of prodromal symptoms that herald the onset of a reactivation episode, such as pain, burning, tingling, and pruritus [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-herpes-simplex-virus-type-1-infection/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. These symptoms may last from 6 to 53 hours prior to the appearance of the first vesicles [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-herpes-simplex-virus-type-1-infection/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].</p><p>Recurrence patterns can demonstrate great variability from person to person. However, the specific triggers can be quite predictable for each individual patient and lesions tend to recur at the same site.</p><p>Subclinical shedding is common in both immunocompetent and immunocompromised patients and is probably a key factor in transmitting virus to others.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Immunocompetent hosts</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Recurrent episodes are usually of shorter duration than the primary episode. The median time from onset of prodromal symptoms to healing of the lesion is approximately five days.</p><p>The frequency of reactivation is also influenced by the interaction between the viral subtype and the anatomic area where infection has occurred. HSV-1 has a specific tropism for oral mucosa while HSV-2 preferentially infects genital mucosa. In patients who have simultaneously acquired HSV-1 infection of both oral and genital mucosa, oral lesions recur much more frequently than genital lesions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-herpes-simplex-virus-type-1-infection/abstract/7,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,8</a>]. In contrast, patients who have acquired HSV-2 infection of these same two sites have more genital recurrences than oral reactivation episodes.</p><p>Recurrences may also demonstrate individual predictability in terms of precipitating factors, site of recurrence, and numbers of recurrences over time.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Precipitating factors for HSV-1 recurrence include exposure to sunlight, fever, menstruation, and emotional stress [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-herpes-simplex-virus-type-1-infection/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. Trauma to the area of primary infection, such as trigeminal nerve manipulation (in the case of oral infection) or dental extractions can also trigger a recurrence [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-herpes-simplex-virus-type-1-infection/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Recurrences usually occur at the site of the primary infection and in adjacent areas, due to either centrifugal spread via peripheral nerves or contiguous spread to new epithelial cells [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-herpes-simplex-virus-type-1-infection/abstract/6,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,10</a>]. Occurrence at distant sites may be the result of new primary infection, autoinoculation, or rarely disseminated infection.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Recurrences occur as frequently as once per month (24 percent) or as infrequently as twice per year (19 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-herpes-simplex-virus-type-1-infection/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. Some individuals have a primary attack without subsequent clinically recognized recurrences.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Immunocompromised hosts</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The initial containment of HSV infection requires intact cellular immunity. Thus, immunocompromised hosts are at risk for increased frequency and severity of recurrent HSV infections. They are also at risk for dissemination of infection, which may include sites that are rarely involved in immunocompetent hosts, such as the lungs or gastrointestinal tract. Visceral dissemination is associated with high mortality. Risk factors for increased severity of HSV infection include history of HIV infection, malignancy, organ transplantation, malnutrition, pregnancy, and advanced age [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-herpes-simplex-virus-type-1-infection/abstract/11-18\" class=\"abstract_t\">11-18</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h3\">HIV infection</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients with advanced HIV infection (CD4 count &lt;200 <span class=\"nowrap\">cells/microL)</span> are at increased risk for recurrent and extensive HSV infections. HSV infections can occur anywhere on the skin, often presenting as extensive oral or perianal ulcers. HIV-infected patients can also develop esophagitis, colitis, chorioretinitis, acute retinal necrosis, tracheobronchitis, and pneumonia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-herpes-simplex-virus-type-1-infection/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>].</p><p>HSV infection also has ramifications for HIV disease. The presence of genital HSV lesions may increase the risk of acquiring HIV through sexual transmission. HSV can also affect the viral replication of HIV. Frequent mucosal reactivation of HSV is associated with higher levels of plasma HIV RNA [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-herpes-simplex-virus-type-1-infection/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>], while suppressive therapy for HSV is associated with measurable declines in HIV viremia.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h3\">Transplant recipients</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Transplant recipients who have been previously infected with HSV-1 have reactivation rates of 60 to 80 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-herpes-simplex-virus-type-1-infection/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. Most will excrete virus in throat washings during the first few weeks after grafting. These infections may be asymptomatic or may lead to tracheobronchitis, esophagitis, pneumonia, or hepatitis.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h3\">Burns and other skin disorders</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients who have disrupted skin integrity secondary to severe burns or primary dermatologic disorders, such as eczema and pemphigus vulgaris, are also at risk for severe HSV infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-herpes-simplex-virus-type-1-infection/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>].

Reactivation of HSV-1 infection can also lead to dissemination to the respiratory tract or visceral organs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-herpes-simplex-virus-type-1-infection/abstract/15,23\" class=\"abstract_t\">15,23</a>].

Patients commonly referred to herpes labialis as &quot;cold sores&quot;. (See <a href=\"#H1\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Inoculation of HSV-1 at mucosal or skin sites leads to viral entry into the epidermis, the dermis, and eventually to sensory and autonomic nerve endings. During primary infection, symptomatic patients develop sudden onset of multiple painful vesicular lesions grouped in a single anatomic site. These lesions can last for up to 10 to 14 days with or without systemic symptoms of fever and malaise. However, most primary HSV-1 infections are asymptomatic. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Primary infection'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>After primary infection, HSV lives in a latent state in ganglion neurons and can reactivate. The majority of patients are aware of prodromal symptoms that herald the onset of a reactivation episode, such as pain, burning, tingling, and pruritus. The frequency and severity of reactivation is determined by many factors, including stress or any underlying immunodeficiency, such as HIV infection. (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Recurrent infection'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In the immunocompetent host, recurrent episodes are usually of shorter duration than the primary episode. The median time from onset of prodromal symptoms to healing of the lesion is approximately five days. (See <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Immunocompetent hosts'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Compared with the immunocompetent host, the frequency and severity of recurrent infections are greater in the immunocompromised host, who is also at risk for disseminated HSV-1 infection to uncommon sites, such as the lungs or gastrointestinal tract. (See <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Immunocompromised hosts'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Primary HSV-1 oral infection usually presents as gingivostomatitis in children. After a brief incubation period, fever, pharyngitis and painful vesicular lesions develop suddenly, leading to difficulties in eating, drinking, and swallowing. (See <a href=\"#H9\" class=\"local\">'Oral infections'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>HSV-1 infection can cause primary cutaneous infection anywhere on the skin, especially if there is disruption of skin integrity. Herpetic whitlow is seen primarily among dentists and health care workers with frequent contact with infected secretions while eczema herpeticum is seen mainly in patients with atopic dermatitis. (See <a href=\"#H14\" class=\"local\">'Other cutaneous manifestations'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Primary ocular HSV infections occur in less than 5 percent of patients, but can cause significant morbidity due to keratitis and acute retinal necrosis. (See <a href=\"#H16\" class=\"local\">'Ocular infections'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>HSV-1 also causes sporadic cases of encephalitis with high rates of morbidity and mortality. The clinical syndrome is often characterized by the rapid onset of fever, headache, seizures, focal neurologic signs, and impaired consciousness. A variety of other neurologic syndromes have been linked to infection with HSV including aseptic meningitis, autonomic dysfunction, transverse myelitis, benign recurrent lymphocytic meningitis, and Bell's palsy. (See <a href=\"#H21\" class=\"local\">'Neurologic syndromes'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The diagnosis of HSV-1 infection can be made by a variety of techniques including viral culture, serology, immunofluorescence or polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing. While viral culture has remained the standard diagnostic method for isolating HSV-1, real-time HSV PCR assays are more sensitive, although more expensive to perform. In patients with neurologic syndromes, PCR is the test of choice for cerebral spinal fluid specimens.
