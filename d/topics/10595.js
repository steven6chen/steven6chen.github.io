These women present to a clinician's office or emergency room complaining of vaginal bleeding that is severe or has lasted for many days or weeks. Consequences of such episodes depend upon the volume of bleeding, and range from patient anxiety and interference with daily activities to severe anemia and hypovolemia. Evaluation and management of women experiencing such episodes must be expedited to establish the source of bleeding and prevent or treat excessive blood loss [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/managing-an-episode-of-severe-or-prolonged-uterine-bleeding/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p>Evaluation and management of an episode of heavy or prolonged uterine bleeding will be reviewed here. The general evaluation and treatment of abnormal uterine bleeding, uterine bleeding in pregnancy, and approach to a woman with vaginal bleeding in the emergency department are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=approach-to-abnormal-uterine-bleeding-in-nonpregnant-reproductive-age-women\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Approach to abnormal uterine bleeding in nonpregnant reproductive-age women&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-abnormal-uterine-bleeding\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of abnormal uterine bleeding&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-the-etiology-and-evaluation-of-vaginal-bleeding-in-pregnant-women\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of the etiology and evaluation of vaginal bleeding in pregnant women&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=approach-to-the-adult-with-vaginal-bleeding-in-the-emergency-department\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Approach to the adult with vaginal bleeding in the emergency department&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">TERMINOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There is no standard definition of acute uterine bleeding. Acute uterine bleeding has been described as excessively heavy or prolonged bleeding of uterine origin sufficient in volume as to require urgent or emergent intervention [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/managing-an-episode-of-severe-or-prolonged-uterine-bleeding/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. This may occur with ovulatory or anovulatory bleeding. In this review, we will use the term acute to refer to bleeding that is profuse, and not only of sudden onset.</p><p>Prolonged menses are defined as longer than seven days; in this review, we will apply this definition to either ovulatory or anovulatory bleeding and address women with an isolated episode of prolonged bleeding. Management of chronic prolonged uterine bleeding is discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-abnormal-uterine-bleeding\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of abnormal uterine bleeding&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL PRESENTATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Women with heavy or prolonged uterine bleeding generally complain of heavy vaginal bleeding that may soak through clothing or onto bedding. Women with this symptom also often report passing blood clots. The current episode may represent either a new onset of bleeding or an exacerbation of existing bleeding; it may be continuous or intermittent.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h1\">EVALUATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The goals of evaluation of a woman who complains of heavy or prolonged bleeding from the vagina are to establish hemodynamic instability, identify the source of bleeding, and evaluate the volume of blood loss.</p><p>Upon initial presentation, the most important steps in evaluating a woman with heavy or prolonged vaginal bleeding are to assess hemodynamic stability and perform a pregnancy test. Vaginal bleeding in pregnant women is discussed in detail separately. Once these steps of the evaluation are complete, the approach to further evaluation can be determined. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-the-etiology-and-evaluation-of-vaginal-bleeding-in-pregnant-women\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of the etiology and evaluation of vaginal bleeding in pregnant women&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Assess hemodynamic stability</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Vital signs are the first step in the evaluation of women who present with heavy or prolonged vaginal bleeding. In women who are not stable, immediate supportive measures (eg, fluid resuscitation, blood transfusion) should be initiated and testing for anemia and an expedited assessment for the source of bleeding are performed. In women who are stable, a more detailed evaluation may proceed.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Evaluate for anemia and coagulopathy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A hematocrit is sent to assess for anemia; clotting studies are sent in women with suspected coagulopathy. A bleeding diathesis may be either the etiology of the bleeding or may be secondary to other factors associated with the bleeding. Laboratory testing may be deferred until after the history and physical examination are performed in hemodynamically stable patients. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-features-diagnosis-and-treatment-of-disseminated-intravascular-coagulation-in-adults#H255168\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical features, diagnosis, and treatment of disseminated intravascular coagulation in adults&quot;, section on 'Pathogenesis'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-features-diagnosis-and-treatment-of-disseminated-intravascular-coagulation-in-adults#H12\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical features, diagnosis, and treatment of disseminated intravascular coagulation in adults&quot;, section on 'Diagnostic evaluation'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Confirm uterine source and assess volume of bleeding</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Confirmation of the uterus as the source of bleeding can be made through both history and physical examination. This section describes a focused initial evaluation of women with profuse or prolonged bleeding. Once the bleeding has been controlled, a comprehensive evaluation can be performed to identify its etiology. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=approach-to-abnormal-uterine-bleeding-in-nonpregnant-reproductive-age-women\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Approach to abnormal uterine bleeding in nonpregnant reproductive-age women&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=postmenopausal-uterine-bleeding#H15\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Postmenopausal uterine bleeding&quot;, section on 'Diagnostic evaluation'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=approach-to-abnormal-uterine-bleeding-in-nonpregnant-reproductive-age-women#H16087721\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Approach to abnormal uterine bleeding in nonpregnant reproductive-age women&quot;, section on 'Further evaluation'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h3\">History</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A history of precipitating events (eg, trauma, surgery, recent pregnancy) and previous episodes of heavy, prolonged, or spontaneous bleeding from the genital tract or other sites is elicited. Women are also asked about uterine pathology (eg, fibroids) and medications or family history that suggest a bleeding diathesis. Bleeding that is associated with urination or defecation suggests, but does not confirm, bleeding from the urethra or anus.</p><p>A patient should be asked about the duration, pattern, and volume of bleeding. Prolonged bleeding is defined as longer than seven days, as noted above (see <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Terminology'</a> above). Heavy and prolonged bleeding may both occur within a single episode, since the rate of bleeding may suddenly increase after days or weeks of moderate flow.</p><p>Profuse or prolonged bleeding may be continuous or intermittent. A hiatus of bleeding of several hours may represent blood that has accumulated in the upper vagina and is released when a woman changes position from supine or seated to standing.</p><p>The volume of bleeding can be estimated from the number of sanitary pads or tampons that have been soaked (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F69390\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef69390 \">table 1</a>). A typical definition of profuse bleeding is that it soaks a large sanitary pad or tampon at every hour or two and continues for two or more hours [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/managing-an-episode-of-severe-or-prolonged-uterine-bleeding/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. United States regulations specify that each regular to super plus tampon absorbs 6 to 15 g of fluid, which equals approximately 6 to 15 mL of whole blood [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/managing-an-episode-of-severe-or-prolonged-uterine-bleeding/abstract/4,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,5</a>]. However, assessing the volume of blood loss by counting tampons or pads appears to be inaccurate. Clinical studies have reported that the mean absorption ranges from 1 to 994 ml for different types of sanitary products and that absorbency varied greatly for products in a single package [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/managing-an-episode-of-severe-or-prolonged-uterine-bleeding/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. The alkaline hematin method is the standard for determining menstrual blood loss from a tampon or sanitary pad and is used in research settings. As a comparison, the average amount of fluid loss during menstruation is 35 to 40 mL per five to seven day cycle, of which approximately one-third is whole blood and the rest is endometrial tissue fluid [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/managing-an-episode-of-severe-or-prolonged-uterine-bleeding/abstract/7-10\" class=\"abstract_t\">7-10</a>]; excessive menstrual bleeding is defined as greater than 80 mL [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/managing-an-episode-of-severe-or-prolonged-uterine-bleeding/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>].</p><p>Many of these episodes are self-limited. In such cases, immediate treatment is not necessary and the patient should be evaluated as appropriate. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=approach-to-abnormal-uterine-bleeding-in-nonpregnant-reproductive-age-women\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Approach to abnormal uterine bleeding in nonpregnant reproductive-age women&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h3\">Physical examination</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Physical examination of the external and internal anatomy of the female genital tract is crucial in confirming that source of bleeding is uterine rather than from another genital tract site (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F74527\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef74527 \">table 2</a>). The differential diagnosis of genital tract bleeding in women is discussed in detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=differential-diagnosis-of-genital-tract-bleeding-in-women\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Differential diagnosis of genital tract bleeding in women&quot;</a>.)</p><p>A complete pelvic examination is performed with the following focus:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Assess the presence of active bleeding and its volume.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Determine if the bleeding is originating from the vulva, vagina, cervical surface or os, urethra, or anus.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Note any suspicious findings (eg, mass, laceration, ulceration, foreign body).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Assess the size, contour, and tenderness of the uterus, which may suggest the presence of fibroids, adenomyosis, or infection.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Examine the adnexa for a mass or tenderness, suggesting a tumor or infection.</p><p/><p>In addition, a general physical examination should be performed to look for signs of systemic illness, such as fever, ecchymoses, an enlarged thyroid gland, or evidence of hyperandrogenism (hirsutism, acne, clitoromegaly, or male pattern balding).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h2\">Identify structural abnormalities</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Uterine structural abnormalities can be identified with pelvic examination <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> imaging. Such information may help to guide management, but imaging should be deferred until the patient is hemodynamically stable. Pelvic ultrasound is the imaging study of choice since it can be performed quickly and yields useful images of the uterus and ovaries. Brisk uterine bleeding may make it difficult to perform or interpret sonographic imaging. Computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging are more expensive, take longer to perform, and are unlikely to provide more information than ultrasound in this setting.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h2\">Sample the endometrium</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Endometrial sampling should be performed in all patients who have an episode of profuse uterine bleeding, to exclude endometrial neoplasia or endometritis. Whether sampling is performed before, during, or after therapy depends upon the choice of initial therapy (ie, uterine curettage is both diagnostic and therapeutic) and whether the patient's hemodynamic status allows therapy to be deferred while sampling is performed. It is preferable to collect an endometrial specimen prior to hormonal therapy whenever possible, since hormonal alterations may interfere with interpretation of the sample.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h1\">ETIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Causes of acute or prolonged uterine bleeding in nonpregnant women include anatomic uterine abnormalities (eg, fibroids, arteriovenous malformation), endocrinologic issues, or a bleeding diathesis (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F90483\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef90483 \">figure 1</a>). The differential diagnosis is discussed in detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=approach-to-abnormal-uterine-bleeding-in-nonpregnant-reproductive-age-women\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Approach to abnormal uterine bleeding in nonpregnant reproductive-age women&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=differential-diagnosis-of-genital-tract-bleeding-in-women#H2\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Differential diagnosis of genital tract bleeding in women&quot;, section on 'Uterine bleeding'</a>.) </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h1\">APPROACH TO MANAGEMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Women should be triaged according to hemodynamic stability and rate of ongoing blood loss. The goal of therapy in all women is cessation of bleeding. Once this has been achieved, a treatment plan can be made for women who are likely to have recurrent bleeding.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14\"><span class=\"h1\">HEMODYNAMICALLY UNSTABLE WOMEN</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Hemodynamically unstable women with acute or prolonged uterine bleeding require immediate intervention. Woman who present to an ambulatory setting and are found to be hemodynamically unstable should be transferred immediately to an acute care setting.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15\"><span class=\"h2\">Stabilizing the patient</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H16\"><span class=\"h3\">Fluid resuscitation and blood product replacement</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Hemodynamically unstable patients are prepared for resuscitation in the standard fashion: airway assessment, placement of two large bore (14 gauge or larger) peripheral intravenous lines, and type and cross-matching of blood in preparation for transfusion. Fluid resuscitation and replacement of red blood cell <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> plasma components are administered as appropriate (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F93934%7EHEME%2F53854\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef93934 graphicRef53854 \">table 3A-B</a>). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=indications-and-hemoglobin-thresholds-for-red-blood-cell-transfusion-in-the-adult\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Indications and hemoglobin thresholds for red blood cell transfusion in the adult&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H17\"><span class=\"h3\">Intrauterine tamponade</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The initial step to decrease profuse uterine bleeding in a hemodynamically unstable woman is intrauterine tamponade. This approach will typically decrease bleeding and, in conjunction with appropriate administration of intravenous fluids and blood transfusion, stabilize the patient while more definitive therapy is implemented. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=indications-and-hemoglobin-thresholds-for-red-blood-cell-transfusion-in-the-adult\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Indications and hemoglobin thresholds for red blood cell transfusion in the adult&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Intrauterine tamponade can be achieved using either an intrauterine balloon or gauze packing. The steps for placing either of these are:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Place a speculum in the vagina and visualize the cervical os.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Sterilize the cervix by swabbing it three times with a large cotton swab or gauze soaked in iodine.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Stabilize the cervix by placing a single tooth tenaculum or ring forceps on the anterior cervical lip.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Grasp the balloon or gauze with a long Kelly or ring forceps and thread it in through the cervical os into the uterus.</p><p/><p>When a balloon is used, it is inflated after it is inserted into the uterus. Most commonly a 30 mL Foley catheter is used. With a 30 mL balloon in place, if brisk bleeding continues and the uterus is enlarged (the size of 12 or more weeks of gestation), a larger balloon may be required; the Bakri balloon used for postpartum hemorrhage has a 300 mL capacity (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F52635\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef52635 \">figure 2</a>) (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=postpartum-hemorrhage-medical-and-minimally-invasive-management#H3702724929\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Postpartum hemorrhage: Medical and minimally invasive management&quot;, section on 'Perform uterine tamponade in patients with atony or lower segment bleeding'</a>).</p><p>When gauze is used, a continuous piece of gauze (eg, Kerlix) is preferred over smaller gauze pieces to avoid retained pieces of gauze upon removal. Gauze is placed until no further gauze can be admitted. Firm, but not excessive, pressure is used to avoid uterine perforation. The gauze can be impregnated with 5000 units thrombin in 5 mL sterile saline to enhance clotting. If packing does not control hemorrhage, in our clinical experience, repacking is unlikely to be effective.</p><p>The distended tamponaded uterus causes discomfort, which can be treated with analgesics or a slight reduction in distending pressure, as long as tamponade is maintained. Devices used to tamponade the uterus should not be left in place for more than 24 hours. If the tamponade is not removed for the purpose of other treatment measures, then deflation is performed slowly, eg, 20 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/hour</span> for a balloon or 5 <span class=\"nowrap\">cm/hr</span> of gauze. We give broad spectrum antibiotics for infection prophylaxis to patients with an intrauterine balloon or packing in place.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H18\"><span class=\"h2\">Therapeutic measures</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H19\"><span class=\"h3\">Uterine curettage</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Uterine curettage is the treatment of choice for profuse uterine bleeding in women who are hemodynamically unstable. In most women and at most institutions, it can be performed rapidly, with cessation or significant decrease in bleeding in less than one hour. Other advantages of this treatment are that it is both diagnostic and therapeutic and it can be performed in women who wish to preserve fertility. A disadvantage of curettage is that it does not treat the underlying cause of uterine bleeding, so bleeding is likely to recur if no preventive therapy is initiated postoperatively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/managing-an-episode-of-severe-or-prolonged-uterine-bleeding/abstract/12,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,13</a>].</p><p>There are no high quality data comparing uterine curettage with medical therapy in women with acute uterine bleeding. According to indirect data and clinical experience, medical therapy requires more time until bleeding subsides [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/managing-an-episode-of-severe-or-prolonged-uterine-bleeding/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. An advantage of medical therapy is that its use avoids the risk of perioperative complications. Thus, we suggest medical therapy for women in whom a waiting period of three or more hours is not likely to result in the need for additional blood product transfusion or medical complications. Medical therapy is often beneficial in addition to curettage if bleeding persists after the procedure or to prevent recurrent bleeding.</p><p>Curettage can be performed as a standard dilation and curettage (D&amp;C) or using a Karman cannula. Advantages of the Karman cannula over a D&amp;C are that it can be used in the office or emergency department and often does not require cervical dilation. On the other hand, the Karman procedure typically removes less tissue and, thus, it may be less effective at decreasing bleeding. The steps of each procedure are discussed in detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dilation-and-curettage#H8\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Dilation and curettage&quot;, section on 'Procedure'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=endometrial-sampling-procedures\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Endometrial sampling procedures&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H20\"><span class=\"h3\">High-dose intravenous estrogen</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>High-dose intravenous (IV) estrogen is beneficial in combination with other measures in hemodynamically unstable women with acute uterine bleeding; the use of IV estrogen alone is appropriate in some women as has been shown in a randomized double-blind controlled study [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/managing-an-episode-of-severe-or-prolonged-uterine-bleeding/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>] (see <a href=\"#H19\" class=\"local\">'Uterine curettage'</a> above). IV estrogen alone appears to result in cessation of bleeding in most women within five hours of the first dose [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/managing-an-episode-of-severe-or-prolonged-uterine-bleeding/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>].</p><p>The mechanism of action of estrogen therapy is based on the denudation of the endometrium that results from profuse uterine bleeding. Estrogen promotes rapid regrowth of endometrium over the denuded epithelial surface, stabilizes lysosomal membranes, and stimulates proliferation of endometrial ground substance [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/managing-an-episode-of-severe-or-prolonged-uterine-bleeding/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>].</p><p>The effectiveness of IV conjugated equine estrogen (CEE) therapy was illustrated in a randomized trial in which 34 women with excessive or prolonged uterine bleeding were assigned to IV CEE (Premarin 25 mg in 5 mL isotonic saline injected over two minutes with a dose repeated at three and five hours from the initial dose if bleeding continued) or placebo (lactose 200 mg) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/managing-an-episode-of-severe-or-prolonged-uterine-bleeding/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. Within three hours of the first dose, there was no significant difference in the number of women in whom bleeding had stopped in the CEE versus placebo group (22 versus 36 percent). However, at five hours after the first dose, bleeding had stopped in significantly more women in the CEE versus placebo group (72 versus 38 percent); among the remaining five patients in the CEE group, bleeding persisted in two women at eight hours. Endometrial biopsy revealed no association between histology (benign, neoplasia, or endometritis) and success of therapy.</p><p>An antiemetic is often required with this regimen. In the trial described above, intravenous CEE produced nausea and vomiting in 39 percent of treated patients compared with 13 percent in the placebo group [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/managing-an-episode-of-severe-or-prolonged-uterine-bleeding/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. In women treated with IV estrogen, we give <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prochlorperazine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">prochlorperazine</a> IV 2.5 to 10 mg every three to four hours as needed.</p><p>If bleeding does not subside after eight hours, IV estrogen should be stopped and other treatments employed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/managing-an-episode-of-severe-or-prolonged-uterine-bleeding/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. If bleeding subsides, IV estrogen is discontinued and an oral maintenance regimen is prescribed; options include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Oral CEE &ndash; We use Premarin 2.5 mg four times per day until the bleeding subsides or is minimal. We do not continue this regimen for more than 21 to 25 days. The potency of the effect on liver proteins of 2.5 mg of premarin is approximately equivalent to 8 to 40 mcg of ethinyl estradiol [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/managing-an-episode-of-severe-or-prolonged-uterine-bleeding/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]; it is, therefore, similar to or less than one dose of a 35 mcg oral contraceptive. After the estrogen is discontinued, a progestin should be given. We use oral <a href=\"topic.htm?path=medroxyprogesterone-acetate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">medroxyprogesterone acetate</a> (10 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day)</span> for 10 days. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Oral contraceptive pill with 35 mcg estrogen &ndash; We use two pills per day for 5 days followed by once a day for 20 days. At the conclusion of oral therapy, women will have a withdrawal bleed that may be heavy, but is likely to last less than five to seven days.</p><p/><p>Pulmonary embolism and thrombosis at other sites are potential complications of high dose estrogen therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/managing-an-episode-of-severe-or-prolonged-uterine-bleeding/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. The minimum effective estrogen dose that controls bleeding should be administered to minimize the prevalence of side effects and the risk of complications. This therapy should be avoided in women with absolute contraindications to estrogen therapy (see <a href=\"#H29\" class=\"local\">'Women at risk of thrombosis'</a> below).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H21\"><span class=\"h3\">Uterine artery embolization</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Uterine artery embolization as a first line therapy is reserved for women in whom the etiology of bleeding is a uterine arteriovenous malformation, since it is the most effective treatment for this condition. Use of embolization in unstable patients is limited because it usually cannot be performed as rapidly as other measures. In institutions in which embolization can be performed in a timely fashion, it can be an effective alternative to hysterectomy in women who wish to preserve their uterus.</p><p>The safety of pregnancy after uterine artery embolization is uncertain; a systematic review and several case series of pregnancies following this procedure reported adverse outcomes in some pregnancies following uterine artery embolization, including miscarriage, preterm delivery, placental problems, and malpresentation.

For women with prolonged bleeding that is not profuse (soaking &lt;1 pad or tampon per hour), lower doses of oral contraceptives are the best option (see <a href=\"#H25\" class=\"local\">'High dose oral contraceptives'</a> below).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H24\"><span class=\"h2\">High dose oral estrogen</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>First line therapy for hemodynamically stable women is high dose oral estrogen. We give Premarin 2.5 mg four times per day until the bleeding subsides or is minimal. For women with moderate bleeding, we change the regimen to twice daily. We do not continue this regimen for more than 21 to 25 days. After the estrogen is discontinued, a progestin should be given; we use oral <a href=\"topic.htm?path=medroxyprogesterone-acetate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">medroxyprogesterone acetate</a> (10 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day)</span> for 10 days. The potency of the effect on liver proteins of 2.5 mg of premarin is approximately equivalent to 8 to 40 mcg of ethinyl estradiol [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/managing-an-episode-of-severe-or-prolonged-uterine-bleeding/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]; it is, therefore, similar to or less than one dose of a 35 mcg oral contraceptive.</p><p>Many women experience nausea and vomiting while taking high dose estrogen. An antiemetic (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=promethazine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">promethazine</a> 12.5 to 25 mg per rectum) should be prescribed, to be used as needed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/managing-an-episode-of-severe-or-prolonged-uterine-bleeding/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>] (see <a href=\"#H20\" class=\"local\">'High-dose intravenous estrogen'</a> above). There are no data regarding the time course of therapeutic success with high dose oral estrogen. Based on the data for IV estrogen therapy and allowing for a delayed onset of action with oral administration, bleeding is likely to stop in most women within 10 hours after the first dose.</p><p>Estrogen therapy alone is more effective than combined estrogen-progestin or progestin-alone therapy because progestins inhibit the synthesis of estrogen receptors and increase estradiol dehydrogenase, thereby impeding the rapid proliferation of endometrium induced by estrogen.</p><p>This therapy should be avoided in women with absolute contraindications to estrogen therapy (see <a href=\"#H29\" class=\"local\">'Women at risk of thrombosis'</a> below).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H25\"><span class=\"h2\">High dose oral contraceptives</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>High doses of oral contraceptives (OCs) (eg, an OC containing 35 mcg ethinyl estradiol taken two to four times daily) will cause bleeding to subside in most women within 48 hours [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/managing-an-episode-of-severe-or-prolonged-uterine-bleeding/abstract/2,17\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,17</a>]. We use a cascading regimen (ie, five pills on day 1, four pills on day 2, three pills on day 3, two pills on day 4, and one pill on day 5). For women with moderate bleeding, we start with three pills daily. An antiemetic medication should be prescribed (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=promethazine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">promethazine</a> 12.5 to 25 mg per rectum, as needed).</p><p>Treatment with one pill daily of OCs should continue for at least one week after the bleeding subsides and then should be stopped for three to five days to allow for a withdrawal bleed. Standard dose OCs may then be restarted either to prevent recurrent menorrhagia or for contraception.</p><p>Other combined estrogen-progestin contraceptives (vaginal ring, patch) are not used for treatment of an episode of profuse uterine bleeding, since it is not possible to vary the dose as precisely as with OCs.</p><p>There are no data comparing treatment of estrogen alone versus estrogen-progestins in women with acute or prolonged uterine bleeding. As discussed above, physiologically it appears that treatment with estrogen alone is likely to be effective more rapidly than with a combined estrogen-progestin (see <a href=\"#H24\" class=\"local\">'High dose oral estrogen'</a> above). On the other hand, some women may prefer OCs due to familiarity or other reasons. We use OCs in women who can tolerate continued bleeding for 48 hours and prefer an OC to oral CEE.</p><p>OC therapy should be avoided in women with absolute contraindications to estrogen or progestin therapy (see <a href=\"#H29\" class=\"local\">'Women at risk of thrombosis'</a> below).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H26\"><span class=\"h2\">High dose progestins</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Profuse or prolonged uterine hemorrhage related to anovulation can also be treated with high dose progestins alone.

They are used more commonly as second- or third-line therapy to prevent abnormal uterine bleeding. Their use is limited by expense and adverse effects. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-abnormal-uterine-bleeding\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of abnormal uterine bleeding&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=heavy-or-irregular-uterine-bleeding-during-chemotherapy#H6\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Heavy or irregular uterine bleeding during chemotherapy&quot;, section on 'GnRH agonists'</a>.)</p><p>There are few reports of use of GnRH agonists for treatment of an acute episode of uterine bleeding [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/managing-an-episode-of-severe-or-prolonged-uterine-bleeding/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. Use of these agents may be considered in this setting if other methods have failed or are contraindicated. If they are used, they result in an initial follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) and luteinizing hormone (LH) surge that could lead to an increased volume of bleeding. Use of GnRH agonists in combination with other agents (eg, oral contraceptives) may avoid this surge. However, because of the potential for increased bleeding initially, GnRH agents should be used only in patients who can tolerate several days of heavy uterine bleeding. In our experience, treatment with GnRH agonists results in a decrease in the volume of bleeding within one week. &#160; &#160; &#160;</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H27\"><span class=\"h2\">Tranexamic acid</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Another medical therapy option is <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tranexamic-acid-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">tranexamic acid</a> (1 to 1.5 g orally three to four times daily), which acts within two to three hours of administration [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/managing-an-episode-of-severe-or-prolonged-uterine-bleeding/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>].
