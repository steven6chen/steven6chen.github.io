The ability of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=digoxin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">digoxin</a> to reduce sympathetic activation has also been recognized. For maximal early benefits, digoxin requires loading doses, which can be administered intravenously or orally. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=use-of-digoxin-in-heart-failure-with-reduced-ejection-fraction#H2\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Use of digoxin in heart failure with reduced ejection fraction&quot;, section on 'Mechanism of action'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=control-of-ventricular-rate-in-atrial-fibrillation-pharmacologic-therapy#H17\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Control of ventricular rate in atrial fibrillation: Pharmacologic therapy&quot;, section on 'Digoxin'</a>.)</p><p>While two cardiac glycosides (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=digoxin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">digoxin</a> and digitoxin) were previously used, digitoxin has not been widely available since the 1980s. As digoxin is now the only cardiac glycoside available in most countries, the method of initiating therapy with digoxin for patients with atrial fibrillation is presented here. Recommendations regarding the use of digoxin in the management of heart failure or arrhythmias are discussed separately.

Hypokalemia or hypomagnesemia, for example, may promote the development of digoxin-induced arrhythmias, while impaired renal function may result in higher than anticipated serum drug levels.

The following principles should be viewed as a general guide to the use of digoxin for its inotropic or electrophysiologic effects, which must be modified according to clinical circumstances. Patients receiving digoxin for ventricular rate control in atrial fibrillation or flutter will usually require more rapid loading than those treated with digoxin for heart failure, in whom a loading dose is typically not required. The use of digoxin primarily for heart failure is discussed separately.

Thus, patients frequently require the addition of a beta blocker or calcium channel blocker for optimal rate control. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=control-of-ventricular-rate-in-atrial-fibrillation-pharmacologic-therapy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Control of ventricular rate in atrial fibrillation: Pharmacologic therapy&quot;</a>.)</p><p>When <a href=\"topic.htm?path=digoxin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">digoxin</a> is used strictly for ventricular rate control in AF, serum digoxin levels should be monitored periodically, although the drug concentration often does not correlate with ventricular rate control and is used more as a guide to toxicity than to therapy. Junctional escape beats (as detected by the equality of all the longest observed R-R intervals on the electrocardiogram) are common when digitalis has successfully slowed the ventricular rate. Giving more digoxin in this setting will increase the degree of AV nodal block and produce periods of regular junctional rhythm. The change from single junctional escapes to periodic junctional rhythm usually signifies the development of digoxin toxicity.

Monitoring the serum digoxin level is particularly important in persons with chronic renal dysfunction, rapidly changing renal function, or electrolyte disturbances (eg, hypokalemia, hypomagnesemia). (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Monitoring serum digoxin'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Assuming that the <a href=\"topic.htm?path=digoxin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">digoxin</a> level was drawn at the correct time, at steady state, and under conditions of stable renal function, there is a linear relationship between digoxin dose and serum concentration which should be followed for any necessary dose adjustments.

(See <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Atrial fibrillation'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Approximately 70 to 80 percent of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=digoxin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">digoxin</a> is eliminated unchanged in the urine, leading to prolongation of the half-life in patients with renal insufficiency. Renal insufficiency also decreases the extravascular volume of distribution of digoxin, another effect that can elevate plasma drug levels. As a result, both the initial loading dose and the maintenance dose must be reduced in patients with underlying renal disease.

In some patients, use of antibiotics such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tetracycline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">tetracycline</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=erythromycin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">erythromycin</a> may impair gastrointestinal metabolism of digoxin, leading to higher serum digoxin concentrations.
