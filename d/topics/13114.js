Approximately 140,250 new cases are diagnosed each year in the United States, of which 97,220 are colon and the remainder rectal cancers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathology-and-prognostic-determinants-of-colorectal-cancer/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Annually, approximately 50,630 Americans die of CRC, accounting for approximately 8 percent of all cancer deaths. Global, country-specific data on incidence and mortality are available from the World Health Organization (WHO) <a href=\"http://globocan.iarc.fr/Pages/Map.aspx&amp;token=0fC2KlWP2lBbCApZ6DyKw47MnQXaSNBIvsugca7gMSw+6djwprsRosUIl828CRp5&amp;TOPIC_ID=2484\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">GLOBOCAN database</a>.</p><p>Surgical resection is the primary treatment modality for early-stage CRC (stage I through III) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F111438\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef111438 \">table 1</a>), and the most powerful tool for assessing prognosis following potentially curative surgery is pathologic analysis of the resected specimen. Although the parameters that determine pathologic stage are the strongest predictors of postoperative outcome, other clinical, molecular, and histologic features may influence prognosis independent of stage. Among patients with stage IV disease, prognosis is more closely tied to the location and extent of distant metastatic disease.</p><p>Here we will discuss the pathology of CRC and the major determinants of prognosis following surgical resection, with particular attention to the strength of the evidence supporting each factor. The molecular pathogenesis of CRC and the clinical presentation and staging evaluation for colon and rectum cancer are discussed elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=molecular-genetics-of-colorectal-cancer\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Molecular genetics of colorectal cancer&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-presentation-diagnosis-and-staging-of-colorectal-cancer\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical presentation, diagnosis, and staging of colorectal cancer&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pretreatment-local-staging-evaluation-for-rectal-cancer\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pretreatment local staging evaluation for rectal cancer&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">PATHOLOGY</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Gross appearance</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Although all colorectal cancers (CRCs) originate in adenomas or flat dysplasia, they evolve into different morphologic patterns with invasion and expansion. Tumors in the proximal or right colon usually appear grossly as polypoid or fungating exophytic masses. Occult bleeding may result in the clinical presentation of an unexplained iron deficiency anemia.</p><p>By contrast, tumors involving the distal or left colon are more commonly annular or encircling lesions that produce an &quot;apple-core&quot; or &quot;napkin-ring&quot; appearance (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F82202%7EGAST%2F75818\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef82202 graphicRef75818 \">image 1A-B</a>). The bowel lumen becomes constricted and narrowed, producing symptoms of bowel dysfunction (eg, constipation, diarrhea, or bowel obstruction). The presence of clinical bowel obstruction or perforation of the bowel wall worsens the prognosis overall [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathology-and-prognostic-determinants-of-colorectal-cancer/abstract/2,3\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,3</a>].</p><p>Despite differences in their gross appearance, right- and left-sided colon cancers are microscopically similar, and they seem to have a similar prognosis when they present with locoregional disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathology-and-prognostic-determinants-of-colorectal-cancer/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. However, in the setting of metastatic disease, at least some data suggest a worse prognosis for those with a right-sided primary tumor [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathology-and-prognostic-determinants-of-colorectal-cancer/abstract/5,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,6</a>].</p><p>Synchronous colon cancers, defined as two or more distinct primary tumors separated by normal bowel and not due to direct extension or metastasis, occur in 3 to 5 percent of patients with CRC [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathology-and-prognostic-determinants-of-colorectal-cancer/abstract/7,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,8</a>]. The incidence is closer to 2.5 percent when patients with Lynch syndrome (hereditary nonpolyposis CRC [HNPCC]) are excluded [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathology-and-prognostic-determinants-of-colorectal-cancer/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lynch-syndrome-hereditary-nonpolyposis-colorectal-cancer-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Lynch syndrome (hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer): Clinical manifestations and diagnosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Synchronous primaries have the same prognosis as a solitary cancer when the highest stage of disease at presentation is compared [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathology-and-prognostic-determinants-of-colorectal-cancer/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Histology</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The vast majority of tumors of the colon and rectum are carcinomas. Other histologic types (neuroendocrine neoplasms, hamartomas, mesenchymal tumors, lymphomas) are relatively unusual. Of the carcinomas, more than 90 percent are adenocarcinomas. World Health Organization (WHO) classification of CRC is provided in the table (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F68703\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef68703 \">table 2</a>).</p><p>Some of these morphologic variants carry prognostic significance. As an example, signet ring cancers are an aggressive adenocarcinoma subtype with a poor prognosis overall, while the medullary subtype, which is often associated with deficient mismatch repair (MMR) proteins, has a relatively favorable prognosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathology-and-prognostic-determinants-of-colorectal-cancer/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H26\" class=\"local\">'Mismatch repair deficiency'</a> below.)</p><p>Adenocarcinoma not otherwise specified (NOS) can be further classified by the histologic grade of differentiation, which takes into account the degree to which there are well-formed glands (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F101667\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef101667 \">table 3</a>); the inclusion of cytologic or other features in the estimation of grade is variable. Gland formation is present to greater or lesser degrees in well-differentiated and moderately differentiated tumors (low-grade tumors when using a two-tiered grading system), respectively. By contrast, poorly differentiated or undifferentiated adenocarcinomas (high-grade tumors) do not form well-defined glandular structures, consisting predominantly of solid sheets or cords of infiltrating cells, often with marked cellular atypia, pleomorphism, and a high mitotic rate. In the majority of studies, the prognostic significance of grade falls out on statistical analysis as a two-tiered stratification variable: low grade (well and moderately differentiated) versus high grade (poorly differentiated or undifferentiated). The College of American Pathologists (CAP) and the American Joint Committee on <span class=\"nowrap\">Cancer/Union</span> for International Cancer Control <span class=\"nowrap\">(AJCC/UICC)</span> have both recommended the adoption of a two-tiered grading system for CRC and the use of gland formation as the only feature by which grade is assessed (ie, &lt;50 percent gland formation represents high-grade disease) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathology-and-prognostic-determinants-of-colorectal-cancer/abstract/11,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,12</a>]. A two-tiered system with a well-defined cut-point would be expected to reduce interobserver variation while preserving (or improving) the prognostic power of grade.</p><p>Many tumors produce mucin, which may remain within the cells or be secreted. Extracellular mucin dissects through the tumor wall, aiding its local extension [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathology-and-prognostic-determinants-of-colorectal-cancer/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. Tumors producing copious amounts of extracellular mucin (ie, mucin comprising &ge;50 percent of the tumor mass) are classified as mucinous carcinomas (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F68703\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef68703 \">table 2</a>). This histologic type accounts for approximately 11 to 17 percent of all CRCs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathology-and-prognostic-determinants-of-colorectal-cancer/abstract/13-16\" class=\"abstract_t\">13-16</a>]. Mucinous carcinomas have a predilection for the right side of the colon [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathology-and-prognostic-determinants-of-colorectal-cancer/abstract/17,18\" class=\"abstract_t\">17,18</a>], and they may have a poor responsiveness to upfront (neoadjuvant) chemoradiotherapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathology-and-prognostic-determinants-of-colorectal-cancer/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>] and adjuvant chemotherapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathology-and-prognostic-determinants-of-colorectal-cancer/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>], although this is controversial [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathology-and-prognostic-determinants-of-colorectal-cancer/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H21\" class=\"local\">'Histologic type, grade of differentiation, and presence of mucin'</a> below.)</p><p>In some non-gland-forming carcinomas, intracellular mucin may be a dominant feature that displaces tumor cell nuclei to the side. When &ge;50 percent of the tumor is made up of cells of this type, it is classified as a signet ring cell carcinoma (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F67584\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef67584 \">picture 1</a>). They account for only 1 to 2 percent of all CRCs, but signet ring carcinomas are aggressive variants, with a propensity for extensive intramural spread and peritoneal carcinomatosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathology-and-prognostic-determinants-of-colorectal-cancer/abstract/13,22,23\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,22,23</a>]. As an example, in one report of 1600 consecutive patients with CRC, 13 of the 14 patients with signet ring carcinomas had stage III or IV disease at diagnosis, and nine had peritoneal spread [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathology-and-prognostic-determinants-of-colorectal-cancer/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>].</p><p>Some cancers, particularly those arising in the distal colon, contain areas of squamous differentiation and are termed adenosquamous carcinomas [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathology-and-prognostic-determinants-of-colorectal-cancer/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. These rare tumors account for between 0.05 and 0.2 percent of all colorectal malignancies and are associated with higher overall and colorectal-specific mortality as compared with adenocarcinoma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathology-and-prognostic-determinants-of-colorectal-cancer/abstract/25,26\" class=\"abstract_t\">25,26</a>].</p><p>Approximately 10 percent of CRCs, particularly poorly differentiated tumors, contain foci of neuroendocrine differentiation. Non-gland forming tumors with a predominance of neuroendocrine differentiation are classified as well-differentiated neuroendocrine (carcinoid) tumors, which have a more favorable prognosis than adenocarcinomas, and poorly differentiated neuroendocrine carcinomas, which have a poor prognosis overall. However, the prognostic importance of focal neuroendocrine differentiation within other histologic types such as an adenocarcinoma is unclear. Assessment of neuroendocrine differentiation should be made on routine hematoxylin and eosin (H&amp;E) stained sections; the data are insufficient to recommend the use of special stains (ie, chromogranin, neuron-specific enolase, or synaptophysin). (See <a href=\"#H672795652\" class=\"local\">'Focal neuroendocrine differentiation'</a> below and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pathology-classification-and-grading-of-neuroendocrine-neoplasms-arising-in-the-digestive-system\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pathology classification, and grading of neuroendocrine neoplasms arising in the digestive system&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The medullary carcinoma subtype (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F68703\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef68703 \">table 2</a>) is a distinctive type of non-gland forming cancer composed of large eosinophilic, polygonal cells that grow in solid sheets and are heavily infiltrated by small lymphocytes (ie, tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathology-and-prognostic-determinants-of-colorectal-cancer/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. The importance of recognizing this tumor type is its association with tumors that are deficient in one or more MMR proteins, including those that arise in the setting of Lynch syndrome [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathology-and-prognostic-determinants-of-colorectal-cancer/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. The biologic footprint of these tumors is a high degree of microsatellite instability. Large bowel tumors with microsatellite instability are more common in the right colon; are more often of the mucinous, signet ring, or medullary histologic type; and have abundant tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes or are rimmed by a Crohn-like, germinal center-producing lymphoid reaction. (See <a href=\"#H26\" class=\"local\">'Mismatch repair deficiency'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h3\">Appendix cancer</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Cancer of the vermiform appendix is rare. Primary malignant tumors of the appendix are found in 0.1 percent of all appendectomy specimens; the majority are carcinoids, but approximately one-third are adenocarcinomas. Significantly, metachronous or synchronous primary neoplasms, particularly involving the gastrointestinal (GI) tract, are common in patients with appendiceal tumors. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cancer-of-the-appendix-and-pseudomyxoma-peritonei#H8\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Cancer of the appendix and pseudomyxoma peritonei&quot;, section on 'Epithelial tumors'</a>.)</p><p>Appendiceal adenocarcinomas commonly spread intraperitoneally. When these carcinomas are mucin secreting (mucinous cystadenocarcinomas) and present with peritoneal dissemination, they produce the clinical picture of a pseudomyxoma peritonei. The histologic spectrum of tumors that are associated with this clinical pattern ranges from mucinous cystadenomas to the adenocarcinomas. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cancer-of-the-appendix-and-pseudomyxoma-peritonei\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Cancer of the appendix and pseudomyxoma peritonei&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Primary mucinous epithelial ovarian carcinoma only rarely presents similarly, but may be considered in the differential diagnosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathology-and-prognostic-determinants-of-colorectal-cancer/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. Immunohistochemistry (IHC) can help with the distinction (see below).

As a result, the current AJCC tumor, node, metastasis (TNM) cancer staging manual contains a separate staging classification for appendiceal cancers (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F111127\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef111127 \">table 4</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathology-and-prognostic-determinants-of-colorectal-cancer/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cancer-of-the-appendix-and-pseudomyxoma-peritonei\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Cancer of the appendix and pseudomyxoma peritonei&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H672788825\"><span class=\"h2\">Immunohistochemistry</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Cytokeratin 20 (CK20) and caudal-type homeobox 2 (CDX2) are two of the most sensitive and specific markers of intestinal differentiation and are extremely useful IHC markers in correctly identifying adenocarcinomas of colorectal origin [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathology-and-prognostic-determinants-of-colorectal-cancer/abstract/30-32\" class=\"abstract_t\">30-32</a>]. IHC for CK20 and CK7 can be particularly helpful in the differential diagnosis of a primary appendiceal malignancy versus mucinous ovarian cancer (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F58475\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef58475 \">table 5</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathology-and-prognostic-determinants-of-colorectal-cancer/abstract/33,34\" class=\"abstract_t\">33,34</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Appendix cancer'</a> above.)</p><p>However, an important caveat is that unlike conventional colorectal adenocarcinomas, medullary carcinomas of the colon with high levels of microsatellite instability frequently lack CDX2 and CK20 expression, and instead, they may express markers not commonly associated with CRC, such as calretinin, CK7, SATB2, and CDH17 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathology-and-prognostic-determinants-of-colorectal-cancer/abstract/35-38\" class=\"abstract_t\">35-38</a>].</p><p>IHC is also helpful to identify deficient expression of DNA MMRs. This is clinically useful in three ways:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>With sporadic somatic MMR gene mutation, tumor tissue will show loss of staining for one or more of the MMR proteins, but the surrounding normal mucosa will be positive, which also serves as an internal control for the stain. Tumors with deficient MMR proteins have a relatively favorable prognosis, and this may be used in the decision-making process for adjuvant chemotherapy, particularly for patients with stage II (node-negative) colon cancer. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=adjuvant-chemotherapy-for-resected-stage-ii-colon-cancer#H286915662\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Adjuvant chemotherapy for resected stage II colon cancer&quot;, section on 'Implications for adjuvant chemotherapy'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Germline mutations in the MMR genes that cause Lynch syndrome typically result in a truncated or lost MMR protein that can be detected as <strong>loss of staining of the protein</strong> on tumor IHC testing [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathology-and-prognostic-determinants-of-colorectal-cancer/abstract/39,40\" class=\"abstract_t\">39,40</a>]. Typically testing is carried out for <em>MLH1</em>, <em>PMS2</em>, <em>MSH2</em> and <em>MSH6</em>. The likelihood of finding a germline mutation in one of the MMR genes based on IHC results varies depending on the protein that is absent (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F63906\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef63906 \">table 6</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathology-and-prognostic-determinants-of-colorectal-cancer/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>].

The most common metastatic sites are the regional lymph nodes, liver, and lungs. Because the venous drainage of the intestinal tract is via the portal system, the first site of hematogenous dissemination is usually liver, followed by lungs, bone, and many other sites, including (rarely) brain. However, tumors arising in the distal rectum may metastasize initially to the lungs because the inferior rectal vein drains into the inferior vena cava rather than into the portal venous system.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">TNM staging</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The tumor, node, metastasis (TNM) staging system of the American Joint Committee on <span class=\"nowrap\">Cancer/Union</span> for International Cancer Control <span class=\"nowrap\">(AJCC/UICC)</span> is the preferred staging system for CRC [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathology-and-prognostic-determinants-of-colorectal-cancer/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. The older Duke's classification, including the Astler-Coller modification, is no longer used.</p><p>As in all of the TNM staging classifications, radiographic, endoscopic (including biopsy), and intraoperative findings are used to assign a clinical stage (cT, cN, cM), while assessment of pathologic stage (pT, pN, pM) requires gross pathologic or histopathologic examination.

However, in the staging of CRC, the pTis category includes stromal invasion of malignant cells through the lamina propria into but not through the muscularis mucosa. This is unique to the large bowel and justified because the colorectal mucosa, unlike the mucosa elsewhere in the gastrointestinal (GI) tract and in other organs, lacks stromal lymphatics. As a result, tumors invading up to the muscularis mucosa lack access to the regional lymphatic vasculature and cannot metastasize via this route. It has been recommended that the terms &quot;intraepithelial carcinoma&quot; (without stromal invasion) and &quot;intramucosal carcinoma&quot; (with mucosal stromal invasion) be used to differentiate the two lesions included in the pTis category [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathology-and-prognostic-determinants-of-colorectal-cancer/abstract/44\" class=\"abstract_t\">44</a>], but this distinction has not been made in either the current 2010 or newest 2017 TNM classifications [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathology-and-prognostic-determinants-of-colorectal-cancer/abstract/12,42\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,42</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1641722874\"><span class=\"h3\">Posttherapy staging for rectal cancer</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The TNM staging system was initially devised for tumors that had not been previously treated.

This term applies to any aspect of the colorectum that is not covered (or partially covered, as with the ascending and descending colon and rectosigmoid) by a serosal layer of mesothelial cells and that must be dissected from the retroperitoneum (or subperitoneum in order to remove the viscus). For mid and distal rectal cancers that are entirely subperitoneal in location, the entire external surface of the specimen is considered a CRM. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=rectal-cancer-surgical-principles#H87590752\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Rectal cancer: Surgical principles&quot;, section on 'Radial margins'</a>.)</p><p>By contrast, for colonic segments that are completely encased by a peritonealized (serosal) surface (eg, cecum, transverse, and sigmoid colon), the only surgical margin that is surgically dissected is the mesenteric margin, unless the cancer is adherent to or invading an adjacent organ or structure. In such cases, the CRM is a relevant radial margin only when the point of deepest tumor penetration is on the mesenteric aspect of the bowel and extends to the surface of this margin with or without serosal penetration. These concepts are illustrated in the figure (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F81248\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef81248 \">figure 5</a>).

Total mesorectal excision (TME) with adequate surgical clearance around the penetrating edge of the tumor decreases the rate of local relapse. With this approach, all mesorectal soft tissues encasing the rectum (which includes the mesentery and all regional nodes) are removed intact, and the circumferential surface is the mesorectal fascia. Guidelines for grading the quality and completeness of the mesorectum in a TME are outlined in the table (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F111551\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef111551 \">table 9</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathology-and-prognostic-determinants-of-colorectal-cancer/abstract/67\" class=\"abstract_t\">67</a>].

Distant metastatic spread typically follows venous and not lymphatic drainage, and at least some data suggest that lymphatic and distant metastases arise from independent tumor subclones in a substantial number of cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathology-and-prognostic-determinants-of-colorectal-cancer/abstract/74,75\" class=\"abstract_t\">74,75</a>]. These findings support the view that lymph node involvement reflects intrinsic metastatic potential. </p><p>For both colon and rectal cancers, the incidence of regional node involvement is related both to the depth of transmural invasion of the primary tumor and to histologic grade.

The number of involved nodes influences outcome in both the N1 and N2 categories, regardless of the T category, both for rectal and colon cancer. In addition to the number of involved nodes, the total number of lymph nodes in the surgical specimen directly influences prognosis for both stage II (node-negative) and stage III (node-positive) disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathology-and-prognostic-determinants-of-colorectal-cancer/abstract/80-85\" class=\"abstract_t\">80-85</a>].

However, there is no consensus as to the optimal cutoff values defining the LNR category with the best outcomes. There are no prospective trials addressing this issue, and the values used in the available retrospective analyses vary widely [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathology-and-prognostic-determinants-of-colorectal-cancer/abstract/88\" class=\"abstract_t\">88</a>].</p><p>The reason for the relationship between total number of nodes in the specimen and outcomes is unclear. The most obvious explanation is that removal of more nodes increases the accuracy of staging. However, the strong association between total lymph node count and survival is not entirely explained by improvements in staging [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathology-and-prognostic-determinants-of-colorectal-cancer/abstract/85,89,90\" class=\"abstract_t\">85,89,90</a>]. The larger number of nodes may reflect the quality of the surgery and a more complete resection of the mesenteric pedicle. Alternatively, the differences between individual patients with colon cancer in terms of the number of lymph nodes present may reflect underlying biologic variability. As an example, tumor factors may stimulate lymph nodes to enlarge, reflecting immune system recognition of the tumor and more favorable survival outcomes with a higher number of lymph nodes that is independent of the number of metastatic lymph nodes. Such biological differences could contribute to the lack of association between average node counts, the frequency of nodal positivity, and survival in several hospital-based series [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathology-and-prognostic-determinants-of-colorectal-cancer/abstract/91-94\" class=\"abstract_t\">91-94</a>] and in population-based analyses from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) database [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathology-and-prognostic-determinants-of-colorectal-cancer/abstract/85,90\" class=\"abstract_t\">85,90</a>].</p><p>Despite the disparate findings, guidelines from expert groups recommend at least 12 nodes be examined histologically to accurately determine nodal status; however, this number was derived empirically based upon older observational data that was not adjusted for variables such as T-stage and tumor grade and the use of preoperative chemoradiotherapy for rectal cancer [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathology-and-prognostic-determinants-of-colorectal-cancer/abstract/11,80,81,95,96\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,80,81,95,96</a>].

Other histologic types (neuroendocrine neoplasms, hamartomas, mesenchymal tumors, lymphomas) are relatively unusual. Of the carcinomas, more than 90 percent are adenocarcinomas. (See <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Histology'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Cytokeratin 20 (CK20) and caudal-type homeobox 2 (CDX2) are two of the most sensitive and specific markers of intestinal differentiation and are extremely useful immunohistochemical (IHC) markers in correctly identifying adenocarcinomas of colorectal origin [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathology-and-prognostic-determinants-of-colorectal-cancer/abstract/30-32\" class=\"abstract_t\">30-32</a>]. IHC for CK20 and CK7 can be particularly helpful in the differential diagnosis of a primary appendiceal malignancy versus mucinous ovarian cancer (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F58475\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef58475 \">table 5</a>). (See <a href=\"#H672788825\" class=\"local\">'Immunohistochemistry'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The most powerful tool for assessing prognosis following potentially curative surgery for colorectal cancer (CRC) is pathologic analysis of the resected specimen. The most important pathologic characteristics are the presence of distant metastases, local tumor extent, nodal positivity (particularly the number of involved lymph nodes), residual disease, extramural tumor deposits, lymphovascular and perineural invasion, histologic grade of differentiation, and for patients treated with neoadjuvant therapy prior to resection of a rectal cancer, the tumor regression grade. (See <a href=\"#H672792378\" class=\"local\">'Pathologic features'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The depth of tumor invasion, status of the regional nodes, and the presence or absence of metastases are used to define the tumor stage, which is then used to derive prognostic stage groupings. Five-year survival stratified by tumor stage at diagnosis for colon cancer using the American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) 2010 staging criteria is illustrated in the figure (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F81414\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef81414 \">figure 3</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathology-and-prognostic-determinants-of-colorectal-cancer/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. Five-year survival stratified by tumor stage at diagnosis for rectal cancer using the 2010 staging criteria is illustrated in the figure (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F60598\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef60598 \">figure 2</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathology-and-prognostic-determinants-of-colorectal-cancer/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H8\" class=\"local\">'TNM staging'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Among patients receiving neoadjuvant (presurgical) treatment for rectal cancer, the posttreatment stage (given a yp designation in the AJCC staging system, see above) is a more accurate predictor of outcome than is the pretreatment clinical stage. Five-year survivals according to pathologic stage after chemoradiotherapy for rectal cancer are outlined in the table (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F111443\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef111443 \">table 8</a>). (See <a href=\"#H1641722874\" class=\"local\">'Posttherapy staging for rectal cancer'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Further stratification of outcomes can be achieved by the identification of patients with a high preoperative serum level of the tumor marker carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA), clinical obstruction at the time of diagnosis, and macroscopic perforation of the tumor. (See <a href=\"#H672792703\" class=\"local\">'Clinical features'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Preliminary studies suggest that molecular features may also influence outcome, independent of stage at presentation. However, despite the enormous number of correlative studies exploring the prognostic significance of various molecular features, the only factors that are used for clinical decision-making at present are the status of the DNA mismatch repair (MMR) proteins (the biologic footprint of loss of deficient MMR status is microsatellite instability), and <em>BRAF</em> and <em>RAS</em> mutations. These factors are both prognostic and predictive of chemotherapy efficacy. (See <a href=\"#H26\" class=\"local\">'Mismatch repair deficiency'</a> above and <a href=\"#H1022797966\" class=\"local\">'RAS and BRAF'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Until large, statistically robust studies are completed with multivariate analysis of an array of potential prognostic factors and their interaction with each other, no other molecular or genetic markers should be used routinely to develop treatment recommendations or to estimate prognosis in patients with resected CRC. The past few years has seen exciting developments in the field of molecular tumor classification, especially in the identification of the importance of the tumor microenvironment to biologic behavior. Such progress raises the possibility of future molecularly-based prognostic stratification systems that may someday be used to select specific therapy, but molecular classification is not yet ready for incorporation into available staging systems or other prognostic models.
