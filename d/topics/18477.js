In the United States for example, vaginal cancer accounts for approximately 4000 cases and over 900 deaths annually [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vaginal-cancer/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p>Most of these tumors are squamous cell carcinomas, but melanoma, sarcoma, adenocarcinoma, and other histologic types also occur (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F72984\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef72984 \">table 1</a>). Although primary vaginal cancer is rare, metastatic disease to the vagina or local extension from adjacent gynecologic structures is not uncommon. As a result, the majority of vaginal malignancies are metastatic, often arising from the endometrium, cervix, vulva, ovary, breast, rectum, and kidney [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vaginal-cancer/abstract/2-5\" class=\"abstract_t\">2-5</a>]. Vaginal metastases may occur by direct extension (eg, cervix, vulva, endometrium) or by lymphatic or hematogenous spread (eg, breast, ovary, kidney).</p><p>The clinical manifestations, evaluation, and therapy of invasive vaginal cancer are reviewed here. Vaginal intraepithelial neoplasia is discussed elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=vaginal-intraepithelial-neoplasia\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Vaginal intraepithelial neoplasia&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">EPIDEMIOLOGY AND RISK FACTORS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Approximately 1 in 100,000 women will be diagnosed with in situ or invasive vaginal cancer (typically of squamous cell histology) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vaginal-cancer/abstract/6,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,7</a>]. The mean age at diagnosis of squamous cell carcinoma, the most common histologic type of vaginal cancer, is approximately 60 years, although the disease is seen occasionally in women in their 20s and 30s. Squamous carcinoma is more common as the age of the patient increases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vaginal-cancer/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].</p><p>Most cases of vaginal cancer are likely mediated by human papillomavirus (HPV) infection, as with cervical cancer [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vaginal-cancer/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. In a case-control study of 156 women with in situ or invasive vaginal cancer, over 50 percent were positive for antibodies to HPV subtypes 16 or 18 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vaginal-cancer/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. Thus, vaginal cancer has the same risk factors as cervical neoplasia: multiple lifetime sexual partners, early age at first intercourse, and being a current smoker [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vaginal-cancer/abstract/9,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,10</a>].</p><p>There is evidence that some high-grade vulvar and vaginal intraepithelial neoplasia are monoclonal lesions derived from high-grade or malignant cervical disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vaginal-cancer/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. This was supported by a retrospective cohort study of over 130,000 women in which women with cervical intraepithelial neoplasia 3 (CIN 3) had a significantly increased rate of developing vaginal cancer compared with all women within the same population and time period (standardized incidence ratio 6.8, 95% CI 5.6-8.2) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vaginal-cancer/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. A fourfold or greater increased risk was found until 25 years following CIN 3 diagnosis. Similarly, in a case series, 30 percent of all women with in situ or invasive vaginal disease had been treated for a prior anogenital tumor (primarily cervical), and 17 of 25 (70 percent) of invasive cancer biopsy specimens contained HPV <span class=\"nowrap\">16/18</span> DNA. Similarly, in a series of 153 women with vaginal cancer treated at the Princess Margaret Hospital, 51 patients had a prior gynecologic malignancy; of these, 34 had cervical cancer [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vaginal-cancer/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=vaginal-intraepithelial-neoplasia#H3\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Vaginal intraepithelial neoplasia&quot;, section on 'Epidemiology'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=vaginal-intraepithelial-neoplasia#H5\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Vaginal intraepithelial neoplasia&quot;, section on 'Etiology'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL MANIFESTATIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Vaginal bleeding is the most common clinical presentation of vaginal cancer. Many women are asymptomatic.</p><p>Vaginal bleeding associated with vaginal cancer is typically postcoital or postmenopausal. Any unscheduled vaginal bleeding should be investigated to determine if the source is vaginal. A watery, blood-tinged, or malodorous vaginal discharge may also be present [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vaginal-cancer/abstract/14-16\" class=\"abstract_t\">14-16</a>].</p><p>A vaginal mass may also be noted by the patient. Other potential symptoms are related to local extension of disease, urinary symptoms (eg, frequency, dysuria, hematuria), or gastrointestinal complaints (eg, tenesmus, constipation, melena) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vaginal-cancer/abstract/14-16\" class=\"abstract_t\">14-16</a>]. Pelvic pain from extension of disease beyond the vagina is present in 5 percent of patients.</p><p>As many as 20 percent of women are asymptomatic at time of diagnosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vaginal-cancer/abstract/17-19\" class=\"abstract_t\">17-19</a>]. These vaginal cancers may be detected as a result of cytologic screening for cervical cancer or may be an incidental finding of a vaginal mass on pelvic examination.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2840282433\"><span class=\"h1\">DIAGNOSTIC EVALUATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The key elements of the diagnostic evaluation are the pelvic examination, vaginal cytology, and vaginal biopsy.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2840282494\"><span class=\"h2\">History</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The history should include questions about symptoms associated with vaginal cancer. (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Clinical manifestations'</a> above.)</p><p>A gynecologic history should be taken, including a history of cervical or vulvar neoplasia, because history of other gynecologic malignancy could exclude the diagnosis of vaginal cancer. A medical, surgical, and medication history should be taken. This should include assessment of medical comorbidities that may impact treatment decisions.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2840282557\"><span class=\"h2\">Physical examination</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A complete pelvic examination is performed. During the speculum examination, the vagina should be inspected thoroughly, including visualization of the entire circumference and the fornices by moving the position of the speculum. Any abnormal areas or masses should be biopsied. The bimanual examination should include palpation of the vaginal walls for masses and evaluation for other pelvic masses. The groins should be palpated to assess for enlarged lymph nodes.</p><p>The lesion may be missed on initial examination if it is small and situated in the lower two-thirds of the vagina. During visual examination of the vagina, the anterior and posterior blades of the speculum obscure this area, so the tumor may be missed unless the vagina is inspected as the speculum is removed or the lesion is palpated on bimanual examination.</p><p>Rectovaginal exam should also be performed to assess for parametrial and pelvic sidewall involvement and possible rectal involvement.</p><p>The posterior wall of the upper one-third of the vagina is the most common site of primary vaginal carcinoma. In one review, tumors occurred in the upper-, middle-, and lower-third of the vagina in 50, 20, and 30 percent of cases, respectively, with more than one-half of the tumors arising from the posterior vaginal wall [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vaginal-cancer/abstract/7,20\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,20</a>].</p><p>The lesion may appear as a mass, a plaque, or an ulcer.</p><p>A focused physical examination is performed to assess for metastatic disease. In particular, the inguinal area should be examined for enlarged lymph nodes.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2840282578\"><span class=\"h2\">Vaginal cytology</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A vaginal cytology specimen should be obtained during the pelvic examination. Twenty percent of vaginal cancers are detected incidentally as a result of cytologic screening for cervical cancer [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vaginal-cancer/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cervical-and-vaginal-cytology-interpretation-of-results-pap-test-report#H9531352\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Cervical and vaginal cytology: Interpretation of results (Pap test report)&quot;, section on 'Vaginal cytology'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2840282632\"><span class=\"h2\">Vaginal colposcopy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>If a lesion is not visualized and there are abnormal cytology results, colposcopy of the cervix and vagina should be performed with acetic acid followed by Lugol iodine stain. In addition, if a gross lesion is visualized, some experts advise performing vaginal colposcopy to examine the rest of the vagina. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=colposcopy#H16\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Colposcopy&quot;, section on 'Vaginal colposcopy'</a>.) </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2840282638\"><span class=\"h2\">Vaginal biopsy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>An office biopsy of abnormal areas of the vagina can be done with either punch (Baker or Keyes) or cervical (Tischler or Burke) biopsy forceps. An examination under anesthesia may be necessary for examination and biopsy for women with significant vaginal stenosis that precludes an adequate office examination, in older adult women, or if cystoscopy and proctoscopy are necessary for clinical staging. (See <a href=\"#H10\" class=\"local\">'Staging'</a> below.) &#160;</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1120870508\"><span class=\"h2\">Imaging studies</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The only imaging studies that are part of the International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics (FIGO) staging for vaginal cancer are chest and skeletal radiography (see <a href=\"#H10\" class=\"local\">'Staging'</a> below). However, advanced imaging, such as computed tomography (CT), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and 18-fluoro-2-deoxyglucose-positron emission tomography and CT <span class=\"nowrap\">(FDG-PET/CT)</span> can be helpful for treatment planning. MRI can assist in determining the primary vaginal tumor size and local extent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vaginal-cancer/abstract/22,23\" class=\"abstract_t\">22,23</a>]. Vaginal tumors generally are best seen on T2 imaging, and instilling gel into the vaginal canal, which distends the vaginal walls, often aids in visualizing and assessing the thickness of the vaginal tumor. FDG-PET can also be helpful for evaluating the primary vaginal tumor and abnormal lymph nodes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vaginal-cancer/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h1\">DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Vaginal cancer is a histologic diagnosis based upon a vaginal biopsy and no history of a previous gynecologic malignancy that could better define the vaginal disease as a recurrent cancer as opposed to a new primary.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2840282440\"><span class=\"h1\">DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The differential diagnosis of vaginal bleeding requires first that bleeding from other genital tract sites is excluded. This can typically be accomplished with pelvic examination.</p><p>Vaginal bleeding may be caused by vaginal atrophy in menopausal women. In addition, vaginal infection, inflammation, or trauma may result in bleeding. Rarely, vaginal bleeding is due to a dermatologic condition (eg, toxic epidermal necrolysis). Bleeding from these etiologies may result in focal bleeding from a fissure or laceration, which is not generally found in vaginal cancer. Or, it may result in an ulcer or diffuse bleeding, which may also be found in vaginal cancer.</p><p>A vaginal mass may also be benign, including Gartner duct cysts, vaginal polyps, or vaginal adenosis or endometriosis.</p><p>The differential diagnosis of female genital tract bleeding is discussed in detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=differential-diagnosis-of-genital-tract-bleeding-in-women\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Differential diagnosis of genital tract bleeding in women&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h1\">HISTOPATHOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Primary vaginal tumors comprise a heterogeneous group of malignancies (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F72984\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef72984 \">table 1</a>) that can be multicentric, thus, the entire vaginal mucosa is at risk.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Squamous cell carcinoma</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Squamous cell carcinoma accounts for the majority of vaginal cancers. The mean age at diagnosis of squamous cell carcinomas is approximately 60 years, as noted above [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vaginal-cancer/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. Grossly, these tumors may be nodular, ulcerative, indurated, endophytic, or exophytic. Histologically, they are similar to squamous cell tumors from other sites. Vaginal cancer is also associated with the human papillomavirus (HPV). However, vaginal epithelium is more stable than cervical epithelium, which undergoes constant metaplasia, and is thus less susceptible to oncogenic viruses [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vaginal-cancer/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Epidemiology and risk factors'</a> above.)</p><p>Verrucous carcinoma is an uncommon variant of vaginal squamous cell carcinoma that is well-differentiated and has low malignant potential [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vaginal-cancer/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. It usually presents as a large, warty, fungating mass that is locally aggressive but rarely metastasizes. Histologically, it is composed of large papillary fronds covered by dense keratin. Its deep margin creates a pushing border of well-oriented rete ridges in contrast to the well-demarcated margins of benign condyloma acuminata.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Adenocarcinoma</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Adenocarcinomas represent nearly all of the primary vaginal cancers in women younger than 20 years old [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vaginal-cancer/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. Adenocarcinomas may arise in areas of vaginal adenosis, Wolffian rest elements, periurethral glands, and foci of endometriosis. Clear cell variants are the best known type of adenocarcinoma, primarily because of their occurrence in young women who have been exposed in utero to diethylstilbestrol (DES) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vaginal-cancer/abstract/15,28\" class=\"abstract_t\">15,28</a>]. Grossly, clear cell carcinomas of the vagina usually present as polypoid masses, most often on the anterior wall of the vagina. Approximately 70 percent of patients are stage I at the time of diagnosis.</p><p>DES exposure can result in both cervical and vaginal clear cell adenocarcinomas. As an example, in one report of genital clear cell carcinomas in the Netherlands, vaginal tumors were detected in 33 percent of cases and cervical tumors were detected in 80 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vaginal-cancer/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. In addition, the incidence of invasive or in situ squamous cell cancer of the cervix is increased in women exposed to DES in utero. In one report from the Netherlands DES Information Center, the prevalence of cervical cancer was 5.4-fold higher than expected, based on age and period-specific prevalence rates from the Netherlands cancer registry [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vaginal-cancer/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>].</p><p>In females exposed in utero to DES, the actual risk of developing clear cell adenocarcinoma through age 34 is only 1 in 1000, with the highest risk in those who were exposed before 12 weeks of gestation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vaginal-cancer/abstract/31,32\" class=\"abstract_t\">31,32</a>]. The median age at diagnosis of DES-related clear cell adenocarcinoma of the vagina is 19 years, with a range of 7 to 33 years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vaginal-cancer/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]. Nonmalignant abnormalities can also occur; areas of vaginal adenosis and structural abnormalities of the uterus, cervix, or vagina are present in 45 and 25 percent of these women, respectively. Thus, it is recommended that women exposed to DES in utero have their first gynecologic examination at menarche with a careful assessment of the cervix and vagina, in addition to cervical and vaginal cytological examination. An examination of DES-exposed women should consist of colposcopic inspection of the cervix and vagina, yearly cytologic examination of the cervix and vagina, and careful palpation of the cervix and entire vaginal wall. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=outcome-and-follow-up-of-diethylstilbestrol-des-exposed-individuals\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Outcome and follow-up of diethylstilbestrol (DES) exposed individuals&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Most women with DES-associated clear cell vaginal cancer have good outcomes with primary radiation, surgery, or both [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vaginal-cancer/abstract/33,34\" class=\"abstract_t\">33,34</a>]. On the other hand, adenocarcinomas that occur in non-DES-exposed women tend to have a poorer outcome [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vaginal-cancer/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Sarcoma</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Leiomyosarcomas, endometrial stromal sarcomas, malignant mixed m&uuml;llerian tumors, and rhabdomyosarcomas are the major types of primary vaginal sarcomas. The most common of these is the embryonal rhabdomyosarcoma (sarcoma botryoides), a highly malignant tumor that occurs in the vagina during infancy and early childhood (mean age, three years) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vaginal-cancer/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>]. This sarcoma generally presents as soft nodules that fill and sometimes protrude from the vagina, resembling a bunch of grapes (botryoides comes from the Greek word botrys, which means &quot;grapes&quot;) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F56001\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef56001 \">picture 1</a>). The prognosis for patients with this malignancy has improved with the use of multimodality therapy, including surgery, chemotherapy (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=vincristine-conventional-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">vincristine</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cyclophosphamide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cyclophosphamide</a>, and actinomycin D), and radiation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vaginal-cancer/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>].

The majority all of the reported cases have been in Caucasian women [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vaginal-cancer/abstract/38,39\" class=\"abstract_t\">38,39</a>]. These malignancies occur at a mean age of approximately 60 years (range, 22 to 84 years). The presenting symptom is most commonly vaginal bleeding. They appear as a blue-black or black-brown mass, plaque, or ulceration, most frequently on the distal one-third of the anterior vaginal wall. Importantly, they are often nonpigmented. Primary malignant melanomas of the urogenital mucous membranes may have aggressive biologic behavior with a high rate of local failure and metastases. The five-year survival rate for vaginal melanomas is usually less than 20 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vaginal-cancer/abstract/25,39-41\" class=\"abstract_t\">25,39-41</a>].

This is due to anatomic considerations, because surgical resection of tumors at this location frequently requires vulvovaginectomy in addition to inguinal node dissection to achieve negative margins and acceptable oncologic outcomes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vaginal-cancer/abstract/46\" class=\"abstract_t\">46</a>].

In addition, if surgical resection is attempted, it is difficult to get an adequate margin if the lesion is too close to the bladder or rectum.</p><p/><p>Inguinal lymph nodes will also have to be assessed if the tumor is in the distal portion of the vagina.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H95436081\"><span class=\"h3\">Surgery</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The surgical approach for vaginal cancer requires a radical hysterectomy, upper vaginectomy, and bilateral pelvic lymphadenectomy. If a hysterectomy has been performed previously, then radical vaginectomy and bilateral lymphadenectomies should be done to complete the surgical therapy. Patients with stage I vaginal cancer appear to have the best outcomes when treated surgically. This was shown in a literature review that showed patients with early-stage disease had a mean five-year survival rate of 77 percent, which was far better than those with later-stage disease, regardless of whether or not adjuvant RT was administered [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vaginal-cancer/abstract/6,48\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,48</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H95436504\"><span class=\"h3\">Radiation therapy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>For some patients, radiation alone is adequate treatment. As an example, the outcomes with contemporary RT alone for early-stage vaginal cancer were shown in one series of 91 women treated at a single institution; for patients with stage I disease (n = 38), the two-year rates of overall survival, locoregional control rate, and distant metastasis-free survival were 96.2, 80.6, and 87.5 percent, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vaginal-cancer/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. The use of brachytherapy is particularly important, as a Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) study including over 2500 vaginal cancer patients found an improved median survival with treatment including brachytherapy compared with external radiation alone, 6.1 versus 3.6 years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vaginal-cancer/abstract/49\" class=\"abstract_t\">49</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H258796566\"><span class=\"h4\">Technique</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A total radiation dose of at least 70 to 75 Gy is generally recommend, with 45 to 50 Gy being delivered with external beam radiation and the additional radiation being delivered with intracavitary or interstitial brachytherapy radiation, depending on the thickness of the primary tumor. The external radiation should include the pelvic lymph nodes, vaginal tumor with a margin, vagina, and paravaginal tissues and inguinal lymph nodes if the vaginal tumor is in the lower half of the vaginal canal. Brachytherapy radiation should immediately follow the completion of external radiation. Residual vaginal tumors less than 5 mm thick can be treated with vaginal cylinder or similar applicator, while tumors thicker than 5 mm require an interstitial treatment for adequate dose and normal tissue sparing [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vaginal-cancer/abstract/50\" class=\"abstract_t\">50</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H95436094\"><span class=\"h2\">Stage II to IV tumors</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients with more advanced disease are often not candidates for surgery.

Because of the poor prognosis with radiation alone (predominantly local failures) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vaginal-cancer/abstract/51\" class=\"abstract_t\">51</a>], we often proceed with the combined use of radiation and concurrent chemotherapy in women with high-risk disease (eg, stage III or IV, or tumor size larger than 4 cm) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vaginal-cancer/abstract/52-54\" class=\"abstract_t\">52-54</a>].
