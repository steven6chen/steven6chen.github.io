Accordingly, these disorders are presenting an increasing global health burden. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=public-health-issues-in-the-thalassemic-syndromes\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Public health issues in the thalassemic syndromes&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The most important distinction that needs to be made when considering mutant hemoglobins is the frequency with which they are found in human populations.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3714839\"><span class=\"h2\">High frequency mutations</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>One group of mutant globin genes, including hemoglobins S, C, and E, is found at a frequency varying from 2 to 95 percent in different populations. These mutations are the product of expansion via selective external forces (eg, malaria) because, in the asymptomatic heterozygous form, they protect carriers from dying of malarial infection. These mutations are ethnic-specific, in that they are present in some human populations and not in others. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=protection-against-malaria-in-the-hemoglobinopathies\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Protection against malaria in the hemoglobinopathies&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3714845\"><span class=\"h2\">Low frequency mutations</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Hemoglobin mutants in the second group exist at frequencies below 1 percent, and many times occur as spontaneous mutations in the propositus. These mutations usually have no medical consequences, but a subset can have serious abnormalities when present in the homozygous form. They are not ethnic-specific and examples of the same mutation, originating independently, can be found in any ethnic group.</p><p>Mutant hemoglobins that have frequencies of approximately 1 to 2 percent in the population may or may not have been expanded by selection (eg, HbDLos Angeles, HbG-Philadelphia, Hb Hasharon). An alternative explanation is that these abnormal hemoglobins have a slightly higher frequency than predicted by mutational pressure alone (ie, no selection due to external forces) because of a &quot;founder effect.&quot; This occurs when a population originates from a single &quot;founder&quot; or a small group of people that by chance had a high frequency of a particular non-selected hemoglobin mutation.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3714851\"><span class=\"h2\">Clinical significance</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The majority of hemoglobin mutants are not associated with any clinical manifestations. Many were discovered during the course of large population surveys. The &quot;classical&quot; diagnostic tool for the detection of new hemoglobin mutants was zone electrophoresis, which separates proteins differing in electrical charge. However, other methods such as high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) are increasingly used. A number of more sophisticated techniques have also been applied to the detection of mutant hemoglobins, including mass spectrometry and sequencing of DNA fragments generated by the polymerase chain reaction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/introduction-to-hemoglobin-mutations/abstract/4-8\" class=\"abstract_t\">4-8</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methods-for-hemoglobin-analysis-and-hemoglobinopathy-testing\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Methods for hemoglobin analysis and hemoglobinopathy testing&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">QUANTITATION OF MUTANT HEMOGLOBINS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In patients heterozygous for a globin gene mutation, the quantitative amount of mutant hemoglobin is variable and depends upon a number of factors, such as the number of functioning genes in the individual, stability of the messenger RNA, rate of synthesis and stability of the gene product, and the efficiency with which the abnormal hemoglobin is assembled.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Beta globin mutations</strong> &ndash; In heterozygotes, beta globin mutant hemoglobins generally comprise approximately 50 percent of the total hemoglobin in the red cell, in keeping with the presence of two beta globin genes, only one of which is abnormal in the heterozygous setting. Exceptions to this rule are discussed below.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Alpha globin mutations</strong> &ndash; Normal hemoglobin is produced from four alpha globin genes. Thus, alpha globin mutants in heterozygotes usually comprise approximately 25 percent of the hemolysate. This fraction increases if deletional forms of alpha thalassemia are also present in the same subject. In addition, the two tandem alpha globin genes differ in transcriptional efficiency, with alpha-2 being two to three times more efficient than alpha-1. As a result, stable mutants expressed by the alpha-2 gene tend to be relatively more abundant than those expressed by the alpha-1 gene [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/introduction-to-hemoglobin-mutations/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pathophysiology-of-alpha-thalassemia#H2\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pathophysiology of alpha thalassemia&quot;, section on 'Definitions'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Assembly of the mutant hemoglobin</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The proportion of normal and mutant hemoglobins in red cells of heterozygotes provides insight into the assembly of human hemoglobins [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/introduction-to-hemoglobin-mutations/abstract/10,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,11</a>]. The great majority of beta chain mutants are synthesized at the same rate as normal beta chains, and have normal stability [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/introduction-to-hemoglobin-mutations/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. Thus, heterozygotes would be expected to have equal amounts of normal and mutant hemoglobin. However, measurements of this proportion in heterozygotes have revealed unexpected variability, due, at least in part, to the net charge of the mutant globin chain.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h3\">Positively charged beta chain mutants</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Positively charged beta chain mutants such as hemoglobins S, C, D-Los Angeles, and E constitute significantly less than one-half of the total hemoglobin in heterozygotes, and are reduced further in the presence of alpha thalassemia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/introduction-to-hemoglobin-mutations/abstract/10,11,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,11,13</a>]. As an example, for patients heterozygous for the sickle mutation, average values for the percent of HbS are reduced in proportion to the number of active alpha genes, as follows (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F70184\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef70184 \">table 3</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F116210\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef116210 \">table 4</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/introduction-to-hemoglobin-mutations/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Four alpha globin genes &ndash; 35 to 45 percent HbS</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Three alpha globin genes &ndash; 30 to 35 percent HbS</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Two alpha globin genes &ndash; 25 to 30 percent HbS</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>One alpha globin gene &ndash; 17 to 25 percent HbS</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h3\">Negatively charged beta chain mutants</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Many of the more negatively charged beta chain mutants in heterozygotes are present in amounts exceeding that of HbA. In two heterozygotes who had a negatively charged mutant (HbJ-Baltimore or HbJ-Iran) in conjunction with alpha thalassemia, the proportion of the mutant hemoglobin was found to be even further increased [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/introduction-to-hemoglobin-mutations/abstract/10,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,11</a>].</p><p>This analysis suggests that alterations in surface charge of the mutant globin chain contribute to different rates of assembly of the hemoglobin tetramer. This hypothesis is supported by in vitro mixing experiments with normal and mutant beta subunits, showing that when alpha chains are present in limiting amounts, mimicking the situation seen in alpha thalassemia, hemoglobins containing negatively charged mutants are formed much more readily than those containing positively charged mutants (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F72950\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef72950 \">figure 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/introduction-to-hemoglobin-mutations/abstract/15,16\" class=\"abstract_t\">15,16</a>].</p><p>This electrostatic model of hemoglobin assembly has clinical implications. Differences in rates of assembly explain not only the low proportion of HbS in sickle cell trait (35 to 45 percent HbS) but also why the proportion of HbS in SC red cells is 10 to 15 percent higher than in AS red cells [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/introduction-to-hemoglobin-mutations/abstract/17,18\" class=\"abstract_t\">17,18</a>]. The prominent clinical manifestations of HbSC disease and their absence in sickle trait can be attributed in part to differences in the intracellular content of HbS [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/introduction-to-hemoglobin-mutations/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. The higher proportion of HbS in SC red cells compared with AS red cells is due to the fact that the affinity of alpha subunits for beta subunits is in the following order: Beta A &gt; Beta S &gt; Beta C. This model also provides an explanation for differences in the levels of HbA<sub>2</sub> and HbF that accompany certain hematologic disorders [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/introduction-to-hemoglobin-mutations/abstract/10,19,20\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,19,20</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL PHENOTYPES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Individuals with a mutant globin gene(s) come to the attention of clinicians when the mutation affects hemoglobin solubility, stability, oxygen affinity, or synthesis (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F61649\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef61649 \">table 1</a>).

This leads to the formation of sickle-shaped red cells (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F77366\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef77366 \">picture 1</a>) that occlude blood flow in the microcirculation. HbS is frequently seen in Africa, the Middle East, Mediterranean countries, and among the tribes of India. It is also found in other locations to which these populations have migrated.

Hemoglobin analysis shows &gt;90 percent HbE and no Hb A, with the remainder being HbF.</p><p/><p>This mutation is very frequent in the Indian subcontinent and southeast Asia, where the frequency of HbE approaches 60 percent, presumably because of the resistance of HbAE red cells to invasion by P. falciparum.

The high amount of HbE in heterozygotes (30 percent) or homozygotes (&gt;90 percent) distinguishes HbE from HbA<sub>2</sub>, since the latter is a minor hemoglobin usually constituting less than 5 percent of total hemoglobin.</p><p>A variable and occasionally much more severe phenotype is seen when this mutation is combined with other alpha <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> beta globin chain mutations (ie, sickle hemoglobin or combinations of alpha <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> beta thalassemia) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/introduction-to-hemoglobin-mutations/abstract/25,26\" class=\"abstract_t\">25,26</a>].
