The management of bowel obstruction depends upon the etiology, severity, and location of the obstruction. The goals of initial management are to relieve discomfort and restore normal fluid volume and electrolytes in preparation for possible surgical intervention. Some patients may be candidates for a trial of nonoperative management. High-quality data to guide management of SBO are sparse, and clinical practice is highly variable; however, guidelines based upon the available evidence are available from the Eastern Association for the Surgery of Trauma (EAST) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-management-of-mechanical-small-bowel-obstruction-in-adults/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>], and from the World Society of Emergency Surgery (Bologna guidelines). The latter focuses on the management of adhesion-related small bowel obstruction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-management-of-mechanical-small-bowel-obstruction-in-adults/abstract/3,4\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,4</a>].</p><p>This topic review will focus on the management of mechanical small bowel obstruction. The clinical features and diagnosis of mechanical small bowel obstruction are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epidemiology-clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-mechanical-small-bowel-obstruction-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Epidemiology, clinical features, and diagnosis of mechanical small bowel obstruction in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H372577752\"><span class=\"h1\">INITIAL MANAGEMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients with clinical features of small bowel obstruction (SBO) who are diagnosed with acute mechanical small bowel obstruction generally require admission to the hospital for initial management that includes intravenous fluid therapy and electrolyte replacement in preparation for surgery, if indicated, or as an element of nonoperative management. Patients with chronic <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> intermittent mechanical small bowel obstruction, such as patients with small bowel strictures related to Crohn's disease, radiation enteritis, or other etiologies that can cause partial bowel obstruction, may be managed expectantly on an outpatient basis. Such patients should limit their oral intake to fluids, and as long as hydration and normal electrolyte balance can be maintained, which may require outpatient fluid therapy, hospitalization may be avoided. In a review of 129 patients, placement of a nasogastric tube to manage nausea and emesis predicted the need for admission, which occurred in approximately one-half of patients who presented to the emergency room with varying degrees and etiologies for small bowel obstruction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-management-of-mechanical-small-bowel-obstruction-in-adults/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H72469672\"><span class=\"h2\">Surgical consultation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>For patients with symptoms that are severe enough to require admission for symptoms of abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting, we suggest prompt surgical consultation to aid in determining if immediate surgical intervention is needed. (See <a href=\"#H372577787\" class=\"local\">'Indications for surgical exploration'</a> below.)</p><p>If surgery is not immediately indicated, we suggest admission to a dedicated surgical service unless such a service is not available or the patient is not a candidate for, or is unwilling to consider, an operation. (See <a href=\"#H3958937\" class=\"local\">'Medical therapies'</a> below.)</p><p>Patients with small bowel obstruction admitted to a surgical service have shorter length of stay, fewer hospital charges, a shorter time to surgery, and lower mortality than patients admitted to medical service [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-management-of-mechanical-small-bowel-obstruction-in-adults/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. For patients who are admitted to a medical service for the management of SBO, the use of clear-cut SBO management protocols reportedly decreases time to surgical consultation, decreases time to operative intervention, and shortens hospital length of stay [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-management-of-mechanical-small-bowel-obstruction-in-adults/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H372577759\"><span class=\"h2\">Fluid therapy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients with bowel obstruction can have severe volume depletion, metabolic acidosis or alkalosis, and electrolyte abnormalities. This is particularly true for patients with copious emesis from proximal small bowel obstruction, those with symptoms lasting several days prior to presentation, or obstruction that causes large-volume intraluminal fluid sequestration. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epidemiology-clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-mechanical-small-bowel-obstruction-in-adults#H13713325\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Epidemiology, clinical features, and diagnosis of mechanical small bowel obstruction in adults&quot;, section on 'Pathophysiology'</a>.)</p><p>Upon admission, adequate intravenous (IV) access in the form of two large-bore peripheral lines should be obtained for fluid resuscitation. Lactated ringers or normal saline may be appropriate for intravenous fluid therapy. Aggressive potassium repletion may be needed, but it is important to be certain the patient does not have acute kidney injury (acute renal failure) from severe dehydration, in which case potassium supplementation should be given cautiously until renal function can be improved. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=maintenance-and-replacement-fluid-therapy-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Maintenance and replacement fluid therapy in adults&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-the-management-of-acute-kidney-injury-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of the management of acute kidney injury in adults&quot;</a>.) </p><p>Although suspected strangulation warrants operative intervention as soon as possible, fluid resuscitation and repletion of electrolytes prior to surgery helps minimize complications (eg, hypotension) related to some anesthesia induction agents. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=general-anesthesia-induction#H295889468\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;General anesthesia: Induction&quot;, section on 'Selection of induction technique'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H372577766\"><span class=\"h2\">Diet</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In general, all patients with mechanical bowel obstruction should be made nil per os (NPO) to limit bowel distension; however, a small subset of patients with partial bowel obstruction may tolerate a small amount of liquids. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H372577773\"><span class=\"h2\">Gastrointestinal decompression</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The need for gastrointestinal decompression in the setting of small bowel obstruction may vary from patient to patient and remains a matter of clinical judgment. For patients with small bowel mechanical bowel obstruction that is associated with significant distension, nausea, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> vomiting, we recommend nasogastric tube decompression [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-management-of-mechanical-small-bowel-obstruction-in-adults/abstract/1-3\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-3</a>]. In patients with complete or high-grade small bowel obstruction, decompression of the distended stomach improves patient comfort and also minimizes the passage of swallowed air, which can worsen distension. The placement and management of nasogastric tubes is discussed elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nasogastric-and-nasoenteric-tubes\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Nasogastric and nasoenteric tubes&quot;</a>.)</p><p>For patients with recurrent small bowel obstruction who have undergone multiple prior operations, and in whom another operation is felt to be particularly risky, one can attempt long tube decompression as a component of conservative management to avoid further surgery. However, there are few data to support this practice over the use of standard nasogastric decompression, and as such, we do not advocate the routine use of long tubes in patients with small bowel obstruction. Older trials comparing standard nasogastric tubes and long tubes weighted with a mercury-filled balloon (eg, Miller-Abbott tube, Anderson tube, Dennis tube [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-management-of-mechanical-small-bowel-obstruction-in-adults/abstract/7,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,8</a>]), found no significant difference in the percentage of patients ultimately requiring surgical intervention [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-management-of-mechanical-small-bowel-obstruction-in-adults/abstract/3,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,9</a>]. However, a later randomized trial comparing 90 patients managed with an endoscopically-placed long hydrophilic silicon tube with 96 patients managed with a nasogastric tube found a significantly decreased time to relief of clinical symptoms in the group managed with the long tube compared with the nasogastric tube (4.1 versus 8.5 days) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-management-of-mechanical-small-bowel-obstruction-in-adults/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. Overall effectiveness (ie, no need for surgery) was nearly doubled in the long tube group (90 versus 47 percent). The improved outcomes seen in this one study will need to be replicated in future studies before routine implementation; concerns remain over the potential risks of long tubes, such as knot formation. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H372577780\"><span class=\"h2\">Pain management</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In general, pain from mechanical bowel obstruction, which is crampy in nature, is often not amenable to treatment with analgesics, particularly opioids. If the patient's pain is severe and unrelenting, there may be a strangulating mechanism that would indicate the need for surgical intervention. However, pain management with opioids and other pharmacologic agents is reasonable in palliative care patients. (See <a href=\"#H3958937\" class=\"local\">'Medical therapies'</a> below.) </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H372577787\"><span class=\"h1\">INDICATIONS FOR SURGICAL EXPLORATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>All patients suspected of having complicated bowel obstruction (complete obstruction, closed-loop obstruction, bowel ischemia, necrosis, or perforation) based upon clinical and radiologic examination should be taken to the operating room for abdominal exploration [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-management-of-mechanical-small-bowel-obstruction-in-adults/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>]. Although some surgeons may be reluctant to operate on patients with a history of prior surgery for intraabdominal malignancy because they believe that obstruction due to metastatic cancer is not likely to be relieved by surgery, this is not necessarily the case as many are due to adhesions. Nonoperative therapy for malignant obstruction is associated with a high failure rate and high mortality, but on the other hand, palliative surgery for those in whom the obstruction cannot be relieved is also associated with overall poor outcomes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-management-of-mechanical-small-bowel-obstruction-in-adults/abstract/10-14\" class=\"abstract_t\">10-14</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H3956584\" class=\"local\">'Patients with malignancy'</a> below.)</p><p>The incidence of complications with adhesive obstruction is overall low [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-management-of-mechanical-small-bowel-obstruction-in-adults/abstract/15-25\" class=\"abstract_t\">15-25</a>]. Among patients who present with small bowel obstruction, incarcerated hernias cause the majority of complications [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-management-of-mechanical-small-bowel-obstruction-in-adults/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. </p><p>The development of complicated obstruction during a trial of conservative, nonoperative management should also prompt surgical exploration [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-management-of-mechanical-small-bowel-obstruction-in-adults/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Approximately one-fourth of patients admitted with small bowel obstruction will require surgery. (See <a href=\"#H372577794\" class=\"local\">'Trial of nonoperative management'</a> below.)</p><p>Clinical features of small bowel obstruction indicative of complicated obstruction are presented separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epidemiology-clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-mechanical-small-bowel-obstruction-in-adults#H104559350\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Epidemiology, clinical features, and diagnosis of mechanical small bowel obstruction in adults&quot;, section on 'Complete obstruction and closed-loop obstruction'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epidemiology-clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-mechanical-small-bowel-obstruction-in-adults#H171509351\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Epidemiology, clinical features, and diagnosis of mechanical small bowel obstruction in adults&quot;, section on 'Bowel ischemia and perforation'</a>.)</p><p>It is difficult to accurately predict bowel ischemia based upon clinical parameters alone [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-management-of-mechanical-small-bowel-obstruction-in-adults/abstract/25,27\" class=\"abstract_t\">25,27</a>].

However, these signs are also nonspecific. In one study that included 145 patients with high-grade obstruction on CT, 46 percent were successfully managed nonoperatively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-management-of-mechanical-small-bowel-obstruction-in-adults/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]. </p><p/><p>In a multivariate analysis, six clinical and radiographic values correlated with the need for bowel resection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-management-of-mechanical-small-bowel-obstruction-in-adults/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>]. A scoring system was developed that assigned one point to each of these variables, which are listed below. Among 233 consecutive patients with bowel obstruction, 11 patients with a total score &ge;4 points required bowel resection.

In a propensity score-matched study of patients who underwent adhesiolysis for small bowel obstruction, the use of laparoscopy was associated with significantly lower rates of overall complications (odds ratio [OR] 0.41, 95% CI 0.28-0.60), surgical site infections (OR 0.15, 95% CI 0.05-0.49) and intraoperative transfusions (OR 0.22, 95% CI 0.05-0.90), as well as a shorter length of hospital stay (4 versus 10 days) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-management-of-mechanical-small-bowel-obstruction-in-adults/abstract/43\" class=\"abstract_t\">43</a>]. A systematic review and pooled analysis of 11 nonrandomized studies also showed laparoscopic adhesiolysis to be associated with lower rates of mortality (pooled OR 0.31, 95% CI 0.16-0.61), morbidity (pooled OR 0.34, 95 % CI 0.27-0.78), and wound infection (pooled OR 0.29, 95% CI 0.12-0.70), as well as a shorter length of hospital stay (weighed mean difference -7.11 days, 95% CI -8.47 to -5.75 days) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-management-of-mechanical-small-bowel-obstruction-in-adults/abstract/44\" class=\"abstract_t\">44</a>]. However, laparoscopic adhesiolysis is not always feasible, especially in patients who have had prior abdominal surgery. The benefits of laparoscopic adhesiolysis also need to be validated by controlled, prospective trials, as in observational studies, healthier patients may have been selected for laparoscopic surgery.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H372577794\"><span class=\"h1\">TRIAL OF NONOPERATIVE MANAGEMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Many patients without indications for immediate intervention can safely undergo initial nonoperative management, but clinical evaluation must first exclude complicated obstruction (eg, strangulation, necrosis) indicating the need for immediate surgery. Considerations for patients with abdominal malignancies (resected, unresected, metastatic) are discussed below. (See <a href=\"#H3956584\" class=\"local\">'Patients with malignancy'</a> below and <a href=\"#H372577787\" class=\"local\">'Indications for surgical exploration'</a> above.)</p><p>Conservative nonoperative management resolves symptoms in many patients with partial small bowel obstruction, but success rates depend upon the etiology [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-management-of-mechanical-small-bowel-obstruction-in-adults/abstract/3,45,46\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,45,46</a>]. In the setting of adhesive small bowel obstruction, nonoperative management is overall successful in 65 to 80 percent of patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-management-of-mechanical-small-bowel-obstruction-in-adults/abstract/47-50\" class=\"abstract_t\">47-50</a>]. Although the incidence of bowel ischemia during nonoperative management of partial small bowel obstruction is low at 3 to 6 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-management-of-mechanical-small-bowel-obstruction-in-adults/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>], the patient still needs to be carefully monitored with serial abdominal examination and laboratory studies; some will benefit from follow-up imaging. </p><p>The management of patients with complete small bowel obstruction due to adhesions is controversial. Some have demonstrated that nonoperative management is still successful in 41 to 73 percent of patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-management-of-mechanical-small-bowel-obstruction-in-adults/abstract/47,51\" class=\"abstract_t\">47,51</a>]; however, complete adhesive small bowel obstruction is associated with a higher requirement for small-bowel resection (31 percent) in some series [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-management-of-mechanical-small-bowel-obstruction-in-adults/abstract/52\" class=\"abstract_t\">52</a>]. Nonoperative management of partial and complete adhesive small bowel obstruction is associated with higher recurrence rates and lower disease-free intervals compared with operative management [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-management-of-mechanical-small-bowel-obstruction-in-adults/abstract/51,53\" class=\"abstract_t\">51,53</a>].</p><p>A trial of nonoperative management is warranted in patients with the following etiologies for their bowel obstruction, who do not otherwise have indications for surgical exploration:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Early postoperative bowel obstruction &ndash; Adhesions associated with early postoperative bowel obstruction rarely lead to strangulation.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Inflammatory bowel disease &ndash; Patients who do not have fulminant disease causing complete bowel obstruction may respond to medical therapy.

In other studies, nonoperative management for uncomplicated adhesive bowel obstruction exceeding three to five days was associated with increased morbidity and mortality [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-management-of-mechanical-small-bowel-obstruction-in-adults/abstract/57,58\" class=\"abstract_t\">57,58</a>]. Earlier rather than later surgery may be warranted in patients with known malignancy (resected, unresected, metastases), although disease distribution and location need to be carefully considered and the decision to operate or not individualized accordingly.

The volume of output from the nasogastric tube should be carefully documented to help with clinical judgments regarding the progression or resolution of the obstruction, and the requirement for intravenous fluid therapy. Nasogastric losses can be replaced with normal saline plus <a href=\"topic.htm?path=potassium-chloride-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">potassium chloride</a> (30 to 40 <span class=\"nowrap\">mEq/L)</span>. In cases where the obstruction is clearly resolved, the nasogastric tube can be removed, and diet initiated and advanced as tolerated.

Gastrografin draws fluid into the lumen of the bowel due to its hypertonicity, decreasing intestinal wall edema and stimulating intestinal peristalsis. </p><p>The volume of Gastrografin administered generally ranges from 7.5 mL over 30 minutes to 22.5 mL over a course of two hours and can be repeated if initially ineffective, up to a total dose of 100 mL. Higher doses of Gastrografin have not been studied [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-management-of-mechanical-small-bowel-obstruction-in-adults/abstract/72\" class=\"abstract_t\">72</a>]. After Gastrografin is administered, abdominal radiographs should be performed up to but no later than 24 hours afterward. In general, failure of the contrast to reach the colon 24 hours later should influence, but not dictate, the decision to operate. The time allowed for nonoperative resolution following instillation of Gastrografin is a matter of clinical judgment in these patients. If there is concern that the patient has increasing pain, distension, and persistent high nasogastric output, surgical exploration may still be indicated. </p><p>Water-soluble contrast has been found in several studies to improve bowel function and decrease length of hospital stay in those patients who are destined to resolve with nonoperative treatment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-management-of-mechanical-small-bowel-obstruction-in-adults/abstract/65-67,72-75\" class=\"abstract_t\">65-67,72-75</a>]. In a 2016 systematic review and meta-analysis, water-soluble contrast predicted resolution of obstruction without surgery with a sensitivity of 92 percent and a specificity of 93 percent. Oral water-soluble contrast also reduced the need for surgery (odds ratio 0.44), length of stay (weighted mean difference -2.18 days), and time to resolution (weighted mean difference -28.25 hours). There was no increased morbidity or mortality associated with water-soluble contrast [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-management-of-mechanical-small-bowel-obstruction-in-adults/abstract/76\" class=\"abstract_t\">76</a>]. Based on these data, a number of algorithms have triaged patients to surgery versus nonoperative management based on their responses to the water-soluble contrast challenge [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-management-of-mechanical-small-bowel-obstruction-in-adults/abstract/77,78\" class=\"abstract_t\">77,78</a>]. In a multicenter prospective observational study comparing patients treated at centers with and without a Gastrografin protocol, those treated with Gastrografin had a significantly lower rate of operative exploration (21 versus 44 percent) and a shorter length of stay (4 versus 5 days). The median number of days between Gastrografin administration and operative exploration (for those who failed nonoperative treatment) was three days. Multivariable regression confirmed that Gastrografin was independently associated with successful nonoperative management [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-management-of-mechanical-small-bowel-obstruction-in-adults/abstract/79\" class=\"abstract_t\">79</a>].</p><p>However, the benefit of Gastrografin was not shown in all studies. In the Adhesive Small Bowel Obstruction Study (ASBOS), similar percentages of patients who received 100 mL of Gastrografin versus normal saline required operative intervention (24 versus 20 percent) or bowel resection (8 versus 4 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-management-of-mechanical-small-bowel-obstruction-in-adults/abstract/80\" class=\"abstract_t\">80</a>]. Contrary to other studies, Gastrografin administration did not shorten the length of hospital stay (3.5 days in both groups). In this study, patients were committed to operative exploration if Gastrografin was not observed in the cecum by 48 hours after administration, a time threshold that is significantly shorter than those recommended by others (in the absence of clinical signs mandating exploration). As examples, the World Society of Emergency Surgery 2013 guidelines recommend waiting 72 hours [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-management-of-mechanical-small-bowel-obstruction-in-adults/abstract/81\" class=\"abstract_t\">81</a>], and the Eastern Association for the Surgery of Trauma suggests a period of three to five days of nonoperative management before proceeding with surgery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-management-of-mechanical-small-bowel-obstruction-in-adults/abstract/82\" class=\"abstract_t\">82</a>]. A large study using the 2009 Nationwide Inpatient Sample (NIS) reported no increase in complications if surgery is delayed for up to four days [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-management-of-mechanical-small-bowel-obstruction-in-adults/abstract/58\" class=\"abstract_t\">58</a>]. The time necessary for successful nonoperative treatment of small bowel obstruction varies widely in the literature. In one study predating the use of therapeutic Gastrografin, an average of 6.9 days was required before nonoperative resolution. A hypothetical threshold of five days would have subjected 141 of the 220 patients who eventually resolved nonoperatively to unnecessary surgery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-management-of-mechanical-small-bowel-obstruction-in-adults/abstract/83\" class=\"abstract_t\">83</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H372577857\"><span class=\"h2\">Failure of nonoperative management</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The decision to proceed with surgical exploration or continue nonoperative management is based primarily on the clinical status of the patient.

Mortality ranged from 6 to 32 percent and serious complications occurred in up to 44 percent of patients. Re-obstruction, reoperation, and rehospitalization were common.

Patients who receive Gastrografin may have more rapid resolution of symptoms, a shorter length of hospital stay, and a lower rate of surgical intervention. In order to receive the benefit, Gastrografin should be administered relatively soon after emergency department admission and the decision to proceed with nonoperative treatment.
