It is a life-threatening pregnancy complication for both mother and fetus. Other adverse outcomes include complications related to severe hemorrhage, bladder laceration, hysterectomy, and neonatal morbidity related to intrauterine hypoxia. Most uterine ruptures in resource-rich countries are associated with a trial of labor after cesarean delivery (TOLAC). In resource-limited countries, many uterine ruptures are related to obstructed labor and lack of access to operative delivery.</p><p>By comparison, a uterine dehiscence (or uterine window) has been loosely defined as a clinically occult and incomplete disruption that does not lead to any serious maternal or neonatal consequences. It is often incidentally discovered at the time of cesarean delivery.</p><p>This topic will review clinical findings, risk factors, prediction, and management of uterine rupture in women who have had a previous cesarean delivery. We use the terms &quot;rupture&quot; and &quot;dehiscence&quot; to refer to clinically significant and clinically occult disruption, respectively, although others have used these terms interchangeably. Counseling women about TOLAC risks and success rates, choosing the route of delivery after a previous cesarean delivery, and management of induction and labor in TOLAC are discussed separately:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=choosing-the-route-of-delivery-after-cesarean-birth\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Choosing the route of delivery after cesarean birth&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=use-of-calculators-and-models-for-predicting-vaginal-birth-after-a-previous-cesarean-delivery\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Use of calculators and models for predicting vaginal birth after a previous cesarean delivery&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cervical-ripening-and-induction-of-labor-in-women-with-a-prior-cesarean-delivery\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Cervical ripening and induction of labor in women with a prior cesarean delivery&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p>Rupture of the unscarred uterus is also discussed separately.

Because of the great concern for uterine rupture in women undergoing trial of labor after cesarean delivery (TOLAC), investigators have conducted sophisticated analyses with the goal of using risk factors to predict the likelihood of uterine rupture in specific patients. A number of predictive models for uterine rupture using a combination of risk factors have been described, but none has proven reliable or clinically useful [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/uterine-rupture-after-previous-cesarean-delivery/abstract/12,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,13</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H28115142\"><span class=\"h2\">Use of imaging</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Sonographic lower uterine segment thickness near term is inversely correlated with the risk of uterine scar dehiscence or rupture at delivery.

A 2013 systematic review of 21 studies of sonographic lower uterine segment thickness for predicting the risk of a uterine scar defect during a trial of labor could not determine an ideal cut-off [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/uterine-rupture-after-previous-cesarean-delivery/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. The authors concluded a full lower uterine segment thickness (distance from bladder wall to amnion) cut-off of 3.1 to 5.1 mm was reassuring that the scar would remain intact during a trial of labor (ie, good negative predictive value); at this cutoff, sensitivity for the occurrence of a uterine defect (dehiscence, rupture) was 96 percent (95% CI 0.89-0.98) and specificity was 63 percent (95% CI, 0.30-0.87). At a full lower uterine segment thickness (distance from bladder wall to amnion) cut-off between 2.0 and 3.0, sensitivity and specificity were 61 percent (95% CI, 0.42&ndash;0.77) and 91 percent (95% CI, 0.80&ndash;0.96), respectively. These data show that there is no clear clinical role for ultrasonic measurement of the lower uterine segment in late pregnancy because it is insufficiently predictive of both catastrophic uterine disruption and the absence of disruption.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H178170088\"><span class=\"h3\">Postpartum ultrasound examination of the scar</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>U or V wedge-shaped hypoechoic uterine defects (also called niches) have been observed on imaging studies several months after delivery.

Obviously, future reproduction plans need to be considered, but desire for more pregnancies may be superseded by the need for prompt, life-saving measures, such as hysterectomy. The surgeon can try to close the uterine defect using a technique similar to that for traditional hysterotomy closure, with additional interventions (as needed) to achieve hemostasis. However, if an adequate closure and hemostasis cannot be achieved, hysterectomy should be performed.</p><p>The goals of conservative surgery are to repair the uterine defect, control hemorrhage, identify damage to other organs (eg, urinary tract), minimize early postsurgical morbidity, and reduce the risk of complications in future pregnancies. The optimal repair technique has not been established due to the rarity of uterine rupture, variability in location and extent of damage, and scarcity of long-term follow-up data. In general, medial ruptures that do not involve the adnexal vasculature can often be repaired successfully by primary closure, while lateral ruptures and very large ruptures require ligation of the adnexal vasculature, and often hysterectomy.</p><p>Following delivery of the fetus and placenta, primary single or double-layer closure with a delayed absorbable suture is a straightforward, rapid technique for repairing the rupture, closing the incision, and achieving hemostasis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/uterine-rupture-after-previous-cesarean-delivery/abstract/50,55-57\" class=\"abstract_t\">50,55-57</a>].

It is not surprising that prompt intervention will not always successfully prevent these adverse outcomes because outcome severity depends largely on the extent of placental separation following uterine rupture. This exists as a spectrum varying from no separation to total placental abruption, and partial degrees of separation may increase over time.

It is an obstetric emergency.

(See <a href=\"#H178169761\" class=\"local\">'Incidence'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The primary risk factors for uterine rupture after a previous cesarean delivery are, from highest to lowest risk: previous uterine rupture, previous fundal or vertical hysterotomy, and induction of labor (particularly with prostaglandins). A prior vaginal delivery, either before or after the prior cesarean delivery, significantly reduces the risk of uterine rupture. (See <a href=\"#H338586765\" class=\"local\">'Risk factors'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>There is no reliable way to predict uterine rupture in women with a prior cesarean delivery. On imaging studies, an intact, thick scar is reassuring of the integrity of the repair and a thin scar or a defect is worrisome for recurrent rupture, but neither finding is strongly predictive of outcome. (See <a href=\"#H28115135\" class=\"local\">'Predicting uterine rupture'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The premonitory clinical signs of uterine rupture include fetal heart rate (FHR) abnormalities (category II or III tracing), vaginal bleeding, sudden or worsening abdominal pain, uterine contraction abnormalities, and, in women who have epidural anesthesia, need for frequent epidural dosing. (See <a href=\"#H178170161\" class=\"local\">'Patient presentation'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>No FHR pattern is pathognomonic of rupture. The most common FHR abnormality is fetal bradycardia, which may be sudden or preceded by deceleration. (See <a href=\"#H178170161\" class=\"local\">'Patient presentation'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Intraabdominal hemorrhage can lead to rapid maternal hemodynamic deterioration. Vaginal bleeding may be modest, despite major intraabdominal hemorrhage. Uterine contractions may gradually decrease in amplitude and there may be loss of station of the fetal presenting part. Pain related to uterine rupture may be partially or completely masked by neuraxial analgesia administered for management of labor pain. (See <a href=\"#H178170161\" class=\"local\">'Patient presentation'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In postpartum women, abdominal pain and persistent vaginal bleeding despite use of uterotonic agents should prompt consideration of uterine rupture. (See <a href=\"#H3253153521\" class=\"local\">'Postpartum'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The diagnosis of uterine rupture is based on clinical or radiologic identification of complete disruption of all uterine layers, including the serosa. It should be suspected in women undergoing TOLAC with one or more of the following signs and symptoms: FHR abnormalities, sudden or worsening abdominal pain, decreasing uterine contractions, vaginal bleeding, hemodynamic instability. A preoperative provisional diagnosis of rupture is not critical since urgent delivery is often indicated in these patients because of nonreassuring FHR changes <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> hemodynamic instability. (See <a href=\"#H178170175\" class=\"local\">'Diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Definitive surgical management involves hysterectomy. Uterine repair may be possible, depending on patient plans for future pregnancies, extent of uterine damage, hemodynamic stability, and the surgeon&rsquo;s skills. The goals of conservative surgery are to repair the uterine defect, control hemorrhage, identify damage to other organs (eg, urinary tract), minimize early post-surgical morbidity, and reduce the risk of complications in future pregnancies. (See <a href=\"#H372959634\" class=\"local\">'Repair versus hysterectomy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Uterine rupture can lead to multiple adverse outcomes, including severe hemorrhage, bladder laceration, hysterectomy, and rarely death, for the mother, and death or neurological morbidity for the <span class=\"nowrap\">fetus/neonate</span>.

The risk is related to the site of rupture, with the highest risk in patients with fundal or longitudinal rupture. For women with a previous rupture that occurred during labor, at term and in the lower uterine segment, a scheduled cesarean delivery at 36 to 37 weeks is the usual approach. For patients with a previous preterm, antepartum, or fundal rupture, delivery by 36 weeks is prudent, with timing based on patient specific factors.

Most uterine dehiscences are incidentally identified at repeat cesarean delivery, but some have been detected during prenatal ultrasound examination. Management is repeat cesarean with repair of the defect; timing of delivery depends on the gestational age when the dehiscence is detected. (See <a href=\"#H1055357\" class=\"local\">'Antepartum uterine dehiscence'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4154924943\"><span class=\"h1\">ACKNOWLEDGMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The editorial staff at UpToDate would like to acknowledge Christopher T Lang, MD, who contributed to an earlier version of this topic review.</p></div><div id=\"topicAgreement\">Use of UpToDate is subject to the <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/legal/license\" class=\"licenseLink\" id=\"sla_in_page\">Subscription and License Agreement</a>.</div><div id=\"references\" class=\"headingAnchor\"><h1>REFERENCES</h1><ol id=\"reference\"><li><a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/uterine-rupture-after-previous-cesarean-delivery/abstract/1\" class=\"nounderline abstract_t\">National Institutes of Health Consensus Development Conference Panel.
