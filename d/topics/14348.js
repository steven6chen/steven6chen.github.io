The great majority of affected patients have underlying ulcerative colitis; the incidence may be as high as 90 percent when rectal and sigmoid biopsies are routinely obtained [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-sclerosing-cholangitis-in-adults-management/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].

Randomized trials of high-dose <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ursodeoxycholic-acid-ursodiol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ursodeoxycholic acid</a> (UDCA) are currently underway in an attempt to confirm encouraging results in pilot studies.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Ursodeoxycholic acid</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>UDCA, a hydrophilic bile acid, is the most extensively studied of all medical treatments for PSC. UDCA, at a dose up to 15 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> per day, is thought to exert its effects in cholestatic conditions via protection of cholangiocytes against cytotoxic hydrophobic bile acids, stimulation of hepatobiliary secretion, protection of hepatocytes against bile acid-induced apoptosis, and induction of antioxidants [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-sclerosing-cholangitis-in-adults-management/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].</p><p>UDCA, at a dose up to 15 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg/day,</span> has shown some efficacy in improving biochemical abnormalities and stabilizing hepatic inflammation but has not resulted in a survival benefit or a delay in the need for liver transplantation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-sclerosing-cholangitis-in-adults-management/abstract/9-17\" class=\"abstract_t\">9-17</a>]. Three meta-analyses (all with eight randomized controlled trials, though with minor differences in which studies were included) found that UDCA significantly improved liver biochemical tests [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-sclerosing-cholangitis-in-adults-management/abstract/16-18\" class=\"abstract_t\">16-18</a>]. None of the meta-analyses found a benefit on the risk of death or need for liver transplantation. One detected significant benefit in liver histology and a trend toward a reduction in histologic deterioration and improvement of cholangiographic abnormalities [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-sclerosing-cholangitis-in-adults-management/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>], whereas two found no benefit on histology [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-sclerosing-cholangitis-in-adults-management/abstract/17,18\" class=\"abstract_t\">17,18</a>]. In addition, there was no benefit from UDCA with regard to pruritus, fatigue, or cholangiocarcinoma development [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-sclerosing-cholangitis-in-adults-management/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. Thus, the available data do not demonstrate a consistent benefit on clinically important outcomes.</p><p>However, the majority of patients in the studies included in the meta-analyses already had significant hepatic fibrosis or cirrhosis. It is possible that use of UDCA in early stage PSC (eg, before onset of fibrosis) may be helpful, but the appropriate studies have been difficult to perform because of limited numbers of patients and significant heterogeneity in patient populations. Finally, UDCA has also been studied as an agent to prevent colorectal cancer in patients with PSC. This topic is discussed elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=primary-sclerosing-cholangitis-inflammatory-bowel-disease-and-colorectal-cancer#H6\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Primary sclerosing cholangitis: Inflammatory bowel disease and colorectal cancer&quot;, section on 'Chemoprevention'</a>.)</p><p>Complicating the issue is evidence that withdrawing UDCA may be associated with worsening biochemical test results and pruritus [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-sclerosing-cholangitis-in-adults-management/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. This was examined in a study with 26 patients with PSC who had been taking UDCA (10 to 15 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> per day) and then had the medication stopped. Three months after stopping UDCA, there were increases in the patients' mean alkaline phosphatase (76 percent increase), gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase (118 percent increase), bilirubin (50 percent increase), alanine aminotransferase (64 percent increase), aspartate aminotransferase (45 percent increase), and Mayo Risk Score (0.5 point increase from baseline). In addition, there was a trend toward worsening pruritus compared with baseline. Limitations of the study included that most of the outcomes assessed were surrogate outcomes (eg, biochemical test results rather than clinically important outcomes, such as death or need for liver transplantation), it was unblinded (which could have influenced assessment of subjective outcomes, such as pruritus), it was of short duration (so a transient rebound effect could not be evaluated), and it was not known if the patients in the trial had initially responded to UDCA (introducing possible selection bias) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-sclerosing-cholangitis-in-adults-management/abstract/19,20\" class=\"abstract_t\">19,20</a>].</p><p>A 2010 guideline issued by the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases recommends <strong>against</strong> use of UDCA in the treatment of primary sclerosing cholangitis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-sclerosing-cholangitis-in-adults-management/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>], whereas a 2015 guideline from the American College of Gastroenterology does not make a recommendation about using UDCA other than to note that it should not be used in doses &gt;28 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg/day</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-sclerosing-cholangitis-in-adults-management/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. The guidelines note the lack of proven efficacy on hard endpoints such as death or liver transplantation for low- or intermediate-dose UDCA and the worse outcomes described in a randomized controlled trial of high-dose UDCA (see below). Although standard-dose UDCA has not been associated with adverse outcomes, UDCA cannot be recommended routinely until further data on efficacy and safety are available.</p><p>Our approach is to not start UDCA in patients with PSC. In addition, we suggest stopping it in patients who are already taking it and offering to restart the drug at standard doses (13 to 15 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> per day in divided doses) if any of the following occur:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The patient's bilirubin or alkaline phosphatase increases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-sclerosing-cholangitis-in-adults-management/abstract/7,19,21\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,19,21</a>] </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The patient has worsening pruritus</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The patient is concerned about his or her liver tests worsening and prefers to resume the drug</p><p/><p>However, given the uncertainty regarding its benefits, an alternative approach is to start (or continue) UDCA in patients who want to take it despite the uncertain benefits [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-sclerosing-cholangitis-in-adults-management/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. After six months, if the alkaline phosphatase normalizes or is decreased by at least 40 percent, or if the patient experiences symptomatic improvement, UDCA can be continued. Otherwise, it is stopped.</p><p>A derivative of UDCA (24-norursodeoxycholic acid) has shown promise in an animal model of PSC [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-sclerosing-cholangitis-in-adults-management/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h3\">High-dose UDCA</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Pilot studies suggested that UDCA given in higher-than-standard doses (20 to 30 rather than 13 to 15 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> per day) may increase the benefit [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-sclerosing-cholangitis-in-adults-management/abstract/23-26\" class=\"abstract_t\">23-26</a>]. However, a placebo-controlled trial involving 150 patients was stopped early because patients randomly assigned to UDCA at doses of 28 to 30 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> per day were significantly <strong>more likely</strong> to reach the primary endpoint of death, need for liver transplant, or development of varices [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-sclerosing-cholangitis-in-adults-management/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. A follow-up study found that the increased risk of adverse events with high-dose UDCA was limited to patients with early histologic stage disease or with normal total bilirubin levels [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-sclerosing-cholangitis-in-adults-management/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. The reasons for the unexpected outcome are unclear, but based upon these data, high-dose UDCA should be avoided in patients with PSC.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Glucocorticoids</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>No studies have demonstrated a long-term benefit from glucocorticoid therapy, either alone or in combination with other agents [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-sclerosing-cholangitis-in-adults-management/abstract/29-31\" class=\"abstract_t\">29-31</a>]. In addition to lack of efficacy, patients with PSC tend to have bone loss that can lead to osteoporosis, which may be made worse by glucocorticoid therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-sclerosing-cholangitis-in-adults-management/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>].

As an example, in one series with 130 patients, the cumulative incidence of recurrence at 1, 5, and 10 years post-transplantation was 2, 12, and 20 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-sclerosing-cholangitis-in-adults-management/abstract/92\" class=\"abstract_t\">92</a>]. In a second study that included 565 patients who underwent successful liver transplantation for PSC, recurrence was seen in 14 percent of patients after a median follow-up of nine years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-sclerosing-cholangitis-in-adults-management/abstract/95\" class=\"abstract_t\">95</a>]. The diagnosis of recurrence is based upon consistent findings of liver biopsy and cholangiography in the absence of other conditions that could account for the findings, such as an ABO blood group-incompatible liver allograft, dominant anastomotic stricture, or hepatic artery thrombosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-sclerosing-cholangitis-in-adults-management/abstract/88\" class=\"abstract_t\">88</a>].</p><p>The natural history of recurrent disease is variable, similar to the nontransplant setting. Only approximately one-third of patients with recurrence develop progressive disease leading to retransplantation or death. Risk factors for recurrence, particularly the influence of the immunosuppressive regimen, remain incompletely understood, although a variety of risk factors have been reported in various series including age, sex mismatch, male sex, coexistent IBD, presence of an intact colon after transplantation, cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection, recurrent acute cellular rejection, steroid-resistant cellular rejection, use of OKT3, presence of cholangiocarcinoma before transplantation, use of extended donor criteria, and prolonged use of glucocorticoids [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-sclerosing-cholangitis-in-adults-management/abstract/93,95,97\" class=\"abstract_t\">93,95,97</a>].

Although the disease may remain quiescent in some patients, it may become aggressive in others despite the immunosuppression used for the transplant.</p><p>One of the largest series to evaluate this issue included 303 patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) who underwent liver transplantation between 1981 and 1997 at the University of Pittsburgh [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-sclerosing-cholangitis-in-adults-management/abstract/101\" class=\"abstract_t\">101</a>]. Progression of IBD was assessed based upon the need for colectomy and clinical features of disease activity. The influence of transplantation on the disease course was determined using multivariate statistical models that adjusted for the duration of follow-up and other covariates that might influence the course of IBD. The authors found that the only two independent risk factors for IBD progression were older age at the time of transplant (age &gt;30 years, hazard ratio [HR] 1.5) and liver transplantation itself (HR 3.1). The incidence rates for colectomy rose from 0.007 per year before liver transplantation to 0.025 per year after transplantation.</p><p>A limitation of this analysis was that it did not include some potentially relevant covariates in the model, such as pretransplant IBD disease activity and the extent of the disease. Furthermore, IBD disease activity was assessed retrospectively, raising the potential for misclassification, since other causes of bowel disturbance may occur in the transplant setting (eg, CMV, lymphoma, post-transplant lymphoproliferative disorder). Thus, this study confirms that IBD activity may progress after transplantation in some patients, but it does not provide a profile of patient characteristics or immunosuppressive regimens associated with increased risk.</p><p>Some of these issues were addressed in a more recent series that included 353 patients with IBD who underwent liver transplantation between 1984 and 2006 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-sclerosing-cholangitis-in-adults-management/abstract/105\" class=\"abstract_t\">105</a>]. The patients were followed for a median of five years. Among the 218 patients with an intact colon and colonoscopies performed both before and after transplantation, 124 patients (57 percent) had macroscopic colonic inflammation prior to transplantation (75 percent mild, 22 percent moderate, and 3 percent severe). Following transplantation, 153 patients (70 percent) had macroscopic inflammation (60 percent mild, 23 percent moderate, and 17 percent severe; p&lt;0.001). Overall, IBD activity decreased in 17 percent of patients, remained unchanged in 43 percent, and increased in 40 percent. Age less than 20 years at the time of IBD diagnosis and the use of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tacrolimus-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">tacrolimus</a> plus <a href=\"topic.htm?path=mycophenolate-mofetil-cellcept-and-enteric-coated-mycophenolate-sodium-myfortic-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">mycophenolate</a> mofetil were associated with an increased risk of worsening inflammation (HRs of 1.8 and 3.9, respectively), whereas the use of cyclosporin and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=azathioprine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">azathioprine</a> was associated with a decreased risk (HR 0.4).</p><p>Another retrospective study compared patients with PSC and IBD who underwent liver transplantation with those who did not undergo transplantation and found a decreased risk of colectomy among those who underwent liver transplantation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-sclerosing-cholangitis-in-adults-management/abstract/104\" class=\"abstract_t\">104</a>].

Patients who underwent liver transplantation had a significantly lower colectomy rate during follow-up than those who were not listed (27 versus 75 percent; adjusted HR 0.43; 95% CI 0.25-0.75). Other risk factors for undergoing colectomy included a high revised PSC Mayo risk score (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F54210\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef54210 \">table 1</a>) at diagnosis (HR 0.52; 95% CI 0.37-0.72) and the development of colon cancer or dysplasia (HR 2.47; 95% CI 1.63-3.75).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H25107425\"><span class=\"h1\">CANCER SCREENING</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In addition to age-appropriate cancer screening, patients with primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC) typically undergo screening for gallbladder carcinoma, cholangiocarcinoma, colon cancer, and hepatocellular carcinoma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-sclerosing-cholangitis-in-adults-management/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H25107431\"><span class=\"h2\">Gallbladder carcinoma and cholangiocarcinoma</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>PSC is associated with an increased risk of cholangiocarcinoma and gallbladder carcinoma.

Specificity can be increased by using higher cutoff values but at the cost of lower levels of sensitivity. </p><p>A more recent study of 208 patients found a sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value of 78, 98, 56 and 99 percent, respectively, using an absolute CA 19-9 level of 129 <span class=\"nowrap\">units/mL</span> as a cutoff value [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-sclerosing-cholangitis-in-adults-management/abstract/113\" class=\"abstract_t\">113</a>]. An important caveat is that in another study, more than one-third of patients with this cutoff level of CA 19-9 did not have cholangiocarcinoma after an average of 30 months of follow-up [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-sclerosing-cholangitis-in-adults-management/abstract/114\" class=\"abstract_t\">114</a>]. Another issue is that CA 19-9 requires the presence of the Lewis blood group antigen (a glycosyl transferase) to be expressed. Individuals with a Lewis-negative phenotype (an estimated 5 to 10 percent of the population) do not make CA 19-9 and therefore will not benefit from CA 19-9 testing. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H25107454\"><span class=\"h2\">Colon cancer</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The prevalence of ulcerative colitis in patients with PSC approaches 90 percent and is associated with a high risk of colonic dysplasia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-sclerosing-cholangitis-in-adults-management/abstract/115,116\" class=\"abstract_t\">115,116</a>]. As a result, patients with PSC and inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) should undergo surveillance colonoscopy every one to two years from the time of diagnosis of PSC [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-sclerosing-cholangitis-in-adults-management/abstract/4,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,5</a>], and patients with PSC without IBD should undergo surveillance colonoscopy every three to five years, including biopsies to look for previously undiagnosed colitis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-sclerosing-cholangitis-in-adults-management/abstract/4,117\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,117</a>].

The mechanism by which this might occur is unclear but may be related to the presence of longstanding ulcerative colitis or to the use of immunosuppressive drugs. An exception to these reports is a study with 303 patients in which the only identified risk factor for colon cancer following transplantation was the duration of IBD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-sclerosing-cholangitis-in-adults-management/abstract/101\" class=\"abstract_t\">101</a>].

Thus, a role for any medical therapy is unproven. (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Ursodeoxycholic acid'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In patients who are already taking UDCA, we suggest stopping UDCA but reinstituting it at standard doses (13 to 15 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> per day in divided doses) if they develop worsening pruritus or jaundice (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). However, given the uncertainty regarding its benefits, an alternative approach is to start (or continue) UDCA in patients who want to take it despite the uncertain benefits. After six months, if the alkaline phosphatase normalizes or is decreased by at least 40 percent, or if the patient experiences symptomatic improvement, UDCA can be continued. Otherwise, it is stopped. (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Ursodeoxycholic acid'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We suggest that patients with a dominant stricture and pruritus <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> cholangitis undergo endoscopic therapy to dilate <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> stent the stricture, provided that the patient has access to a center with considerable expertise in therapeutic biliary endoscopy (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). An important potential clinical benefit is relief of jaundice and pruritus, although a benefit on disease progression has not been clearly established. (See <a href=\"#H16\" class=\"local\">'Endoscopic therapy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Dominant strictures should be evaluated for possible malignancy during endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) with brushings for cytology, biopsies, and fluorescence in-situ hybridization. In patients with a high clinical suspicion of cholangiocarcinoma but nondiagnostic brush <span class=\"nowrap\">cytology/endobiliary</span> biopsy, fine-needle aspiration under endoscopic ultrasonographic or computed tomographic (CT) guidance is indicated. Findings that should increase the clinical suspicion for cholangiocarcinoma include an elevated serum cancer antigen (CA) 19-9 or carcinoembryonic antigen measurement in conjunction with an imaging study (abdominal CT scan, ultrasonography, magnetic resonance imaging [MRI], or magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography [MRCP]) showing a mass lesion, interval change in bile duct dilation, a new &quot;dominant&quot; stricture with upstream biliary dilation, or clinical features such as weight loss.

Screening consists of either ultrasound or MRI with MRCP, plus measurement of a serum CA 19-9. However no studies have been performed that demonstrate a benefit in patient outcomes with screening using serum tumor markers, imaging studies, or cholangiographic brush cytology, so forgoing screening is a reasonable alternative. (See <a href=\"#H25107431\" class=\"local\">'Gallbladder carcinoma and cholangiocarcinoma'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Other screening examinations include annual ultrasound of the gallbladder to screen for gallbladder cancer and bone density examination at diagnosis and every two to three years thereafter.
