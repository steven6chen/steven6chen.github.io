The vast majority of these are adenocarcinomas. Primary rectal squamous cell carcinomas, which are very rare, can be difficult to distinguish from anal cancers and are treated according to the same approach as anal cancer, with initial chemoradiotherapy (radiotherapy with concurrent fluoropyrimidine chemotherapy) rather than surgery. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-features-staging-and-treatment-of-anal-cancer#H523512861\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical features, staging, and treatment of anal cancer&quot;, section on 'Rectal squamous cell cancers'</a>.)</p><p>The optimal approach to treating rectal adenocarcinoma depends upon a number of factors, of which the location in the rectum and the local disease extent are most important. For some patients with limited invasive cancer in a polyp who have no adverse features, polypectomy alone may suffice. For others who have locally extensive, fixed, bulky tumors or extensive nodal disease, induction chemoradiotherapy or induction chemotherapy followed by chemoradiotherapy may be pursued. An algorithmic approach to treating rectal cancer that is based upon the pretreatment clinical staging evaluation is presented in the algorithm (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F108222\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef108222 \">algorithm 1</a>). </p><p>This topic review will provide an overview of the treatment for rectal cancer. Neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy for potentially resectable adenocarcinomas, adjuvant therapy after resection of a primary rectal adenocarcinoma, staging and the staging workup, pretreatment local staging evaluation, surgical principles, and recommendations for posttreatment surveillance are discussed elsewhere, as is the management of rectal squamous cell cancers.

(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-presentation-diagnosis-and-staging-of-colorectal-cancer#H2\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical presentation, diagnosis, and staging of colorectal cancer&quot;, section on 'Clinical presentation'</a>.)</p><p>When viewed through the endoscope, the vast majority of rectal cancers are endoluminal masses that arise from the mucosa and protrude into the lumen. The mass may be exophytic or polypoid. Bleeding (oozing or frank bleeding) may be seen with lesions that are friable, necrotic, or ulcerated. A minority of neoplastic lesions are nonpolypoid and relatively flat or depressed.</p><p>If a mass is noted during colonoscopy, a biopsy should be performed. In other cases, the only finding may be a polyp or polyps. Endoscopic criteria that suggest malignancy in a polyp are outlined in the table (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F68868\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef68868 \">table 1</a>). When they are identified, colorectal polyps should be removed as some types of polyps (particularly adenomatous polyps) are the precursors to invasive cancer. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=molecular-genetics-of-colorectal-cancer#H3\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Molecular genetics of colorectal cancer&quot;, section on 'The adenoma-carcinoma sequence'</a>.) </p><p>There are two primary goals of polypectomy. The first is to completely remove all neoplastic tissue. The second is to provide a tissue sample that can be evaluated histologically. There are a number of techniques for endoscopic excision of colorectal polyps. The approach chosen will depend on the characteristics and location of the polyp, and the endoscopist's experience. Snare excision is commonly used for polyps &gt;5 to 10 mm and offers the most complete removal of adenomatous tissue. Diminutive lesions (&lt;5 mm) can be readily removed with either biopsy forceps or by snare polypectomy. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-colon-polyps\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of colon polyps&quot;</a>.) </p><p>The optimal method for colonoscopic removal of large polyps (&gt;10 mm) varies with the type of polyp. Large pedunculated polyps readily lend themselves to snare removal. Endoscopic mucosal resection (EMR), a technique whereby fluid is injected into the bowel wall to lift a flat or a sessile polyp, allows resection of larger polyps. At times, large sessile adenomas (&gt;2 to 3 cm) require piecemeal resection. When large polyps are present in the rectum, consideration should be given to referring the patient for a transanal endoscopic microsurgery (TEM (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F58698\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef58698 \">figure 1</a>)) or transanal minimally invasive surgery (TAMIS) procedure as an alternative to endoscopic polypectomy, as there is a greater likelihood of removing the specimen in one piece, which allows an adequate assessment of the resection margins. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=endoscopic-removal-of-large-colon-polyps\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Endoscopic removal of large colon polyps&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=rectal-cancer-surgical-techniques#H1553346650\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Rectal cancer: Surgical techniques&quot;, section on 'Transanal endoscopic surgery (TES)'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=transanal-endoscopic-surgery-tes#H1655175149\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Transanal endoscopic surgery (TES)&quot;, section on 'Transanal minimally invasive surgery (TAMIS)'</a>.)</p><p>Whether or not polypectomy alone will be sufficient treatment for an individual malignant polyp depends on the histologic findings and the results of local staging. All patients with malignant polyps should be referred for local staging. (See <a href=\"#H1628809585\" class=\"local\">'Local imaging'</a> below.) </p><p>The approach to management of malignant polyps, stratified according to clinical stage (which is derived from the biopsy and local staging evaluation), is discussed in more detail in the sections below and outlined in the algorithm (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F108222\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef108222 \">algorithm 1</a>).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H302822369\"><span class=\"h1\">THE PRETREATMENT STAGING EVALUATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The goal of the pretreatment staging evaluation is to assess the presence of distant metastatic disease, and to determine the tumor location in the rectum and its local extent. An accurate assessment of location and local tumor extent is necessary prior to treatment in order to select the surgical approach and to identify those patients who are candidates for initial therapy (chemoradiotherapy, radiotherapy alone, or a combination of chemotherapy and chemoradiotherapy) prior to surgery. In addition to a digital clinical examination (which may require an examination under anesthesia) and rigid proctoscopy, all patients with an invasive rectal cancer, including those with limited malignancy in a polyp, should undergo preoperative local staging using either rectal magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or transrectal ultrasound. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=neoadjuvant-chemoradiotherapy-and-radiotherapy-for-rectal-adenocarcinoma\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy and radiotherapy for rectal adenocarcinoma&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3389121522\"><span class=\"h2\">TNM staging</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Rectal cancers are staged using the tumor, node, metastasis (TNM) staging system from the joint American Joint Committee on Cancer <span class=\"nowrap\">(AJCC)/Union</span> for International Cancer Control (UICC); the current (eighth edition, 2017) version is presented in the table (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F111438\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef111438 \">table 2</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-management-of-rectal-adenocarcinoma/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. cTNM is the clinical classification (generally used for patients who are clinically staged before definitive surgical resection), and pTNM is the pathologic classification, which is generally used after the pathologist has examined the final resection specimen. The &quot;y&quot; prefix is used for those cancers that are classified on the basis of a surgical specimen after neoadjuvant pretreatment (eg, ypTNM). The designation of the clinical stage of a rectal cancer generally rests upon the diagnostic biopsy, physical examination, and radiographic studies, such as computed tomography (CT), MRI, and transrectal ultrasound. </p><p>An important point is that pathologic T stage (pT) entails a resection of the primary tumor or biopsy adequate to evaluate the highest pT category. A polypectomy specimen with complete removal of the lesion would fall under the pT1 category, but if lesion removal is incomplete, it is more correct to stage this as a clinical T1 (cT1) lesion.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2997600237\"><span class=\"h2\">Physical and endoscopic examination</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Digital rectal examination (DRE) and proctoscopy are essential to the surgical decision-making process. On DRE, fixation of the lesion to the anal sphincter, its relationship to the anorectal ring (the collection of muscles that make up the sphincters), and fixation to both the rectal wall and the pelvic wall muscles (levators) can be assessed. Proctoscopy can accurately determine the distance between the distal tumor margin, the top of the anorectal ring, and the dentate line.</p><p>Adequate clinical assessment of local tumor extension may require an examination under anesthesia, especially when the patient cannot be examined because of pain. In some cases, a tumor that is considered unresectable by clinical or radiographic examination may appear amenable to curative resection when the patient is examined under anesthesia.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1758631128\"><span class=\"h2\">Imaging</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Once the diagnosis is established, the local and distant extent of disease spread is determined to provide a framework for discussing therapy. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-presentation-diagnosis-and-staging-of-colorectal-cancer#H14\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical presentation, diagnosis, and staging of colorectal cancer&quot;, section on 'Clinical staging evaluation'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1628809585\"><span class=\"h3\">Local imaging</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>While preoperative CT of the abdomen and pelvis is imperative in planning the surgical procedure, imaging is imperfect, and it can underestimate the extent of adjacent local organ involvement. CT, in particular, can accurately identify locoregionally confined disease and the need for adjacent organ resection, but it is less helpful in predicting local tumor resectability [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-management-of-rectal-adenocarcinoma/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-presentation-diagnosis-and-staging-of-colorectal-cancer#H625807\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical presentation, diagnosis, and staging of colorectal cancer&quot;, section on 'Locoregional staging for rectal cancer'</a>.)</p><p>Thin-cut MRI with pelvic phased-array coil is the preferred imaging modality for evaluating the extent of the primary tumor as it will be able to provide information on the circumferential resection margin (CRM), as well as invasion to other organs and structures. MRI exceeds the capability of CT scan to locally stage the depth of transmural invasion, presence or absence of invasion into adjacent structures, and the presence of perirectal nodal involvement for rectal cancers. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pretreatment-local-staging-evaluation-for-rectal-cancer#H10\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pretreatment local staging evaluation for rectal cancer&quot;, section on 'MRI scan'</a>.)</p><p>Endorectal or transrectal ultrasound is another alternative but may be limited by the bulkiness of the tumor and the lack of depth to assess invasion of other organs. Endoscopic ultrasound is particularly limited for posterior or posterolateral tumors, in whom the distance to the CRM cannot be estimated because neighboring structures that allow assessment of the CRM are lacking.</p><p>Whether all invasive rectal cancers require local staging is debated. Some adenomas with early invasive cancer (cT1 lesions) have a low (&lt;2 percent) risk of lymphatic metastasis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-management-of-rectal-adenocarcinoma/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>], and consensus-based guidelines from the <a href=\"http://www.nccn.org/professionals/physician_gls/f_guidelines.asp#site&amp;token=KVRKaAygvvJD1E58VlEWXz36Vm7rTFr+R9Uzv3HO05ED1Gei9+DmGHcRz0LAM8ZDYHKgb6e25tFXbwlgtK+Snb/LRLTmHDvToUPPCY3zWvc=&amp;TOPIC_ID=106743\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN)</a> suggest observation alone for single-specimen, completely resected pedunculated polyps with invasive cancer that have favorable histologic features and clear margins (pT1) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F107550\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef107550 \">table 3</a>). However, some factors, such as young age, increase the risk of lymph node positivity in early-stage rectal cancer [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-management-of-rectal-adenocarcinoma/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. Consensus-based guidelines from other expert groups, including the Practice Parameters Committee of the American College of Gastroenterology (ACG) and the European Society for Medical Oncology (ESMO), recommend performing either transrectal ultrasound or high-resolution MRI to determine the local tumor stage and assess for lymph node positivity for all patients with an invasive rectal cancer, including those with pT1 malignant polyps with favorable prognostic factors (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F107550\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef107550 \">table 3</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-management-of-rectal-adenocarcinoma/abstract/6,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,7</a>].

The rationale is that the likelihood of a positive margin at the time of surgery may be diminished if the patient experiences significant downstaging using a preoperative regimen that includes both chemoradiotherapy and chemotherapy. Further, there is a greater likelihood of completing systemic chemotherapy if given before surgery rather than after surgery due to postoperative morbidity and treatment-related toxicity.

Data primarily from Japan showed that when the depth of submucosal invasion was &lt;1000 micrometers (ie, sm1), the rate of nodal involvement was 0 to 1.8 percent, whereas the rate of nodal involvement was 12.8 to 13.8 percent when the depth of submucosal invasion was &ge;1000 micrometers (ie, sm2 or sm3) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-management-of-rectal-adenocarcinoma/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. Other data from the Mayo clinic support the view that sm3 level of invasion is associated with a high risk of nodal metastases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-management-of-rectal-adenocarcinoma/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. Consequently, ESMO recommends local excision for cT1 rectal cancers that are sm1, but proctectomy with total mesorectal excision for sm2 or sm3 tumors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-management-of-rectal-adenocarcinoma/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. </p><p>These criteria are not absolute. At least in the United States, this distinction has not been consistently made by pathologists reviewing biopsy material, and the depth of submucosal invasion has not generally been considered to be a factor in selecting patients with cT1 disease for local excision.</p><p>Furthermore, selected patients with clinical N0 tumors that are deeper than T1 can be treated with local excision if used in conjunction with chemoradiotherapy, administered preoperatively or postoperatively. (See <a href=\"#H922308174\" class=\"local\">'Clinical T2N0'</a> below and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=adjuvant-therapy-for-resected-rectal-adenocarcinoma#H6323794\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Adjuvant therapy for resected rectal adenocarcinoma&quot;, section on 'Adjuvant chemoradiotherapy for T2-3 rectal cancer after local excision'</a>.)</p><p>However, just because the tumor is amenable to local excision does not mean that it represents the best choice for surgical therapy.

In general, neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy is not needed in this setting. An important point is that the use of preoperative chemoradiotherapy for a distal pT1 or T2N0 rectal cancer in an attempt to convert the operation from an APR into an LAR, or proctectomy and coloanal anastomosis is controversial and not yet an accepted standard of care.

Following chemoradiotherapy, restaging evaluation is indicated with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or endoscopic ultrasound. Although definitive therapy would be transabdominal surgery, an alternative to transabdominal surgery for patients who continue to refuse surgery or are poor candidates, and for highly selected patients who appear to have a complete clinical response (ie, they are left with only a scar after neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy) is full thickness local excision with close follow-up.

Updated guidelines for treatment of rectal cancer from ESMO suggest that patients with a depth of invasion beyond the muscularis propria that is 5 mm or less are appropriate candidates for upfront surgery rather than neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy, even if they are node positive, as long as the levators are not threatened, the mesorectal fascia is clear, and there is no extranodal extension [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-management-of-rectal-adenocarcinoma/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].

In our view, surgical resection remains the standard approach after neoadjuvant therapy for patients who are medically operable, even if they appear to have a complete clinical response to induction therapy. While early data are promising, prospective validation is needed before either avoidance of radical surgery or local excision alone can be adopted for any subset of patients undergoing neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy.

Induction chemotherapy (preferably with an oxaliplatin-containing regimen, such as FOLFOX) followed by fluoropyrimidine-based concomitant chemoradiotherapy is an appropriate alternative to initial chemoradiotherapy for patients with large bulky, locally unresectable tumors and those that are clinical N2.

For most patients, we favor initial chemotherapy to allow the natural history of the metastatic disease to reveal itself. Furthermore, if there has been significant tumor downsizing with induction chemotherapy, chemoradiation may not be necessary and may be selectively omitted. An important point is that the relative impact of chemotherapy and radiation in a patient with resectable synchronous metastatic disease has not been established, and efforts should focus on achieving margin-negative resections of both the primary site and metastases above all else.

Another option is placement of an intraluminal self-expanding metal stent, although in the rectum, this is less favored due to potential migration or erosion through the wall as the tumor responds to treatment.

Familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP; 90 percent risk of colorectal cancer by the age of 45 in the absence of prophylactic colectomy) and Lynch syndrome (hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer [HNPCC]; lifetime risk of colorectal cancer 25 to 75 percent) are the most common of the familial colorectal cancer syndromes, but together these two conditions account for less than 5 percent of colorectal cancer cases.

The term Lynch syndrome is now commonly used for families who have been genetically determined to have a disease-causing defect (inherited or, rarely, de novo) in one of the mismatch repair (MMR) genes. The biologic footprint of deficient MMR capacity is microsatellite instability (MSI), detected by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) or, indirectly, by the absence of MMR gene protein expression in the tumor, as detected by immunohistochemistry (IHC). However, absence of MMR proteins is not specific to Lynch syndrome; approximately 15 percent of sporadic tumors also have high levels of MSI or loss of expression of MMR proteins.</p><p>Testing of colorectal cancers is routinely used to help establish the diagnosis of Lynch syndrome. Some institutions perform selective MSI testing <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> IHC testing for MMR proteins in colorectal cancers in young patients (diagnosed prior to age 50 years) or in those who meet the Bethesda criteria (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F72965\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef72965 \">table 7</a>). However, increasingly, universal testing of all colorectal cancers for MSI <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> loss of MMR proteins by IHC is performed, a practice that is supported by guidelines from the American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO), the European Society for Medical Oncology (ESMO), and a United States Multi-Society Task Force on Colorectal Cancer [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-management-of-rectal-adenocarcinoma/abstract/22-24\" class=\"abstract_t\">22-24</a>]. In general:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Absence of MSI and intact expression of all four MMR proteins on IHC rules out Lynch syndrome.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For individuals with evidence of loss of expression of an MMR protein by IHC, further evaluation is based on the IHC results and is outlined in the suggested algorithm (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F75385\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef75385 \">algorithm 2</a>):</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Although over 90 percent of Lynch syndrome-related colorectal cancers will demonstrate MSI, 15 percent of sporadic colorectal cancers also have MSI. Thus, the finding of MSI in a colorectal cancer is not specific for Lynch syndrome. Absence of protein expression of MLH1 and PMS2, MLH1 alone, or PMS2 alone (which is rare) may be associated with either sporadic or inherited disease. If these two proteins are not expressed in a tumor, the next step is analysis of BRAF V600E mutation or analysis of methylation of the MLH1 promoter. The presence of a BRAF mutation suggests sporadic, rather than inherited, disease, and there is no need to refer for genetic testing. If there is methylation of the MLH1 promoter and no BRAF mutation, most likely the patient will have a sporadic tumor; however, 5 to 10 percent of these patients may harbor a germline mutation.

(See <a href=\"#H1817380913\" class=\"local\">'Diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The optimal approach to treating rectal adenocarcinoma depends upon a number of factors, of which the location in the rectum and the local disease extent are most important. For some patients with limited invasive cancer in a polyp who have no adverse features, polypectomy alone may suffice. For others who have locally extensive, fixed, bulky tumors or extensive nodal disease, induction chemoradiotherapy or induction chemotherapy followed by chemoradiotherapy may be pursued. An algorithmic approach to treating rectal cancer that is based upon the pretreatment clinical staging evaluation is presented in the algorithm (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F108222\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef108222 \">algorithm 1</a>). </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The goal of the pretreatment staging evaluation is to assess the presence of distant metastatic disease, and to determine the tumor location in the rectum and its local extent (see <a href=\"#H302822369\" class=\"local\">'The pretreatment staging evaluation'</a> above):</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>An accurate assessment of location and tumor extent in the pelvis is necessary prior to treatment in order to select the surgical approach and to identify those patients who are candidates for initial therapy (chemoradiotherapy, radiotherapy [RT] alone, or a combination of chemotherapy and chemoradiotherapy) prior to surgery. All patients with an invasive rectal cancer, including those with limited malignancy in a polyp, should undergo preoperative local staging using either rectal magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or transrectal endoscopic ultrasound. (See <a href=\"#H1628809585\" class=\"local\">'Local imaging'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>A contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) scan of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis is recommended to evaluate for distant metastases in all patients with a new diagnosis of invasive rectal cancer, except for those patients with a completely resected malignant polyp with no invasion beyond the submucosa (pT1N0), favorable histologic features, and clear margins (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F107550\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef107550 \">table 3</a>). (See <a href=\"#H1873108143\" class=\"local\">'Evaluation for distant metastases'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>In keeping with guidelines from the American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) and others, we recommend obtaining a serum carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) level preoperatively in most patients with rectal cancer to aid in posttreatment follow-up and in the assessment of prognosis. (See <a href=\"#H3465297841\" class=\"local\">'Tumor markers'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Surgical resection is the cornerstone of curative therapy for patients with potentially resectable rectal cancer. Superficially invasive, small rectal adenocarcinomas may be effectively managed with local excision (transanal excision, transanal endoscopic microsurgery [TEM], or transanal minimally invasive surgery [TAMIS]). (See <a href=\"#H2523274362\" class=\"local\">'Clinical/pathologic T1N0'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">However, the majority of patients have more deeply invasive tumors that do not meet the criteria for local excision. Such patients will require a transabdominal excision, and the specific techniques used depend upon the extent and location of the tumor within the rectum (see <a href=\"#H4093405224\" class=\"local\">'Surgical approaches'</a> above): </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>A tumor in the upper and middle rectum can usually be managed with a sphincter-sparing procedure, such as low anterior resection (LAR), provided that negative margins can be achieved. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=rectal-cancer-surgical-techniques#H1845484\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Rectal cancer: Surgical techniques&quot;, section on 'Sphincter-sparing procedures'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Tumors in the lower rectum (ie, within 5 cm of the anal verge (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F62539\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef62539 \">figure 2</a>)) may require an abdominal perineal resection (APR) if a negative distal margin cannot be achieved with sphincter-sparing procedures. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=rectal-cancer-surgical-techniques#H87595450\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Rectal cancer: Surgical techniques&quot;, section on 'Abdominal perineal resection'</a>.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\">An alternative for patients with lower rectal tumors who are thought to need APR includes local excision for selected patients with small lower rectal tumors, while for patients with larger or more invasive lower rectal cancers, preoperative (neoadjuvant) RT and chemoradiotherapy can be used to promote tumor regression in an attempt to convert a planned APR to a sphincter-sparing surgical procedure, such as LAR or proctectomy and coloanal anastomosis. (See <a href=\"#H4093405224\" class=\"local\">'Surgical approaches'</a> above and <a href=\"#H3012473184\" class=\"local\">'Multidisciplinary management'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>All patients with invasive rectal cancer, with the exception of those with pT1N0 disease with favorable histologic features after local imaging and endoscopic polypectomy, should be referred for multidisciplinary evaluation (surgery, radiation oncology, and medical oncology). (See <a href=\"#H3012473184\" class=\"local\">'Multidisciplinary management'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients who undergo initial surgery, postoperative (adjuvant) therapy (usually a combination of chemoradiotherapy and chemotherapy alone) might be recommended for those with transmural (ie, T3 or T4) or node-positive tumors, and started approximately four to six weeks postoperatively. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=adjuvant-therapy-for-resected-rectal-adenocarcinoma#H12279283\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Adjuvant therapy for resected rectal adenocarcinoma&quot;, section on 'Indications'</a>.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Indications for preoperative (neoadjuvant) chemoradiotherapy or RT include a clinically staged T3 or T4, or node-positive tumor, or one that is invading or threatening the circumferential margin. However, there is not uniform agreement on the indications for neoadjuvant therapy, particularly for transmural tumors with a clear circumferential margin. Updated guidelines for treatment of rectal cancer from the European Society of Medical Oncology (ESMO) suggest that patients with a depth of invasion beyond the muscularis propria that is 5 mm or less are appropriate candidates for upfront surgery rather than neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy, even if node positive, as long as the levators are not threatened, the mesorectal fascia is clear, and there is no extranodal extension [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-management-of-rectal-adenocarcinoma/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H643083163\" class=\"local\">'Clinical T3/4 or N1'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">The use of preoperative chemoradiotherapy for a distal T1 or T2N0 rectal cancer in an attempt to convert an APR into an LAR is controversial and not yet an accepted standard of care. (See <a href=\"#H922308174\" class=\"local\">'Clinical T2N0'</a> above and <a href=\"#H643083163\" class=\"local\">'Clinical T3/4 or N1'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients with transmural (T3-4) or node-positive disease, the specific approach to initial therapy varies according to the presence or absence of distant metastases:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>For patients without distant metastases, preoperative conventional fractionation chemoradiotherapy over 5.5 to 6 weeks using concurrent fluoropyrimidine-based chemotherapy is preferred over initial surgery if the patient can tolerate it. Short-course (five days), high-dose-rate &quot;Swedish style&quot; preoperative RT has not gained popularity in the United States but is the preferred approach at many institutions outside of the United States. An alternative approach for those with bulky, initially unresectable tumors or extensive nodal disease (ie, cN2 disease) is induction chemotherapy (preferably with an oxaliplatin-containing regimen, such as FOLFOX (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F50132\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef50132 \">table 4</a>)) followed by fluoropyrimidine-based concomitant chemoradiotherapy. (See <a href=\"#H2982328785\" class=\"local\">'No distant metastases'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>For patients with metastatic disease, if both the primary tumor and metastases are resectable, one approach is to start with short-course RT to the primary and involved nodes followed by combination chemotherapy and then surgical resection of both the primary and the metastatic disease. Another approach is initial chemotherapy followed by long-course chemoradiotherapy and then resection. In some situations, radiation can be omitted if the primary tumor has responded to chemotherapy. There is no consensus as to the best approach, and guidelines from expert groups differ. (See <a href=\"#H3667110195\" class=\"local\">'Potentially resectable metastases'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>For patients with unresectable metastatic disease who have symptomatic tumors, options include surgical bypass, palliative resection, laser ablation or electrofulguration (for nonobstructing tumors), or short-course RT followed by modern combination chemotherapy. For asymptomatic primary tumors, we only pursue treatment of the primary in the setting of imminent obstruction. (See <a href=\"#H2858533129\" class=\"local\">'Unresectable metastases'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Intensive postoperative surveillance is generally recommended for patients with resected stage II or III (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F111438\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef111438 \">table 2</a>) cancers who would be considered candidates for aggressive treatment, including curative intent surgery in the event of a disease recurrence. We follow published guidelines from ASCO (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F91618\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef91618 \">table 8</a>). For patients with resected stage IV disease, we recommend the same surveillance strategy, except that we increase the frequency of surveillance CT to every six months. (See <a href=\"#H3618003228\" class=\"local\">'Posttreatment surveillance'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">There is little consensus as to the appropriate follow-up strategy for resected stage I disease. We suggest following the same posttreatment surveillance strategy as used for stage II disease, and we do periodic flexible sigmoidoscopy for patients who are treated by transanal excision alone. (See <a href=\"#H394864663\" class=\"local\">'Stage I disease'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Although most colorectal cancers are sporadic, specific genetic disorders have been identified, most of which are autosomal dominant, that are associated with a very high risk of developing the disease. Lynch syndrome, which accounts for approximately 2 to 3 percent of all colorectal adenocarcinomas, is characterized by a germline disease-causing defect in one of the mismatch repair (MMR) genes, the biologic footprint of which is microsatellite instability (MSI). Increasingly, universal testing of all colorectal cancers for MSI or loss of MMR proteins by immunohistochemistry (IHC) is performed, a practice that is supported by multiple professional societies. Testing for presence of MMR proteins by IHC is unreliable on a posttreatment rectal cancer. Thus, if initial chemoradiotherapy or short-course RT is planned, an attempt should be made to perform IHC testing on the pretreatment biopsy material. (See <a href=\"#H2377642995\" class=\"local\">'Genetic issues'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Management of locally recurrent rectal adenocarcinoma is a significant challenge. The choice of therapy depends upon prior therapy, the local extent of the recurrence, and whether or not distant disease is present. Complete surgical resection is a prerequisite for cure; however, outcomes are poor with surgery alone. For most patients, especially those who have not received prior pelvic RT, combined modality therapy is recommended rather than surgery alone.
