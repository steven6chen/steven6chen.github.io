They are most often composed of struvite (magnesium ammonium phosphate) <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> <a href=\"topic.htm?path=calcium-carbonate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">calcium carbonate</a> apatite. These stones are often referred to as 'infection stones' since they are strongly associated with urinary tract infections with urea splitting organisms. Cystine stones, although much less common, may also develop into staghorn calculi [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-struvite-or-staghorn-calculi/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cystine-stones\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Cystine stones&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Small struvite <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> <a href=\"topic.htm?path=calcium-carbonate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">calcium carbonate</a> apatite stones can grow rapidly over a period of weeks to months into large staghorn calculi involving the calyces and entire renal pelvis. If left untreated, this can lead to deterioration of kidney function and end-stage renal disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-struvite-or-staghorn-calculi/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. In addition, since the stones often remain infected, there is a risk of developing sepsis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-struvite-or-staghorn-calculi/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Thus, most patients require definitive surgical treatment.</p><p>There are several alternative surgical treatments for staghorn calculi. The American Urological Association Nephrolithiasis Guidelines Panel reviewed the existing literature to determine the optimal application of these different treatment modalities [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-struvite-or-staghorn-calculi/abstract/3-5\" class=\"abstract_t\">3-5</a>]. The current discussion is largely based upon this Panel's recommendations for the management of staghorn calculi; the pathogenesis and clinical manifestations of struvite stones as well as the management of renal and ureteral calculi in general, are presented separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pathogenesis-and-clinical-manifestations-of-struvite-stones\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pathogenesis and clinical manifestations of struvite stones&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=options-in-the-management-of-renal-and-ureteral-stones-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Options in the management of renal and ureteral stones in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h2\">Limitations of the data</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There are limitations that must be considered when interpreting and adopting guidelines for the optimal treatment of staghorn calculi [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-struvite-or-staghorn-calculi/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Data from randomized controlled studies comparing treatment options are very limited.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>There is no uniform system of categorizing staghorn calculi, no standard method of describing the collecting system, and no widely accepted system of reporting the size of staghorn calculi.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The indications for hospitalization may vary in different countries.</p><p/><p>These limitations lead to difficulty in interpreting or comparing procedural outcomes reported in the literature. In addition, most of the studies that evaluated the use of shock-wave lithotripsy for struvite stones were based upon results with the unmodified Dornier HM-3, the most powerful machine available at the time the guidelines were created. Future studies may report on other lithotriptors, as monotherapy or in combination with other modalities, which might demonstrate dissimilar efficacy.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">TREATMENT OPTIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There are seven alternatives for managing staghorn calculi, including:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Medical therapy alone</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Open surgery</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Laparoscopic surgery</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Percutaneous nephrolithotomy (PNL)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Shock-wave lithotripsy (SWL)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Combination of PNL and SWL</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Combination of PNL and ureteroscopy</p><p/><p>Surgical therapy with one of the procedures listed above, most commonly PNL, is usually required to treat struvite stones. Medical therapy alone is <strong>not</strong> preferred except in patients who are too ill to tolerate, or who refuse, stone removal.</p><p>This section briefly reviews these options as they relate to management of struvite stones. Greater detail regarding the surgical options is provided elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=options-in-the-management-of-renal-and-ureteral-stones-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Options in the management of renal and ureteral stones in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Medical therapy alone</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The medical treatment of struvite stones is rarely successful. Bacteria live within interstices of the stone where antimicrobial agents may not penetrate, and create a persistently alkaline local environment promoting stone growth. Nevertheless, if a bacterium has been identified in culture, chronic administration of a culture-specific antimicrobial agent can sometimes prevent further stone growth and should be initiated.</p><p>Other strategies include dietary phosphorus reduction (but this therapy is burdensome and often constipating) and administration of urease inhibitors such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acetohydroxamic-acid-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">acetohydroxamic acid</a> (AHA, Lithostat). Urease inhibitors can cause complete, non-competitive inhibition of urease production. Stone growth can be arrested in 80 percent of patients versus only 40 percent of patients in placebo-treated patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-struvite-or-staghorn-calculi/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. However, 20 to 60 percent of patients receiving AHA experience significant side effects such as palpitations, edema, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, headache, loss of taste, hallucinations, rash, abdominal discomfort, anemia, and reticulocytosis (all reversible).</p><p>Prior to 1980, surgery was not advocated for removal of staghorn stones since they were unlikely to be symptomatic except for bacteriuria. However, few patients do well with observation alone. Among 177 consecutive patients with a staghorn calculus, for example, renal-related death occurred in 67, 3, and zero percent of patients who refused treatment, who were treated without complete clearance of stone fragments, or who had complete clearance of fragments, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-struvite-or-staghorn-calculi/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].</p><p>Thus, medical therapy alone is not considered the preferred option except in patients who are too ill to tolerate, or who refuse, stone removal [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-struvite-or-staghorn-calculi/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. Routine surveillance every three to four months to monitor stone growth is mandatory for patients on medical therapy alone [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-struvite-or-staghorn-calculi/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Open surgery</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Surgical removal of a renal stone was once considered the &quot;gold standard&quot; to which all other forms of stone removal were compared. Yet, open surgery for management of staghorn calculi is rarely indicated today. A variety of specific open surgical operations on the kidney may be performed to remove a staghorn calculus. Depending upon anatomy, a pelviolithotomy, extended pyelotomy, nephrostomy, anatrophic nephrolithotomy, partial nephrectomy, or even nephrectomy may all play a role.</p><p>The most common open operative stone removal procedure performed today is anatrophic nephrolithotomy, which involves an incision of the renal parenchyma along an avascular plane to gain access to the calyceal system. The development of this technique, and the demonstration that patients with infected stones could be made stone free, made this surgical approach the standard of care throughout the 1960s and 1970s.</p><p>Open surgical stone removal is now relatively uncommon in the treatment of struvite stones, except for removal of a unilateral, chronically infected, shrunken, and poorly functioning kidney [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-struvite-or-staghorn-calculi/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. It may also be the only reasonable treatment option for very large or complex stones, or in morbidly obese individuals in whom endoscopic and fluoroscopic techniques are difficult [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-struvite-or-staghorn-calculi/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. There have been a number of series reporting the use of laparoscopic techniques to perform anatrophic nephrolithotomy. These data are limited by the small number of patients treated in this fashion and the lack of studies comparing laparoscopic anatrophic nephrolithotomy to established endoscopic techniques [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-struvite-or-staghorn-calculi/abstract/11,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,12</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Percutaneous nephrolithotomy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>PNL became popular as a primary technique for stone removal in the early 1980s. This procedure allows for removal of large volume stones. The technique has been greatly improved with refinements in flexible and rigid nephroscopes, and laser or pneumatic lithotripsy via the nephroscope. A more extensive discussion of this technique is provided elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=options-in-the-management-of-renal-and-ureteral-stones-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Options in the management of renal and ureteral stones in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Staghorn calculi are generally best managed by PNL, despite the frequent requirement for repeat procedures. PNL was previously recommended in conjunction with SWL [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-struvite-or-staghorn-calculi/abstract/4,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,10</a>], but results with PNL alone have surpassed those with combination PNL and SWL as refinements in PNL techniques and instruments have been made [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-struvite-or-staghorn-calculi/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].</p><p>The following are some unquestioned advantages to PNL [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-struvite-or-staghorn-calculi/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>If the stone can be accessed, it can almost always be removed.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Direct inspection of the collecting system allows identification and removal of small fragments.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Repeated inspections are possible because the tract can be kept open indefinitely.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The process is relatively rapid, with success or failure being obvious immediately.</p><p/><p>Hospitalization is usually from one to three days, with most patients returning to light activity after one week. Although the expertise for performing PNL is becoming more widely available, patients with complete or complex stones are best treated by specialized &quot;stone experts&quot; who are generally located at major teaching hospitals.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Shock-wave lithotripsy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>SWL has historically been an accepted treatment for most stones and is still used for the majority of smaller stones. There are several reasons for the popularity of SWL: it is generally considered to have few short-term complications; its noninvasive nature has much appeal; and the technique is widely available. However, it often requires general or regional anesthesia. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=options-in-the-management-of-renal-and-ureteral-stones-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Options in the management of renal and ureteral stones in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p>There are some disadvantages with SWL in the management of staghorn calculi, given inferior stone-free rates (compared with PNL) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-struvite-or-staghorn-calculi/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>], and it may result in a significant perinephric hematoma, residual stones in the ureteral tract, sepsis, renal trauma, and colic [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-struvite-or-staghorn-calculi/abstract/14-16\" class=\"abstract_t\">14-16</a>]. Multiple treatments may often be required, and ancillary procedures directed toward the management of fragments are often necessary. In addition, multiple SWL treatments may subsequently impair renal function. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=renal-complications-of-extracorporeal-shock-wave-lithotripsy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Renal complications of extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Thus, we do <strong>not</strong> recommend SWL monotherapy as first line therapy for the management of most patients with staghorn calculi [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-struvite-or-staghorn-calculi/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. The exception is in patients with small stone burdens (stone area less than 500 mm<sup>2</sup>) who have normal collecting system anatomy (eg, no hydroureteronephrosis) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-struvite-or-staghorn-calculi/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. If SWL monotherapy is used, a stent should be placed to ensure adequate drainage of the kidney.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Combination of PNL and SWL</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Some patients are managed by using both PNL and SWL on the same stone [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-struvite-or-staghorn-calculi/abstract/10,17\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,17</a>], particularly when the stone is large <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> fragments are inaccessible by PNL [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-struvite-or-staghorn-calculi/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. This technique combines the main advantage of PNL (which is the rapid removal of large volumes of an easily accessible stone), with the advantage of SWL (the easy treatment of small volumes of stone that are difficult or dangerous to access using PNL) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-struvite-or-staghorn-calculi/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>].</p><p>With the combined technique, the surgeon first utilizes PNL, making every effort to remove as much stone as possible. Any residual stones are treated one or two days later with SWL. Because subsequent passage of these fragments cannot be predicted, a second percutaneous procedure is then performed, removing all residual stones. The likelihood of success is greatest with small, nonobstructing stones and lowest with large obstructing stones that essentially form a cast of the renal pelvis and calyces [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-struvite-or-staghorn-calculi/abstract/19,20\" class=\"abstract_t\">19,20</a>].</p><p>However, newer PNL techniques and instruments may make the addition of SWL to PNL unnecessary.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h2\">Adjunctive procedures</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Percutaneous nephrostomy tube placement may be necessary at some point in the management of staghorn stones. Nephrostomy tubes are placed routinely in patients undergoing PNL and are also frequently used for drainage of infected stone fragments or pain relief following SWL.</p><p>Ureteral stent insertion prior to SWL of staghorn calculi is used routinely. In many cases, a double-pigtail stent is placed and left indwelling for days or weeks to maintain drainage while fragments pass.</p><p>Ureteroscopy is sometimes performed in patients undergoing PNL. With this technique, the ureteroscopic component provides the ability to remove peripheral stones, avoiding the need for multiple nephrostomy tracts [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-struvite-or-staghorn-calculi/abstract/21,22\" class=\"abstract_t\">21,22</a>].</p><p>Irrigation (chemolysis) of the collecting system, with solutions such as a citric acid mixture (Renacidin), to dissolve remaining fragments of infected stones, particularly after PNL, has been advocated by some clinicians. Chemolysis is not a common procedure today since its use prolongs hospitalization [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-struvite-or-staghorn-calculi/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h2\">Post-procedure monitoring</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Periodic monitoring (every 6 to 12 months) with urologic imaging (eg, plain radiograph [KUB], ultrasound, or computed tomography [CT]) is indicated after successful therapy since new stone formation can occur, occasionally affecting the contralateral kidney [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-struvite-or-staghorn-calculi/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. This is most likely to occur in women with pure struvite stones and recurrent urinary tract infections and in patients with a ureteral diversion or any other condition resulting in recurrent bacteriuria [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-struvite-or-staghorn-calculi/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h1\">OUTCOMES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Outcomes relevant for determining the appropriate modality of treatment for staghorn calculi are the stone-free rate, requirement for repeat primary, secondary or adjunctive procedures, and complication rates [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-struvite-or-staghorn-calculi/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h2\">Stone-free rate</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The stone-free rate following surgical stone removal is perhaps the most quantifiable and meaningful determinant of successful treatment. Given that the majority of these complex stones contain bacteria, the only way to subsequently sterilize the patients' urine is to completely remove all stone material.</p><p>Nevertheless, the renal stone literature is clouded by studies that count patients with small residual fragments (so-called &quot;clinically insignificant&quot; residual fragments) as successes. In addition, the method of assessing the stone-free state has a significant impact on the number of patients who are reported free of stones following surgery. As an example, stone-free rates are probably overestimated if the only method of ascertainment is a plain abdominal radiograph, as done in the majority of studies that examined this issue related to staghorn calculi. The removal of all fragments is best confirmed by CT without contrast, which can detect stones as small as 1 mm in diameter. CT scanning is more sensitive than plain radiographs, renal ultrasonography or nephrotomography. However, nephrostomy tubes may obscure residual stone fragments.</p><p>Stone-free rates are greatly dependent upon stone burden, in particular if SWL and PNL are used rather than open surgery. Lower rates are reported with complete staghorn calculi (filling virtually the entire pelvis and calyces) compared to partial staghorn calculi.</p><p>Stone-free rates are also higher with procedures that are more invasive. As an example, stone-free rates are approximately 50 percent for SWL, and over 75 to 80 percent for open surgery and PNL (100 percent in some reports of open surgery) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-struvite-or-staghorn-calculi/abstract/3,26-28\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,26-28</a>].</p><p>Although stone-free rates over 75 percent are achievable using PNL, these patients often require repeat procedures [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-struvite-or-staghorn-calculi/abstract/3,4,20,29\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,4,20,29</a>]. As an example, in a prospective randomized trial of 50 staghorn calculi, SWL monotherapy (23 stones) was compared with combined initial PNL followed by SWL (27 stones) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-struvite-or-staghorn-calculi/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. The stone-free rate at six months was significantly greater with combination therapy (74 versus 22 percent). Stone-free rates without a 'second look' PNL are lower (66 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-struvite-or-staghorn-calculi/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. &quot;Aggressive PNL&quot; with multiple nephrostomy tracts appear to improve stone-free rates, while minimizing the need for second look nephroscopy procedures [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-struvite-or-staghorn-calculi/abstract/30,31\" class=\"abstract_t\">30,31</a>].</p><p>If absolute stone-free rates are used to ultimately decide the most appropriate mode of stone removal, PNL and open surgery provide the &quot;best&quot; results. However, between PNL and open surgery, PNL generally has the advantages of lower patient morbidity and mortality.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h3\">Residual stone fragments</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A persistent stone-free state is also dependent upon complete removal of all large stone fragments. As an example, the persistence of fragments more than 5 mm in size at three months is associated with a very high incidence of progressive stone growth (seven of nine in one series) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-struvite-or-staghorn-calculi/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>]. On the other hand, the stone-free and infection-free rate at three years is approximately 90 percent if all fragments are removed during the initial therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-struvite-or-staghorn-calculi/abstract/32,33\" class=\"abstract_t\">32,33</a>].</p><p>Persistently sterile urine and prevention of stone growth can be achieved in some patients with small residual stone particles. Finely pulverized stone material is susceptible to sterilization by appropriate antimicrobial therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-struvite-or-staghorn-calculi/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>]. In addition to antibiotics, patients with small fragments that persist eight weeks or more after SWL may benefit from the administration of 40 to 60 mEq of potassium citrate per day to increase urinary citrate excretion; this therapy also appears to benefit patients with calcium oxalate stone [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-struvite-or-staghorn-calculi/abstract/35-37\" class=\"abstract_t\">35-37</a>]. Potassium citrate administration will minimize growth of the fragments, thereby promoting their spontaneous passage.</p><p>For patients with small fragments that persist eight weeks after the procedure, we suggest appropriate antibiotic treatment and administration of 40 to 60 mEq of potassium citrate per day.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14\"><span class=\"h2\">Repeat procedures</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients may require a repeat procedure (with same or different modality), or an adjunctive procedure (see <a href=\"#H9\" class=\"local\">'Adjunctive procedures'</a> above). Analyzing the number of repeat procedures associated with various treatment options for staghorn calculi can be difficult since some adjunctive procedures are considered an essential part of the primary procedure. The American Urological Association Nephrolithiasis Guidelines Panel changed its position with the 2004 guidelines and now considers adjunctive procedures part of the primary procedures if they are performed in the same session [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-struvite-or-staghorn-calculi/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].</p><p>Before 1979, when open surgery was the only modality available to treat staghorn calculi, it was unusual to perform more than one procedure per patient to remove all stone material.

They are most often composed of struvite (magnesium ammonium phosphate) <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> <a href=\"topic.htm?path=calcium-carbonate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">calcium carbonate</a> apatite. These stones are strongly associated with urinary tract infections and persistent infection of the stone.</p><p>Staghorn calculi can lead to sepsis, deterioration of kidney function, and end-stage renal disease if left untreated. Since medical therapy alone is usually not successful, most patients require definitive surgical treatment.</p><p>The major surgical alternatives for staghorn calculi include percutaneous nephrolithotomy (PNL), shock-wave lithotripsy (SWL), the combination of PNL and SWL, and open surgery.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H19\"><span class=\"h2\">Recommendations</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The following recommendations apply to adult patients with a non-cystine, non-uric acid staghorn calculus, who have two equally well-functioning kidneys or a solitary kidney with normal kidney function. In addition, it is assumed that the medical condition of the patient is such that they could tolerate anesthesia and any of the four modalities of treatment.</p><p>Given the poor outcomes associated with non-removal of staghorn calculi, we recommend that all newly diagnosed patients undergo a stone removal procedure (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=2\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1B</a>). (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Treatment options'</a> above.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We suggest that percutaneous nephrolithotomy (PNL) be used as the first line of treatment for most patients (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=5\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2B</a>).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>PNL should be the final procedure in patients who require combination therapy with PNL and SWL, to ensure that stone fragments are removed. (See <a href=\"#H8\" class=\"local\">'Combination of PNL and SWL'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We suggest SWL as monotherapy, <strong>with</strong> placement of adequate drainage of the kidney prior to the procedure (usually a ureteral stent), only in selected patients with small stone volumes who have normal collecting system anatomy (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=5\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2B</a>).</p><p/><p>For patients with small fragments that persist eight weeks after the procedure, we suggest appropriate antibiotic treatment and administration of 40 to 60 mEq of potassium citrate per day (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). (See <a href=\"#H13\" class=\"local\">'Residual stone fragments'</a> above.)</p><p>Given that outcomes with percutaneous nephrolithotomy are similar to open surgery, but with lower morbidity, we recommend open surgery (anatrophic nephrolithotomy) only in very selected circumstances, as follows (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=2\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1B</a>):</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients with a large stone burden, especially if the collecting system anatomy is very distorted, in whom a reasonable number of less invasive procedures would not be expected to successfully remove the stone.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Morbidly obese individuals in whom endoscopic and fluoroscopic techniques are difficult.</p><p/><p>For patients with a staghorn stone in a non-functioning or poorly functioning kidney, especially if it is chronically infected, nephrectomy is a reasonable treatment option.</p><p>Subsequent to successful treatment, periodic monitoring (every 6 to 12 months) should be undertaken since new stones may occur, occasionally affecting the contralateral kidney. Urologic imaging with plain abdominal radiographs or a non-contrasted renal CT scan and 24-hour urinary testing will help determine stone recurrence and the adequacy of medical stone management.
