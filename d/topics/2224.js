The World Health organization (WHO), the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP), the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG), and the United States Preventive Services Task Force all recommend breastfeeding for the first six months of life [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/breast-milk-expression-for-the-preterm-infant/abstract/1-5\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-5</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=infant-benefits-of-breastfeeding\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Infant benefits of breastfeeding&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=maternal-and-economic-benefits-of-breastfeeding\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Maternal and economic benefits of breastfeeding&quot;</a>.)</p><p>However, mothers of vulnerable infants, such as preterm infants, encounter a variety of unique breastfeeding barriers and challenges that result in a decreased rate of breastfeeding in preterm compared with term infants [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/breast-milk-expression-for-the-preterm-infant/abstract/4,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,6</a>]. As an example, in Massachusetts, breastfeeding initiation rates were 77, 70, and 63 percent in term infants, infants born between 32 and 36 weeks gestation, and those born between 24 and 31 weeks, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/breast-milk-expression-for-the-preterm-infant/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. For extremely premature infants, a major barrier is their inability to breastfeed effectively for some time after delivery, which requires their mothers to establish and maintain milk production by milk expression either by hand or by use of a pump. As a result, efforts need to be made to support both breast milk expression and breastfeeding for the maternal-preterm infant dyad, because the benefits of human milk are well-established in these infants. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=human-milk-feeding-and-fortification-of-human-milk-for-premature-infants#H2\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Human milk feeding and fortification of human milk for premature infants&quot;, section on 'Advantages of human milk'</a>.)</p><p>Breast milk expression for the premature infant will be reviewed here.

(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=breastfeeding-parental-education-and-support\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Breastfeeding: Parental education and support&quot;</a>.)</p><p>In the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU), educational efforts are needed to address the specific breastfeeding needs of parents with preterm infants. In most cases, mothers who deliver prematurely have not made a final decision on whether to breastfeed their infant and may not have the necessary information to make an informed decision. Clinical staff should discuss the benefits of human milk, including the long-term effects of exclusive breastfeeding. In most cases, mothers opt to feed their infant breast milk and are willing to express their milk for at least one to two weeks when they learn about the benefits of human milk [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/breast-milk-expression-for-the-preterm-infant/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].</p><p>Because many preterm infants cannot initially feed at the breast, mothers need instructions regarding expression and collection of milk. At the point that the infant can breastfeed, mothers require additional instructions on how best to initiate breastfeeding [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/breast-milk-expression-for-the-preterm-infant/abstract/8,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,9</a>].</p><p>Efforts to promote breastfeeding should be directed and coordinated by a clinician with expertise in both lactation and intensive neonatal care. Staff should have a comprehensive understanding of the benefits of breastfeeding and the policy and procedures of the lactation support service, and be trained to implement the policy. Optimal care practice policy, which promotes breastfeeding, is outlined in the criteria required for the World Health Organization and the United Nations Children's Fund Baby-Friendly Hospital, and is discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=initiation-of-breastfeeding#H2\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Initiation of breastfeeding&quot;, section on 'Hospital environment'</a>.)</p><p>The impact of lactational counseling was illustrated in a randomized trial of preterm infants between 26 and 37 weeks gestation (mean age 32 weeks) whose mothers intended to breastfeed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/breast-milk-expression-for-the-preterm-infant/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. Women who received weekly peer breastfeeding counseling compared with those who received standard care were more likely to provide breast milk to their infant at 12 weeks postpartum (odds ratio [OR] 2.8, 95% CI 1.1-7.1). Peer counselors help mothers learn to use the breast pump, breastfeed, and provide skin-to-skin care (also referred to as kangaroo care).</p><p>In another study, lactational counseling led to a high rate of initiating breastfeeding (84 percent) in mothers of very low birth weight infants (birth weights below 1500 g) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/breast-milk-expression-for-the-preterm-infant/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. Counseling included education on the benefits of human milk, use and procurement of a breast pump, and storage of milk. Counseling promoting breastfeeding did not increase maternal stress and anxiety.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">EFFECTS OF PREMATURITY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Premature infants often are unable to breastfeed effectively for some time after delivery. This requires mothers to establish and maintain milk production by milk expression, which is particularly challenging because it is often required for a prolonged period [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/breast-milk-expression-for-the-preterm-infant/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. </p><p>However, mothers who deliver prematurely have difficulty in establishing an adequate milk supply [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/breast-milk-expression-for-the-preterm-infant/abstract/13,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,14</a>]. Milk production decreases with lower gestational age, which may in part be due to incomplete mammary development because of the shortened pregnancy. This was illustrated in a study of 46 Australian mothers, which showed that milk production was lower in mothers who delivered before 28 weeks gestation compared with in those who delivered between 28 and 34 weeks gestation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/breast-milk-expression-for-the-preterm-infant/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. Lower volumes persisted to the 10<sup>th</sup> day postpartum in women who delivered at an earlier gestation. In addition, lactogenesis stage II (secretory activation, which is marked by the onset of copious milk production) occurred later in mothers who delivered before 28 weeks gestation, a finding which has been noted in earlier studies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/breast-milk-expression-for-the-preterm-infant/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=physiology-of-lactation#H3\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Physiology of lactation&quot;, section on 'Pregnancy'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=physiology-of-lactation#H9\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Physiology of lactation&quot;, section on 'Lactogenesis'</a>.)</p><p>Despite these challenges, the majority of mothers who deliver prematurely are capable of producing enough milk to feed their offspring. It is important to identify the barriers for successful establishment of milk production, so that support and interventions can be directed towards addressing these impediments.</p><p>The following factors are associated with a decreased likelihood that mother's milk will be used for infant feeding [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/breast-milk-expression-for-the-preterm-infant/abstract/13,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,14</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Lower gestational age, as mentioned previously</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Irregular and infrequent emptying of the breast</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Increased maternal-infant separation</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Decreased skin-to-skin contact (see <a href=\"#H25\" class=\"local\">'Skin-to-skin contact'</a> below)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Maternal fatigue and stress</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Young maternal age</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Low maternal annual income (ie, less than $50,000)</p><p/><p>Based upon these findings, it is imperative that mothers of premature infants receive counseling to increase their milk supply, and ultimately initiate breastfeeding.

Milk expression is most often performed using a mechanical breast pump because of its efficiency in removing milk within a reasonable time period and its ability to thoroughly empty the breast. Breast stimulation practices that include manual expression of milk during the first 48 hours after birth and in combination with electric breast pump use yield higher volumes of colostrum [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/breast-milk-expression-for-the-preterm-infant/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>] and sustainable daily milk volumes (&gt;500 mL) over eight weeks post-delivery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/breast-milk-expression-for-the-preterm-infant/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. However, several randomized trials demonstrate the superiority of electric breast pumps over hand expression for optimal milk removal [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/breast-milk-expression-for-the-preterm-infant/abstract/18,19\" class=\"abstract_t\">18,19</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Breast pump selection</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>For mothers who are totally dependent upon expression of their milk to initiate and maintain their milk production, a hospital grade electric breast pump to stimulate and empty their breasts is recommended. Electric pumps programmed with suction patterns that mimic the human infant during breastfeeding result in greater milk output in less time spent pumping in pump-dependent mothers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/breast-milk-expression-for-the-preterm-infant/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. Evidence suggests that double pumping (simultaneously) is more effective than sequential pumping in the first two weeks [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/breast-milk-expression-for-the-preterm-infant/abstract/18,21\" class=\"abstract_t\">18,21</a>]. Double pumping appears to stimulate more milk ejections and is more efficient in yielding a milk higher in volume and energy content when compared with single pumping [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/breast-milk-expression-for-the-preterm-infant/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. With regards to pump suction pressure, mothers should be advised not to expect to use the maximum vacuum programmed into the breast pump as the maximum comfortable vacuum chosen by mothers is variable in mothers with sufficient milk production [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/breast-milk-expression-for-the-preterm-infant/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>].</p><p>Selection of the correct size breast shield is important in order to maximize the amount of milk expressed. If a breast shield is too small, the nipple will rub against the sides of the tunnel causing discomfort and possible trauma, resulting in milk ejection inhibition and poor milk flow [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/breast-milk-expression-for-the-preterm-infant/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. If a breast shield is too large, a loss or reduction in suction will occur due to air leakage resulting in ineffective stimulation, milk ejection, and milk flow. A properly fitted shield allows the nipple and areola to move in and out of the shield freely, without touching the sides of the tunnel (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F107721\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef107721 \">figure 1</a>). Mothers should be re-evaluated for proper shield size following several weeks of pumping to ensure the fit is still appropriate.</p><p>A hospital grade double pump may be rented through hospitals, pharmacies, lactation consultants, and home health agencies. For women in the United States who are participants of the Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC), these pumps are available at no charge in most states. For mothers who cannot afford or prefer not to obtain an electric pump, one manual pump model has been shown to extract the same volume of milk during sequential pumping as the hospital grade electric pump, although the pumping time is longer [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/breast-milk-expression-for-the-preterm-infant/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Timing, frequency, and duration</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h3\">Initiation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Mothers who are unable to breastfeed directly should be advised to initiate milk expression within the first six hours after delivery. Delaying milk expression beyond this point is associated with lower milk volumes on days 10 through 14 postpartum [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/breast-milk-expression-for-the-preterm-infant/abstract/26,27\" class=\"abstract_t\">26,27</a>]. Initiation within the first one to six hours after delivery appears to result in greater total volume at one, two, and eight weeks [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/breast-milk-expression-for-the-preterm-infant/abstract/27,28\" class=\"abstract_t\">27,28</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h3\">Frequency</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The breasts should be pumped at least six times a day to ensure an adequate milk supply. This is because pumping at least six times per day is associated with higher milk volumes than less frequent pumping in the first six weeks after delivery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/breast-milk-expression-for-the-preterm-infant/abstract/17,29\" class=\"abstract_t\">17,29</a>] The optimal number of daily milk expressions will vary with each mother, and hospital staff should monitor milk production closely and make adjustments in the pumping schedule as needed. (See <a href=\"#H10\" class=\"local\">'Monitoring'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2196424376\"><span class=\"h3\">Duration</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Mothers should be advised to pump the breasts simultaneously for 15 minutes prior to the onset of lactogenesis II (defined as the first of two consecutive pumping sessions for which the total milk output is &gt;20 mL, which typically occurs around the third or fourth day of life if the breast is appropriately stimulated). After the onset of lactogenesis II, each pumping session should continue until only drops are being expressed, with a minimum of 15 minutes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/breast-milk-expression-for-the-preterm-infant/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. In a prospective observational study of 52 pump-dependent mothers of preterm infants (&lt;31 weeks gestation) with daily mean milk volumes &gt;500 mL, the mean duration of pumping was around 25 minutes per session [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/breast-milk-expression-for-the-preterm-infant/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h3\">Interpumping intervals</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Between pumping, milk stasis occurs, and the response of mothers to milk stasis during interpumping intervals varies. Some mothers may experience a reduction in milk synthesis when nonpumping intervals extend beyond six hours, while others maintain the same milk production rate with longer interpumping intervals.</p><p>When milk volume is inadequate, characterizing the maternal response to milk stasis during interpumping intervals may be helpful in developing effective strategies for increased milk production. The following is one approach that determines milk production rates between feeds and over a 24-hour period, and uses this information to adjust the pumping schedule, as needed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/breast-milk-expression-for-the-preterm-infant/abstract/30,31\" class=\"abstract_t\">30,31</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Determine the overall rate of milk synthesis over a 24-hour period: calculated as the measured 24-hour <span class=\"nowrap\">volume/1440</span> minutes.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Determine and compare the rates of milk synthesis for interpumping intervals of long and short duration.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Compare the rates of long interpumping intervals (six hours or greater) with the 24-hour synthesis rate.</p><p/><p>Mothers who are relatively less responsive to milk stasis will have similar synthesis rates during short and long interpumping intervals and can safely include longer interpumping intervals at night. In contrast, mothers whose milk production decreases with increasing prolongation of the interpumping intervals need to ensure that their breasts are emptied on a frequent and regular basis to prevent down regulation of production.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h3\">Monitoring</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>To help with monitoring milk expression and volume, we have found it useful to have mothers maintain pumping records that document the frequency and volume of milk expression in the first few weeks post-delivery (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F107720\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef107720 \">table 1</a>). These records reflect volume patterns following different lengths of interpumping intervals, which are used to adjust pumping frequency and optimize volume production. In a retrospective observational study, use of expressed breast milk increased significantly after mothers began to use pumping logs, rising from 2.7 to 23.2 percent for breast milk feedings, and from 35.1 to 57.2 percent for mixed feedings [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/breast-milk-expression-for-the-preterm-infant/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h2\">Milk volume</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The single most important factor predicting breastfeeding success is the ability of the mother to produce enough milk to meet the requirements of her infant at discharge [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/breast-milk-expression-for-the-preterm-infant/abstract/7,33,34\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,33,34</a>]. By the time of discharge, most preterm infants require about 500 mL of milk per day. Mothers of premature infants who produce less than 350 mL of milk per day by days 10 to 14 postpartum are at risk of producing insufficient milk to feed their infants at discharge. Efforts to increase production should be initiated at that time and continue during the infant's hospitalization. (See <a href=\"#H20\" class=\"local\">'Optimizing milk production'</a> below.)</p><p>The full feeding volume for extremely preterm infants generally is considered to be about 150 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/kg</span> per day. This volume will usually be supplemented with fortifiers that provide additional macro and micronutrients. However, volumes up to 200 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/kg</span> per day are well tolerated by most human milk-fed premature infants who do not have significant chronic cardiopulmonary diseases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/breast-milk-expression-for-the-preterm-infant/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>]. These higher volumes may be needed for larger preterm infants, and for infants who are preparing for hospital discharge who will be fed exclusively human milk after discharge. Increased tolerance of preterm infants to higher feeding volumes with human milk compared with formula has been attributed to a faster gastric emptying rate with human milk versus formula. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=human-milk-feeding-and-fortification-of-human-milk-for-premature-infants\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Human milk feeding and fortification of human milk for premature infants&quot;</a>.)</p><p>In one observational study of mothers with preterm infants (birth weight &lt;1500 g and gestational age &lt;31 weeks), instruction and support of a combination of mechanical breast pumping and manual expression of breast milk resulted in a high and sustainable daily milk production for most mothers through the entire eight-week study period [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/breast-milk-expression-for-the-preterm-infant/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. Mothers were instructed to begin pumping within six hours after delivery, and milk volume was assessed on a weekly basis. Mean daily milk volume (MDMV) was about 320 mL at one week postpartum and steadily increased to 820 mL by the end of study. Of the 42 mothers who completed the study, 75 percent had MDMV &gt;500 mL. The following factors were associated with increased milk production:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Increased frequency of hand expression of colostrum during the first three postpartum days correlated with larger MDMV from week one through week seven.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Frequent pumping (at least seven times a day) compared with less frequent pumping was associated with a higher MDMV at week two postpartum (622 versus 402 mL) and a higher, but not statistically significant, MDMV at week eight (1019 versus 752 mL).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In 39 of 42 mothers, MDMV increased from 583 &plusmn; 383 to 863 &plusmn; 506 mL after they participated in an instructional post-discharge mechanical and hand pumping session that monitored milk production given at a mean 20.6 &plusmn; 9.6 days.</p><p/><p>These results demonstrate that mothers of preterm infants can produce sufficient amounts of breast milk for the nutritional needs of their infants using a combination of mechanical and hand pumping.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h2\">Hindmilk</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The fat content of expressed milk increases from the beginning to the end of an expression session. The final drops of milk (hindmilk) have the highest fat and caloric content, and contribute disproportionately to the infant's calorie intake [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/breast-milk-expression-for-the-preterm-infant/abstract/36,37\" class=\"abstract_t\">36,37</a>]. Mothers should be encouraged to pump until milk ceases to flow, which generally takes about 15 minutes, but this may vary from woman to woman. Once lactation is established, some mothers may find that less time is required to achieve satisfactory breast emptying.

Hard plastic containers scratch and are difficult to clean over time, at which point they should be replaced. Flexible, polyethylene bags are not recommended for milk collection and storage due to the significant greater loss of the cellular component of the milk (maternal macrophages and lymphocytes), and chance of leakage during storage and handling [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/breast-milk-expression-for-the-preterm-infant/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>]. In addition, transparent plastic containers or bottles that contain bisphenol A should be avoided because exposure to bisphenol A may be associated with impairment of infant development. These containers often are marked with the recycling number 7 or the letters PC, which stand for &quot;polycarbonate&quot; plastic.</p><p>Each container should be labeled with the infant's name, medical record number, date and time of collection, and use of any maternal medications. Mothers should be provided with labels for this purpose and instructed to use <span class=\"nowrap\">pens/markers</span> that will not smudge or wash off when exposed to water. If the milk is to be transferred to another container by the nurse or other designated staff prior to feeding, each individual <span class=\"nowrap\">syringe/bottle</span> should be labeled appropriately. Prior to feeding, the information from the labeled milk should be verified against the infant's name band.

Pumping sessions should be observed to ensure the correct breast shield size is used and that the breasts are completely emptied with production of hindmilk. If the milk extraction techniques are performed efficiently, increasing the frequency of breast emptying by two sessions per 24 hours results in an average milk volume increase of 80 mL per day over a two-week time period [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/breast-milk-expression-for-the-preterm-infant/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>].

Bedside pumping allows clinical staff to directly detect and address any pumping difficulty, monitor the maternal pumping schedule, and emphasize to the mother the need to maintain a regular and frequent pumping schedule. It also enables physical contact between the mother and infant during milk expression that augments release of lactogenic hormones, such as oxytocin. In addition, bedside pumping decreases the mother's time away from the infant for pumping either in the mother's room or a &quot;pumping room&quot; [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/breast-milk-expression-for-the-preterm-infant/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].

(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=infant-benefits-of-breastfeeding\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Infant benefits of breastfeeding&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=maternal-and-economic-benefits-of-breastfeeding\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Maternal and economic benefits of breastfeeding&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Mothers of preterm infants below 34 weeks gestation generally need to express their milk because their infant is unable to completely feed at the breast.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Milk expression is most often performed using a mechanical breast pump because of its efficiency in removing milk within a reasonable time period and its ability to thoroughly empty the breast. We suggest milk expression should be started within six hours after delivery and performed at least six times a day to ensure optimal milk supply in the first weeks of life (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=5\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2B</a>). (See <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Milk expression'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Thorough breast emptying optimizes milk production and ensures expression of hindmilk, which has the highest fat and caloric content of human milk. Milk production is also enhanced by skin-to-skin contact and tactile nipple stimulation. We do not recommend the routine use of galactagogues to increase milk production because of limited data on efficacy and safety for both mother and infant (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=2\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1B</a>). (See <a href=\"#H20\" class=\"local\">'Optimizing milk production'</a> above and <a href=\"#H12\" class=\"local\">'Hindmilk'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Optimal handling of expressed milk reduces the bacterial growth and protects the antimicrobial and nutritional properties of human milk. The temperature at which milk is stored depends upon the intended duration of storage prior to feeding. (See <a href=\"#H13\" class=\"local\">'Milk collection and storage'</a> above.)</p><p/></div><div id=\"topicAgreement\">Use of UpToDate is subject to the <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/legal/license\" class=\"licenseLink\" id=\"sla_in_page\">Subscription and License Agreement</a>.</div><div id=\"references\" class=\"headingAnchor\"><h1>REFERENCES</h1><ol id=\"reference\"><li><a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/breast-milk-expression-for-the-preterm-infant/abstract/1\" class=\"nounderline abstract_t\">Section on Breastfeeding.
