There were no differences in clinical features between those in whom the proteinuria did and did not resolve other than a tendency for an increased body mass index (BMI) for age and gender in those who resolved.

The two approaches generally used to make the diagnosis of orthostatic proteinuria are:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Comparison of the protein-to-creatinine <span class=\"nowrap\">(Pr/Cr)</span> ratio in urine samples collected in recumbent and upright positions. This is the most convenient standard method.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>24-hour urine collection divided into separate daytime and nighttime collections.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H77439727\"><span class=\"h2\">Urine protein-to-creatinine ratio</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Comparison of the <span class=\"nowrap\">Pr/Cr</span> ratio in urine samples collected in the recumbent and upright position is the easiest way to establish a diagnosis. Orthostatic proteinuria is confirmed if the recumbent urine sample has a normal <span class=\"nowrap\">Pr/Cr</span> ratio and the upright sample has an elevated ratio. A normal urine <span class=\"nowrap\">Pr/Cr</span> ratio is &lt;0.2 mg <span class=\"nowrap\">protein/mg</span> creatinine (&lt;20 mg <span class=\"nowrap\">protein/mmol</span> creatinine) in adults and children greater than two years of age, and &lt;0.5 mg <span class=\"nowrap\">protein/mg</span> creatinine (&lt;50 mg <span class=\"nowrap\">protein/mmol</span> creatinine) in infants and toddlers age 6 to 24 months.

The patient should void completely just before going to sleep and collect a morning sample as soon as arising. A second sample is then collected after at least an hour of being upright and moving around normally.</p><p>A normal urine <span class=\"nowrap\">Pr/Cr</span> ratio on the first morning void and an elevated ratio on the second specimen confirm the diagnosis of orthostatic proteinuria.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H274769446\"><span class=\"h2\">24-hour urine collection</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Alternatively, a split 24-hour urine collection can be used to make the diagnosis of orthostatic proteinuria. This approach is generally used if the diagnosis remains uncertain after comparison of urine <span class=\"nowrap\">Pr/Cr</span> ratios on recumbent and upright urine samples. This test should be deferred for at least 24 hours after strenuous exercise.</p><p>The following protocol is used, which can be printed out and given to the patient (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=split-urine-collection-for-orthostatic-proteinuria-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">&quot;Patient education: Split urine collection for orthostatic proteinuria (Beyond the Basics)&quot;</a>):</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The timing of the daytime collection begins with the first morning void. This void is discarded, however, and not included in the collection since it represents urine produced prior to the timed collection period.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Daytime collection &ndash; After the first morning void is discarded, all subsequent voids are collected throughout the day as the patient performs <span class=\"nowrap\">his/her</span> normal activities. The collection ends with inclusion of a final void that is collected immediately prior to going to bed. It is important that the times of the discarded first morning void and the final void before bedtime be noted so that the duration of the daytime collection is known.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Nighttime collection &ndash; The nighttime (recumbent) collection consists of any urine voided during the nighttime after going to bed and also includes the next morning's first void collected immediately upon awakening. The collection ends with this void. The time of the first morning void should be noted so that the duration of the nighttime collection is also known.</p><p/><p>Total urinary protein excretion rate in <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/hour</span> is then determined for both the daytime and nighttime collections by dividing total protein content in each collection by the time of that collection in hours. For children, this rate should then be normalized to body surface area in square meters.</p><p>Orthostatic proteinuria is diagnosed if the urinary protein excretion rate is normal for the nighttime collection (for children &lt;4 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/m<sup>2</sup></span> per hour and for adults &lt;50 mg over an eight-hour period) and the daytime collection exceeds the normal protein excretion rate.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H619742617\"><span class=\"h2\">Urinary dipstick</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The urinary dipstick is often used to screen for proteinuria, but in dilute specimens the degree of proteinuria may be underestimated. With a urine specific gravity &gt;1.01 (which is generally the case with first morning void specimens from patients with normal urinary concentrating mechanisms who do not drink overnight), it may be the simplest and cheapest test to demonstrate normal urine protein excretion in a first morning sample [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/orthostatic-postural-proteinuria/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. However, if there is uncertainty regarding the urinary dipstick result, a urine <span class=\"nowrap\">Pr/Cr</span> ratio should be calculated.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13281199\"><span class=\"h2\">Effect of strenuous exercise on the diagnostic evaluation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A relatively short period (15 to 20 minutes) of maximal exercise can lead to increased proteinuria in a substantial number of normal individuals. The increase in proteinuria is proportional to the intensity of exercise, and even a short period of intense physical activity can lead to a rise in proteinuria [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/orthostatic-postural-proteinuria/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. As a result, to avoid the risk of a false positive result, in the setting of recent strenuous exercise, a repeat urine sample should be assessed at least 24 hours after such exercise, and strenuous exercise needs to be avoided for a day before further diagnostic urine testing for proteinuria [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/orthostatic-postural-proteinuria/abstract/21,22\" class=\"abstract_t\">21,22</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H188318335\"><span class=\"h1\">DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The differential diagnosis of orthostatic proteinuria includes conditions that result in either transient or persistent proteinuria (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F73973\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef73973 \">table 1</a>).</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Transient proteinuria &ndash; In children, transient proteinuria is the most common cause of a positive urinary dipstick for protein [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/orthostatic-postural-proteinuria/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. It is associated with conditions that may alter renal hemodynamics such as acute febrile illness, vigorous exercise, or exposure to extreme cold. This benign condition is distinguished from orthostatic proteinuria as transient proteinuria resolves completely when the underlying condition is no longer present, whereas orthostatic proteinuria is a persistent condition. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-of-proteinuria-in-children#H13\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation of proteinuria in children&quot;, section on 'Approach to the child with proteinuria'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=assessment-of-urinary-protein-excretion-and-evaluation-of-isolated-non-nephrotic-proteinuria-in-adults#H13\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Assessment of urinary protein excretion and evaluation of isolated non-nephrotic proteinuria in adults&quot;, section on 'Rule out transient proteinuria'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Persistent or fixed proteinuria is differentiated from orthostatic proteinuria by elevated protein excretion in urine samples collected in both the recumbent and upright positions. Non-orthostatic persistent proteinuria is a marker for renal parenchymal disease, can be associated with chronic kidney disease, and always warrants further evaluation and follow-up in both children and adults. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-of-a-child-with-glomerular-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation of a child with glomerular disease&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-of-proteinuria-in-children#H13\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation of proteinuria in children&quot;, section on 'Approach to the child with proteinuria'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=assessment-of-urinary-protein-excretion-and-evaluation-of-isolated-non-nephrotic-proteinuria-in-adults#H15\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Assessment of urinary protein excretion and evaluation of isolated non-nephrotic proteinuria in adults&quot;, section on 'Persistent isolated proteinuria'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">It is particularly important to differentiate non-orthostatic persistent proteinuria with its risk for renal disease from orthostatic proteinuria. Making the correct diagnosis of orthostatic proteinuria prevents unnecessary and costly investigation in patients with daytime proteinuria [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/orthostatic-postural-proteinuria/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h1\">PROGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Orthostatic proteinuria is a benign condition. Long-term follow-up of affected individuals, including data on a small number followed for as long as 40 to 50 years, points to no adverse effect on renal function [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/orthostatic-postural-proteinuria/abstract/23,24\" class=\"abstract_t\">23,24</a>]. Orthostatic proteinuria also has a tendency to resolve over time. In one study, only 50 percent had persistent orthostatic proteinuria after 10 years of follow-up, with rates further dropping to 17 percent at 20 years. [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/orthostatic-postural-proteinuria/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. In these studies, all patients had normal renal function, including those with persistent orthostatic proteinuria.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H77440012\"><span class=\"h1\">MANAGEMENT AND FOLLOW-UP CARE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In view of the benign course of orthostatic proteinuria, no intervention or further initial evaluation is recommended. Since the long-term prognosis is excellent, the best follow-up care remains unclear. Many pediatric nephrologists recommend that routine health care maintenance of affected individuals include testing a first morning void sample to confirm that it remains free of protein. As noted above, such testing should be deferred for at least 24 hours after strenuous exercise and should not be done during acute illness or fever, or when there may be transient proteinuria ongoing.

(See <a href=\"#H13281199\" class=\"local\">'Effect of strenuous exercise on the diagnostic evaluation'</a> above and <a href=\"#H188318335\" class=\"local\">'Differential diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The differential diagnosis of orthostatic proteinuria includes conditions that result in either transient or persistent proteinuria (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F73973\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef73973 \">table 1</a>). (See <a href=\"#H188318335\" class=\"local\">'Differential diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Transient proteinuria, which is associated with fever, vigorous exercise, or exposure to extreme cold, is distinguished from orthostatic proteinuria by the resolution of abnormal daytime protein excretion when the underlying condition is no longer present.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Persistent proteinuria is differentiated from orthostatic proteinuria by elevated protein excretion in urine samples collected in both the recumbent and upright positions. Non-orthostatic persistent proteinuria is a marker for renal parenchymal disease, can be associated with chronic kidney disease, and always warrants further evaluation and follow-up in both children and adults. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-of-proteinuria-in-children#H13\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation of proteinuria in children&quot;, section on 'Approach to the child with proteinuria'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=assessment-of-urinary-protein-excretion-and-evaluation-of-isolated-non-nephrotic-proteinuria-in-adults#H15\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Assessment of urinary protein excretion and evaluation of isolated non-nephrotic proteinuria in adults&quot;, section on 'Persistent isolated proteinuria'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Orthostatic proteinuria is a benign condition and does not affect renal function. Over time, proteinuria resolves spontaneously in most patients. (See <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Prognosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For individuals with orthostatic proteinuria, we recommend <strong>no</strong> further initial evaluation or intervention (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=3\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1C</a>). Although the long-term prognosis is excellent, we suggest periodic monitoring of protein excretion using a first morning void to reconfirm the diagnosis of orthostatic proteinuria in those who continue to have daytime proteinuria (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>).
