The discussion will include pertinent features of the history and physical examination and an algorithmic approach to common and life threatening conditions. The approach and treatment of children with infectious pharyngitis are discussed in more detail elsewhere.

The developmental ability of young children to identify and define their symptoms varies and the physician must pay careful attention to the patient and the caretaker in order to clarify the exact nature of the complaint.</p><p>Sore throat can be the symptom of a disease process that does not directly affect the pharynx. Occasionally, young patients with dysphagia that results from disease in the area of the esophagus or with difficulty swallowing because of a neuromuscular disorder may verbalize these sensations as a sore throat or their symptoms may be interpreted by a caretaker as a sore throat.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">CAUSES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The etiology of sore throat varies by age (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F60174\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef60174 \">table 1</a>) and can further be divided by conditions that are life-threatening, common, or less common. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Life-threatening conditions</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h3\">Epiglottitis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The incidence of epiglottitis, a well-appreciated cause of life-threatening upper airway infection, has declined significantly since the introduction of vaccination against Haemophilus influenzae type b. This disease manifests with a toxic appearance, high fever, stridor, and drooling. Sore throat occurs in many cases, but is only rarely the primary complaint. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epiglottitis-supraglottitis-clinical-features-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Epiglottitis (supraglottitis): Clinical features and diagnosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h3\">Retropharyngeal abscess</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Retropharyngeal abscesses can cause sore throat and usually occur in children less than four years of age. Other complaints include neck pain and fever. There may be difficulty swallowing and respiratory distress. The posterior location of the abscess makes it difficult to visualize on physical examination. Imaging is often required to confirm the diagnosis. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=retropharyngeal-infections-in-children\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Retropharyngeal infections in children&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h3\">Lateral pharyngeal abscesses</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Lateral pharyngeal abscesses produce symptoms similar to retropharyngeal infections but occur less often. High fever is common. Other signs include trismus and swelling below the mandible.

This disease is most common in older children and adolescents. The diagnosis is evident from visual inspection, augmented occasionally by careful palpation. The abscess produces a bulge in the posterior aspect of the soft palate, deviates the uvula to the contralateral side of the pharynx, and has a fluctuant quality on palpation.

Ancillary studies that may be useful include testing for streptococcal disease by antigen detection or culture and a heterophile test and white blood cell count with differential for infectious mononucleosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-sore-throat-in-children/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>].

Children can have symptomatic primary EBV infection without the production of heterophile antibodies and EBV specific serology may be necessary to make the diagnosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-sore-throat-in-children/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=infectious-mononucleosis-in-adults-and-adolescents#H18\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Infectious mononucleosis in adults and adolescents&quot;, section on 'Diagnosis'</a>.)</p><p>A soft-tissue radiographic examination of the lateral neck may be useful in the child who is ill appearing, has significant difficulty swallowing, or who will not move his neck. An abnormal epiglottis and a retropharyngeal abscess can be identified on this view (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F67878\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef67878 \">image 1</a>).</p><p>In order to diagnose a retropharyngeal abscess, the radiograph should be a true lateral, and the child must keep the neck in extension during inspiration to avoid a false thickening of the retropharyngeal space. Findings consistent with a retropharyngeal abscess include a prevertebral space that is increased in depth compared with the anteroposterior measurement of the adjacent vertebral body, or a retropharyngeal space that is greater than 7 mm at C2 or 14 mm at C6 (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F63233\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef63233 \">image 2</a>). Another method for interpreting the width of the prevertebral space is that it should normally measure no more than half the thickness of the vertebral body from C1-C4, or the full thickness from C5-C7. If the diagnosis remains uncertain despite adequate radiographs, a computed tomography (CT) scan should be obtained. A CT scan will confirm the diagnosis of a lateral abscess (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F51505\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef51505 \">image 3</a>).</p><p>If radiographs are normal and a lateral pharyngeal abscess is suspected on the basis of torticollis or asymmetrically enlarged anterior cervical lymph nodes, then a CT scan is indicated. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H19\"><span class=\"h1\">ALGORITHMIC APPROACH</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The tendency of most clinicians is to assume that one of the common organisms is the cause of pharyngitis in the child with a sore throat. Before settling on infectious pharyngitis, however, the clinician should first at least briefly consider several more serious disorders (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F72946\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef72946 \">algorithm 1</a>). </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H20\"><span class=\"h2\">Acutely ill patients</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Conditions that have immediate life-threatening potential include epiglottitis, retropharyngeal and lateral pharyngeal abscesses, peritonsillar abscess, severe tonsillar hypertrophy (usually as an exaggerated manifestation of infectious mononucleosis), diphtheria, and Lemierre's syndrome.</p><p>Generally, stridor and signs of respiratory distress accompany the complaint of sore throat in epiglottitis and retropharyngeal abscess. Drooling occurs commonly in children with these two conditions. Patients with epiglottitis, peritonsillar abscess, or severe infectious tonsillar hypertrophy often experience a change in their voice. In cases of epiglottitis or retropharyngeal abscess that are not clinically obvious, a lateral neck radiograph, obtained under appropriate supervision, is confirmatory.</p><p>Peritonsillar abscess and tonsillar hypertrophy are diagnosed by visual examination of the pharynx. Diphtheria, which produces a thick pharyngeal exudate and markedly enlarged cervical lymph nodes, is rarely a consideration except in unimmunized children, particularly those from underdeveloped nations.</p><p>Lemierre's syndrome is a complication of mixed anaerobic pharyngeal infection leading to sepsis. The child appears toxic, has high fever, neck pain, often has asymmetrically enlarged anterior cervical lymph nodes, and may be hypotensive.</p><p>The next phase of the evaluation of the child with a complaint of sore throat hinges on a careful physical examination, particularly of the pharynx. The appearance of vesicles on the buccal mucosa anterior to the tonsillar pillars points to a herpetic stomatitis or noninfectious syndromes, such as Beh&ccedil;et&rsquo;s or Stevens-Johnson syndrome (erythema multiforme), and generalized inflammation of the oral mucosa in a persistently febrile child suggests Kawasaki disease.</p><p>Uncommonly, a small, pointed foreign body, perhaps a fish bone, becomes lodged in the mucosal folds of the tonsils or pharynx; usually, the history suggests the diagnosis, but an unanticipated sighting may occur in the younger child. Significant asymmetry of the tonsils indicates a peritonsillar cellulitis or, if extensive, an abscess. Clinically, the diagnosis of an abscess is reserved for the tonsil that protrudes beyond the midline, causing the uvula to deviate to the uninvolved side.</p><p>A pharynx that is not inflamed suggests a source of referred pain or irritative pharyngitis. Sources of referred pain (otitis media, dental abscess, and cervical adenitis) usually are identified during the examination. Irritative pharyngitis, seen most commonly during the winter among older children who live in homes with forced hot-air heating, produces minimal or no pharyngeal inflammation. It often is transient, appearing on arising and resolving by midday.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H21\"><span class=\"h2\">Suspected infectious pharyngitis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients who do not have one of the life threatening conditions discussed above and do not have another easily identifiable cause of sore throat (eg, foreign body) are likely to have infectious pharyngitis.</p><p>Infectious pharyngitis evokes a spectrum of inflammatory responses that range from minimal injection of the mucosa to beefy erythema with exudation and edema formation (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F64820\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef64820 \">algorithm 2</a>). The three relatively common causes are streptococci, respiratory viruses, and infectious mononucleosis. In a few cases, a viral pharyngitis that results from Coxsackie virus infection will be evident on the basis of vesicular formation in the posterior pharynx alone (herpangina) or in combination with involvement of the extremities (hand, foot, and mouth disease). Such patients require only symptomatic therapy. </p><p>For patients without pharyngeal vesicles who have significant symptoms with pharyngeal erythema <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> exudate, it is prudent to obtain a rapid test for group A streptococcus, followed by a throat culture if the rapid test is negative. Back up culture for a rapid antigen diagnostic test is recommended. However back up testing (either culture or rapid DNA probe) may not be necessary in older adolescents similar to the approach in adult patients. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-of-acute-pharyngitis-in-adults#H3083859811\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation of acute pharyngitis in adults&quot;, section on 'Testing for GAS'</a>.) In settings where a rapid test is not routinely performed or available, a throat culture for group A streptococcus should be obtained.</p><p>In the rare child with an unusual history, the physician must pursue diagnoses such as gonococcal pharyngitis (sexual abuse, oral sex) or diphtheria (immigration from an underdeveloped country, lack of immunization). If no diagnosis has yet been made in a child who has persistent sore throat and fever, infectious mononucleosis merits consideration even in the absence of lymphadenopathy and splenomegaly. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-treatment-of-epstein-barr-virus-infection\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and treatment of Epstein-Barr virus infection&quot;</a>.) &#160;</p><p>Some authorities find it acceptable not to perform either culture or rapid antigen diagnostic testing if all clinical features point towards a viral etiology (no exudate, no palatal petechiae, no cervical lymphadenopathy, URI symptoms present) in a developed country with a low risk of non-suppurative post-streptococcal complications, such as rheumatic fever [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-sore-throat-in-children/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3750676058\"><span class=\"h1\">SOCIETY GUIDELINE LINKS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Links to society and government-sponsored guidelines from selected countries and regions around the world are provided separately.
