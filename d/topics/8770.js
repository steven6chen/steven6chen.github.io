Ventricular tachycardia (VT) and ventricular fibrillation (VF) are most frequent in the first hours of an infarction, and the incidence then declines in phases during the days, weeks, and months after the event. This pattern reflects the electrophysiologic manifestations of the evolving interactions between ischemia, infarction, reperfusion, and scar formation. A detailed discussion of ventricular arrhythmias in the acute phase of an MI is presented separately.

The rate declined and stabilized in the ensuing 18 months at approximately 4 per 100 person years. The patients were control subjects from five trials of antiarrhythmic drugs or angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors. Due to variations in enrollment periods, the overall analysis assessed survival beginning at day 45 after the incident MI.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h3\">Limitations of early risk stratification</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In the VALIANT study described above, among those patients successfully resuscitated from an episode of sudden cardiac arrest in the first 30 days after an MI, 74 percent were still alive at one year, suggesting that there may be a role for early risk stratification and possibly ICD therapy in selected patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/incidence-of-and-risk-stratification-for-sudden-cardiac-death-after-acute-myocardial-infarction/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. However, both risk assessment and treatment decisions during this early stage are complicated for several reasons:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The arrhythmic substrate evolves as stunned myocardium recovers and scar formation occurs in regions of necrosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/incidence-of-and-risk-stratification-for-sudden-cardiac-death-after-acute-myocardial-infarction/abstract/8,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,9</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>With this physiologic evolution, the findings and implications of risk stratification tests (eg, NSVT, LV function) also change, leading to uncertainty regarding the prognostic significance of abnormal findings in the early postinfarction period.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a subgroup analysis from the MADIT II trial, in which patients were stratified according to the time since their most recent MI, survival benefit with ICD therapy was noted only among those patients whose MI occurred &ge;18 months prior to enrollment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/incidence-of-and-risk-stratification-for-sudden-cardiac-death-after-acute-myocardial-infarction/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>].</p><p/><p>Consistent with these concerns, two randomized trials that directly addressed the issue of early ICD placement for primary prevention of SCD (DINAMIT and IRIS) did not show an improvement in survival in patients with LV dysfunction randomly assigned to receive ICD placement within 31 or 40 days after an acute MI [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/incidence-of-and-risk-stratification-for-sudden-cardiac-death-after-acute-myocardial-infarction/abstract/11,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,12</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=primary-prevention-of-sudden-cardiac-death-in-heart-failure-and-cardiomyopathy#H362963749\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Primary prevention of sudden cardiac death in heart failure and cardiomyopathy&quot;, section on 'Trials of ICD therapy early after MI'</a>.)</p><p>A number of reasons may explain the discrepancy between the elevated early risk of SCD demonstrated in VALIANT and the lack of benefit from ICD therapy in DINAMIT and IRIS. As an example, a benefit from early ICD placement may have been missed in DINAMIT and IRIS because some of the highest risk patients may have been excluded from the trial. In DINAMIT, the average enrollment date was 18 days after MI and in IRIS it was 13 days as compared to 5 days in VALIANT. Because of the high rate of events in the first month after an MI, some patients may have had an arrhythmic event before they could be enrolled in DINAMIT and IRIS and were therefore excluded from the trial, thereby diluting the possible benefit of ICD therapy.</p><p>However, despite the high incidence of early events in VALIANT, the following observations suggest that ICD placement may not have provided durable survival benefit to the patients with early events:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In trials such as VALIANT, arrhythmic events are defined by clinical criteria that may be erroneous. In a study with a design similar to VALIANT, autopsy data revealed that 55 percent of deaths that were clinically adjudicated to have been due to arrhythmias were in fact due to recurrent infarction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/incidence-of-and-risk-stratification-for-sudden-cardiac-death-after-acute-myocardial-infarction/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Rates of reperfusion therapies and beta blocker use were relatively low in VALIANT. Among VALIANT patients who experienced SCD or resuscitated arrest during follow up, only 8 percent had undergone primary PCI, 24 percent had undergone fibrinolysis, and 61 percent were on beta blockers. In contrast, in DINAMIT, 63 percent of patients underwent PCI <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> fibrinolysis and 87 percent were taking beta blockers. Thus, early mortality in VALIANT may have been reduced more by greater use of reperfusion and beta blockers than by early ICD placement.</p><p/><p>At present, ICD therapy for primary prevention is not recommended less than 40 days after MI. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=primary-prevention-of-sudden-cardiac-death-in-heart-failure-and-cardiomyopathy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Primary prevention of sudden cardiac death in heart failure and cardiomyopathy&quot;</a>.)</p><p>However, a subsequent study has raised the question of whether early electrophysiologic (EP) testing may help stratify patients post-MI for ICD placement. An observational study evaluated 360 patients without sustained ventricular tachyarrhythmia who underwent EP testing with programmed ventricular stimulation on day nine post-MI [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/incidence-of-and-risk-stratification-for-sudden-cardiac-death-after-acute-myocardial-infarction/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. In this study 39 percent of early post-MI patients had inducible monomorphic VT (EP positive group, of which 71 percent received an ICD) while 61 percent were noninducible (EP negative group, of which only six percent received an ICD). Patients were followed for two years, with a combined primary endpoint of sudden death and spontaneous ventricular tachyarrhythmia. After adjusting the data for differences in the baseline characteristics between the two groups, the EP negative group had a lower risk of the primary combined endpoint (adjusted hazard ratio 0.46, 95% CI 0.22 to 0.95).</p><p>While this study does provide intriguing evidence for the use of EP testing for early risk stratification of post-MI patients, there is a significant potential for measurement bias and underreporting of the primary endpoint in the EP negative group as patients without an ICD were not continuously monitored for ventricular arrhythmias. However, the results suggest EP testing to be a promising means of risk stratification in early post-MI patients and warrant further investigation in a randomized clinical trial.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h1\">RISK FACTORS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A number of clinical features have been evaluated as possible risk factors for the development of a fatal arrhythmia following an acute MI (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F80458\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef80458 \">table 1</a>):</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Reduced LV ejection fraction (LVEF) or history of heart failure</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Ventricular tachycardia (VT) induced by electrophysiologic study (EPS)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Spontaneous ventricular premature beats (VPBs) and nonsustained ventricular tachycardia (NSVT) documented on 24-hour ambulatory monitoring</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Late potentials on a signal averaged ECG (SAECG)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Reduced heart rate variability (HRV) assessed by ambulatory monitoring</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>T wave (repolarization) alternans (TWA)</p><p/><p>Sustained ventricular arrhythmias are not included on this list of risk factors, which may seem counterintuitive. However, sustained arrhythmias that occur in the early post-MI phase (usually defined as the first 48 hours) are generally considered epiphenomena of the MI and are not consistently associated with long-term prognosis. This lack of association with long term prognosis is more clearly established for early ventricular fibrillation (VF) and polymorphic VT. Sustained monomorphic VT, even when it occurs early, may reflect permanent arrhythmic substrate. Patients with sustained arrhythmias after the early phase are managed according to secondary prevention strategies, and therefore not included in primary prevention risk stratification protocols. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-features-and-treatment-of-ventricular-arrhythmias-during-acute-myocardial-infarction\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical features and treatment of ventricular arrhythmias during acute myocardial infarction&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sustained-monomorphic-ventricular-tachycardia-in-patients-with-structural-heart-disease-treatment-and-prognosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Sustained monomorphic ventricular tachycardia in patients with structural heart disease: Treatment and prognosis&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=secondary-prevention-of-sudden-cardiac-death-in-heart-failure-and-cardiomyopathy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Secondary prevention of sudden cardiac death in heart failure and cardiomyopathy&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The advent of reperfusion therapy (thrombolysis and percutaneous coronary intervention [PCI]) has reduced the prognostic significance of many of the variables that have been useful for risk stratification in the past. As a result, risk stratification strategies are under ongoing investigation.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H362965438\"><span class=\"h2\">Impact of age, ethnicity, and comorbidities</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Because of the risks of noncardiac death, older patients and those with multiple or severe comorbidities may be less likely to derive benefit from an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD). As an example, a post-hoc analysis from the MADIT-II trial described below found no mortality benefit in patients with an estimated glomerular filtration rate less than 35 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/min</span> (mean 29 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/min,</span> no patient was on dialysis), while a benefit was noted in patients with better renal function [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/incidence-of-and-risk-stratification-for-sudden-cardiac-death-after-acute-myocardial-infarction/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>].</p><p>Older patients (eg, age &ge;75 or 80 years) were excluded from some of the major ICD trials, and few patients over age 75 years were enrolled in any of the studies. It is not known, therefore, what survival benefit older patients derive from ICD implantation. The overall prognosis of older patients with an ICD was evaluated in a series of 107 patients &ge;80 years of age at the time of ICD implantation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/incidence-of-and-risk-stratification-for-sudden-cardiac-death-after-acute-myocardial-infarction/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. Median survival after implantation was more than four years, but, among those patients with an LVEF &le;30 percent and an estimated glomerular filtration rate &lt;60 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/min,</span> median survival was less than two years. As there was no control group, this study could not determine whether or not older patients derived survival benefit from an ICD. Rather, it showed that some patients over age 80 years can be expected to live long enough that an ICD may improve overall survival, while those with severe disease and comorbidities have a poor prognosis, even with an ICD.</p><p>Race and ethnicity may also impact the likelihood of receiving an appropriate shock from an ICD placed for primary prevention. In the PROSE-ICD study, a prospective cohort of 1189 patients (447 African American, 712 non-African American) who underwent ICD implantation for primary prevention of sudden cardiac death (SCD) and were followed for an average of 5.1 years, African-American patients were significantly more like to die without receiving an appropriate ICD shock (hazard ratio 1.33 compared with non-African Americans, 95% CI 1.02-1.74) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/incidence-of-and-risk-stratification-for-sudden-cardiac-death-after-acute-myocardial-infarction/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. While some of this risk may have been attributable to baseline differences in comorbidities between the two groups, additional data are needed to aid in determining the optimal candidates for prophylactic ICD insertion.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">LV dysfunction</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Left ventricular (LV) dysfunction, as measured by the LVEF, is one of the most powerful predictors of mortality at six months (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F75743\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef75743 \">figure 1</a>) and one year after acute MI [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/incidence-of-and-risk-stratification-for-sudden-cardiac-death-after-acute-myocardial-infarction/abstract/18-21\" class=\"abstract_t\">18-21</a>]. The higher rate of mortality includes an increase in SCD.

Inducibility appears to be less common in the primary reperfusion era, however, when present, still predicts an increased risk of SCD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/incidence-of-and-risk-stratification-for-sudden-cardiac-death-after-acute-myocardial-infarction/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h3\">Role in severe LV dysfunction</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In MUSTT and MADIT I, patients with at least moderate LV dysfunction, NSVT and inducible VT or VF had survival benefit with ICD therapy. However, later trials limited to patients with more severe LV dysfunction, MADIT II (LVEF &le;30 percent) and SCD-HeFT (LVEF &le;35 percent and NYHA class II or III heart failure), showed benefit with ICD therapy regardless of NSVT or inducibility.</p><p>Although severe LV dysfunction alone identifies patients at high SCD risk, it is not clear if inducible VT or VF may identify those at even higher risk. This question was addressed in two retrospective analyses:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>An analysis from the MUSTT trial evaluated the prognostic value of inducibility in patients with an LVEF below 30 percent compared to those with an LVEF &ge;30 percent but &le;40 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/incidence-of-and-risk-stratification-for-sudden-cardiac-death-after-acute-myocardial-infarction/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>]. The rate of arrhythmic death at five years was not significantly increased if VT was inducible when the LVEF was &lt;30 percent (40 versus 31 percent) but was significantly increased at higher ejection fractions (30 versus 17 percent). It was suggested by the authors that EPS may have predictive value in patients with ejection fractions &ge;30 percent but &le;40 percent. However, the magnitude of the difference in risk for the two groups was similar (9 percent for LVEF &lt;30 percent, 13 percent for LVEF &ge;30 percent), suggesting that the perceived difference in the utility of EPS may have resulted from the study being underpowered (ie, it had too few patients to detect a significant difference of that magnitude).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a substudy from the MADIT II trial, EP study was performed in 593 of the 720 patients randomly assigned to ICD therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/incidence-of-and-risk-stratification-for-sudden-cardiac-death-after-acute-myocardial-infarction/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>].

Similar patterns were reported with strict and broad definitions but, in multivariate analysis, only the strict definition of inducibility predicted overall arrhythmic risk.</p><p>The reason that inducible VT had an inverse relationship with VF events is not known. The authors suggested that the rates of arrhythmic events in this high-risk population would be similar regardless of inducibility. In those patients with demonstrable substrate for monomorphic VT, arrhythmic triggers would produce this arrhythmia, while those without such substrate would degenerate quickly to VF.</p><p>The time since the MI may also have contributed to dissociation between VT and VF risk. Patients with inducible VT were an average of 90 months post-MI, while those with other arrhythmias or who were not inducible were an average of 34 to 61 months post-MI. Thus, inducible VT may have identified a cohort of &quot;selected survivors&quot; who were at lower risk for VF.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h2\">VPBs on monitoring</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Ventricular premature beats, particularly if frequent (more than 10 per hour) or complex, appear to be associated with a worse prognosis in patients with a prior MI.

Early VF alone does not appear to predict adverse late outcomes, but this may not apply to early sustained monomorphic VT.</p><p>Among patients with a prior infarction, monomorphic VT is usually due to reentry in a region of scar and fibrosis, which represents permanent arrhythmic substrate.

Most of the trials demonstrating mortality benefit with ICD therapy in the primary prevention of SCD enrolled patients with multiple risk factors.

Although each of these trials demonstrated mortality benefit with ICD therapy in their respective populations, the absolute benefit was lower than that seen in the earlier MUSTT and MADIT I trials, suggesting that within the population encompassed by MADIT II and SCD-HeFT inclusion criteria are subsets of patients at lower risk.

Patients in the highest BP quartiles (ie, systolic BP &gt;130 mmHg or diastolic BP &ge;80 mmHg) had a lower incidence of SCD than those with lower baseline BP.

(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=primary-prevention-of-sudden-cardiac-death-in-heart-failure-and-cardiomyopathy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Primary prevention of sudden cardiac death in heart failure and cardiomyopathy&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>With regard to primary prevention of sudden cardiac death (SCD), the most important initial parameter is left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>We recommend that LV function should be assessed in the time period when an ICD may be indicated (ie, after 40 days). If a low LVEF was documented earlier, it should be reassessed at this time. (See <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'LV dysfunction'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Further risk stratification is largely based upon the LVEF (see <a href=\"#H18\" class=\"local\">'Risk stratification strategies'</a> above):</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>No further risk stratification is required for patients in whom an ICD is indicated for primary prevention of SCD: those with an LVEF &le;30 percent (MADIT II criteria) or those who satisfy SCD-HEFT criteria (ischemic cardiomyopathy, LVEF &le;35 percent, NYHA II or III HF).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>For patients with an LVEF &gt;40 percent, we recommend <strong>no</strong> further risk stratification, since such patients are unlikely to meet indications for an ICD.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>For patients with an LVEF of 31 to 40 percent, we do not routinely proceed with further risk stratification. However, periodic Holter monitoring (once or twice a year) is a reasonable approach, with the understanding that patients found to have nonsustained ventricular tachycardia should be referred for invasive electrophysiology (EP) study.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The indications for ICD implantation are discussed in detail elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=primary-prevention-of-sudden-cardiac-death-in-heart-failure-and-cardiomyopathy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Primary prevention of sudden cardiac death in heart failure and cardiomyopathy&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A number of additional risk factors are associated with the risk of SCD after an acute myocardial infarction, including microvolt T wave alternans, signal-averaged ECG, and heart rate variability. However, because the results of these studies do not usually affect management decisions, we do not recommend their routine use. Such studies may provide additional insight into a given patient's arrhythmic risk, but data do not support using this information to guide decisions regarding ICD or antiarrhythmic drug therapy. (See <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'Risk factors'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Despite the limited data, some experts would consider EP study in patients with an abnormality in one or more of these parameters who do not meet criteria for ICD therapy (eg, LVEF &gt;40 percent, or LVEF 30 to 40 percent without heart failure or NSVT). A clearly positive EP study may provide an indication for an ICD. (See <a href=\"#H18\" class=\"local\">'Risk stratification strategies'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Controversy continues regarding the need for ICD placement in all patients who meet current indications. Due to the preliminary nature of the data in patients who currently meet criteria for an ICD, we do <strong>not</strong> recommend further testing for the purpose of selecting low-risk patients who do not need an ICD.
