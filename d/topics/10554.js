Neutropenia is usually defined (and defined herein) as an absolute neutrophil count (ANC) &lt;1500 <span class=\"nowrap\">cells/microL</span> (&lt;1.5 x 10<sup>9</sup><span class=\"nowrap\">/L)</span> in an adult. The ANC is equal to the product of the white blood cell (WBC) count and the percentage of neutrophils from the WBC differential (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=calculator-absolute-neutrophil-count\" class=\"calc calc_professional\">calculator 1</a>). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=approach-to-the-adult-with-unexplained-neutropenia#H1006808\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Approach to the adult with unexplained neutropenia&quot;, section on 'Definitions and normal values'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H957856\"><span class=\"h1\">INFECTIOUS RISK STRATIFICATION</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H960026\"><span class=\"h2\">Overview of risk stratification</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The most important factor in managing a patient with neutropenia is determining the patient's risk of developing an infection and ability to respond to a severe infection. While most clinicians are familiar with the uniformly high risk of infection in those with chemotherapy-induced neutropenia, the risk of infection in those with non-chemotherapy-induced neutropenia can be quite variable, ranging from no increased risk to severe, life-threatening risk. Details of the evaluation of adults with unexplained neutropenia are presented separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=approach-to-the-adult-with-unexplained-neutropenia\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Approach to the adult with unexplained neutropenia&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The main determinant of the infectious risk in patients with non-chemotherapy-induced neutropenia is the adequacy of the bone marrow neutrophil reserve (ie, the ability of the bone marrow to produce neutrophils) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F71724\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef71724 \">table 1</a>). As a general rule, patients with an adequate bone marrow reserve may have chronic, non-life-threatening infections or no infections, while those with inadequate bone marrow reserve are at high risk of severe infection and sepsis. (See <a href=\"#H960033\" class=\"local\">'Bone marrow evaluation'</a> below.)</p><p>The ability of the bone marrow to produce adequate neutrophils can be assessed directly by bone marrow examination, or indirectly from clinical findings that suggest adequate delivery of neutrophils to the tissues. (See <a href=\"#H960033\" class=\"local\">'Bone marrow evaluation'</a> below and <a href=\"#H960062\" class=\"local\">'Clinical features'</a> below.)</p><p>However, a patient may develop an infection before the adequacy of the bone marrow reserve is known. If a patient first presents with fever (ie, a single oral temperature &gt;38.3&deg;C [101&deg;F] or &gt;38.0&deg;C [100.4&deg;F] sustained for &gt;1 hour) and neutropenia of unknown cause, one must assume that the patient has inadequate marrow reserve and is at high risk. (See <a href=\"#H15213234\" class=\"local\">'Patients with inadequate bone marrow reserve'</a> below.)</p><p>Another factor that can increase infectious risk is the presence of disease states such as vasculitis and defective cellular immunity, which sometimes accompany neutropenia. The severity of these conditions can increase infectious risk independently of the bone marrow ability to produce neutrophils or the severity of the neutropenia. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=the-adaptive-cellular-immune-response\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;The adaptive cellular immune response&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=the-humoral-immune-response\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;The humoral immune response&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H960033\"><span class=\"h2\">Bone marrow evaluation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The gold standard for determining the adequacy of the bone marrow ability to produce neutrophils is examination of a bone marrow aspirate and biopsy specimen. Bone marrow examination is commonly performed in the course of the initial evaluation for patients with congenital neutropenias or pancytopenia. </p><p>Bone marrow neutrophil production is considered to be adequate if the cellularity and maturation of the neutrophil series is normal or increased. In contrast, reduced bone marrow cellularity or myeloid arrest at the myelocyte or metamyelocyte stage implies decreased bone marrow reserve. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-of-bone-marrow-aspirate-smears#H8\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation of bone marrow aspirate smears&quot;, section on 'Estimation of cellularity and myeloid to erythroid ratio'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=regulation-of-myelopoiesis#H4\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Regulation of myelopoiesis&quot;, section on 'Neutrophil production and maturation'</a>.)</p><p>Bone marrow sampling may not be necessary (or indicated) for those with mild or transient neutropenia, lack of infections, or infections associated with signs of adequate neutrophil delivery. In particular, in patients with longstanding mild neutropenia suggestive of constitutional neutropenia (eg, benign ethnic neutropenia), bone marrow examination is uniformly uninformative and need not be performed.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H960062\"><span class=\"h2\">Clinical features</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>For patients who have not had a bone marrow evaluation or in whom the bone marrow findings are equivocal, the following clinical features may be useful in predicting the bone marrow reserve <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> the presence of an active infection (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F62992\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef62992 \">table 2</a>):</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Purulent material or abscess formation suggests adequate bone marrow reserve and tissue delivery of neutrophils. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Markedly increased dental caries <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> ulcerations of the oral mucosa and severe gingivitis suggest an inability to deliver neutrophils.

This study evaluated the relationship between the frequency, severity, and duration of neutropenia during 125 episodes of severe neutropenia and 733 episodes of moderate neutropenia. Infections occurred in 80 percent of patients with severe neutropenia (ANC <span class=\"nowrap\">&lt;100/microL)</span> within two weeks of onset and in 100 percent at three weeks. However, it should be noted that patients in this study had leukemia and therefore had many reasons to have intercurrent infection related to the effects of chemotherapy on mucosal surfaces, indwelling intravenous catheters, and the other aspects of their disease and its treatment. </p><p>Patients with chronic idiopathic neutropenia may have a very benign course and tolerate an ANC &lt;100 <span class=\"nowrap\">cells/microL</span> without experiencing infectious episodes, but others may experience gingivitis and painful mouth ulcers requiring treatment with G-CSF.</p><p>In most cases, individuals with post-infectious neutropenia and neutropenia due to nutrient deficiencies will experience a rapid resolution of neutropenia once the infection resolves or the nutritional deficiency is corrected, and these individuals can be presumed to handle infections adequately once the neutrophil count begins to improve.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15213457\"><span class=\"h2\">Preventing infection</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1412561\"><span class=\"h3\">Overview of infection prevention</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The major means of preventing infection in those with inadequate bone marrow neutrophil reserve include reducing exposures and raising the neutrophil count with myeloid growth factors.</p><p>We also suggest the following in all patients:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Emphasize dental hygiene and regular dental care to prevent oral infections and bacteremia from an oral source.

Patients in this category include those with benign ethnic neutropenia, autoimmune neutropenia, drug-induced mild to moderate neutropenia that is dose-related and stable, splenic sequestration of neutrophils, and chronic idiopathic neutropenia without frequent infections. We monitor patients more frequently around the time of their initial diagnosis if we are unsure about whether a more severe deficiency may be evolving. (See <a href=\"#H957856\" class=\"local\">'Infectious risk stratification'</a> above.)</p><p>Most patients who are not experiencing frequent infections can have their complete blood count (CBC) with differential monitored on a periodic basis as an outpatient.
