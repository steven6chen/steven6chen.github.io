The clinical features and histopathologic appearance of ILD in DM and PM reflect the patterns of lung pathology associated with the idiopathic interstitial pneumonias, including nonspecific interstitial pneumonia, usual interstitial pneumonia, organizing pneumonia, and acute interstitial pneumonia. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=idiopathic-interstitial-pneumonias-clinical-manifestations-and-pathology\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Idiopathic interstitial pneumonias: Clinical manifestations and pathology&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The treatment of interstitial lung disease associated with DM and PM will be reviewed here.

While formal guidelines are not available, we observe patients without treatment in the setting of the following characteristics: mild dyspnea on exertion, &lt;10 percent involvement on high resolution computed tomography, forced vital capacity &gt;75 percent of predicted, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> diffusing capacity for carbon monoxide (DLCO) &gt;65 percent of predicted [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/interstitial-lung-disease-in-dermatomyositis-and-polymyositis-treatment/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. However, for other patients with a greater degree of respiratory impairment and more pronounced abnormalities on imaging and pulmonary function tests, immunosuppressive therapy for ILD is generally indicated. </p><p>For patients with DM or PM who are receiving immunosuppressive therapy for their myositis, it is essential to exclude infection or drug-induced pulmonary toxicity as causes of lung disease. In addition, patients with DM and PM are at increased risk of malignancy, including cancers involving the lungs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/interstitial-lung-disease-in-dermatomyositis-and-polymyositis-treatment/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Thus, it is prudent to ascertain that the patient has undergone appropriate cancer screening.

The choice of agent must take into account both the treatment for COP and the underlying myopathy. The treatment of COP is discussed separately.

High-dose intravenous glucocorticoids (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methylprednisolone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">methylprednisolone</a> 1 gram daily for three days) may be used at the start of therapy in addition to a second immunosuppressive agent for patients with impending respiratory failure due to rapidly progressive interstitial pneumonitis.

A favorable response includes a reduction in dyspnea and cough, radiographic clearing, and physiologic improvement, as assessed by forced vital capacity, total lung capacity, diffusion capacity for carbon monoxide, and both resting and exercise oxygen saturation.

For these patients, the goal is to maintain control of disease, using a regimen with the least toxicity possible. Flares of DM and PM may occur at any time, although they often do in the context of tapering immunosuppressive therapy.

The majority of patients with DM or PM who develop ILD have a clinical and histopathologic pattern of nonspecific interstitial pneumonia (NSIP) or organizing pneumonia (OP). (See <a href=\"#H473092486\" class=\"local\">'Approach to therapy'</a> above.) &#160;</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients with DM or PM who have radiographic ILD but are asymptomatic and have minimal reductions in lung volumes and diffusing capacity, we suggest a period of observation and serial assessment of clinical status and pulmonary function tests (PFTs). (See <a href=\"#H473092402\" class=\"local\">'Initial glucocorticoid therapy for NSIP'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients with DM or PM who develop symptomatic ILD, we recommend initiating systemic glucocorticoids or increasing the dose if the patient is already taking glucocorticoids for the myositis (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=2\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1B</a>). The usual starting dose is oral <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prednisone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">prednisone</a> at a dose of 1 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> ideal body weight per day to a maximum daily dose of 80 mg. High-dose intravenous glucocorticoids (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methylprednisolone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">methylprednisolone</a> 1 gram daily for three days) may be used at the start of therapy for patients with impending respiratory failure due to rapidly progressive interstitial pneumonitis. (See <a href=\"#H473092402\" class=\"local\">'Initial glucocorticoid therapy for NSIP'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients with ILD and DM or PM have a high likelihood of requiring a second agent to control the ILD or enable tapering of glucocorticoids. We suggest adding a second immunosuppressive agent from the outset of therapy (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). <a href=\"topic.htm?path=azathioprine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Azathioprine</a> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=mycophenolate-mofetil-cellcept-and-enteric-coated-mycophenolate-sodium-myfortic-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">mycophenolate</a> are the &quot;second agents&quot; used most often. (See <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Adding a second agent'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients with severe and rapidly progressive ILD, defined as significant pulmonary dysfunction and extensive chest radiographic findings at baseline, we suggest adding a second agent to the systemic glucocorticoids rather than administering glucocorticoids alone (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=2\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1B</a>). We generally choose <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cyclophosphamide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cyclophosphamide</a> in this setting.
