TSH secretion, in turn, is controlled through negative feedback by thyroid hormones (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=thyroid-hormone-synthesis-and-physiology\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Thyroid hormone synthesis and physiology&quot;</a>). There is a negative log-linear relationship between serum free T4 and TSH concentrations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/laboratory-assessment-of-thyroid-function/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. This means that very small changes in serum free T4 concentrations induce very large reciprocal changes in serum TSH concentrations. As a result, thyroid function is best assessed by measuring serum TSH, assuming steady-state conditions and the absence of pituitary or hypothalamic disease. Nevertheless, direct measurement of serum thyroid hormone levels is still important in many patients since it may be difficult in some patients to be certain about the state of pituitary and hypothalamic function.</p><p>This topic review will provide an overview of thyroid function testing. More detailed discussions of serum TSH and free thyroid hormone measurements, abnormalities in thyroid hormone binding proteins, and the effects of drugs and nonthyroidal illness on thyroid function tests are discussed separately.

Since the normal range for serum TSH is approximately 0.4 to 5.0 <span class=\"nowrap\">mU/L,</span> these assays were useful for the diagnosis of primary hypothyroidism (in which serum TSH concentrations are appropriately elevated) but were not sufficiently sensitive to distinguish between normal serum TSH concentrations and the low serum TSH concentrations present in most patients with hyperthyroidism.</p><p>Second-generation TSH immunometric assays have detection limits of approximately 0.1 <span class=\"nowrap\">mU/L</span>. Since this detection limit is just below the normal range for TSH of approximately 0.4 to 5.0 <span class=\"nowrap\">mU/L,</span> these assays can be used as screening tests to distinguish hyperthyroidism from euthyroidism and hypothyroidism [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/laboratory-assessment-of-thyroid-function/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. However, since the range of subnormal TSH measurement is very limited, values near or at the detection limit do not distinguish the degree of hyperthyroidism, and poor quality control in many laboratories can lead to erroneous values [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/laboratory-assessment-of-thyroid-function/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].</p><p>Third-generation TSH chemiluminometric assays, currently in wide use, have detection limits of approximately 0.01 <span class=\"nowrap\">mU/L</span>. They can therefore provide detectable TSH measurements even in mild hyperthyroidism [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/laboratory-assessment-of-thyroid-function/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. Because of the considerably lower detection limit, even with poor quality control, serum TSH values in patients with overt hyperthyroidism are easily distinguished from those in euthyroid patients. In order to reliably detect values of serum TSH in the hyperthyroid range, one needs a third-generation assay with a functional sensitivity of at least &le;0.05 <span class=\"nowrap\">mU/L</span>. As an example, second-generation methods will often give values well over 0.1 <span class=\"nowrap\">mU/L</span> when the true value is 0.03 <span class=\"nowrap\">mU/L,</span> a typical hyperthyroid value, and can thus lead to a false negative test [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/laboratory-assessment-of-thyroid-function/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. Third-generation values &lt;0.1 <span class=\"nowrap\">mU/L</span> are, however, generally reliable.</p><p>Presently there is considerable controversy as to the appropriate upper limit of normal for serum TSH. Most laboratories have used values of approximately 4.5 to 5.0 <span class=\"nowrap\">mU/L</span>. A monograph published by the National Academy of Clinical Biochemistry argues that the upper limit of normal of the euthyroid reference range should be reduced to 2.5 <span class=\"nowrap\">mU/L</span> because 95 percent of rigorously screened euthyroid volunteers have serum values between 0.4 and 2.5 <span class=\"nowrap\">mU/L</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/laboratory-assessment-of-thyroid-function/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. However, a population study from Germany, which excluded patients with a positive family history, goiter, nodules, or positive antithyroid peroxidase (TPO) antibodies, found a normal reference range of 0.3 to 3.63 <span class=\"nowrap\">mU/L</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/laboratory-assessment-of-thyroid-function/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. The use of 2.5 <span class=\"nowrap\">mU/L</span> as the upper limit of normal for serum TSH will increase substantially the number of patients in the United States diagnosed with subclinical hypothyroidism. Presently, controversy exists as to whether patients with serum TSH values between 5 and 10 <span class=\"nowrap\">mU/L</span> require treatment (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=subclinical-hypothyroidism-in-nonpregnant-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Subclinical hypothyroidism in nonpregnant adults&quot;</a>). Until there are data demonstrating an adverse biologic significance for serum TSH values between 2.5 and 5.0 <span class=\"nowrap\">mU/L,</span> the wisdom of labeling such patients as hypothyroid is questionable.</p><p>Age-based normal ranges for TSH are important, as illustrated by an analysis of 16,533 individuals in the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey III (NHANES III) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/laboratory-assessment-of-thyroid-function/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. In this report, there was an age-related shift towards higher TSH concentrations in older patients, which persisted when those with positive antithyroid antibodies were excluded. For example, the 97.5 centile for TSH in subjects aged 20 to 29 years or over age 80 was 3.56 and 7.49 <span class=\"nowrap\">mU/L,</span> respectively. Seventy percent of subjects in the older group with a TSH greater than 4.5 <span class=\"nowrap\">mU/L</span> were within the normal range for their age. Similar age-associated increases in serum TSH concentrations were found in other prospective cohort studies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/laboratory-assessment-of-thyroid-function/abstract/9-11\" class=\"abstract_t\">9-11</a>]. A weight-related shift in the reference range for TSH among obese and morbidly obese patients has also been reported [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/laboratory-assessment-of-thyroid-function/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Serum T4 and T3</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Serum total thyroxine (T4) is usually measured by RIA, chemiluminometric assay, or similar immunometric technique. Virtually all (99.97 percent) of serum T4 is bound to TBG (thyroxine-binding globulin), transthyretin (also called TBPA [thyroxine-binding prealbumin]), or albumin. Serum total T4 assays measure both bound and unbound (&quot;free&quot;) T4. Normal ranges vary among laboratories; a typical range is 4.6 to 11.2 <span class=\"nowrap\">mcg/dL</span> (60 to 145 <span class=\"nowrap\">nmol/L)</span>.</p><p>Serum triiodothyronine (T3) is also measured by RIA, chemiluminometric assay, or other immunometric assay. T3 is less tightly bound to TBG and TBPA but more tightly bound to albumin than T4. The normal range is even more variable among laboratories than that for total T4; a typical range is approximately 75 to 195 <span class=\"nowrap\">ng/dL</span> (1.1 to 3 <span class=\"nowrap\">nmol/L)</span>.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Serum free T4 and free T3</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The free hormone hypothesis states that the unbound or free hormone is that which is available for uptake into cells and interaction with nuclear receptors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/laboratory-assessment-of-thyroid-function/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. The bound hormone, on the other hand, represents a circulating storage pool that is not immediately available for uptake into cells.</p><p>Since drugs and illness can alter concentrations of binding proteins or interaction of the binding proteins with thyroxine (T4) or triiodothyronine (T3) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F50439\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef50439 \">table 2</a>), the free and total hormone concentrations may not be concordant. An example is estrogen-induced TBG excess in which total T4 concentrations are high due to increased TBG-bound hormone, but the physiologically important free T4 concentrations are normal (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=euthyroid-hyperthyroxinemia-and-hypothyroxinemia\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Euthyroid hyperthyroxinemia and hypothyroxinemia&quot;</a>). It is therefore necessary to estimate free hormone concentrations.</p><p>Four different tests have been used to estimate the free T4: equilibrium dialysis, &quot;direct&quot; free hormone measurements, calculating the free hormone index by using the thyroid hormone-binding ratio or index (THBR or THBI) via measurement of the T3-resin uptake, and calculating the ratio of total thyroid hormone to TBG levels [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/laboratory-assessment-of-thyroid-function/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. Because none of these methods measure free T4 directly, guidelines suggest that these methods be named &quot;free T4 estimate tests&quot; [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/laboratory-assessment-of-thyroid-function/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].</p><p>Measurement of free T4 by equilibrium dialysis is available only in a few reference laboratories. The classic technique measures the distribution of free T4 at equilibrium across a dialysis membrane to estimate the unbound fraction. The method is too tedious and expensive for routine use. Thus, most laboratories measure free T4 using only two of the four methods:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>&quot;Direct&quot; free T4 &ndash; &quot;Direct&quot; free T4 measurements are most common since they can be automated. Varying methodologies have been used by commercial laboratories [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/laboratory-assessment-of-thyroid-function/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]; however, none of these actually measure unbound T4 directly, since free hormone represents only 0.03 percent of serum total T4. The perceived advantage of direct free T4 measurement is that confusion related to binding protein abnormalities is mitigated by providing values that allegedly take binding abnormalities into account. The disadvantage is that no currently available assay provides correct free T4 values for all the binding abnormalities that have been described. Direct free T4 measurements may be unreliable during pregnancy (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-thyroid-disease-in-pregnancy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of thyroid disease in pregnancy&quot;</a>). The normal range also varies with the methodology used.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Direct T3 measurements are also available but have limited utility and are less reliable.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Free T4 index &ndash; Calculation of the free T4 index has the advantage that the clinician is given both a total T4 and a THBR or THBI, making it clear when the patient has a potential binding protein abnormality. The disadvantages are: (1) the calculation is poorly understood by many clinicians, and (2) the free T4 index, as with direct free T4 measurements, fails to give correct values for many described binding protein abnormalities. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=euthyroid-hyperthyroxinemia-and-hypothyroxinemia\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Euthyroid hyperthyroxinemia and hypothyroxinemia&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">T3-resin uptake</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The triiodothyronine (T3)-resin uptake is the traditional test utilized to calculate the free hormone index. This test is performed by incubating the patient's serum with radiolabeled T3 tracer and subsequently adding an insoluble resin that traps the remaining unbound radiolabeled T3. A typical resin is dextran-coated charcoal. The value reported is the percent tracer bound to the resin, which varies inversely with the number of available free binding sites for T3. The number of free binding sites is determined by both binding protein levels and endogenous hormone production.</p><p>The normal range varies considerably among laboratories. While many laboratories still report the actual measured value for the T3 resin, it is preferable to calculate a THBR or THBI, which is simply a normalized T3-resin uptake value [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/laboratory-assessment-of-thyroid-function/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]:</p><div class=\"formulaContainer\"><div class=\"formula\"><p> &#160;THBI &#160;= &#160;patient's T3 resin &#160;&divide; &#160;normal pool T3 resin</p></div></div><p>The mean THBI is, therefore, by definition 1.00, with a normal range of approximately 0.83 to 1.16.</p><p>The free T4 index approximates the free T4 by dialysis and is calculated by &quot;correcting&quot; the total T4 by the binding ratio or index:</p><div class=\"formulaContainer\"><div class=\"formula\"><p> &#160;Free T4 index &#160;= &#160;total T4 &#160;x &#160;THBI</p></div></div><p>If the index is calculated by using the T3-resin measurement directly, the result is a unitless number with a normal range distinct for the laboratory.

However, some experts recommend that both serum TSH and free T4 be measured in all patients for screening purposes since errors may be made when only TSH is measured in patients with secondary or central hypothyroidism or TSH-mediated hyperthyroidism.</p><p>This approach adds considerable cost to screening and is likely to pick up few cases of unsuspected pituitary disease.

Knowing that the half-life of thyroxine is approximately one week, measurement of serum free T4 after two or three half-lives, as an example, might allow one to make gross adjustments in the levothyroxine dose even though the serum TSH has not yet had time to fully equilibrate.</p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=liothyronine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Liothyronine</a> (T3, Cytomel) is generally not recommended for treating hypothyroidism. However, in patients with persistent hypothyroid symptoms on <a href=\"topic.htm?path=levothyroxine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">levothyroxine</a>, T3 is sometimes added. If the ratio of T4-to-T3 administered is below 10:1 (normal ratio approximately 14:1), assessment of therapy requires measurement of serum T3 and TSH since serum T4 will remain low. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-primary-hypothyroidism-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of primary hypothyroidism in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h2\">Monitoring treatment of hyperthyroidism</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Serum T3 concentrations are disproportionately higher than serum T4 concentrations in many types of hyperthyroidism. As a result, serum T3 measurements may be valuable for evaluating and following patients with this disorder. Serum TSH measurements are useful for the diagnosis of hyperthyroidism, but they are unable to distinguish the degree of hyperthyroidism since suppression occurs in the early stages of the disease (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=subclinical-hyperthyroidism-in-nonpregnant-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Subclinical hyperthyroidism in nonpregnant adults&quot;</a>). During the early treatment of hyperthyroidism, serum TSH may remain subnormal for several weeks and rarely for several months. One must therefore rely upon serum free T4 and T3 measurements when assessing the efficacy of antithyroid drugs, radioiodine, or surgery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/laboratory-assessment-of-thyroid-function/abstract/16,28\" class=\"abstract_t\">16,28</a>]. Once steady-state conditions are assured, measurement of serum TSH is required to assess the efficacy of therapy.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h1\">ANTITHYROID ANTIBODIES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Several antibodies against thyroid antigens have been described in chronic autoimmune thyroiditis. The antigens include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Thyroglobulin (Tg, formerly known as the colloid antigen)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Thyroid peroxidase (TPO, formerly known as the microsomal antigen)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The TSH receptor</p><p/><p>Tg is synthesized by follicular cells and secreted into the lumen of the thyroid follicle, where it is stored as colloid. TPO catalyzes the iodination of tyrosine&nbsp;residues of Tg to form monoiodotyrosine and diiodotyrosine. Nearly all patients with Hashimoto's thyroiditis have high serum concentrations of antibodies to Tg and TPO. Thyrotropin receptor antibodies (TRAb) have been classified as stimulating, blocking, or neutral. TRAb of the stimulating variety (thyroid-stimulating immunoglobulins [TSI]) cause Graves' disease. However, both thyrotropin receptor-blocking and -stimulating antibodies are seen in patients with Graves' disease. Thyrotropin receptor-blocking antibodies may also be seen in patients with atrophic Hashimoto's thyroiditis. The role of these antibodies in the pathogenesis of autoimmune thyroid disease is reviewed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pathogenesis-of-graves-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pathogenesis of Graves' disease&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pathogenesis-of-hashimotos-thyroiditis-chronic-autoimmune-thyroiditis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pathogenesis of Hashimoto's thyroiditis (chronic autoimmune thyroiditis)&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Routine measurement of antithyroid antibodies is not necessary for the assessment of thyroid function. As an example, serum anti-TPO antibodies need not be measured in patients with overt primary hypothyroidism, because almost all have chronic autoimmune thyroiditis. However, a test for anti-TPO antibodies may be useful to predict the likelihood of progression to permanent overt hypothyroidism in patients with subclinical hypothyroidism. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=subclinical-hypothyroidism-in-nonpregnant-adults#H7\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Subclinical hypothyroidism in nonpregnant adults&quot;, section on 'Identifying the cause'</a>.)</p><p>Measurement of TRAb is unnecessary for establishing the cause of hyperthyroidism if a radioiodine uptake has been obtained. However, TRAb measurements are being used increasingly as an alternative to obtaining a radioiodine uptake scan when Graves' disease is suspected. TRAb measurements are also useful for assessing the likelihood of remission after a course of antithyroid drugs in patients with Graves' disease. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diagnosis-of-hyperthyroidism#H19\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Diagnosis of hyperthyroidism&quot;, section on 'Determining the etiology'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=postpartum-thyroiditis#H8\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Postpartum thyroiditis&quot;, section on 'Differential diagnosis'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=thionamides-in-the-treatment-of-graves-disease#H1090206230\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Thionamides in the treatment of Graves' disease&quot;, section on 'Evaluation prior to stopping therapy'</a>.)</p><p>There are two methods for measuring TRAb. Third-generation TSH receptor-binding inhibitor immunoglobulin (TBII or TBI) assays measure inhibition of binding of labeled monoclonal anti-human TSH receptor antibody, or labeled TSH, to recombinant human TSH (rhTSH) receptor. TSI assays measure cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) production, or other molecular markers, from Chinese hamster ovary cells transfected with modified rhTSH-receptors. Older TSI assays were more specific but less sensitive than TBII assays, but third-generation assays have a sensitivity of 97 percent and a specificity of 99 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/laboratory-assessment-of-thyroid-function/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"PATIENT_INFORMATION\"><span class=\"h1\">INFORMATION FOR PATIENTS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>UpToDate offers two types of patient education materials, &quot;The Basics&quot; and &quot;Beyond the Basics.&quot; The Basics patient education pieces are written in plain language, at the 5<sup>th</sup> to 6<sup>th</sup> grade reading level, and they answer the four or five key questions a patient might have about a given condition.
