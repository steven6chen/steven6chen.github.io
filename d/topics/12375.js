Endometrioid carcinoma is the common site and histologic subtype of endometrial carcinoma and of uterine cancer overall. Endometrioid tumors tend to have a favorable prognosis and typically present at an early stage with abnormal uterine bleeding. Other histologic types of endometrial carcinoma (eg, serous, clear cell) as well as other types of uterine cancer are associated with a poor prognosis.</p><p>An overview of endometrial carcinoma will be presented here.

The mortality rate was 1.7 to 2.4 per 100,000 women. In the United States, as with other developed countries, uterine cancer was the most common gynecologic malignancy, with over 60,000 new cases and over 10,000 deaths from the disease in each year [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-endometrial-carcinoma/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. </p><p>Women in the US have a 2.8 percent lifetime risk of being diagnosed with uterine cancer [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-endometrial-carcinoma/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. The average age of diagnosis of uterine cancer in the US is 62 years old. Among new cases, 34.5 percent were in women ages 55 to 64 years. </p><p>The majority of women with uterine cancer are diagnosed at an early stage: confined to primary site (67 percent); spread to regional organs and lymph nodes (21 percent); and distant metastases (8 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-endometrial-carcinoma/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. </p><p>Endometrial adenocarcinoma is the most common site and type of uterine cancer.

Among endometrial carcinomas, there are two histologic categories, which differ in incidence, responsiveness to estrogens, and clinical behavior [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-endometrial-carcinoma/abstract/4,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,5</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Type I tumors include tumors of endometrioid histology that are grade 1 or 2; these comprise approximately 80 percent of endometrial carcinomas. These tumors typically have a favorable prognosis, are estrogen-responsive, and may be preceded by an intraepithelial neoplasm (atypical <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> complex endometrial hyperplasia). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=classification-and-diagnosis-of-endometrial-hyperplasia\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Classification and diagnosis of endometrial hyperplasia&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Type II tumors account for 10 to 20 percent of endometrial carcinomas. They include grade 3 endometrioid tumors as well as tumors of non-endometrioid histology: serous, clear cell, mucinous, squamous, transitional cell, mesonephric, and undifferentiated. Other histologic types of uterine cancer are discussed separately.

Women with type I endometrial cancers often have a thickened endometrial stripe on pelvic ultrasound. Other risk factors include <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tamoxifen-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">tamoxifen</a> therapy, obesity, nulliparity, diabetes mellitus, and hypertension. Risk factors are presented in the table (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F62089\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef62089 \">table 1</a>). </p><p>Risk factors for type II endometrial carcinomas (serous and clear cell) are discussed in detail separately.

Cytoreduction often is performed when metastases are evident. Staging is typically performed via a minimally invasive route, with robotic-assisted laparoscopy or conventional laparoscopy being the most common routes for surgical extirpation. Additional routes (laparotomy or vaginal) are often tailored to each patient's pathology.</p><p>Staging and surgical treatment of endometrial carcinoma are discussed in detail separately.

Other factors may also impact adjuvant therapy decisions (eg, lower uterine segment involvement, positive peritoneal cytology). General principles of adjuvant therapy for endometrial carcinoma are discussed separately.

A thorough evaluation prior to medical therapy (eg, dilation and curettage, imaging studies) is necessary to try to confirm that the lesion is confined to the uterus and is grade 1 or 2. However, an important consideration is that women who were presumed to have low-risk disease may ultimately have high-risk features at the time of hysterectomy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-endometrial-carcinoma/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. Fertility preservation for women with endometrial carcinoma is discussed in detail separately.

Fortunately, most women with endometrial carcinoma have a favorable prognosis, since the majority of patients have endometrioid histology and present with early-stage disease. (See <a href=\"#H4678240\" class=\"local\">'Epidemiology'</a> above.)</p><p>In general, the rate of five-year survival for stage I disease is approximately 80 to 90 percent, for stage II it is 70 to 80 percent, and for stages III and IV it is 20 to 60 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-endometrial-carcinoma/abstract/10,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,11</a>].
