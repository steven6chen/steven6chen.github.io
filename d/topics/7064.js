They can make you pass out, or move or behave strangely. &quot;Febrile&quot; means that the seizure is caused by a fever. Febrile seizures occur in children ages 3 months to 6 years old. They often run in families.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H17481636\"><span class=\"h1\">How do I know if my child has a fever?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>To find out if your child has a fever, take his or her temperature. The most accurate way is to take a rectal temperature (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F74460\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef74460 \">figure 1</a>). A rectal temperature higher than 100.4&deg;F (38&deg;C) is a fever.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H17481643\"><span class=\"h1\">What are the symptoms of a febrile seizure?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>During a febrile seizure, the child usually passes out and has jerking movements of the arms, legs, or face. Most febrile seizures last less than 5 minutes. After a seizure, the child might be confused or sleepy for a short time.</p><p>Although not as common, some febrile seizures last more than 15 minutes. After a longer seizure, a child can have short-term weakness in his or her arm or leg.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H17481650\"><span class=\"h1\">How can I help my child during a seizure?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>During a seizure, you should:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Put your child on his or her side</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Not put anything in your child's mouth or try to stop the jerking movements</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Keep track of how long the seizure lasts &ndash; If it lasts more than 5 minutes, <strong>call for an ambulance (in the US and Canada, dial 9-1-1)</strong>.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H17481657\"><span class=\"h1\">Does my child need to see a doctor or nurse?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Yes. Take your child to the doctor or nurse as soon as possible. He or she will want to make sure that your child's fever isn't caused by a serious infection. To do this, your doctor or nurse might need to do tests.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H17481664\"><span class=\"h1\">How are febrile seizures treated?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>If a febrile seizure stops on its own, it does not need to be treated. If a febrile seizure lasts more than 15 minutes, a doctor might need to use anti-seizure medicines to stop it.</p><p>Your child might also get other treatments, such as:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Medicines to bring down his or her fever</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Medicines to treat the infection that is causing the fever (if the fever is caused by an infection)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Fluids to treat dehydration (if the infection is causing vomiting or diarrhea)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H17481671\"><span class=\"h1\">Will my child have more febrile seizures?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>It's possible. Children who have 1 febrile seizure have a higher chance of having another. Talk with your doctor or nurse about how to treat any fevers that your child gets in the future.</p><p>If your child keeps having febrile seizures, your doctor might prescribe medicine so that you can treat your child's seizures at home.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H17481678\"><span class=\"h1\">Does a febrile seizure cause brain damage?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>No. A febrile seizure does not cause brain damage. It also does not mean that your child will have a life-long seizure condition.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H17481685\"><span class=\"h1\">More on this topic</span></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=seizures-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Seizures (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=fever-in-children-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Fever in children (The Basics)</a></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=febrile-seizures-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Febrile seizures (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=seizures-in-children-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Seizures in children (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-seizures-in-children-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Treatment of seizures in children (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=fever-in-children-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Fever in children (Beyond the Basics)</a></p></div><div id=\"reviewProcess\"><span>All topics are updated as new evidence becomes available and our <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/home/editorial-policy\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"policy policy_editorialpolicy\">peer review process</a> is complete.</span></div><div id=\"topicRetrievedDate\"><span class=\"emphasis\">This topic retrieved from UpToDate on: </span>Apr 02, 2018.</div><div id=\"disclaimer\">The content on the UpToDate website is not intended nor recommended as a substitute for medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.
