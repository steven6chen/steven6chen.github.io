The immune response can be directed towards the myelin or the axon of peripheral nerve, resulting in demyelinating and axonal forms of GBS.

While all age groups are affected, the incidence increases by approximately 20 percent with every 10-year increase in age beyond the first decade of life. In addition, the incidence is slightly greater in males than in females.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL FEATURES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The cardinal clinical features of Guillain-Barr&eacute; syndrome (GBS) are progressive, fairly symmetric muscle weakness accompanied by absent or depressed deep tendon reflexes. Patients usually present a few days to a week after onset of symptoms. The weakness can vary from mild difficulty with walking to nearly complete paralysis of all extremity, facial, respiratory, and bulbar muscles.</p><p>Studies from the United States and Europe, reflecting primarily patients with acute inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy (AIDP), show that GBS is associated with the following clinical features [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/guillain-barre-syndrome-in-adults-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/3,4\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,4</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The weakness usually starts in the legs, but it begins in the arms or facial muscles in about 10 percent of patients.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Severe respiratory muscle weakness necessitating ventilatory support develops in 10 to 30 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/guillain-barre-syndrome-in-adults-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Facial nerve palsies occur in more than 50 percent, and oropharyngeal weakness eventually occurs in 50 percent.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Oculomotor weakness occurs in about 15 percent of patients.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Decreased or absent reflexes in affected arms or legs are found in approximately 90 percent of patients at presentation and in all patients with disease progression [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/guillain-barre-syndrome-in-adults-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Paresthesias in the hands and feet accompany the weakness in more than 80 percent of patients, but sensory abnormalities on examination are frequently mild.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pain due to nerve root inflammation, typically located in the back and extremities, can be a presenting feature and is reported during the acute phase by two-thirds of patients with all forms of GBS [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/guillain-barre-syndrome-in-adults-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/6,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,7</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Dysautonomia occurs in approximately 70 percent of patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/guillain-barre-syndrome-in-adults-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. In a study of data from the US Nationwide Inpatient Sample during 2010-2011, manifestations of autonomic dysfunction that were more common in patients with GBS (n = 2587) compared with controls (10,348) included <span class=\"nowrap\">diarrhea/constipation</span> (16 versus 5 percent), hyponatremia (15 versus 7 percent), bradycardia (5 versus 3 percent), urinary retention (4 versus 2 percent), tachycardia (3 versus 1 percent), reversible cardiomyopathy (1 versus 0 percent), and Horner syndrome (1 versus 0 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/guillain-barre-syndrome-in-adults-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. Severe autonomic dysfunction is important to recognize since this is occasionally associated with sudden death [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/guillain-barre-syndrome-in-adults-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion (SIADH), which may be due to autonomic involvement, is another complication of GBS [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/guillain-barre-syndrome-in-adults-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/9,11,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,11,12</a>]. In the US Nationwide Inpatient Sample data, SIADH was significantly more frequent in hospitalized patients with GBS compared with controls (5 versus &lt;1 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/guillain-barre-syndrome-in-adults-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. </p><p>Unusual features of GBS include papilledema, facial myokymia, hearing loss, meningeal signs, vocal cord paralysis, and mental status changes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/guillain-barre-syndrome-in-adults-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. In addition, posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome, also known as reversible posterior leukoencephalopathy syndrome (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=reversible-posterior-leukoencephalopathy-syndrome\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Reversible posterior leukoencephalopathy syndrome&quot;</a>), has been associated with GBS in adults and children, likely related to acute hypertension from dysautonomia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/guillain-barre-syndrome-in-adults-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/14-16\" class=\"abstract_t\">14-16</a>].</p><p>GBS usually progresses over a period of about two weeks. By four weeks after the initial symptoms, &gt;90 percent of GBS patients have reached the nadir of the disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/guillain-barre-syndrome-in-adults-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. Disease progression for more than eight weeks is consistent with the diagnosis of chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyradiculoneuropathy (CIDP).

This finding, called albuminocytologic dissociation, is present in up to 66 percent of patients with GBS at one week after onset of symptoms. (See <a href=\"#H11\" class=\"local\">'Cerebrospinal fluid analysis'</a> below.)</p><p>Electrodiagnostic studies (ie, electromyography and nerve conduction studies) may show evidence of an acute polyneuropathy with predominantly demyelinating features in acute inflammatory demyelinating polyradiculoneuropathy (AIDP), or predominantly axonal features in acute motor axonal neuropathy (AMAN) and acute sensorimotor axonal neuropathy (AMSAN).</p><p>Glycolipid antibodies may be associated with different forms or aspects of GBS (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=guillain-barre-syndrome-pathogenesis#H3\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Guillain-Barr&eacute; syndrome: Pathogenesis&quot;, section on 'Molecular mimicry'</a>). However, aside from the GQ1b antibody associated with the Miller Fisher variant of GBS, antibody testing has little or no role in the diagnosis of the more common GBS variants.</p><p>Laboratory testing for patients with GBS is discussed below. (See <a href=\"#H10\" class=\"local\">'Diagnostic evaluation'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h1\">GBS VARIANTS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Historically, the Guillain-Barr&eacute; syndrome (GBS) was considered a single disorder. It now is recognized as a heterogeneous syndrome with several variant forms. Each form of GBS has distinguishing clinical, pathophysiologic, and pathologic features.</p><p>Acute inflammatory demyelinating polyradiculoneuropathy (AIDP) is the most common form in the United States and Europe, representing approximately 85 to 90 percent of cases. The clinical variant Miller Fisher syndrome (MFS), characterized by ophthalmoplegia, ataxia, and areflexia, occurs in 5 percent of cases in the United States and 25 percent of cases in Japan [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/guillain-barre-syndrome-in-adults-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>].</p><p>Acute motor axonal neuropathy (AMAN) and acute sensorimotor axonal neuropathy (AMSAN) are primary axonal forms of GBS. These forms are frequently observed in China, Japan, and Mexico, but they also comprise an estimated 5 to 10 percent of GBS cases in the United States [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/guillain-barre-syndrome-in-adults-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>].</p><p>Other, less frequent, clinical variants are recognized and listed below. (See <a href=\"#H9\" class=\"local\">'Other variants'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Acute inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>As noted above, AIDP is the most common form in the United States and Europe, representing approximately 85 to 90 percent of cases. The typical clinical features are a progressive, fairly symmetric muscle weakness accompanied by absent or depressed deep tendon reflexes. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Clinical features'</a> above.)</p><p>Peripheral nerve myelin is the target of immune attack in AIDP. The immunologic basis of peripheral nerve demyelination in AIDP is discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=guillain-barre-syndrome-pathogenesis#H2\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Guillain-Barr&eacute; syndrome: Pathogenesis&quot;, section on 'Mechanisms'</a>.)</p><p>Inflammatory demyelination is thought to start at the level of the nerve roots, leading to electrophysiologic conduction slowing and conduction blocks with resultant muscle weakness and back pain. Multifocal, patchy, widespread peripheral nerve demyelination follows, causing increasing paralysis. Peripheral nerve remyelination occurs relatively rapidly over several weeks to months. However, in a small percentage of patients, there is superimposed significant axonal degeneration with markedly delayed and incomplete recovery.</p><p>The earliest abnormalities seen on electrodiagnostic studies in patients with AIDP are prolonged or absent F waves and absent H reflexes, reflecting demyelination at the level of the nerve roots [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/guillain-barre-syndrome-in-adults-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/19,20\" class=\"abstract_t\">19,20</a>]. Increased distal latencies and conduction blocks with temporal dispersion of motor responses follow [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/guillain-barre-syndrome-in-adults-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/21,22\" class=\"abstract_t\">21,22</a>]. Significant slowing of nerve conduction velocities is usually not seen until the third or fourth week [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/guillain-barre-syndrome-in-adults-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. Sensory nerve conduction studies (NCS) reveal absent responses or slowed conduction velocities. In the first days after the onset of weakness, some patients with AIDP have a sural sparing pattern in which the sural nerve sensory response is normal, while median and ulnar nerve sensory responses are affected [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/guillain-barre-syndrome-in-adults-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/20,23,24\" class=\"abstract_t\">20,23,24</a>]. Sural sparing has a low to moderate sensitivity and a high specificity for AIDP compared with a diagnosis other than GBS.</p><p>Needle electromyography (EMG) of weak muscles shows reduced recruitment. Ancillary studies, such as facial NCS and blink reflexes, are occasionally helpful.</p><p>A small percentage of AIDP patients develop severe secondary axonal degeneration, and electrodiagnostic studies in these patients at three to four weeks after GBS onset show loss of motor and sensory responses on NCS with extensive denervation on needle examination.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Acute motor axonal neuropathy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>An acute axonal form of GBS, now known as AMAN, was first recognized in 1986 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/guillain-barre-syndrome-in-adults-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. Most cases are preceded by Campylobacter jejuni infection. AMAN occurs frequently in Japan and China, particularly in young people [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/guillain-barre-syndrome-in-adults-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/26,27\" class=\"abstract_t\">26,27</a>]. AMAN has a seasonal incidence, being more frequent in the summer.</p><p>Deep tendon reflexes are occasionally preserved in patients with AMAN [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/guillain-barre-syndrome-in-adults-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. Sensory nerves are not affected. It progresses more rapidly, but the overall prognosis is not worse than AIDP [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/guillain-barre-syndrome-in-adults-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. The presenting clinical features and recovery of AMAN are otherwise similar to those of AIDP.</p><p>This disorder is distinguished from AIDP by its selective involvement of motor nerves and by an electrophysiologic pattern of axonal involvement. In AMAN, distal motor amplitudes are low initially but may increase rapidly with recovery of function; these findings may reflect reversible conduction failure, possibly at the motor nerve terminal or node of Ranvier [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/guillain-barre-syndrome-in-adults-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/30-32\" class=\"abstract_t\">30-32</a>]. There is no sensory nerve involvement and no peripheral nerve demyelination. F waves may be absent but are not significantly prolonged. There is no significant slowing of conduction velocities or increase in distal latencies. There is no temporal dispersion.</p><p>The development of AMAN and AMSAN has been associated with antibodies to the gangliosides GM1, GD1a, GalNac-GD1a, and GD1b that are present in peripheral nerve axons. These anti-ganglioside antibodies can be induced by Campylobacter jejuni infection. The pathophysiology is that of antibody and complement mediated axonal nerve damage without significant axonal degeneration. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=guillain-barre-syndrome-pathogenesis#H2\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Guillain-Barr&eacute; syndrome: Pathogenesis&quot;, section on 'Mechanisms'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Acute motor and sensory axonal neuropathy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>AMSAN is a more severe form of AMAN, in which both sensory and motor fibers are affected with marked axonal degeneration, causing delayed and incomplete recovery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/guillain-barre-syndrome-in-adults-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>]. Clinically, AMSAN resembles the AMAN variant but has more sensory symptoms. The pathology is predominantly axonal lesions of both motor and sensory nerve fibers.</p><p>In AMSAN, motor and sensory responses are frequently severely reduced or absent on electrodiagnostic studies. Axonal degeneration in these patients is demonstrated by extensive denervation on follow-up electromyography studies.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H389462\"><span class=\"h2\">Miller Fisher syndrome</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The typical presentation of MFS is that of ophthalmoplegia with ataxia and areflexia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/guillain-barre-syndrome-in-adults-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/17,34\" class=\"abstract_t\">17,34</a>]. About one-quarter of patients who present with MFS will develop some extremity weakness, clearly linking this disorder to GBS. Incomplete forms include acute ophthalmoplegia without ataxia, and acute ataxic neuropathy without ophthalmoplegia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/guillain-barre-syndrome-in-adults-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/1,35\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,35</a>]. Some patients with MFS develop fixed, dilated pupils [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/guillain-barre-syndrome-in-adults-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>].</p><p>Antibodies against GQ1b (a ganglioside component of nerve) are present in 85 to 90 percent of patients with MFS [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/guillain-barre-syndrome-in-adults-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/37,38\" class=\"abstract_t\">37,38</a>]. The GQ1b antibody is strongly associated with involvement of oculomotor nerves and is also found in most patients with prominent oculomotor weakness and GBS.</p><p>Electrodiagnostic studies in patients with MFS reveal reduced or absent sensory responses without slowing of sensory conduction velocities [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/guillain-barre-syndrome-in-adults-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>]. When there is associated weakness, the motor nerve conduction abnormalities of AIDP may be present.</p><p>Only a few pathological studies of MFS are available.

The cardinal clinical features of GBS are progressive, mostly symmetric muscle weakness and absent or depressed deep tendon reflexes. The weakness can vary from mild difficulty with walking to nearly complete paralysis of all extremity, facial, respiratory, and bulbar muscles. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Clinical features'</a> above.)</p><p>The clinical diagnosis of GBS is supported if cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and electrodiagnostic studies show typical abnormalities [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/guillain-barre-syndrome-in-adults-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/54\" class=\"abstract_t\">54</a>]. Therefore, lumbar puncture and electrodiagnostic studies are performed in all patients with suspected GBS. These tests are also helpful in excluding an alternative diagnosis. Examination of the CSF is especially important to exclude causes of weakness that are associated with a CSF pleocytosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/guillain-barre-syndrome-in-adults-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/55\" class=\"abstract_t\">55</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h2\">Cerebrospinal fluid analysis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In patients with GBS, lumbar puncture often reveals an elevated CSF protein with a normal CSF white blood cell count.

The elevated protein may be due to increased permeability of the blood-nerve-barrier at the level of the proximal nerve roots. A normal CSF protein is found in one-third to one-half of patients when tested earlier than one week after symptom onset and therefore does not exclude the diagnosis of GBS [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/guillain-barre-syndrome-in-adults-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].

These articles are best for patients who want a general overview and who prefer short, easy-to-read materials. Beyond the Basics patient education pieces are longer, more sophisticated, and more detailed. These articles are written at the 10<sup>th</sup> to 12<sup>th</sup> grade reading level and are best for patients who want in-depth information and are comfortable with some medical jargon.</p><p>Here are the patient education articles that are relevant to this topic.

The weakness can vary from mild difficulty with walking to nearly complete paralysis of all extremity, facial, respiratory, and bulbar muscles. Severe respiratory muscle weakness necessitating ventilatory support develops in about 30 percent, and dysautonomia occurs in 70 percent of patients. GBS usually progresses over a period of about two weeks. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Clinical features'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>GBS is a heterogeneous syndrome with several variant forms. Acute inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy (AIDP) is the most common variant of GBS in North America, Europe, and most of the developed world. The Miller Fisher syndrome (MFS) is a GBS variant characterized by ophthalmoplegia with ataxia and areflexia. (See <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'GBS variants'</a> above and <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Acute inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy'</a> above and <a href=\"#H389462\" class=\"local\">'Miller Fisher syndrome'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Axonal forms of GBS include acute motor axonal neuropathy (AMAN), most common in Japan and China, and acute motor and sensory axonal neuropathy (AMSAN). (See <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'Acute motor axonal neuropathy'</a> above and <a href=\"#H8\" class=\"local\">'Acute motor and sensory axonal neuropathy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The initial diagnosis of GBS is based upon the clinical presentation. The certainty of the diagnosis is supported if cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis and electrodiagnostic studies show abnormalities typical of GBS. Therefore, these studies should be performed in all patients with suspected GBS. (See <a href=\"#H10\" class=\"local\">'Diagnostic evaluation'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>An increased CSF protein with a normal CSF white blood cell count (albuminocytologic dissociation) is found in 50 to 66 percent of patients with GBS in the first week after the onset of symptoms and in &ge;75 percent of patients in the third week. An alternative diagnosis, including human immunodeficiency virus, should be considered in patients with a CSF cell count <span class=\"nowrap\">&gt;50/mm<sup>3</sup></span>. (See <a href=\"#H11\" class=\"local\">'Cerebrospinal fluid analysis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Electrodiagnostic studies are very useful in confirming the diagnosis and in classifying the main variants of GBS, which are demyelinating GBS (AIDP) and axonal GBS (AMAN). (See <a href=\"#H12\" class=\"local\">'Electrodiagnostic studies'</a> above and <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'GBS variants'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Testing for serum IgG antibodies to GQ1b is useful for the diagnosis of MFS. Testing for other glycolipid antibodies has no clinical role. (See <a href=\"#H13\" class=\"local\">'Antibodies'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The differential diagnosis of GBS includes other acute polyneuropathies, chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy, and diseases of the spinal cord, neuromuscular junction, and muscle. The differential diagnosis of the MFS variant of GBS includes brainstem stroke, Wernicke encephalopathy, and brainstem encephalitis.
