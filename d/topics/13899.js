Nevertheless, acute pancreatitis is the most common serious complication of ERCP and is a common basis for malpractice claims related to ERCP [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/post-endoscopic-retrograde-cholangiopancreatography-ercp-pancreatitis/abstract/2-7\" class=\"abstract_t\">2-7</a>].</p><p>This topic will review post-ERCP pancreatitis (PEP). Other aspects of ERCP are discussed separately.

Two important factors are mechanical injury from instrumentation of the pancreatic duct and hydrostatic injury from contrast injection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/post-endoscopic-retrograde-cholangiopancreatography-ercp-pancreatitis/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].</p><p>Prolonged manipulation around the papillary orifice, repeated instrumentation of the pancreatic duct, and multiple pancreatic duct injections are common when selective bile duct cannulation is difficult [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/post-endoscopic-retrograde-cholangiopancreatography-ercp-pancreatitis/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. This can result in mechanical injury to the duct or ampulla. Thermal injury from electrocautery current may produce edema of the pancreatic orifice, leading to obstruction of the pancreatic duct with impaired emptying of pancreatic secretions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/post-endoscopic-retrograde-cholangiopancreatography-ercp-pancreatitis/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>].</p><p>Hydrostatic injury from over-injection of the pancreatic duct is probably an important cause of pancreatitis after diagnostic ERCP and sphincter of Oddi manometry [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/post-endoscopic-retrograde-cholangiopancreatography-ercp-pancreatitis/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. Over-injection has probably occurred if gland acinarization is apparent during pancreatography (ie, visualization of the side branches of the pancreatic duct during contrast injection).</p><p>Contrast agents could lead to PEP by causing chemical or allergic injury. However, the role of ionic contrast agents in the development of PEP and the relative safety of nonionic low-osmolarity contrast agents are controversial. A meta-analysis of randomized trials found no significant difference in PEP rates among different types of contrast [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/post-endoscopic-retrograde-cholangiopancreatography-ercp-pancreatitis/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>].</p><p>Intraluminal activation of proteolytic enzymes has been suggested in laboratory studies and clinical trials [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/post-endoscopic-retrograde-cholangiopancreatography-ercp-pancreatitis/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>].

Post-ERCP pancreatitis is typically diagnosed when a patient with signs and symptoms of pancreatitis (eg, abdominal pain and tenderness) has elevated pancreatic enzymes (ie, amylase and lipase), though there have been cases of pancreatitis detected by computed tomography among patients with post-ERCP hyperamylasemia who do not report pain [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/post-endoscopic-retrograde-cholangiopancreatography-ercp-pancreatitis/abstract/50\" class=\"abstract_t\">50</a>]. The diagnosis of pancreatitis is discussed in detail separately.

For this reason, amylase and lipase should only be checked in patients with signs and symptoms suggestive of pancreatitis after ERCP. </p><p>In patients suspected of having pancreatitis, the degree and rapidity of the pancreas enzyme elevations may be a way to differentiate patients with PEP from those with pain from other causes. In a study involving 231 patients with serum amylase and lipase serial determinations following ERCP, values of amylase and lipase below 276 <span class=\"nowrap\">unit/L</span> (4.6 <span class=\"nowrap\">nkat/L)</span> and 1000 <span class=\"nowrap\">unit/L</span> (166.7 <span class=\"nowrap\">kat/liter),</span> respectively, at two hours after ERCP were highly predictive of the <strong>absence</strong> of pancreatitis, even in patients who had abdominal pain (negative predictive values of 97 and 98 percent, respectively) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/post-endoscopic-retrograde-cholangiopancreatography-ercp-pancreatitis/abstract/51\" class=\"abstract_t\">51</a>]. Other studies have found that patients with PEP frequently have serum amylase levels more than five times the upper limit of normal [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/post-endoscopic-retrograde-cholangiopancreatography-ercp-pancreatitis/abstract/52,53\" class=\"abstract_t\">52,53</a>].</p><p>Patients who have undergone pancreatogram should be admitted if four-hour amylase level is greater than 2.5 times the upper limit of reference. Patients who have not undergone pancreatogram should be admitted if four-hour amylase level is greater than five times the upper limit of normal [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/post-endoscopic-retrograde-cholangiopancreatography-ercp-pancreatitis/abstract/54\" class=\"abstract_t\">54</a>]. The four-hour post-ERCP amylase level was shown to be useful in the prediction of PEP in two prospective studies including 263 and 886 patients, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/post-endoscopic-retrograde-cholangiopancreatography-ercp-pancreatitis/abstract/54,55\" class=\"abstract_t\">54,55</a>]. </p><p>In one retrospective review of 543 consecutive patients undergoing therapeutic ERCP at a single center, serum lipase measured at four-hour post-ERCP was more useful for the exclusion of PEP compared with serum amylase (sensitivity 100 versus 79 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/post-endoscopic-retrograde-cholangiopancreatography-ercp-pancreatitis/abstract/56\" class=\"abstract_t\">56</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3400456501\"><span class=\"h2\">Other diagnostic tests</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Serum and urinary trypsinogen values have also been proposed as markers of early pancreatitis. A serum trypsinogen 2 concentration more than three times greater than the upper limit of normal six hours after ERCP is an accurate indicator of pancreatitis (sensitivity 93 percent and specificity 91 percent), while a negative urinary trypsinogen 2 test strip six hours after the procedure is highly predictive of the absence of pancreatitis (negative predictive value 98 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/post-endoscopic-retrograde-cholangiopancreatography-ercp-pancreatitis/abstract/57\" class=\"abstract_t\">57</a>]. Serum C-reactive protein and interleukin-6, serially determined at 12 to 24 hours and at 36 to 48 hours, were useful early markers for predicting the severity of ERCP-induced pancreatitis in a pilot study of 84 patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/post-endoscopic-retrograde-cholangiopancreatography-ercp-pancreatitis/abstract/58\" class=\"abstract_t\">58</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H78685116\"><span class=\"h1\">DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Not all patients with pain following ERCP have post-ERCP pancreatitis. Other causes of abdominal pain following ERCP include discomfort due air insufflation and perforation.</p><p>In patients with discomfort due to air insufflation, the pain is typically not as severe as that seen with PEP, and the pancreatic enzyme levels may be normal or elevated, since pancreatic enzymes are elevated in a majority of patients following ERCP [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/post-endoscopic-retrograde-cholangiopancreatography-ercp-pancreatitis/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. If the serum lipase is less than three times the upper limit of normal, pancreatitis is unlikely (specificity of 85 to 98 percent). However, it should be kept in mind that the amylase and lipase start to rise several hours after the onset of pancreatitis, so blood tests drawn shortly after ERCP may be falsely-negative. If the clinical suspicion for pancreatitis is high, repeat tests four hours after ERCP should be obtained.

They may present immediately, or the presentation may be delayed for several hours. Many of the symptoms of perforation overlap with those of acute pancreatitis, and if perforation is suspected, abdominal imaging to look for free air (intraperitoneal or retroperitoneal) should be obtained.

Patients who develop severe pancreatitis may require prolonged hospitalization in the intensive care unit with total parenteral or enteral nutrition. The management of patients with PEP is the same as for patients with pancreatitis from other causes. Endoscopic reintervention may be required in patients with a biliary cause of pancreatitis if the ERCP did not produce adequate biliary decompression.

Most studies found that the guidewire technique improved the success rate for biliary cannulation, but not all found that it reduced the incidence of post-ERCP pancreatitis. In addition, wire-guided cannulation may not prevent post-ERCP pancreatitis in patients with suspected sphincter of Oddi dysfunction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/post-endoscopic-retrograde-cholangiopancreatography-ercp-pancreatitis/abstract/66\" class=\"abstract_t\">66</a>].</p><p>A meta-analysis of 12 randomized trials with 3450 patients found that wire-guided cannulation was superior to a contrast-assisted cannulation technique [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/post-endoscopic-retrograde-cholangiopancreatography-ercp-pancreatitis/abstract/69\" class=\"abstract_t\">69</a>]. Primary cannulation rates were higher for the wire-guided technique (84 versus 77 percent), and the risk of post-ERCP pancreatitis was lower (3.5 versus 6.7 percent). A total of 31 patients would need to undergo guidewire cannulation rather than contrast-assisted cannulation in order to prevent one case of post-ERCP pancreatitis. In addition, guidewire cannulation was less likely to result in post-ERCP pancreatitis in cases where the pancreatic duct was inadvertently manipulated (relative risk [RR] 0.28). The decreased risk of post-ERCP pancreatitis was seen only in the five &quot;non-crossover&quot; trials (ie, if attempts at cannulation failed with the assigned approach, the alternative approach could not be used). </p><p>However, a subsequent prospective trial found no significant difference in post-ERCP pancreatitis rates with the guidewire technique compared with cannulation using a sphincterotome and contrast injection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/post-endoscopic-retrograde-cholangiopancreatography-ercp-pancreatitis/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>]. The study included 1249 patients, and the overall rate of post-ERCP pancreatitis was 5.2 percent for the guidewire group and 4.4 percent for the contrast injection group. Factors that were associated with post-ERCP pancreatitis on multivariable analysis included more than 10 cannulation attempts, cannulation or opacification of the main pancreatic duct, suspected sphincter of Oddi dysfunction, and precut sphincterotomy.</p><p>In a single-center retrospective study enrolling 800 consecutive patients with a native papilla, multivariate analysis revealed that unintentional guidewire insertion into the pancreatic duct and a small common bile duct (diameter &lt;9 mm) were risk factors for post-ERCP pancreatitis in biliary therapeutic ERCP with the use of wire-guided cannulation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/post-endoscopic-retrograde-cholangiopancreatography-ercp-pancreatitis/abstract/70\" class=\"abstract_t\">70</a>].</p><p>In a multicenter prospective randomized controlled trial including 274 patients with a naive papilla, undergoing ERCP using wire-guided cannulation in whom there was unintentional insertion of the guidewire into the pancreatic duct, patients were randomly assigned to undergo the double-guidewire technique (with the guidewire still in the duct) or repeated single-wire cannulation. Conversion to double-guidewire technique neither facilitated selective bile duct cannulation (p = 0.42) nor decreased post-ERCP pancreatitis incidence (p = 0.53) compared with repeated use of a single-wire technique. Double-guidewire cannulation was more effective in patients with malignant biliary stricture (p = 0.02) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/post-endoscopic-retrograde-cholangiopancreatography-ercp-pancreatitis/abstract/71\" class=\"abstract_t\">71</a>]. </p><p>An option for cannulation in patients with common bile duct stones who are undergoing laparoscopic cholecystectomy is rendezvous intraoperative ERCP. During the procedure, the surgeon introduces a guidewire through the cystic duct and advances it through the papilla into the duodenum. The endoscopist then snares the guidewire and pulls it through the accessory channel of the duodenoscope. A sphincterotome can then be advanced over the guidewire to gain biliary access. Two large studies found that using this technique was associated with a lower risk of post-ERCP pancreatitis compared with conventional biliary cannulation techniques (0.4 to 2.2 versus 3.8 to 14 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/post-endoscopic-retrograde-cholangiopancreatography-ercp-pancreatitis/abstract/72,73\" class=\"abstract_t\">72,73</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h4\">Electrocautery</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The type of electrocautery used for sphincterotomy may influence the risk of post-ERCP pancreatitis.
