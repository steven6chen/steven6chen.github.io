Establishing the correct diagnosis is also important. Other causes of upper gastrointestinal bleeding in patients with liver disease include peptic ulcer disease, Mallory-Weiss tear, portal hypertensive gastropathy, and gastric antral vascular ectasia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/general-principles-of-the-management-of-variceal-hemorrhage/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=causes-of-upper-gastrointestinal-bleeding-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Causes of upper gastrointestinal bleeding in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The frequency with which varices account for upper gastrointestinal bleeding in patients with cirrhosis is uncertain. Varices appeared to be the source of bleeding in 50 to 90 percent of patients with cirrhosis with upper gastrointestinal bleeding in various reports, although a variety of other causes may also be responsible [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/general-principles-of-the-management-of-variceal-hemorrhage/abstract/2-7\" class=\"abstract_t\">2-7</a>]. In patients with cirrhosis, any upper gastrointestinal bleeding associated with hemodynamic changes requires endoscopic evaluation and should be considered to be variceal in origin until proven otherwise. </p><p>This topic review will discuss the general principles involved in the initial management of the patient with an acute variceal hemorrhage. The treatment modalities directed specifically at stopping the bleeding are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methods-to-achieve-hemostasis-in-patients-with-acute-variceal-hemorrhage\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Methods to achieve hemostasis in patients with acute variceal hemorrhage&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">DEFINITIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The existing literature is confounded by the variable use of terminology across studies. As a result, several definitions were agreed upon during a consensus conference, which simplify evaluation of published studies and render new studies more comparable [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/general-principles-of-the-management-of-variceal-hemorrhage/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Time zero</strong> &ndash; The time of admission to a medical care facility.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Clinically significant bleeding </strong>&ndash; Defined by a transfusion requirement of two units of blood or more within 24 hours of time zero together with a systolic blood pressure below 100 mmHg, a postural systolic change of more than 20 mmHg, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> a pulse rate above 100 <span class=\"nowrap\">beats/min</span> at time zero.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Acute bleeding episode </strong>&ndash;<strong> </strong>Events in the interval of 120 hours (five days) from time zero. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Treatment failure </strong>&ndash; Failure of therapy is defined by any of the following criteria if they occur within 120 hours of time zero:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Fresh hematemesis or &gt;100 mL of blood in the nasogastric aspirate &gt;2 hours after the start of a specific drug or endoscopic treatment</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Development of hypovolemic shock</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Drop in hemoglobin of &ge;3 gm within a 24-hour period</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Early rebleeding </strong>&ndash; Bleeding that occurs &gt;120 hours but &lt;6 weeks from time zero, provided initial hemostasis was achieved and maintained for at least 24 hours.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Late rebleeding</strong> &ndash; Bleeding that occurs &ge;6 weeks from time zero.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">NATURAL HISTORY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There are two distinct phases in the course of variceal hemorrhage: an acute phase and a later phase in which there is a high risk of recurrent bleeding [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/general-principles-of-the-management-of-variceal-hemorrhage/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. The acute phase starts with the onset of active hemorrhage (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F64026\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef64026 \">picture 1</a>). Only 50 percent of patients with variceal hemorrhage stop bleeding spontaneously; this is quite different from the more than 90 percent spontaneous cessation rate in patients with other forms of upper gastrointestinal hemorrhage. Patients with Child class C cirrhosis and large, actively spurting varices are less likely to achieve spontaneous hemostasis (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F78401\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef78401 \">table 1</a>) (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=calculator-child-pugh-classification-for-severity-of-liver-disease\" class=\"calc calc_professional\">calculator 1</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=calculator-child-pugh-classification-for-severity-of-liver-disease-si-units\" class=\"calc calc_professional\">calculator 2</a>)&nbsp;[<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/general-principles-of-the-management-of-variceal-hemorrhage/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. In addition, a hepatic venous pressure gradient &gt;20 mmHg is associated with a greater risk of continued or recurrent bleeding [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/general-principles-of-the-management-of-variceal-hemorrhage/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. Active infection is associated with an increased risk of bleeding and multiorgan failure, which forms the basis for the recommended use of antibiotics in patients with variceal bleeding. (See <a href=\"#H10\" class=\"local\">'Infection and use of prophylactic antibiotics'</a> below.) </p><p>Following cessation of active hemorrhage, there is a period of approximately six weeks in which there is a high risk of recurrent hemorrhage. The greatest risk is within the first 48 to 72 hours, and over 50 percent of all early rebleeding episodes occur within the first 10 days [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/general-principles-of-the-management-of-variceal-hemorrhage/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. Risk factors for early rebleeding include age greater than 60 years, renal failure, large varices, and severe initial bleeding as defined by a hemoglobin below 8 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/dL</span> at admission (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F52618\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef52618 \">table 2</a>)&nbsp;[<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/general-principles-of-the-management-of-variceal-hemorrhage/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. Survival during this period mirrors the risk of rebleeding and is directly related to the outcome of bleeding [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/general-principles-of-the-management-of-variceal-hemorrhage/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prevention-of-recurrent-variceal-hemorrhage-in-patients-with-cirrhosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Prevention of recurrent variceal hemorrhage in patients with cirrhosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The risk of bleeding and of death in patients who survive six weeks is similar to that in patients with cirrhosis of equivalent severity who have never bled (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F70212\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef70212 \">figure 1</a>)&nbsp;[<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/general-principles-of-the-management-of-variceal-hemorrhage/abstract/9,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,12</a>]. One-year survival in those who survive two weeks after a variceal bleed is approximately 52 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/general-principles-of-the-management-of-variceal-hemorrhage/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. Survival appears to have increased since the 1980s due to a decrease in short-term mortality [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/general-principles-of-the-management-of-variceal-hemorrhage/abstract/13,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,14</a>]. Acute bleeding from varices is associated with approximately 15 to 20 percent 30-day mortality [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/general-principles-of-the-management-of-variceal-hemorrhage/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h1\">GENERAL PRINCIPLES OF MANAGEMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There are three primary goals of management during the active bleeding episode: hemodynamic resuscitation, prevention and treatment of complications, and treatment of bleeding (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F55338\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef55338 \">table 3</a>). All three need to be pursued simultaneously and often require the coordinated care of a hepatologist, critical care clinician, critical care nurse, surgeon, and interventional radiologist.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Hemodynamic resuscitation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Restoration of the intravascular volume should be aggressively managed with large bore peripheral intravenous lines or a central line. Blood loss should be replaced by packed cells, and clotting factors should be replaced as needed. Platelet counts often drop within the first 48 hours after a bleed and may necessitate platelet transfusions if values below <span class=\"nowrap\">50,000/mm<sup>3</sup></span> occur in an actively bleeding patient. In extreme settings, correction of the coagulopathy is necessary. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hemostatic-abnormalities-in-patients-with-liver-disease#H61498824\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Hemostatic abnormalities in patients with liver disease&quot;, section on 'Bleeding'</a>.)</p><p>Patients must be monitored carefully to avoid overtransfusion with volume overload because of the risk of rebound portal hypertension and induction of rebleeding [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/general-principles-of-the-management-of-variceal-hemorrhage/abstract/16-20\" class=\"abstract_t\">16-20</a>]. Those receiving large volumes of blood products should be monitored for a reduction in the serum ionized calcium concentration (due to citrate binding of ionized calcium) and thrombocytopenia; these abnormalities should be corrected. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=massive-blood-transfusion\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Massive blood transfusion&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h3\">Recombinant factor VIIa</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>It may not be possible to correct the coagulopathy adequately with FFP, particularly in patients who are severely volume overloaded. Small pilot studies have demonstrated that <a href=\"topic.htm?path=factor-viia-activated-recombinant-human-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">recombinant human factor VIIa</a> (rFVIIa) has been associated with improvement or normalization of the serum prothrombin time and control of bleeding in such patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/general-principles-of-the-management-of-variceal-hemorrhage/abstract/21-27\" class=\"abstract_t\">21-27</a>]. However, at least two randomized controlled trials and a meta-analysis of those trials failed to demonstrate a clear benefit of recombinant factor VIIa in active variceal bleeding [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/general-principles-of-the-management-of-variceal-hemorrhage/abstract/27-29\" class=\"abstract_t\">27-29</a>]. A second meta-analysis of the same trials did find that recombinant factor VIIa was beneficial with regard to a composite outcome (failure to control bleeding, five-day rebleeding, or death) in the subset of patients with active bleeding at the time of endoscopy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/general-principles-of-the-management-of-variceal-hemorrhage/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. Thus, the role of recombinant factor VIIa in management of bleeding awaits further clarification and it cannot yet be recommended for routine clinical use in patients with variceal hemorrhage. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=recombinant-factor-viia-clinical-uses-dosing-and-adverse-effects\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Recombinant factor VIIa: Clinical uses, dosing, and adverse effects&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Pharmacologic therapy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The role of pharmacologic therapy (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=vasopressin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">vasopressin</a>, somatostatin and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=octreotide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">octreotide</a>) is discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methods-to-achieve-hemostasis-in-patients-with-acute-variceal-hemorrhage\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Methods to achieve hemostasis in patients with acute variceal hemorrhage&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Prevention and management of complications</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Complications related to bleeding and to the treatment of bleeding contribute substantially to mortality from active hemorrhage [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/general-principles-of-the-management-of-variceal-hemorrhage/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]. While hemostasis is almost invariably achieved, many patients succumb to the complications that develop following admission. Thus, prevention, monitoring, and treatment are critically important. The principal complications that cause death are aspiration pneumonia, sepsis, acute-on-chronic liver failure, hepatic encephalopathy, and renal failure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/general-principles-of-the-management-of-variceal-hemorrhage/abstract/10,31,32\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,31,32</a>]. It is not unusual for multiple complications to develop simultaneously.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h3\">Aspiration</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Endotracheal intubation to protect the airway can be considered in patients with massive bleeding [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/general-principles-of-the-management-of-variceal-hemorrhage/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>]. However, whether it is protective against aspiration pneumonia is unclear. One study suggested that it may increase the risk [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/general-principles-of-the-management-of-variceal-hemorrhage/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>]. The risk of aspiration may also be linked to the skill of the endotracheal intubation. It is the author's practice to protect the airway in cases with severe hematemesis prior to endoscopy because it also facilitates the performance of endoscopy and endoscopic therapy, especially if the patient is intoxicated, agitated, or unable to protect his or her airway.</p><p>Whether placement of a nasogastric tube can help prevent aspiration has not been well studied. However, a nasogastric tube can help decompress the stomach and assist in clearing it of blood for subsequent endoscopy.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h3\">Infection and use of prophylactic antibiotics</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Bacterial infections are present in up to 20 percent of patients with cirrhosis who are hospitalized with gastrointestinal bleeding; up to an additional 50 percent develop an infection while hospitalized [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/general-principles-of-the-management-of-variceal-hemorrhage/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>]. Such patients have increased mortality. The most common sites are urinary tract infections (approximately 12 to 29 percent), spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (7 to 23 percent), respiratory infections (6 to 10 percent), and primary bacteremia (4 to 11 percent).</p><p>Multiple trials evaluating the effectiveness of prophylactic antibiotics in patients with cirrhosis hospitalized for bleeding suggest an overall reduction in infectious complications and decreased mortality [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/general-principles-of-the-management-of-variceal-hemorrhage/abstract/36-39\" class=\"abstract_t\">36-39</a>]. Antibiotics may also reduce the risk of recurrent bleeding in hospitalized patients who bled from esophageal varices [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/general-principles-of-the-management-of-variceal-hemorrhage/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>]. However, the optimal choice of antibiotic, duration of therapy, and selection of patients who might benefit most remains unclear. Although a consistent benefit was demonstrated, the trials supporting antibiotic prophylaxis included only a small number of patients with varying severity of liver disease and different causes of bleeding (approximately two-thirds were variceal), compared multiple different antibiotic regimens, and many had important methodologic limitations. A systematic review that included eight placebo-controlled trials with a total of 864 patients found the antibiotics were associated with a significant reduction in mortality (RR 0.75, 95% CI 0.55 to 0.95) and bacterial infections (RR 0.40, 95% CI 0.32 to 0.51) including bacteremia, pneumonia, spontaneous bacterial peritonitis, and urinary tract infections [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/general-principles-of-the-management-of-variceal-hemorrhage/abstract/35,41\" class=\"abstract_t\">35,41</a>].</p><p>A subsequent meta-analysis of 12 trials that compared antibiotic prophylaxis with placebo or no intervention found a benefit of prophylactic antibiotic use with regard to mortality (relative risk [RR] 0.79, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.63-0.98), mortality from bacterial infections (RR 0.43, 95% CI 0.19-0.97), bacterial infections (RR 0.35, 95% CI 0.26-0.47), rebleeding (RR 0.53, 95% CI 0.38-0.74), and days of hospitalization (mean difference -1.9 days, 95% CI -3.8-0.02) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/general-principles-of-the-management-of-variceal-hemorrhage/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>].</p><p>A reasonable conclusion from these data is that patients with cirrhosis who present with upper GI bleeding (from varices or other causes) should be given prophylactic antibiotics, preferably before endoscopy (although effectiveness has also been demonstrated when given after endoscopy). The benefit to antibiotics is probably greater in patients with advanced liver disease (Child Pugh class B and C) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/general-principles-of-the-management-of-variceal-hemorrhage/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>]&nbsp;(<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F78401\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef78401 \">table 1</a>) but all patients with cirrhosis should be considered eligible. </p><p>The optimal choice of antibiotics and duration of therapy is unclear since a benefit was detected from most of the studied regimens, which differed in the choice of antibiotics, their spectrum of activity, and duration of treatment ranging from a single dose up to 10 days. Most of the studies included a quinolone in doses ranging from 400 mg of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ofloxacin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ofloxacin</a>, 400 to 800 mg of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=norfloxacin-united-states-not-available-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">norfloxacin</a>, and 400 to 1000 mg of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ciprofloxacin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ciprofloxacin</a>. Other regimens included cephalosporins, a quinolone given with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=amoxicillin-and-clavulanate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">amoxicillin-clavulanate</a>, nonabsorbable antibiotics, and imipenem-cilastin. We tend to use a broad spectrum antibiotic such as intravenous <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ceftriaxone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ceftriaxone</a> (1 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/day</span> for seven days), which was superior to norfloxacin in a randomized controlled trial [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/general-principles-of-the-management-of-variceal-hemorrhage/abstract/43\" class=\"abstract_t\">43</a>]. For patients being discharged before seven days, we transition to an oral antibiotic, such as ciprofloxacin (500 mg every 12 hours), to complete seven days of antibiotics. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=spontaneous-bacterial-peritonitis-in-adults-treatment-and-prophylaxis#H80470555\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Spontaneous bacterial peritonitis in adults: Treatment and prophylaxis&quot;, section on 'Antibiotic regimen'</a>.)</p><p>An important consideration in the choice of antibiotics should be local patterns of antibiotic resistance; quinolone resistance, for example, has become an increasing problem in patients with cirrhosis in some centers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/general-principles-of-the-management-of-variceal-hemorrhage/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>]. The possibility of quinolone resistance is a particular concern in patients who have been receiving prophylactic <a href=\"topic.htm?path=norfloxacin-united-states-not-available-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">norfloxacin</a> for the prevention of spontaneous bacterial peritonitis. A randomized controlled trial in a setting with high quinolone resistance found a significantly higher probability of developing proved or possible infections (33 versus 11 percent) or spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (12 versus 2 percent) in patients who had been randomized to oral norfloxacin compared with intravenous <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ceftriaxone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ceftriaxone</a> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/general-principles-of-the-management-of-variceal-hemorrhage/abstract/43\" class=\"abstract_t\">43</a>].

Only 50 percent of patients with variceal hemorrhage stop bleeding spontaneously; this is quite different from the more than 90 percent spontaneous cessation rate in patients with other forms of upper gastrointestinal hemorrhage. (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Natural history'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Following cessation of active hemorrhage, there is a period of approximately six weeks in which there is a high risk of recurrent hemorrhage. The greatest risk is within the first 48 to 72 hours, and over 50 percent of all early rebleeding episodes occur within the first 10 days. The risk of bleeding and of death in patients who survive six weeks is similar to that in patients with cirrhosis of equivalent severity who have never bled (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F70212\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef70212 \">figure 1</a>). (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Natural history'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>There are three primary goals of management during the active bleeding episode: hemodynamic resuscitation, prevention and treatment of complications, and treatment of bleeding (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F55338\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef55338 \">table 3</a>). All three need to be pursued simultaneously and often require the coordinated care of a hepatologist, critical care clinician, critical care nurse, surgeon, and interventional radiologist.
