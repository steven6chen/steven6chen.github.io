Deficiency in one of these components may result in major T cell deficiency or dysfunction. The clinical presentation of these defects varies widely, depending upon the severity of the genotypic abnormality. All of these immunodeficiencies are rare.</p><p>A brief review of TCR biology is first presented in this topic review to better understand disorders of the TCR complex that are associated with immunodeficiency. Detailed discussions of these topics are presented separately. Immunodeficiencies that result from defects in individual TCR complex components are then reviewed. Idiopathic cluster of differentiation 4 (CD4) lymphopenia is discussed separately.

TCR gamma-delta is more abundant in skin and intraepithelial lymphocytes. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=t-cell-receptor-genetics\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;T cell receptor genetics&quot;</a>.)</p><p>TCR chains belong structurally to the immunoglobulin gene superfamily. Thus, TCR genes undergo recombination of the variable, diversity, and joining segments, called V(D)J recombination. This event is dependent upon the function of recombinase-activating genes 1 and 2 (<em>RAG1</em> and <em>RAG2</em>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cd3-t-cell-receptor-complex-disorders-causing-immunodeficiency/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=t-cell-receptor-genetics#H3\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;T cell receptor genetics&quot;, section on 'T cell receptor gene organization'</a>.)</p><p>A protein must first be processed by antigen-presenting cells (APCs) for T cells to recognize a specific antigen. APCs degrade the target antigen into several peptides. These peptides are subsequently presented on the cell surface in the groove formed by either a class I or II major histocompatibility complex (MHC) molecule. The human leukocyte antigen (HLA) system is synonymous with the human MHC. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=antigen-presenting-cells\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Antigen-presenting cells&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=major-histocompatibility-complex-mhc-structure-and-function\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Major histocompatibility complex (MHC) structure and function&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=human-leukocyte-antigens-hla-a-roadmap\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Human leukocyte antigens (HLA): A roadmap&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Antigens processed for presentation in the context of class I MHC must be transported to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), where class I MHC is assembled. Two proteins, transporter associated with antigen processing (TAP) 1 and 2, are specifically required for this function. Once in the ER, the peptides associate with class I MHC, which is comprised of an alpha chain noncovalently associated with beta-2-microglobulin (B2M). A specific molecule called TAP-binding protein (TAPBP), also called tapasin, is involved in peptide loading during class I <span class=\"nowrap\">MHC/antigen</span> intracellular transport and expression (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F76821\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef76821 \">figure 2</a>).</p><p>The appropriate TCR is capable of binding the peptide and MHC complex (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F53512\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef53512 \">figure 3</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F63541\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef63541 \">figure 4</a>). CD4 and CD8 act as accessory molecules. They determine whether a particular TCR binds to class I or class II MHC [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cd3-t-cell-receptor-complex-disorders-causing-immunodeficiency/abstract/3,4\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,4</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>CD8 binds to a nonpolymorphic region of class I MHC</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>CD4 binds to a nonpolymorphic region of class II MHC</p><p/><p>TCR chains are also noncovalently linked to nonpolymorphic CD3. Four CD3 chains have been described in humans: epsilon, gamma, delta, and zeta. Signaling cascades are activated upon engagement of the <span class=\"nowrap\">TCR/CD3</span> complex. CD3 is important in transducing the signal that initiates a T cell activation and differentiation pathway via a motif in the cytoplasmic domain called the immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motif (ITAM) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F79731\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef79731 \">figure 5</a>). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=the-adaptive-cellular-immune-response#H4\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;The adaptive cellular immune response&quot;, section on 'T cell activation'</a>.)</p><p>There are a number of molecules involved in early signal transduction, including Lck (lymphocyte-specific protein-tyrosine kinase), Fyn (a tyrosine kinase protooncogene related to Src), ZAP-70 (zeta-chain-associated protein kinase 70 kilodalton), and Syk (spleen tyrosine kinase) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cd3-t-cell-receptor-complex-disorders-causing-immunodeficiency/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>].

Deficiencies in this distal cascade are discussed separately.

The TCR is a heterodimer, either an alpha and a beta chain or a gamma and a delta chain, that binds to peptide presented on class I or II major histocompatibility complex (MHC) molecules by antigen-presenting cells (APCs). CD4 and CD8 act as accessory molecules. TCR chains are also linked to CD3, which is important in transducing the signal that initiates a T cell activation and differentiation pathway. A number of downstream signaling molecules are involved in this pathway.
