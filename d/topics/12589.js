Scleroderma is the hallmark feature of a heterogeneous group of conditions, the classification of which is discussed in more detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-and-classification-of-scleroderma-disorders\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview and classification of scleroderma disorders&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Scleroderma may be a clinical feature of limited anatomic extent affecting only the skin and subjacent tissues, or it may be associated with systemic involvement. When the characteristic skin disorder is associated with internal organ involvement, the disease is termed systemic sclerosis (SSc). SSc is subcategorized further into diffuse cutaneous SSc (dcSSc) and limited cutaneous SSc (lcSSc) on the basis of the extent and distribution of skin involvement. lcSSc is commonly associated with the CREST syndrome [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-clinical-manifestations-of-systemic-sclerosis-scleroderma-in-adults/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Limited cutaneous SSc'</a> below.)</p><p>Other disorders that may either have typical scleroderma skin changes or those that have scleroderma-like cutaneous involvement are considerations in the differential diagnosis of SSc. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diagnosis-and-differential-diagnosis-of-systemic-sclerosis-scleroderma-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Diagnosis and differential diagnosis of systemic sclerosis (scleroderma) in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The systemic manifestations of SSc are diverse. Most prominent are abnormalities of the circulation (most notably Raynaud phenomenon) and involvement of multiple organ systems, including the musculoskeletal, renal, pulmonary, cardiac, and gastrointestinal systems, with fibrotic <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> vascular complications.</p><p>The prevalence rates of scleroderma-like conditions range from 4 to 489 cases per million individuals [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-clinical-manifestations-of-systemic-sclerosis-scleroderma-in-adults/abstract/3,4\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,4</a>]. Incidence figures for SSc are 0.6 to 122 per million persons per year; the actual prevalence is probably at the high end of the range noted above [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-clinical-manifestations-of-systemic-sclerosis-scleroderma-in-adults/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. There are regional differences in incidence. For example, higher rates are seen in the United States and Australia than in Japan or Europe, and in blacks than whites [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-clinical-manifestations-of-systemic-sclerosis-scleroderma-in-adults/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].</p><p>A brief overview of the clinical features of SSc in adults is presented here.

The frequency of these symptoms is uncertain.</p><p>One of the few estimates of the type and frequency of general symptoms among those with SSc was reported in a study of 107 patients with established disease (median 10 years, range 1 to 37 years) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-clinical-manifestations-of-systemic-sclerosis-scleroderma-in-adults/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. The following were the most frequent symptoms:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Fatigue (76 percent)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Stiff joints (74 percent)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Loss of strength (68 percent)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pain (67 percent)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Sleep difficulties (66 percent)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Skin discoloration (47 percent)</p><p/><p>Less commonly noted symptoms were breathlessness, upset stomach, depression, nausea, and weight loss.</p><p>The level of fatigue in SSc is comparable to that in rheumatoid arthritis, systemic lupus, or cancer patients in active treatment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-clinical-manifestations-of-systemic-sclerosis-scleroderma-in-adults/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. The presence of fatigue was associated with poorer physical function and greater pain [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-clinical-manifestations-of-systemic-sclerosis-scleroderma-in-adults/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. Causes of pain include skin-related discomfort, joint pain, Raynaud phenomenon, and ischemic digital ulcers.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">SKIN INVOLVEMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Skin involvement is a nearly universal feature of systemic sclerosis (SSc). It is characterized by variable extent and severity of skin thickening and hardening. The fingers, hands, and face are generally the earliest areas of the body involved. Edematous swelling and erythema may precede skin induration (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RHEUM%2F96749\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef96749 \">figure 1</a>).</p><p>Other prominent skin manifestations include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pruritus in the early stages</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Edema in the early stages</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Skin hyperpigmentation or depigmentation (&ldquo;salt-and-pepper&rdquo;)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Loss of appendicular hair</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Sclerodactyly</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Digital ulcers</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pitting at the fingertips</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Telangiectasia</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Calcinosis cutis</p><p/><p>The assessment of skin involvement includes semiquantitative estimation of skin thickness, pliability (hardness), and fixation to underlying structures (tethering). The modified Rodnan skin score is commonly used as an outcome measure in clinical trials (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RHEUM%2F96747%7ERHEUM%2F97759\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef96747 graphicRef97759 \">figure 2A-B</a>). This semi-quantitative score rates the severity of these features from 0 (normal) to 3 (most severe) in 17 distinct areas of the body. Objective approaches to measuring scleroderma skin involvement, such as ultrasonography [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-clinical-manifestations-of-systemic-sclerosis-scleroderma-in-adults/abstract/7,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,8</a>] and use of a durometer, are under investigation.</p><p>The distribution of skin lesions forms the basis for the current classification system of SSc into limited and diffuse forms of the disease (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RHEUM%2F80559\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef80559 \">table 1</a>). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-and-classification-of-scleroderma-disorders\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview and classification of scleroderma disorders&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Radiographs of the hands may reveal soft tissue calcifications (calcinosis cutis) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RADIOL%2F97989\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef97989 \">image 1</a>) and resorption of the distal phalangeal tufts (acro-osteolysis). Articular erosions, joint space narrowing, and demineralization are less common radiographic findings [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-clinical-manifestations-of-systemic-sclerosis-scleroderma-in-adults/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].</p><p>A small percentage of patients with SSc have no skin induration (termed SSc sine scleroderma) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-clinical-manifestations-of-systemic-sclerosis-scleroderma-in-adults/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. Although there is no clinically evident skin sclerosis, these patients have characteristic vascular <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> fibrotic features of systemic disease, including Raynaud phenomenon, gastrointestinal involvement, renal crisis, pulmonary hypertension, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> interstitial lung disease.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Limited cutaneous SSc</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In patients with limited cutaneous SSc (lcSSc), skin sclerosis is restricted to the hands, the distal forearm, and, to a lesser extent, the face and neck. These patients generally have prominent vascular manifestations, including severe Raynaud phenomenon and cutaneous telangiectasia. Many patients with lcSSc have manifestations of the CREST syndrome (<strong>C</strong>alcinosis cutis, <strong>R</strong>aynaud phenomenon, <strong>E</strong>sophageal dysmotility, <strong>S</strong>clerodactyly, and <strong>T</strong>elangiectasia).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Diffuse cutaneous SSc</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Sclerotic skin on the chest, abdomen, or upper arms and shoulders is indicative of diffuse cutaneous SSc (dcSSc). Patients with dcSSc are more likely to have, or to develop, significant internal organ damage due to ischemic injury or fibrosis than those with limited cutaneous SSc.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h1\">VASCULAR DISEASE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Vascular dysfunction is a significant component of the pathogenesis of systemic sclerosis (SSc). The most characteristic clinical manifestation of vascular dysfunction of SSc is Raynaud phenomenon, defined as sequential color changes in the digits precipitated by cold, stress, or even change in temperatures. Raynaud phenomenon is due to arterial vasoconstriction in the digits. The color changes of pallor (&quot;white&quot;), acrocyanosis (&quot;blue&quot;), and reperfusion hyperemia (&quot;red&quot;) are characteristic. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-the-raynaud-phenomenon\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of the Raynaud phenomenon&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Vascular injury and consequent chronic tissue damage underlie other serious systemic complications of SSc, including gastric antral vascular ectasia, digital ischemic ulcers, pulmonary artery hypertension, scleroderma renal crisis, and myocardial infarction.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Raynaud phenomenon</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Raynaud phenomenon is classically viewed as reversible vasospasm due to functional changes in the digital arteries of the hands and feet. However, in many patients with SSc, progressive structural changes develop in the small blood vessels, with permanently impaired flow. In such patients, episodes of Raynaud phenomenon may be prolonged and can result in ischemic digital ulceration or infarction.</p><p>It is important to realize that persons presenting with Raynaud phenomenon may have primary (no definable underlying disease) or secondary Raynaud phenomenon. Whereas Raynaud phenomenon is seen in SSc and other connective tissue diseases, as well as a number of disorders which result in abnormal blood flow (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RHEUM%2F77253\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef77253 \">table 2</a>), primary Raynaud phenomenon is common in the general population, occurs in otherwise healthy individuals, and almost always follows a benign course. In patients with lcSSc, Raynaud phenomenon generally precedes other disease manifestations, sometimes by years or even decades. In contrast, in patients with dcSSc, the onset of Raynaud phenomenon generally coincides with, and in some cases may even follow, the appearance of characteristic skin or musculoskeletal manifestations.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1757083109\"><span class=\"h2\">Thromboembolic disease</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>An increased risk of venous thromboembolism (VTE) has been reported among patients with SSc [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-clinical-manifestations-of-systemic-sclerosis-scleroderma-in-adults/abstract/11,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,12</a>]. A large population-based study observed a threefold increased risk of pulmonary embolism, deep vein thrombosis, and VTE among 1245&nbsp;patients with incident SSc,&nbsp;compared with matched non-SSc controls, after adjusting for relevant risk factors such as age, sex, and recent hospitalizations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-clinical-manifestations-of-systemic-sclerosis-scleroderma-in-adults/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. The increased risk of VTE was highest during the first year after SSc diagnosis.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h1\">EXTRACUTANEOUS ORGAN INVOLVEMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Extracutaneous organ involvement is virtually universal in systemic sclerosis (SSc). Along with musculoskeletal involvement, the lungs, kidneys, gastrointestinal tract, and heart are commonly affected (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RHEUM%2F67889\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef67889 \">table 3</a>).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h2\">Gastrointestinal involvement</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Nearly 90 percent of patients with either subtype of SSc (diffuse cutaneous SSc [dcSSc] or limited cutaneous SSc [lcSSc]) have evidence of gastrointestinal involvement [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-clinical-manifestations-of-systemic-sclerosis-scleroderma-in-adults/abstract/13,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,14</a>]. Nearly half of these patients may have no symptoms. These issues are discussed in detail separately but will be briefly reviewed here. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=gastrointestinal-manifestations-of-systemic-sclerosis-scleroderma\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Gastrointestinal manifestations of systemic sclerosis (scleroderma)&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Esophageal hypomotility and incompetence of the lower esophageal sphincter disease were the earliest described visceral manifestations of SSc. Symptoms principally result from chronic gastroesophageal reflux, with subsequent chronic esophagitis and stricture formation, Barrett's esophagus, and pulmonary microaspiration.</p><p>Any part of the gastrointestinal tract from mouth to anus may be affected in SSc. Common symptoms of gastrointestinal involvement include dysphagia and choking, heartburn, hoarseness, cough after swallowing, bloating, alternating constipation and diarrhea, pseudo-obstruction and bacterial small bowel overgrowth with malabsorption, and fecal incontinence. Chronic gastroesophageal reflux and recurrent episodes of microaspiration may contribute to the development or progression of interstitial lung disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-clinical-manifestations-of-systemic-sclerosis-scleroderma-in-adults/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. Vascular ectasia (angiodysplasia) in the antrum of the stomach (&quot;watermelon stomach&quot;) is frequent and may be a cause of chronic gastrointestinal bleeding and anemia.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h2\">Pulmonary involvement</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Pulmonary involvement is seen in more than 70 percent of patients with SSc. The two principal clinical manifestations are interstitial lung disease (also called fibrosing alveolitis or pulmonary fibrosis) and pulmonary vascular disease, leading to pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F62662\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef62662 \">table 4</a>). These issues are discussed in detail separately but will be briefly reviewed here.

The most common symptoms are breathlessness on exertion (which may progress to dyspnea at rest) and a nonproductive cough. However, patients may have alveolitis and early pulmonary fibrosis in the absence of respiratory symptoms or physical findings. Chest pain is infrequent and hemoptysis is rare. In advanced disease, auscultation over the lungs reveals &quot;Velcro&quot; rales most prominent at the lung bases.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h3\">Pulmonary vascular disease</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Pulmonary vascular disease, primarily pulmonary arterial hypertension, occurs in 10 to 40 percent of patients with SSc and is more common in patients with limited cutaneous disease. Vascular disease may occur with or without concurrent interstitial lung disease. Dyspnea with exertion and diminished exercise tolerance are the most common initial symptoms, but these may be absent until the disease is fairly advanced.</p><p>Pulmonary arterial hypertension is generally a late complication of SSc. It is typically progressive and, if severe, can lead to cor pulmonale and right-sided heart failure. Thrombosis of the pulmonary vessels is a common late-stage complication and is a frequent cause of death.

Most commonly, cardiac complications are secondary to pulmonary arterial hypertension, but primary cardiac involvement has been increasingly recognized. The manifestations of primary cardiac involvement in SSc include pericarditis, pericardial effusion, myocardial fibrosis, heart failure, myocarditis, microvascular disease, myocardial infarction (MI), conduction disturbances, and arrhythmias [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-clinical-manifestations-of-systemic-sclerosis-scleroderma-in-adults/abstract/22,24\" class=\"abstract_t\">22,24</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H17\"><span class=\"h3\">Pericardial disease</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Symptomatic pericarditis occurs in 7 to 20 percent of patients with SSc, but pathologic evidence of pericardial involvement is observed in 70 to 80 percent at autopsy.

Two potential explanations for this association have been suggested. First, pericardial effusion may simply be a marker of active <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> severe SSc. Second, the presence of a large pericardial effusion could compromise cardiac output, resulting in renal hypoperfusion and triggering a cascade of events culminating in scleroderma renal crisis.

It is distinguishable from the fibrosis associated with coronary atherosclerotic disease and is independent of the secondary cardiac involvement that may result from pulmonary hypertension. Myocardial fibrosis is thought to result from recurrent vasospasm of small vessels and is often associated with contraction band necrosis, a histological lesion indicative of myocardial ischemia (MI) followed by reperfusion. The degree of myocardial fibrosis may be increased in SSc patients with a long history of Raynaud phenomenon [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-clinical-manifestations-of-systemic-sclerosis-scleroderma-in-adults/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Myocardial involvement can lead to systolic or more often diastolic ventricular dysfunction.

After adjusting for age, sex, and comorbidities, SSc was found to be an independent risk factor for acute MI (HR 2.45, CI 1.60-3.75). There also appeared to be no effect of immunosuppressive therapy on the risk of MI.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H19\"><span class=\"h3\">Arrhythmias</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Conduction system disease and arrhythmias are common. They are likely to result from fibrosis of the myocardium and conduction system. Many deaths among SSc patients are sudden, and some may result from a ventricular arrhythmia.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H20\"><span class=\"h2\">Musculoskeletal disease</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The earliest manifestations of diffuse SSc are swelling of the hands, arthralgia, myalgia, and fatigue.</p><p>Joint pain, immobility and contractures develop as the result of fibrosis around tendons and other periarticular structures. Contractures of the fingers from this process are most common, but large joint contractures involving the wrists, elbows, and ankles may also occur. The process is sometimes associated with palpable <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> audible deep tendon friction rubs. Tendon friction rubs occur predominantly in patients with dcSSc. The most common sites of involvement are the extensor and flexor tendons of the fingers and wrist, tendons over the elbow (triceps), knee (patellar), and ankle (anterior and posterior tibial, peroneal and Achilles).</p><p>Frank inflammatory arthritis is uncommon in SSc. When present, it is usually accompanied by joint contractures and tendon friction rubs and is more likely to occur in patients with diffuse cutaneous SSc [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-clinical-manifestations-of-systemic-sclerosis-scleroderma-in-adults/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. The pattern of arthritis is most commonly polyarticular, but oligoarticular and monoarticular patterns can also be observed. In some patients, an erosive polyarticular arthritis of the small joints, particularly the metacarpophalangeal joints and wrists, can be seen. The distal interphalangeal&nbsp;joints are generally not affected. The pattern of articular involvement in the hands is similar to that in rheumatoid arthritis, and it can be difficult to distinguish an overlap syndrome from an SSc-related primary arthropathy in such cases.</p><p>Several studies suggest that the presence of tendon friction rubs in patients with SSc is a marker for aggressive disease and increased risk of internal organ involvement [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-clinical-manifestations-of-systemic-sclerosis-scleroderma-in-adults/abstract/31-33\" class=\"abstract_t\">31-33</a>]. Destructive joint disease in a patient with SSc may suggest an overlap syndrome with rheumatoid arthritis.

This was illustrated in a survey that compared 43 SSc patients to 23 patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-clinical-manifestations-of-systemic-sclerosis-scleroderma-in-adults/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>]. Among the SSc patients, 81 percent had self-reported erectile dysfunction versus 48 percent of those with RA. While Raynaud phenomenon was more prevalent in SSc than in RA (86 versus 19 percent), it was not an independent predictor of erectile dysfunction.</p><p>Women with SSc may also have sexual dysfunction. This is related to decreased vaginal lubrication or constriction of the vaginal introitus. In one study, dyspareunia was present in 56 percent of 60 women with SSc [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-clinical-manifestations-of-systemic-sclerosis-scleroderma-in-adults/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H23\"><span class=\"h1\">PREGNANCY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A detailed discussion of issues related to pregnancy in SSc is presented separately.

The most significant association appears to be with lung cancer, which accounts for approximately one-third of the cancers seen in SSc patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-clinical-manifestations-of-systemic-sclerosis-scleroderma-in-adults/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>]; however, a significantly increased incidence was not noted in a population with a high background rate of lung cancer [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-clinical-manifestations-of-systemic-sclerosis-scleroderma-in-adults/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>]. In a study of 632 Australian patients with SSc, 19 developed lung cancer [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-clinical-manifestations-of-systemic-sclerosis-scleroderma-in-adults/abstract/45\" class=\"abstract_t\">45</a>]. Those who smoked were seven times as likely to develop cancer as those who did not. Pulmonary fibrosis and antitopoisomerase antibodies were not risk factors for lung cancer.</p><p>The issue of malignancy in SSc was assessed in a nationwide population-based, retrospective cohort analysis from Denmark performed between 1977 and 2006; 2046 patients with systemic sclerosis were evaluated [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-clinical-manifestations-of-systemic-sclerosis-scleroderma-in-adults/abstract/43\" class=\"abstract_t\">43</a>]. Patient records were compared with a cohort from the Danish Cancer Registry. The ratio of cancers in SSc patients to expected cancers (the standardized incidence ratio, SIR) was 1.5 overall. The most frequent cancers were lung (SIR 1.6), hematologic (SIR 2.5), and immune-related (SIR 1.4).</p><p>A similar, modest increase in the overall risk of malignant disease (SIR 1.55) was also seen in a cohort of 769 patients seen from 1987 to 2002 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-clinical-manifestations-of-systemic-sclerosis-scleroderma-in-adults/abstract/44\" class=\"abstract_t\">44</a>]. There was, however, a marked increase in the risk of esophageal carcinoma (SIR 15.9 [95% CI 4.2-27.6]) and oropharyngeal carcinoma (SIR 9.63 [95% CI 2.97-16.3]).</p><p>The cause of an increased cancer risk in SSc is not well understood. The association with lung and skin cancers suggests that sites of disease activity may be prone to malignant transformation. </p><p>A close temporal relationship between the onset of cancer and of SSc has been observed among patients with autoantibodies to RNA polymerase <span class=\"nowrap\">I/III</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-clinical-manifestations-of-systemic-sclerosis-scleroderma-in-adults/abstract/46,47\" class=\"abstract_t\">46,47</a>]. One study demonstrated that tumors with somatic mutations in the POLR3A gene, which encodes for RNA polymerase III, may induce the development of autoantibodies to RNA polymerase III and thereby trigger the development of SSc [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-clinical-manifestations-of-systemic-sclerosis-scleroderma-in-adults/abstract/48\" class=\"abstract_t\">48</a>]. In a series of 16 patients with SSc who also had cancer, somatic mutations in the POLR3A gene were present in the tumors from six of eight patients with anti-RNA polymerase III antibodies; by contrast, the POLR3A gene was not mutated in the eight patients without such antibodies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-clinical-manifestations-of-systemic-sclerosis-scleroderma-in-adults/abstract/48\" class=\"abstract_t\">48</a>]. Among the eight patients with antibodies to RNA polymerase III, the cancers were diagnosed between five months prior to their SSc diagnosis and 2.5 years afterward. However, additional studies are needed to determine whether or not somatic mutations in tumors, with subsequent development of autoantibodies, represent a potential mechanistic link between cancer and SSc. &#160;</p><p>There are conflicting data regarding whether the presence of antibodies to topoisomerase-I (Scl-70) identifies a population of SSc patients who are more likely to have, or to develop, cancer [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-clinical-manifestations-of-systemic-sclerosis-scleroderma-in-adults/abstract/49,50\" class=\"abstract_t\">49,50</a>]. &#160;</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"PATIENT_INFORMATION\"><span class=\"h1\">INFORMATION FOR PATIENTS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>UpToDate offers two types of patient education materials, &ldquo;The Basics&rdquo; and &ldquo;Beyond the Basics.&rdquo; The Basics patient education pieces are written in plain language, at the 5<sup>th</sup> to 6<sup>th</sup> grade reading level, and they answer the four or five key questions a patient might have about a given condition.

(See <a href=\"#H1\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Skin involvement is a nearly universal feature of SSc and is characterized by variable thickening and hardening of the skin. The fingers, hands, and face are generally the earliest areas of the body involved. Edematous swelling and erythema of the skin generally precedes skin induration (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RHEUM%2F96749\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef96749 \">figure 1</a>). Other skin manifestations can occur. Malaise, fatigue, arthralgias, and myalgias are common. (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Skin involvement'</a> above and <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'General manifestations'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The most obvious clinical manifestation of vascular dysfunction of SSc is Raynaud phenomenon, which is due to arterial vasoconstriction in the digits. Characteristic sequential color changes in the digits of pallor (&quot;white&quot;), acrocyanosis (&quot;blue&quot;), and reperfusion hyperemia (&quot;red&quot;) are precipitated by cold, stress, or even change in temperatures. (See <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'Vascular disease'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Vascular injury and subsequent chronic damage underlie other serious complications of SSc, including pulmonary artery hypertension, scleroderma renal crisis, and gastric antral vascular ectasia, and also contribute to the pathogenesis of cardiac and gastrointestinal complications.

Symptoms are present in more than half of patients and most commonly result from chronic gastroesophageal reflux, with subsequent chronic esophagitis and stricture formation, Barrett&rsquo;s esophagus, and abnormal motility. (See <a href=\"#H9\" class=\"local\">'Gastrointestinal involvement'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pulmonary involvement is seen in more than 70 percent of patients. The principal pulmonary manifestations are interstitial lung disease and pulmonary vascular disease. The latter leads to pulmonary arterial hypertension and is more common in patients with limited cutaneous disease. (See <a href=\"#H12\" class=\"local\">'Pulmonary vascular disease'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Clinical renal disease is observed in up to half of patients. Findings may include albuminuria, a mild elevation in the plasma creatinine concentration, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> hypertension. Pathologic vascular changes are present in the kidneys in 60 to 80 percent of patients with dcSSc. Scleroderma renal crisis, the most serious renal complication, occurs in up to 10 to 15 percent of patients, generally among those with early-stage dcSSc, and is associated with a poor prognosis.
