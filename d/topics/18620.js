Infection may also involve the adjacent intervertebral disc space, which has no direct blood supply in adults. Infection can also arise following surgery or injection of the disc space or via contiguous spread from adjacent soft tissue infection.</p><p>The terms vertebral osteomyelitis and discitis are often used interchangeably, and the diagnosis and management of the two entities are similar in most patients.

In many cases, however, the primary site of infection cannot be identified [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vertebral-osteomyelitis-and-discitis-in-adults/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. Less common causes include infected native or prosthetic valvular infections, direct spread from a ruptured esophagus, diverticular or renal abscesses, and infected aortic lesions (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RADIOL%2F91706\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef91706 \">image 2</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vertebral-osteomyelitis-and-discitis-in-adults/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].</p><p>Vertebral osteomyelitis has been reported as a complication of lumbar puncture, myelography, translumbar aortography, chemonucleolysis, discography, facet joint corticosteroid injection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vertebral-osteomyelitis-and-discitis-in-adults/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>], epidural catheter placement, and epidural corticosteroid injection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vertebral-osteomyelitis-and-discitis-in-adults/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h3\">Hematogenous spread</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Hematogenous spread is by far the most common cause of vertebral osteomyelitis. Adult vertebral bone has abundant, highly vascular marrow with a sluggish but high-volume blood flow via nutrient vessels of the posterior spinal artery. With aging, these vessels progressively develop a characteristic &quot;corkscrew&quot; anatomy that may predispose to bacterial hematogenous seeding. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hematogenous-osteomyelitis-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Hematogenous osteomyelitis in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Bloodborne organisms that randomly percolate through the marrow cavity of the vertebrae can spontaneously produce a local suppurative infection. Initiation of infection may be facilitated by recent or prior bone trauma with disruption of normal architecture.</p><p>The segmental arteries supplying the vertebrae usually bifurcate to supply two adjacent end plates of contiguous vertebrae. Thus, hematogenous vertebral osteomyelitis often causes bone destruction in two adjacent vertebral bodies and their intervertebral disc. The lumbar vertebral bodies are most often involved, followed by thoracic and, less commonly, cervical vertebrae. Hematogenous sacral osteomyelitis is rare.</p><p>Skip lesions with more than one level of spinal infection occur in less than 5 percent of reported cases. Noncontiguous epidural abscesses appear to be more common (10 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vertebral-osteomyelitis-and-discitis-in-adults/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>].</p><p>It was previously postulated that spread of infection might occur via vertebral veins known as Batson's plexus [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vertebral-osteomyelitis-and-discitis-in-adults/abstract/12,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,13</a>]; this theory has been discounted.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H711629856\"><span class=\"h3\">Contiguous spread</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Contiguous spread of infection may occur from tissues that are adjacent to the spine, such as the aorta, esophagus, or bowel. In such cases, extension of infection is facilitated by the absence of a circumferential cartilage plate or a layer of subchondral compact bone [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vertebral-osteomyelitis-and-discitis-in-adults/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>].</p><p>Sacral osteomyelitis most commonly occurs as a complication of a sacral pressure ulcer, although it can follow pelvic infection, trauma, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> surgery. Typically, it is polymicrobial and restricted to cortical bone [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vertebral-osteomyelitis-and-discitis-in-adults/abstract/15,16\" class=\"abstract_t\">15,16</a>].

Extension of infection anteriorly or laterally can lead to paravertebral, retropharyngeal, mediastinal, subphrenic, retroperitoneal, or psoas abscess (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RADIOL%2F91708\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef91708 \">image 3</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F100372\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef100372 \">table 1</a>). Development of epidural or paravertebral abscess is more common in the setting of gram-positive infection than gram-negative infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vertebral-osteomyelitis-and-discitis-in-adults/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. In addition, thoracic vertebral infections can extend into the pleural space to produce an empyema [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vertebral-osteomyelitis-and-discitis-in-adults/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>].</p><p>Infection can occur in spinal elements other than the vertebral bodies, including the posterior spinous processes, the facet joints, the pedicles, and, rarely, the odontoid process [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vertebral-osteomyelitis-and-discitis-in-adults/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h1\">MICROBIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Most patients have monomicrobial infection. The most common cause of vertebral osteomyelitis is <em>Staphylococcus aureus</em>, accounting for more than 50 percent of cases in most series from developed countries. The relative importance of methicillin-resistant <em>S. aureus </em>(MRSA) as a cause of vertebral osteomyelitis has increased as the proportion of <em>S. aureus</em> strains that are methicillin resistant have increased.</p><p>Other causes of vertebral osteomyelitis include [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vertebral-osteomyelitis-and-discitis-in-adults/abstract/20,21\" class=\"abstract_t\">20,21</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Enteric gram-negative bacilli, particularly following urinary tract instrumentation</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><em>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</em> and <em>Candida</em> spp, which are frequently associated with intravascular access sepsis or injection drug use [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vertebral-osteomyelitis-and-discitis-in-adults/abstract/21,22\" class=\"abstract_t\">21,22</a>] (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=candida-osteoarticular-infections\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Candida osteoarticular infections&quot;</a>)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Groups B and G hemolytic streptococci, especially in patients with diabetes mellitus (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=group-b-streptococcus-virulence-factors-and-pathogenic-mechanisms\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Group B streptococcus: Virulence factors and pathogenic mechanisms&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=group-c-and-group-g-streptococcal-infection\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Group C and group G streptococcal infection&quot;</a>)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Tuberculous infection (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=skeletal-tuberculosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Skeletal tuberculosis&quot;</a>)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Brucellosis (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-treatment-of-brucellosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and treatment of brucellosis&quot;</a>)</p><p/><p>Geography also influences the organisms associated with vertebral osteomyelitis. <em>Brucella melitensis</em> is an important pathogen in the Middle East and Mediterranean countries; <em>Burkholderia pseudomallei</em> (melioidosis) is a potential pathogen in patients from periequatorial regions, and <em>Salmonella</em> and <em>Entamoeba histolytica</em> are occasional causes in Africa or South America.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL FEATURES</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Symptoms and signs</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The major clinical manifestation of vertebral osteomyelitis is back or neck pain; pain is typically localized to the infected disc space area and is exacerbated by physical activity or percussion to the affected area. Pain may radiate to the abdomen, leg, scrotum, groin, or perineum.</p><p>Spinal pain usually begins insidiously and progressively worsens over several weeks to months. In one series of 64 patients with hematogenous vertebral osteomyelitis, the mean duration of symptoms was 48 &plusmn; 40 days [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vertebral-osteomyelitis-and-discitis-in-adults/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. The pain is often worse at night; initially, it may be relieved by bed rest. Pain may be absent in patients with paraplegia.</p><p>Patients whose infections extend posteriorly into the epidural space may present with clinical features of an epidural abscess; this often consists of focal and severe back pain, followed by radiculopathy, then motor weakness and sensory changes, and eventual paralysis. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=spinal-epidural-abscess\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Spinal epidural abscess&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Fever is an inconsistent finding. One review noted a frequency of 52 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vertebral-osteomyelitis-and-discitis-in-adults/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]; lower rates have been noted in other studies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vertebral-osteomyelitis-and-discitis-in-adults/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>].</p><p>Local tenderness to gentle spinal percussion is the most useful clinical sign but is not highly specific. Back pain may be accompanied by reduced mobility <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> spasm of nearby muscles. Rarely, a mass or spinal deformity may be visible.</p><p>The physical examination should include palpation for a distended bladder, evaluation for signs of psoas abscess (eg, flank pain and pain with hip extension), and a careful neurologic assessment of the lower limbs.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h2\">Laboratory findings</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The leukocyte count may be elevated or normal. Elevations in the erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), which can exceed 100 <span class=\"nowrap\">mm/h,</span> and C-reactive protein (CRP) are observed in more than 80 percent of patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vertebral-osteomyelitis-and-discitis-in-adults/abstract/4,24,25\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,24,25</a>].</p><p>If elevated, the ESR and CRP are useful for following the efficacy of therapy.

It should also be suspected in patients with fever and new peripheral neurologic symptoms (with or without back pain) and in patients with new back or neck pain following a recent episode of <em>S. aureus</em> bacteremia.</p><p>The diagnosis of vertebral osteomyelitis or discitis is established based on positive culture obtained from computed tomography (CT)-guided biopsy of the involved vertebra(e) <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> disc space. The diagnosis may be inferred in the setting of clinical and radiographic findings typical of vertebral osteomyelitis and positive blood cultures with a likely pathogen such as <em>S. aureus</em>. Similarly, the diagnosis may be inferred in the setting of histopathologic findings consistent with infection in the absence of positive culture data, particularly in the setting of recent antibiotic administration. For circumstances in which there are no positive microbiologic cultures or Gram stains and a biopsy cannot be performed, the diagnosis may be inferred in the setting of suggestive clinical and typical radiographic findings and persistently elevated inflammatory markers.</p><p>Back pain due to vertebral osteomyelitis may respond to bed rest and conservative measures initially, leading to the erroneous assumption that minor trauma, muscle strain, or other noninfectious cause of back pain is present. In addition, a history of degenerative spinal disease or recent trauma may obscure or delay the true diagnosis.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H26204392\"><span class=\"h2\">Suggested clinical approach</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Initial evaluation of patients with suspected vertebral osteomyelitis begins with careful history and physical examination; patients should have a thorough neurologic exam and should be questioned about predisposing factors including presence of indwelling devices, recent instrumentation, and injection drug use. Initial diagnostic tests include inflammatory markers (erythrocyte sedimentation rate [ESR] and C-reactive protein [CRP]) and cultures (blood and urine), followed by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the spine (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F104402\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef104402 \">algorithm 1</a>). (See <a href=\"#H10615308\" class=\"local\">'Radiographic imaging'</a> below.)</p><p>Evaluation for surgery is warranted for patients with neurologic deficits, radiographic evidence of epidural or paravertebral abscess, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> cord compression (threatened or actual). (See <a href=\"#H30\" class=\"local\">'Surgery'</a> below.)</p><p>In the absence of the above conditions warranting surgical intervention, patients with radiographic evidence of vertebral osteomyelitis should undergo CT-guided needle biopsy of the affected bone and aspiration of abscess if present [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vertebral-osteomyelitis-and-discitis-in-adults/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. The specimens should be sent for bacterial (aerobic and anaerobic), fungal, and mycobacterial culture as well as histologic examination.</p><p>If possible, antimicrobial therapy should be withheld until a microbiologic diagnosis is confirmed. Clinical exceptions include neurologic compromise and sepsis; in these circumstances, empiric antibiotic therapy is warranted [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vertebral-osteomyelitis-and-discitis-in-adults/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H23\" class=\"local\">'Antimicrobial therapy'</a> below.)</p><p>A needle biopsy may not be necessary in patients with clinical and radiographic findings typical of vertebral osteomyelitis and positive blood cultures with a likely pathogen (such as <em>S. aureus</em>,<em> S. lugdunensis</em>) or in patients with positive serology for <em>Brucella</em> (which is warranted for patients with relevant risk factors)<em> </em>[<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vertebral-osteomyelitis-and-discitis-in-adults/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]<em>.</em> Similarly, a positive blood culture due to a gram-negative enteric rod, <em>P. aeruginosa</em>, or other invasive pathogen is usually good evidence that the same pathogen is also the cause of the spinal infection. However, blood culture isolates do not always correlate with culture results from needle biopsy; therefore, needle biopsy is warranted for cases in which an alternate source for the bacteremia is present or strongly suspected [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vertebral-osteomyelitis-and-discitis-in-adults/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=microbiology-epidemiology-and-pathogenesis-of-brucella\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Microbiology, epidemiology, and pathogenesis of Brucella&quot;</a>.)</p><p>If cultures of blood and the needle aspirate are negative and the clinical suspicion for vertebral osteomyelitis remains high (on the basis of clinical and radiographic findings), we advocate performing a second biopsy. In a retrospective study, first biopsy was positive in 43 percent of cases and a second biopsy in 40 percent of cases; when combined with blood culture results, this approach led to microbiological diagnosis in nearly 75 percent of cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vertebral-osteomyelitis-and-discitis-in-adults/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. Performing blood cultures immediately following biopsy does not appear to add any benefit.</p><p>If repeat biopsy specimens and initial blood cultures are nondiagnostic, we usually initiate empiric therapy as discussed below. If such therapy does not result in objective clinical improvement in three to four weeks, a third percutaneous needle biopsy or an open surgical biopsy should be performed. Some suggest that, if the first set of cultures is negative, open biopsy be pursued before starting antibiotic therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vertebral-osteomyelitis-and-discitis-in-adults/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>].

However, a rapid decline was not common: the ESR either rose or failed to decline during the first two weeks of treatment in 19 of 32 patients who were ultimately cured with medical therapy. Similar findings have been reported by others [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vertebral-osteomyelitis-and-discitis-in-adults/abstract/52\" class=\"abstract_t\">52</a>].

In contrast, 5 of 38 patients (13 percent) and 4 of 14 patients (29 percent) whose initial follow-up images demonstrated equivocal changes or evidence of radiographic worsening subsequently failed medical treatment during long-term follow-up.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H495155972\"><span class=\"h3\">Associated hardware</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Development of vertebral osteomyelitis in the presence of spinal hardware typically reflects a complication of the hardware placement. Most patients have an associated wound infection, although rarely hematogenous seeding of hardware can occur. In such cases, treatment should be based culture data obtained from wound drainage <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> operative debridement. Typically such infections are treated with intravenous antimicrobial therapy tailored to culture results until bone fusion has been achieved (at least six weeks). If removal of the hardware following union is feasible, repeat cultures should be obtained at the time of hardware removal to guide subsequent therapy, which typically includes at least another few weeks of antimicrobial therapy. If hardware removal is not feasible, antimicrobial suppression (tailored to culture and susceptibility data) may be required either after or in lieu of a long course of parenteral therapy. Rarely oral therapy can be used as primary therapy if the causative organism is susceptible to an oral agent such as quinolone.</p><p>Issues related to treatment of infections associated with hardware are discussed further separately.

Placing hardware in the setting of spinal infection has raised concern regarding recurrent or chronic infection due to adherence of bacteria to foreign material. One retrospective study has indicated that, when spinal stabilization is required, timely instrumentation may be safe in the setting of appropriate selection and duration of antimicrobial therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vertebral-osteomyelitis-and-discitis-in-adults/abstract/54\" class=\"abstract_t\">54</a>]. Another study reported outcomes for 100 patients with vertebral osteomyelitis who underwent a variety of surgical procedures, which were highly variable; approximately one-quarter of patients had residual pain and a similar proportion required repeat surgery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vertebral-osteomyelitis-and-discitis-in-adults/abstract/55\" class=\"abstract_t\">55</a>].</p><p>In contrast to the preceding study, a report of 42 patients with vertebral osteomyelitis who required surgery, 40 had complete resolution of their deficits with no recurrences following a two-stage procedure that included anterior debridement and strut grafting followed by delayed instrumented posterior fusions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vertebral-osteomyelitis-and-discitis-in-adults/abstract/56\" class=\"abstract_t\">56</a>]. Patients received an average of 14.4 days of intravenous antibiotics after the anterior debridement and six weeks of intravenous therapy following the posterior instrumentation. (See <a href=\"#H32\" class=\"local\">'Prognosis'</a> below.)</p><p>In general, paravertebral abscess may usually be managed by CT-guided catheter drainage. Epidural abscess in the setting of neurologic deficit should be managed with surgical intervention; this may include open drainage, bone debridement, and interbody fusion (with or without bone grafting and posterior instrumentation). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=spinal-epidural-abscess\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Spinal epidural abscess&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10616718\"><span class=\"h2\">Adjunctive measures</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Bed rest and opioid analgesics are generally helpful in managing pain after the diagnosis is established. A fitted back brace may provide substantial back relief and allow mobility for patients with severe pain.</p><p>Early bed rest may be particularly important, especially in lumbar osteomyelitis. When the patient is upright, the whole weight of the upper body is transmitted to the point of active infection. It is our practice to initially put patients with severe pain to bed for at least 10 days using intensive in-bed, non&ndash;weight bearing physical therapy and long-acting oral analgesics. In such circumstances, prophylactic measures for prevention of deep venous thrombosis are warranted. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prevention-of-venous-thromboembolic-disease-in-acutely-ill-hospitalized-medical-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Prevention of venous thromboembolic disease in acutely ill hospitalized medical adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H32\"><span class=\"h1\">PROGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The most serious complication of vertebral osteomyelitis is neurologic impairment secondary to either abscess formation or bony collapse. Most patients have gradual improvement in back pain after therapy is begun, and the pain typically disappears after bone fusion occurs. However, back pain can persist. The best way to reduce the morbidity and mortality associated with vertebral osteomyelitis is to minimize the time between the onset of symptoms and the initiation of appropriate therapy.</p><p>The long-term outcome in vertebral osteomyelitis was evaluated in a retrospective study of 253 patients with vertebral osteomyelitis with median duration of follow-up 6.5 years (range 2 days to 38 years) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vertebral-osteomyelitis-and-discitis-in-adults/abstract/57\" class=\"abstract_t\">57</a>]. Relapse occurred in 14 percent and residual symptoms occurred in 31 percent; 11 percent died (all-cause mortality). Surgery was performed in 43 percent of patients and was successful in 79 percent of cases. Independent risk factors for death or residual symptoms included neurologic compromise at the time of diagnosis (eg, motor weakness, spinal instability, paralysis), nosocomial acquisition of infection, and delay in diagnosis. The results of this study need to be interpreted with caution since cases were collected over a long time period (1950 to 1994), which means that some cases occurred prior to the development of modern imaging and diagnostic techniques.</p><p>In another study including 260 patients with vertebral osteomyelitis, three-quarters of treatment failures occurred within 4.7 months of diagnosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vertebral-osteomyelitis-and-discitis-in-adults/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. Multivariate analysis indicated that infection with <em>S. aureus</em> was associated with increased risk of relapse. Longer-term outcomes included neurological deficit (16 percent) and persistent back pain (32 percent).</p><p>Major depression is a well-recognized complication of chronic back pain (about a third of patients) and is an important potential long-term consequence [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vertebral-osteomyelitis-and-discitis-in-adults/abstract/58,59\" class=\"abstract_t\">58,59</a>].</p><p>Overall morbidity and mortality tends to increase with age; this may be related to delayed diagnosis (especially when people have background degenerative spinal disease or have communication difficulties), multiple comorbidities, and age-related frailty [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vertebral-osteomyelitis-and-discitis-in-adults/abstract/60\" class=\"abstract_t\">60</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H33\"><span class=\"h2\">Mortality</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Prior to the discovery of antibiotics, vertebral osteomyelitis was fatal in approximately 25 percent of cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vertebral-osteomyelitis-and-discitis-in-adults/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>].

(See <a href=\"#H76800064\" class=\"local\">'Mechanisms of infection'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The most important infecting organism in vertebral osteomyelitis is <em>Staphylococcus aureus</em>, accounting for more than 50 percent of cases. Other pathogens include enteric gram-negative bacilli, <em>Candida</em> spp, <em>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</em>, groups B and G streptococci, <em>Brucella</em> spp, and <em>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</em>. (See <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Microbiology'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The major clinical manifestation of vertebral osteomyelitis is back or neck pain, with or without fever. The most common clinical finding is local tenderness to percussion over the involved posterior spinous processes. The most common laboratory abnormalities are elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate and C-reactive protein. (See <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'Clinical features'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Vertebral osteomyelitis should be suspected on the basis of clinical features and radiographic studies (magnetic resonance imaging is the most sensitive radiographic technique) and confirmed by biopsy of the infected intervertebral disc space or vertebral bone. Blood cultures are positive in up to 50 to 70 percent of patients; a biopsy may not be necessary in patients with clinical and radiographic findings typical of vertebral osteomyelitis and positive blood cultures with a likely pathogen. (See <a href=\"#H11\" class=\"local\">'Diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Every effort should be made to identify the pathogen(s) before starting antimicrobial treatment.

Surgery is necessary in a minority of patients with vertebral osteomyelitis; prompt surgery is warranted for patients with focal neurologic deficits, epidural or paravertebral abscess, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> cord compression.

Clinical exceptions include neurologic compromise and sepsis; in these circumstances, empiric antibiotic therapy is warranted. Choice of antibiotic therapy should be guided by biopsy or blood culture results if available. For patients with negative culture results, empiric treatment is warranted based on the most likely organisms to cause infection. (See <a href=\"#H10616867\" class=\"local\">'Clinical approach'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We routinely treat for a minimum duration of 6 weeks. Longer duration of therapy (at least 8 weeks) is warranted for patients with undrained paravertebral abscess(es) <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> infection due to drug-resistant organisms (including methicillin-resistant <em>S. aureus</em>). The duration of therapy should be tailored to individual circumstances during the course of clinical follow-up.
