During breastfeeding, maternal combination antiretroviral treatment (ART) or infant antiretroviral prophylaxis strategies are comparably effective at reducing the risk of transmission [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-hiv-transmission-during-breastfeeding-in-resource-limited-settings/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>]. For programmatic reasons and maternal health benefits, the World Health Organization (WHO) recommends maternal antiretroviral treatment to reduce transmission during breastfeeding, as this allows for simplification of antiretroviral management of pregnant and breastfeeding women throughout the entire period of transmission risk [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-hiv-transmission-during-breastfeeding-in-resource-limited-settings/abstract/41,42\" class=\"abstract_t\">41,42</a>]. Maternal use of antiretroviral agents also has benefits to the health of the mother herself, and WHO guidelines recommend lifelong antiretroviral therapy (ART) for all HIV-infected individuals, including pregnant and breastfeeding women. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=when-to-initiate-antiretroviral-therapy-in-hiv-infected-patients#H1\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;When to initiate antiretroviral therapy in HIV-infected patients&quot;, section on 'Introduction'</a>.) </p><p>Infant antiretroviral use remains important as post-exposure prophylaxis after delivery and in settings in which maternal antiretroviral use is delayed or interrupted during breastfeeding.</p><p>Details on the duration of breastfeeding and the timing and selection of antiretroviral regimens are discussed below. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1036418907\"><span class=\"h2\">Options for infant feeding</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Recommendations on infant feeding must balance the risk of HIV transmission through breast-milk on one hand and the risk of malnutrition and serious infections through unsafe feeding practices on the other (see <a href=\"#H13613019\" class=\"local\">'Replacement feeding'</a> below). The WHO recommends that public health authorities should focus either on promoting breastfeeding and providing antiretroviral interventions to prevent transmission or on avoiding breastfeeding and providing alternate sources of safe nutrition [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-hiv-transmission-during-breastfeeding-in-resource-limited-settings/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>].</p><p>For HIV-infected women in those countries that have chosen to support breastfeeding with antiretroviral interventions, the WHO recommends exclusive breastfeeding for six months, in combination with maternal antiretroviral treatment and a period of infant prophylaxis, to minimize HIV transmission from the mother while optimizing the health benefits of breastfeeding for the infant [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-hiv-transmission-during-breastfeeding-in-resource-limited-settings/abstract/41,43\" class=\"abstract_t\">41,43</a>]. Subsequently, breastfeeding, along with maternal ART (with provision of ART adherence support) and appropriate complementary feeding, should continue without restrictions for up to 24 months or longer, similar to the general population [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-hiv-transmission-during-breastfeeding-in-resource-limited-settings/abstract/44\" class=\"abstract_t\">44</a>]. </p><p>Earlier studies suggested that exclusive breastfeeding was difficult to implement given cultural or logistic constraints with &lt;10 percent of women implementing exclusive breastfeeding despite counseling [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-hiv-transmission-during-breastfeeding-in-resource-limited-settings/abstract/45,46\" class=\"abstract_t\">45,46</a>]. With expanded counseling and home visits, higher levels of exclusive breastfeeding are possible, with some studies reporting &gt;80 percent of HIV-infected women exclusively breastfeeding at three months postpartum [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-hiv-transmission-during-breastfeeding-in-resource-limited-settings/abstract/47-49\" class=\"abstract_t\">47-49</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1036418913\"><span class=\"h2\">Maternal antiretroviral use</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1036418940\"><span class=\"h3\">When to initiate an antiretroviral regimen</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The WHO guidelines recommend initiation of antiretroviral therapy (ART) for all HIV-infected pregnant or breastfeeding women, regardless of their CD4 cell count, to reduce the risk of transmission to their infants and for their own clinical benefit [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-hiv-transmission-during-breastfeeding-in-resource-limited-settings/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>]. Breastfeeding women already taking ART should continue it. For other women, an ART regimen should be initiated as soon as there is a risk for mother-to-child transmission of HIV (ie, as soon as an HIV-infected woman is found to be breastfeeding or as soon as HIV is diagnosed in a breastfeeding woman) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-hiv-transmission-during-breastfeeding-in-resource-limited-settings/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>]. </p><p>These recommendations, initially released in 2015, replaced earlier guidelines (Option A) that endorsed combination ART for women who met criteria for treatment based on CD4 cell count or disease stage and a choice between maternal or infant use of antiretroviral prophylaxis during breastfeeding for women who did not meet criteria [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-hiv-transmission-during-breastfeeding-in-resource-limited-settings/abstract/50\" class=\"abstract_t\">50</a>]. While the available data suggest no difference in efficacy in preventing postnatal transmission between maternal or infant antiretroviral prophylaxis, the advantages of the updated recommendation include the ability to start a regimen without having to measure and wait for a CD4 cell count result and the ease of implementation of a single regimen that continues through the postpartum period. Additionally, mounting evidence has suggested a clinical benefit of ART, even to those with high CD4 cell counts, and a dramatically reduced risk of transmission to an uninfected sexual partner with successful ART [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-hiv-transmission-during-breastfeeding-in-resource-limited-settings/abstract/51\" class=\"abstract_t\">51</a>].

This is most likely related to the time that it takes for antiretroviral agents to lead to complete viral suppression.

Additional advantages of the regimen include antiviral potency, relatively low frequency of severe adverse effects, a greater likelihood of adherence with a once-daily dosing, affordability, and efficacy against hepatitis B virus. This regimen has not been explicitly studied in trials of preventing HIV transmission during breastfeeding; however, in the general HIV-infected population, it does result in viral suppression in the great majority of patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-hiv-transmission-during-breastfeeding-in-resource-limited-settings/abstract/52,53\" class=\"abstract_t\">52,53</a>], which is the most important clinical factor affecting the risk of mother-to-child transmission.

Fortunately, several randomized trials and observational studies in resource-limited settings have shown that use of antiretroviral medications by the mother or infant during breastfeeding can substantially reduce rates of late postnatal HIV transmission to the infant to less than 3 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-hiv-transmission-during-breastfeeding-in-resource-limited-settings/abstract/2-4,67\" class=\"abstract_t\">2-4,67</a>], and in more recent studies, down to 0.6 percent at one year follow-up [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-hiv-transmission-during-breastfeeding-in-resource-limited-settings/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>].</p><p>The discussion below highlights some of the main concepts that have emerged within the last several years regarding the most effective use of antiretroviral medications for the prevention of HIV during breastfeeding. Drugs that have been studied include <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nevirapine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">nevirapine</a>, which is a nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI); <a href=\"topic.htm?path=zidovudine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">zidovudine</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=abacavir-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">abacavir</a>, and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lamivudine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">lamivudine</a>, which are nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs); and <span class=\"nowrap\">lopinavir/<a href=\"topic.htm?path=ritonavir-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ritonavir</a></span> (co-formulated as Kaletra), which are protease inhibitors (PIs).

This supports the observation that there is a significant association between the level of the mother's viral load and HIV infant transmission (see <a href=\"#H1036418272\" class=\"local\">'Virologic'</a> above). Since several weeks may lapse before viral suppression can be achieved following initiation of antiretroviral agents, these should be initiated during pregnancy, rather than at delivery, to maximally reduce infant HIV transmission as illustrated in the studies discussed here [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-hiv-transmission-during-breastfeeding-in-resource-limited-settings/abstract/70\" class=\"abstract_t\">70</a>].</p><p>In the Mma Bana trial in Botswana, 560 women with CD4 cell counts &le;200 <span class=\"nowrap\">cells/microL</span> were randomly assigned to receive either triple nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=zidovudine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">zidovudine</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lamivudine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">lamivudine</a>, and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=abacavir-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">abacavir</a>) or a protease inhibitor (PI) containing regimen <span class=\"nowrap\">(lopinavir/<a href=\"topic.htm?path=ritonavir-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ritonavir</a></span> with zidovudine and lamivudine) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-hiv-transmission-during-breastfeeding-in-resource-limited-settings/abstract/4,71\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,71</a>]. The regimen was initiated between 26 and 34 weeks of gestation and continued through weaning or six months postpartum (whichever occurred first). All infants also received short-term postnatal antiretrovirals to prevent intrapartum mother-to-child transmission of HIV (ie, single-dose <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nevirapine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">nevirapine</a> at birth and zidovudine from birth through four weeks). Women with advanced immunosuppression (CD4 cell counts &lt;200 <span class=\"nowrap\">cells/microL)</span> were placed in the observational group and were initiated on chronic antiretroviral therapy (ART) with nevirapine, zidovudine, and lamivudine for their own overall health. The primary endpoint was the proportion of women with viral suppression at delivery and up to six months postpartum, as the level of HIV RNA is considered a good surrogate of transmission risk. </p><p>High rates of maternal viral suppression to &lt;400 <span class=\"nowrap\">copies/mL</span> were seen in both groups (96 percent in the NRTI group versus 93 percent in the PI group). The overall rate of mother-to-child transmission was 1.1 percent. This rate is also similar to that seen among treated women in resource-rich settings who did not breastfeed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-hiv-transmission-during-breastfeeding-in-resource-limited-settings/abstract/4,71,72\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,71,72</a>]. Because of the low number of maternal-infant transmissions (ie, eight cases total), the effect of specific immunologic or virologic thresholds (eg, CD4 cell counts or HIV RNA levels) on the risk of transmission could not be analyzed. Rates of adverse events were similar in the NRTI and PI groups (6 percent each). However, there was a significantly higher rate of preterm delivery in the PI group than the NRTI group (23 versus 15 percent, respectively). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=safety-and-dosing-of-antiretroviral-medications-in-pregnancy#H98761537\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Safety and dosing of antiretroviral medications in pregnancy&quot;, section on 'Preterm birth'</a>.)</p><p>Similarly, the multisite PROMISE trial, conducted in sub-Saharan Africa and India, demonstrated a transmission rate of 0.3 percent at six months and 0.6 percent at 12 months postpartum among breastfeeding women who continued ART for the duration of breastfeeding [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-hiv-transmission-during-breastfeeding-in-resource-limited-settings/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>].</p><p>Other studies have found somewhat higher overall transmission rates of approximately 3 to 5 percent with use of combination antiretroviral regimens in breastfeeding women [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-hiv-transmission-during-breastfeeding-in-resource-limited-settings/abstract/2,69\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,69</a>]. For example, an observational study in Mozambique of HIV-infected mothers who were provided antenatal and postnatal antiretroviral medications for six months (mainly <a href=\"topic.htm?path=zidovudine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">zidovudine</a> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=stavudine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">stavudine</a> in combination with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lamivudine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">lamivudine</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nevirapine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">nevirapine</a>) demonstrated an overall HIV infant transmission rate of 2.8 percent at 12 months [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-hiv-transmission-during-breastfeeding-in-resource-limited-settings/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. </p><p>In the Breastfeeding, Antiretrovirals, and Nutrition (BAN) trial, the postnatal risk of HIV transmission was 2.9 percent in infants of mothers who were randomly assigned to receive a combination antiretroviral regimen from delivery until weaning at 26 to 28 weeks [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-hiv-transmission-during-breastfeeding-in-resource-limited-settings/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. In this study, there was a delay of 12 weeks in the effect of maternal antiretroviral use, which may reflect the time needed to achieve virologic suppression. This suggests that earlier initiation of antiretrovirals during pregnancy would further decrease the risk of infant HIV transmission. The BAN trial is discussed in greater detail elsewhere. (See <a href=\"#H1809914\" class=\"local\">'Efficacy of maternal versus infant antiretroviral prophylaxis'</a> below.)</p><p>Studies have also examined whether maternal antiretroviral drug interventions during breastfeeding can prevent HIV transmission among women with higher CD4 cell counts (eg, &gt;350 <span class=\"nowrap\">cells/microL)</span> rather than restricting its use to women with greater degrees of immunosuppression. Data from the Kesho Bora trial suggest that the primary benefit of maternal antiretroviral medications in reducing infant HIV transmission was observed among those women in the 200 to 350 cell strata; postnatal transmission rates after age six weeks were very low (one percent or less) in women with CD4 counts in the 350 to 500 <span class=\"nowrap\">cells/microL</span> strata, making it more difficult to discern if there was a further reduction with maternal ART with the limited sample size in this group [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-hiv-transmission-during-breastfeeding-in-resource-limited-settings/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. &#160;</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1809848\"><span class=\"h2\">Efficacy of infant antiretroviral prophylaxis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Several trials have demonstrated the success of infant antiretroviral prophylaxis in decreasing the risk of HIV acquisition during breastfeeding [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-hiv-transmission-during-breastfeeding-in-resource-limited-settings/abstract/5,73-75\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,73-75</a>].

However, given 2015 WHO recommendations of lifelong ART for all HIV-infected individuals, including pregnant and breastfeeding women, maternal ART is the preferred strategy for prevention of breast milk transmission. (See <a href=\"#H1036418861\" class=\"local\">'Recommendations to prevent transmission during breastfeeding'</a> above.)</p><p>The Breastfeeding, Antiretrovirals, and Nutrition (BAN) trial was the first to assess the relative effectiveness of maternal or infant antiretroviral interventions compared with controls for prevention of HIV transmission to infants [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-hiv-transmission-during-breastfeeding-in-resource-limited-settings/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. In this large trial, mother-infant pairs were randomly assigned at delivery to a maternal regimen group, an infant regimen group, or neither intervention (the control group).

The infant regimen included daily <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nevirapine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">nevirapine</a> alone for 28 weeks; the maternal combination drug regimen varied during the trial due to emerging safety data related to individual agents (eg, hypersensitivity reactions and nevirapine use in women with CD4 counts &gt;250 cells). Most of the women in the trial received <a href=\"topic.htm?path=zidovudine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">zidovudine</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lamivudine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">lamivudine</a> (coformulated as Combivir), and ritonavir-boosted lopinavir (coformulated as Kaletra).</p><p>In addition, perinatal antiretroviral prophylaxis (single-dose <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nevirapine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">nevirapine</a> plus one week of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=zidovudine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">zidovudine</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lamivudine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">lamivudine</a>) for the prevention of MTCT was given at delivery to all mothers and infants; based on the standard of care at the time, no antepartum prophylaxis was given. The women were advised to exclusively breastfeed during the study until 24 to 28 weeks when they were then instructed to rapidly wean. Maternal antiretrovirals were discontinued one week after weaning. The primary efficacy endpoint was the rate of detection of HIV infection at 28 weeks postpartum among infants who were uninfected at two weeks of life between the two intervention arms compared to the control arm. Clinical and laboratory data were graded for severity of adverse events. On the basis of the fourth interim analysis, the Data and Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) halted enrollment in the control group in 2008.</p><p>The trial demonstrated that either a maternal regimen of combination antiretroviral medications or an infant regimen of daily <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nevirapine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">nevirapine</a> were both effective in reducing the risk of HIV transmission (cumulative postnatal risk 2.9 percent and 1.7 percent, respectively) compared with controls (5.7 percent). The effectiveness of infant prophylaxis was evident by six weeks, while the relative effectiveness of maternal ART was only first apparent at 12 weeks. Specifically, the highest risk of infant HIV infection occurred between the second and twelfth weeks of life in the control group, with a transmission rate of 3.6 percent. During this period of high risk, the infant regimen reduced postnatal HIV transmission down to 0.5 percent while the maternal regimen reduced this rate to 1.7 percent. After 18 weeks of age, the risk of infection was similar between the two arms. This delayed effect in the maternal ART arm may be related to the time needed to attain maternal viral suppression, since ART was first initiated at delivery. The study protocol did not assess the association between HIV RNA detection and subsequent risk of infant transmission. </p><p>Consistent with these data, the PROMISE trial also did not demonstrate a difference between maternal ART and infant prophylaxis in preventing postnatal HIV transmission during 12 months of breastfeeding [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-hiv-transmission-during-breastfeeding-in-resource-limited-settings/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>].</p><p>An analysis of 48 week outcomes of the BAN trial demonstrated that, although the cumulative risk of HIV transmission still remained less in the maternal and infant prophylaxis arms (4 percent in both) than in the control group (7 percent), the transmission events that occurred after 28 weeks (when all prophylaxis had been discontinued) were evenly distributed across all groups [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-hiv-transmission-during-breastfeeding-in-resource-limited-settings/abstract/79\" class=\"abstract_t\">79</a>]. Half of the late infections occurred at least 42 days after the reported cessation of breastfeeding. Furthermore, overall infant morbidity increased from 0.7 adverse events per 1000 person weeks during the intervention period to 1.1 events per 1000 person weeks after week 28, which correlated with the time when women weaned their infants. Although the study was not designed to evaluate the effect of early weaning, its results suggest that in resource-limited settings, instructing women to cease breastfeeding early at 24 to 28 weeks may not be an effective strategy against further HIV transmission and, as seen in other studies, may be associated with increased infant morbidity and mortality.

In fact, following the first report of breast milk HIV transmission in the United States, the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) issued guidelines recommending replacement feeding for HIV-uninfected infants born to HIV-infected mothers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-hiv-transmission-during-breastfeeding-in-resource-limited-settings/abstract/95\" class=\"abstract_t\">95</a>].

In order to limit the risk of HIV transmission and to facilitate the benefits of passive maternal antibody transfer, prior WHO guidelines recommended breastfeeding for a limited period of time (ie, six months).

However, an excess risk of HIV transmission occurs if antiretroviral medications are discontinued during the breastfeeding period. Maternal and infant antiretroviral prophylaxis strategies during the breastfeeding period are comparably effective in reducing the rate of transmission, but antiretroviral therapy (ART) is now recommended for all HIV-infected individuals, including pregnant and breastfeeding women, and hence is the preferred strategy.
