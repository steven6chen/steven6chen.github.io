Increasing interest has therefore been focused on the late toxicities of cancer chemotherapy in long-term survivors. One of the most common long-term side effects of cytotoxic agents in men is gonadal dysfunction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/effects-of-cytotoxic-agents-on-gonadal-function-in-adult-men/abstract/1-4\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-4</a>]. The following general rules apply to the gonadal toxicity of chemotherapy in the male.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Spermatogenesis is much more likely to be disrupted than is testosterone production, because the germinal epithelium of the testis is more sensitive to damage from cytotoxic drugs than the Leydig cells.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The degree of damage to the germinal epithelium is influenced by the stage of sexual maturation of the testis. In general, the postpubertal testis appears to be more susceptible to damage than the prepubertal testis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/effects-of-cytotoxic-agents-on-gonadal-function-in-adult-men/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The magnitude of the effect on sperm production is both drug specific and dose dependent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/effects-of-cytotoxic-agents-on-gonadal-function-in-adult-men/abstract/1,3,6-11\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,3,6-11</a>].</p><p/><p>The impact of cytotoxic agents on gonadal function in adult men is reviewed here. The impact of such agents on gonadal function and fertility in children, adolescents, and women is reviewed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=endocrinopathies-in-cancer-survivors-and-others-exposed-to-cytotoxic-therapies-during-childhood#H14977244\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Endocrinopathies in cancer survivors and others exposed to cytotoxic therapies during childhood&quot;, section on 'Gonadal dysfunction'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ovarian-failure-due-to-anticancer-drugs-and-radiation\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Ovarian failure due to anticancer drugs and radiation&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">MECHANISMS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The mechanism of action of most cytotoxic chemotherapeutic agents is interference with obligatory cell processes, such as DNA synthesis, in the rapidly dividing cancer cells. However, all cells that undergo rapid division are susceptible to the toxic effects of chemotherapy, and this would include cells involved in spermatogenesis.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Germinal epithelium</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In the testis, the cells within the seminiferous tubules of the germinal epithelium have the highest mitotic and meiotic indices, and are thus most vulnerable to the toxic effects of chemotherapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/effects-of-cytotoxic-agents-on-gonadal-function-in-adult-men/abstract/1,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,7</a>]. While sperm counts begin to decline within a few weeks of chemotherapy, it typically takes two to three months for azoospermia to occur, in keeping with the known kinetics of spermatogenesis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/effects-of-cytotoxic-agents-on-gonadal-function-in-adult-men/abstract/12,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,13</a>]. Because antineoplastic agents act on the sperm cells during cell division, they are most toxic to the rapidly proliferating type B spermatogonia, which can be reproduced from the germinal stem cell layer. However, the severity and duration of gonadal damage induced by cytotoxic agents correlates best with the number of stem cells (type A spermatogonia) that are destroyed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/effects-of-cytotoxic-agents-on-gonadal-function-in-adult-men/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>].</p><p>If the stem cells within the tubules remain intact, spermatogenesis may begin to show recovery approximately 12 weeks after treatment. Therefore, drugs that damage the stem cells are likely to cause permanent infertility. The typical histologic pattern on testicular biopsy of patients who have received cytotoxic agents is atrophic tubules containing Sertoli cells lining the lumen, a few scattered spermatogonia and spermatids, and peritubular fibrosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/effects-of-cytotoxic-agents-on-gonadal-function-in-adult-men/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p>Subtle effects on Sertoli cell function, including changes in cytokeratin expression and <span class=\"nowrap\">inhibin/follicle</span> stimulating hormone (FSH) ratios, have also been reported in adult men who underwent chemotherapy during adolescence [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/effects-of-cytotoxic-agents-on-gonadal-function-in-adult-men/abstract/15,16\" class=\"abstract_t\">15,16</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Leydig cells</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Less commonly, chemotherapy can damage Leydig cells, the site of testosterone production within the testis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/effects-of-cytotoxic-agents-on-gonadal-function-in-adult-men/abstract/1,3,4,17,18\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,3,4,17,18</a>]. However, Leydig cell dysfunction in this setting is typically subclinical, characterized by testosterone levels that are at the lower end of the normal range in association with elevated luteinizing hormone (LH) levels [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/effects-of-cytotoxic-agents-on-gonadal-function-in-adult-men/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. The clinical significance of this state of &quot;compensated hypogonadism&quot; is still unclear. However, one randomized, placebo-controlled trial of testosterone replacement in 35 men with evidence of mild Leydig cell damage following treatment with cytotoxic chemotherapy for malignancy showed no beneficial impact of 12 months of supplemental testosterone on bone mineral density (BMD), body composition, lipids, or quality of life [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/effects-of-cytotoxic-agents-on-gonadal-function-in-adult-men/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. In patients with testosterone levels that are clearly hypogonadal, however, testosterone replacement is a reasonable and safe strategy.

Of 92 men with Hodgkin lymphoma studied prior to therapy, 67 percent had an abnormal semen sample in terms of sperm count (34 percent), motility (68 percent), or morphology (71 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/effects-of-cytotoxic-agents-on-gonadal-function-in-adult-men/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. In another study of 33 men with Hodgkin lymphoma, 12 (36 percent) had abnormalities in sperm count or motility prior to treatment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/effects-of-cytotoxic-agents-on-gonadal-function-in-adult-men/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. However, eight of nine patients (89 percent) who consented to testicular biopsy had histologic evidence of damage to the seminiferous epithelium [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/effects-of-cytotoxic-agents-on-gonadal-function-in-adult-men/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. Elevation of basal follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) levels occurred in 15 percent and luteinizing hormone (LH) in 19 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/effects-of-cytotoxic-agents-on-gonadal-function-in-adult-men/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>].</p><p>As a result of these pretreatment abnormalities, only 20 to 30 percent of men with Hodgkin lymphoma meet traditional criteria for sperm cryopreservation for intrauterine insemination [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/effects-of-cytotoxic-agents-on-gonadal-function-in-adult-men/abstract/28,29\" class=\"abstract_t\">28,29</a>] (see <a href=\"#H34\" class=\"local\">'Semen cryopreservation'</a> below).

Although a history of cryptorchidism was four times more common in patients with TGCC than in the controls (22 versus 5 percent), sperm counts remained significantly lower in men with testicular cancer even when those with cryptorchidism were excluded from the analysis (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epidemiology-of-and-risk-factors-for-testicular-germ-cell-tumors#H5\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Epidemiology of and risk factors for testicular germ cell tumors&quot;, section on 'Cryptorchidism'</a>). This preexisting suppression of spermatogenesis could not be explained by a general effect related to having a malignancy, as higher sperm counts were observed in a control group of men with lymphoma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/effects-of-cytotoxic-agents-on-gonadal-function-in-adult-men/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>].</p><p>The mechanism of association between altered spermatogenesis and testicular cancer remains unclear. Histologically, suppression of spermatogenesis can be demonstrated in both the tumor-bearing [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/effects-of-cytotoxic-agents-on-gonadal-function-in-adult-men/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>] and the contralateral testis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/effects-of-cytotoxic-agents-on-gonadal-function-in-adult-men/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. It has been proposed that factors secreted by the tumor, eg, human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) or interleukins, may be implicated in the disruption of normal sperm production [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/effects-of-cytotoxic-agents-on-gonadal-function-in-adult-men/abstract/32,33\" class=\"abstract_t\">32,33</a>].

Second, the process of freeze-thawing has an additional negative impact on sperm function causing a further decrease in sperm motility, although this effect is no worse in cancer patients than in healthy men [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/effects-of-cytotoxic-agents-on-gonadal-function-in-adult-men/abstract/91\" class=\"abstract_t\">91</a>]. Third, cryopreservation is not typically pursued for patients who are still prepubertal. Although testicular biopsy samples from prepubertal boys have been performed successfully, this procedure is considered experimental and its clinical utility has not been established. Fourth, most insurance companies will not cover the monthly cost of maintaining the specimen. </p><p>Most men are able to obtain their semen samples by ejaculation. The optimal number of samples for future fertility and number of days of abstinence between samples varies based upon baseline semen analysis and the urgency of starting the chemotherapy or radiotherapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/effects-of-cytotoxic-agents-on-gonadal-function-in-adult-men/abstract/92\" class=\"abstract_t\">92</a>]. For men who are too ill or weak to collect samples through ejaculation, other options include electroejaculation, percutaneous epididymal sperm aspiration, or needle testicular sperm extraction or aspiration (TESE or TESA). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatments-for-male-infertility#H2295239941\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatments for male infertility&quot;, section on 'Retrieval of sperm'</a>.)</p><p>Prior to the development of assisted reproductive technologies such as in vitro fertilization (IVF) and intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI), semen cryopreservation was generally not offered to men with poor baseline semen parameters, ie, sperm counts &lt;20 x 10<sup>6</sup><span class=\"nowrap\">/mL</span> <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> &lt;40 percent motile sperm [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/effects-of-cytotoxic-agents-on-gonadal-function-in-adult-men/abstract/93,94\" class=\"abstract_t\">93,94</a>], as it was presumed that such counts would be too low for conception to occur using artificial insemination. However, with the advent of IVF, viable pregnancies have been reported with as few as 0.6 x 10<sup>6</sup> motile spermatozoa [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/effects-of-cytotoxic-agents-on-gonadal-function-in-adult-men/abstract/95-97\" class=\"abstract_t\">95-97</a>]. Therefore, semen cryopreservation should now be offered to all patients as long as there are some spermatozoa present in the ejaculate [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/effects-of-cytotoxic-agents-on-gonadal-function-in-adult-men/abstract/98,99\" class=\"abstract_t\">98,99</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatments-for-male-infertility#H2295239941\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatments for male infertility&quot;, section on 'Retrieval of sperm'</a>.)</p><p>All men scheduled for potentially gonadotoxic chemotherapy who are interested in future paternity should be informed about the risk of infertility and referred for sperm banking. However, only 50 percent are offered sperm banking, and even fewer result in cryopreserved sperm [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/effects-of-cytotoxic-agents-on-gonadal-function-in-adult-men/abstract/100\" class=\"abstract_t\">100</a>], in spite of current guidelines from the American Society of Clinical Oncology [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/effects-of-cytotoxic-agents-on-gonadal-function-in-adult-men/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>] and the American Society of Reproductive Medicine [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/effects-of-cytotoxic-agents-on-gonadal-function-in-adult-men/abstract/92\" class=\"abstract_t\">92</a>]. The common reasons given for not discussing the option with patients include lack of time, lack of local facilities for semen collection, and the high costs of sample storage [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/effects-of-cytotoxic-agents-on-gonadal-function-in-adult-men/abstract/92\" class=\"abstract_t\">92</a>]. </p><p>In the past, men who developed azoospermia after chemotherapy were considered to be sterile. Now, many of these men (approximately 37 percent in one study) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/effects-of-cytotoxic-agents-on-gonadal-function-in-adult-men/abstract/101\" class=\"abstract_t\">101</a>] are able to undergo successful TESE and ICSI. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatments-for-male-infertility#H2690399376\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatments for male infertility&quot;, section on 'IVF with ICSI'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H35\"><span class=\"h2\">Hormonal manipulation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The demonstration that the prepubertal testis appears to be less susceptible to the gonadotoxic effects of chemotherapy than the mature adult testis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/effects-of-cytotoxic-agents-on-gonadal-function-in-adult-men/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>] led to the hypothesis that suppression of testicular function in adult men undergoing chemotherapy might preserve their fertility. While studies in a variety of animal models, including the rat [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/effects-of-cytotoxic-agents-on-gonadal-function-in-adult-men/abstract/102,103\" class=\"abstract_t\">102,103</a>] and mouse [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/effects-of-cytotoxic-agents-on-gonadal-function-in-adult-men/abstract/104\" class=\"abstract_t\">104</a>], have yielded encouraging results, the experience to date in the human has been disappointing [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/effects-of-cytotoxic-agents-on-gonadal-function-in-adult-men/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>].</p><p>In contrast to rodent models, data on the efficacy of GnRH analogs in adult men with Hodgkin lymphoma and germ cell tumors have been disappointing. Studies using a variety of GnRH analogs to reversibly suppress steroidogenesis demonstrated no benefit in either preserving spermatogenesis or accelerating its recovery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/effects-of-cytotoxic-agents-on-gonadal-function-in-adult-men/abstract/105-108\" class=\"abstract_t\">105-108</a>]. These studies generally involved small numbers of patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/effects-of-cytotoxic-agents-on-gonadal-function-in-adult-men/abstract/105,107\" class=\"abstract_t\">105,107</a>], and one was not placebo-controlled [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/effects-of-cytotoxic-agents-on-gonadal-function-in-adult-men/abstract/105\" class=\"abstract_t\">105</a>].</p><p>One potential explanation for the discrepancy between the results of animal and human studies is that the mechanism of chemotherapy-induced infertility is not the same in these two models. In men who receive combination chemotherapy, it is possible that the gonadal toxicity observed is greater than that seen after administration of a single agent in the rat; complete ablation of the germinal epithelium in this setting would preclude any possibility of recovery of spermatogenesis.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"PATIENT_INFORMATION\"><span class=\"h1\">INFORMATION FOR PATIENTS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>UpToDate offers two types of patient education materials, &quot;The Basics&quot; and &quot;Beyond the Basics.&quot; The Basics patient education pieces are written in plain language, at the 5<sup>th</sup> to 6<sup>th</sup> grade reading level, and they answer the four or five key questions a patient might have about a given condition.
