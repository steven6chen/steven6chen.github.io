Septic arthritis due to bacterial infection is often a destructive form of acute arthritis.</p><p>The predisposing factors, pathogenesis, clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and treatment of nongonococcal bacterial arthritis are reviewed here. Issues related to prosthetic joint infections, gonococcal arthritis, and fungal and mycobacterial arthritis are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prosthetic-joint-infection-epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Prosthetic joint infection: Epidemiology, clinical manifestations, and diagnosis&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prosthetic-joint-infection-treatment\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Prosthetic joint infection: Treatment&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=disseminated-gonococcal-infection\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Disseminated gonococcal infection&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=skeletal-tuberculosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Skeletal tuberculosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4534473\"><span class=\"h1\">EPIDEMIOLOGY</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h2\">Prevalence</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The prevalence of bacterial arthritis as the diagnosis among adults presenting with one or more acutely painful joints has been estimated to range from 8 to 27 percent; the lower figure is based on a series of 100 patients presenting to an urban hospital emergency department; the latter figure is based on a study of 75 patients presenting emergently in Taiwan [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/septic-arthritis-in-adults/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>]. These series included some patients with prosthetic joints and a small minority in whom the final diagnosis was gonococcal septic arthritis.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Predisposing factors</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Predisposing factors for septic arthritis were identified in a systematic review that included more than 6200 patients with acutely painful joints; 10 percent had septic arthritis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/septic-arthritis-in-adults/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Predisposing factors include [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/septic-arthritis-in-adults/abstract/3-5\" class=\"abstract_t\">3-5</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Age &gt;80 years</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Diabetes mellitus</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Rheumatoid arthritis</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Presence of prosthetic joint</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Recent joint surgery</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Skin infection</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Intravenous drug abuse, alcoholism</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Prior intraarticular corticosteroid injection</p><p/><p>Each of these factors appears to have a modest impact on the risk of septic arthritis; however, combinations of independent risk factors substantially increase risk. As an example, acute joint pain in the presence of a joint prosthesis and concurrent evidence of skin infection is associated with a positive likelihood ratio of 15 (95% CI 8.1-28) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/septic-arthritis-in-adults/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=glossary-of-common-biostatistical-and-epidemiological-terms#H21\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Glossary of common biostatistical and epidemiological terms&quot;, section on 'Likelihood ratio'</a>.)</p><p>Bacteremia is more likely to localize in a joint with preexisting arthritis, particularly if associated with synovitis. As an example, a prospective community-based study of 154 patients with bacterial arthritis found that 40 percent had preexisting joint disease, usually either rheumatoid arthritis (RA) or osteoarthritis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/septic-arthritis-in-adults/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. Patients with RA appear to be especially prone to bacterial arthritis; the risk may also be increased in gout, pseudogout, osteoarthritis, and Charcot arthropathy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/septic-arthritis-in-adults/abstract/7,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,8</a>]. Patients with RA may have additional predisposing factors, such as prior intraarticular steroid injections, maintenance immunosuppressive medications, and anti-tumor necrosis factor therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/septic-arthritis-in-adults/abstract/9-12\" class=\"abstract_t\">9-12</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tumor-necrosis-factor-alpha-inhibitors-and-mycobacterial-infections\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Tumor necrosis factor-alpha inhibitors and mycobacterial infections&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4533994\"><span class=\"h1\">MECHANISM OF INFECTION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In most cases, bacterial arthritis arises from hematogenous spread to the joint. Bacterial arthritis can also arise as a result of a bite or other trauma, direct inoculation of bacteria during joint surgery, or, in rare cases, following extension of preexisting bony infection through the cortex into the joint space [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/septic-arthritis-in-adults/abstract/7,8,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,8,13</a>]. In a retrospective review including 191 cases of septic arthritis, 72 percent were thought to have arisen hematogenously [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/septic-arthritis-in-adults/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. Common predisposing factors for hematogenous dissemination include injection drug use, presence of indwelling catheters, and an underlying immunocompromised state such as HIV infection. Neonates and older adults are at highest risk [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/septic-arthritis-in-adults/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>].</p><p>In some cases, bacterial arthritis is the presenting sign of infective endocarditis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/septic-arthritis-in-adults/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. This is most likely to occur in patients who use injection drugs. Endocarditis should also be suspected when septic arthritis due to <em>Staphylococcus aureus</em>, enterococci, or streptococci occurs in a patient without an obvious predisposing cause. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-evaluation-of-adults-with-suspected-native-valve-endocarditis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and evaluation of adults with suspected native valve endocarditis&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Patients with hematogenously induced bacterial arthritis may present with joint abnormalities in the absence of documented bacteremia. These patients presumably acquired their infection from a transient or self-limited bacteremia. It is unknown why only a small percentage of patients with bacteremia develop septic arthritis. For example, the incidence of pneumococcal septic arthritis in patients with pneumococcal bacteremia is extremely low (ranging from 0.5 to 0.7 percent in three different case series) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/septic-arthritis-in-adults/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>].</p><p>Bacterial arthritis can occur in conjunction with bacterial meningitis. In a prospective cohort study including nearly 700 adults with bacterial meningitis, arthritis was diagnosed in 7 percent of cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/septic-arthritis-in-adults/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. Joint fluid cultures were positive in 6 of 23 patients (26 percent) in whom aspiration was performed. Arthritis was most frequent in patients with meningococcal meningitis (12 percent).</p><p>Bacterial arthritis can also occur by other mechanisms. Sternoclavicular joint arthritis is a rare complication of subclavian vein catheterization [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/septic-arthritis-in-adults/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. Septic arthritis of the hip can result in rare cases from femoral venipuncture or ruptured colonic diverticular disease, in which the infection dissects via the retroperitoneal space into the posterior thigh and hip joint, presenting as a seemingly spontaneous-onset polymicrobial septic arthritis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/septic-arthritis-in-adults/abstract/19,20\" class=\"abstract_t\">19,20</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h1\">PATHOGENESIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Bacteria entering the joint produce an acute inflammatory cell response in the synovial membrane. Because synovial tissue has no limiting basement plate, bacterial organisms can quickly gain access to the synovial fluid, creating acute-onset joint inflammation with purulence. Following onset of infection, there is marked hyperplasia of the lining cells in the synovial membrane within seven days. In addition, inflammatory cells release cytokines and proteases that cause cartilage degradation and inhibit cartilage synthesis. Pressure necrosis from large synovial effusions may result in further cartilage and bone loss.</p><p>Bacterial DNA and bacterial toxins may have a deleterious effect on joint structures. As an example, extracts of unmethylated bacterial DNA from <em>S. aureus</em> or <em>Escherichia coli</em> produced arthritis in a murine model that lasted up to 14 days [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/septic-arthritis-in-adults/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. Bacterial superantigens, such as staphylococcal toxic shock syndrome toxin (TSST)-1 and staphylococcal enterotoxins may induce a potent inflammatory response that damages joint cartilage. Animals infected with strains of <em>S. aureus</em> expressing TSST-1 and enterotoxin, for example, developed severe arthritis, while those infected with strains in which these toxins were absent had no or only mild joint inflammation. Moreover, vaccination with recombinant forms of staphylococcal enterotoxin protected mice against severe arthritis due to enterotoxin containing staphylococci [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/septic-arthritis-in-adults/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=staphylococcal-toxic-shock-syndrome#H6\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Staphylococcal toxic shock syndrome&quot;, section on 'pathogenesis'</a>.)</p><p>The presence of surface components on organisms such as <em>S. aureus</em> may be important in the pathogenesis of septic arthritis. Adhesins, called &quot;microbial surface components recognizing adhesive matrix molecules&quot; (MSCRAMMs), mediate adherence of staphylococci to intraarticular proteins, such as fibronectin, laminin, elastin, collagen, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hyaluronate-derivatives-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">hyaluronic acid</a>, and to prosthetic joint materials. There is increasing experimental and clinical evidence that the presence or absence of genes encoding certain MSCRAMMs affects whether or not individual strains of <em>S. aureus</em> cause septic arthritis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/septic-arthritis-in-adults/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. A fibrinogen-binding adhesion (FbsA) was a virulence factor in an animal model of septic arthritis following the intravenous injection of <em>Streptococcus agalactiae</em> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/septic-arthritis-in-adults/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. In contrast, the absence of pili-mediated adherence factors in organisms such as <em>Kingella kingae</em> seem to be paradoxically associated with a tendency to develop joint, bone, or endocardial infections [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/septic-arthritis-in-adults/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Microbiology</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Many pathogens are capable of causing nongonococcal bacterial arthritis (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RHEUM%2F57688\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef57688 \">table 1</a>). The incidence of causative organisms varies by age and geographic location. <em>S. aureus</em> (including methicillin-resistant <em>S. aureus </em>[MRSA]) is the most common bacterium infecting adult joints [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/septic-arthritis-in-adults/abstract/4,8,26\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,8,26</a>]. Other gram-positive organisms such as streptococci are also frequent causes of septic arthritis. Septic arthritis due to gram-negative bacilli is generally observed in the setting of trauma, intravenous drug users, neonates, older adults, and in association with underlying immunosuppression.</p><p><em>Streptococcus pneumoniae</em> cause a small but important percentage of cases of septic arthritis in adults. One review of 190 cases of pneumococcal septic arthritis noted that the majority of cases were monoarticular but that polyarticular involvement occurred in 36 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/septic-arthritis-in-adults/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. Only one-half of the patients had another clinically apparent focus of pneumococcal infection.</p><p>Septic arthritis is usually monomicrobial. Polymicrobial infections are less common and usually occur in the setting of penetrating trauma involving the joint space, direct extension from the bowel as mentioned above, or via hematogenous seeding in patients with polymicrobial bacteremia.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL MANIFESTATIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients with nongonococcal bacterial arthritis usually present acutely with a single swollen and painful joint (ie, monoarticular arthritis) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/septic-arthritis-in-adults/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. Joint pain, swelling, warmth, and restricted movement are reported by a majority of patients. These symptoms were noted at presentation in 80 percent of patients with septic arthritis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/septic-arthritis-in-adults/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].</p><p>A majority of patients with bacterial arthritis are febrile; chills and spiking fevers are unusual [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/septic-arthritis-in-adults/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Older adult patients with septic arthritis are less likely to present with fever. There may be evidence of an associated skin, urinary tract, or respiratory infection, which should provide a clue to the likely infecting organism (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RHEUM%2F57688\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef57688 \">table 1</a>).</p><p>The knee is involved in more than 50 percent of cases; wrists, ankles, and hips are also commonly affected [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/septic-arthritis-in-adults/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. Infection of the symphysis pubis is uncommon. In one review of 100 cases of infections of the pubic symphysis, four major underlying factors were identified including patients who had undergone female incontinence surgery (24 percent), who were athletes (19 percent), who had pelvic malignancy (17 percent), or who used injection drugs (15 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/septic-arthritis-in-adults/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pelvic-osteomyelitis-and-other-infections-of-the-bony-pelvis-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pelvic osteomyelitis and other infections of the bony pelvis in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Oligoarticular or polyarticular infection occurs in approximately 20 percent of septic joint infections, usually involving two or three joints. Polyarticular septic arthritis is most likely to occur in patients with rheumatoid arthritis or other systemic connective tissue disease and in patients with overwhelming sepsis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/septic-arthritis-in-adults/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>].</p><p>Injection drug users have a predilection to develop bacterial arthritis in axial joints, such as the sternoclavicular [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/septic-arthritis-in-adults/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>] or sternomanubrial joint. Injection drug users may also develop bacterial arthritis as a consequence of infective endocarditis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/septic-arthritis-in-adults/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. Endocarditis should also be suspected when septic arthritis due to <em>S. aureus</em>, enterococci, or streptococci occurs in a patient without an obvious predisposing cause. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-evaluation-of-adults-with-suspected-native-valve-endocarditis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and evaluation of adults with suspected native valve endocarditis&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h1\">DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The definitive diagnostic test is identification of bacteria in the synovial fluid. In the setting of suspected joint infection, synovial fluid aspiration should be performed (prior to administration of antibiotics); fluid should be sent for Gram stain and culture, leukocyte count with differential, and assessment for crystals (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RHEUM%2F76506\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef76506 \">table 2</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F53631\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef53631 \">algorithm 1</a>). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=synovial-fluid-analysis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Synovial fluid analysis&quot;</a>.)</p><p>If synovial fluid cannot be obtained with closed needle aspiration, the joint should be aspirated under computed tomography (CT) or fluoroscopic or ultrasound guidance. Certain joints, such as the hip or sacroiliac joint, may require surgical arthrotomy for diagnostic aspiration.</p><p>The following results are typically obtained from synovial fluid analysis in patients with bacterial arthritis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/septic-arthritis-in-adults/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Synovial fluid is usually purulent, with typical leukocyte count of 50,000 to 150,000 <span class=\"nowrap\">cells/mm<sup>3</sup></span> (most of which are neutrophils). The likelihood of septic arthritis increases with increasing synovial fluid leukocyte count [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/septic-arthritis-in-adults/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. High synovial fluid white blood cell counts can also occur in noninfectious conditions, so it is important to interpret the results of synovial fluid testing in the overall clinical context. (See <a href=\"#H11\" class=\"local\">'Differential diagnosis'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Gram stain is positive in many but not all cases; the sensitivity is 30 to 50 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/septic-arthritis-in-adults/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. False-positive results may occur since precipitated crystal violet and mucin in the synovial fluid can mimic gram-positive cocci. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=synovial-fluid-analysis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Synovial fluid analysis&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Culture is positive in the majority of patients with nongonococcal bacterial arthritis. Negative cultures may occur in the setting of recent antimicrobial therapy or infection with a fastidious organism.</p><p/><p>Blood cultures are positive in approximately 50 percent of cases; thus, blood cultures should be obtained in the setting of suspected bacterial arthritis (even if fever is absent). Other laboratory findings, such as an increased white blood cell count and an elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate, are common but nonspecific.</p><p>Inflammatory markers (C-reactive protein [CRP] level and erythrocyte sedimentation rate) are frequently elevated in the setting of septic arthritis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/septic-arthritis-in-adults/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]; they are also elevated in most forms of nonseptic acute arthritis. In the absence of underlying inflammatory arthritis, serial inflammatory marker measurements may be useful to guide duration of therapy. Measurement of synovial fluid CRP does not offer a significant advantage over serum CRP; there is a strong correlation between serum and synovial CRP levels [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/septic-arthritis-in-adults/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>].</p><p>Radiographs of the infected joint should be obtained; associated osteomyelitis or concurrent joint disease may be present in rare cases. In addition, a baseline radiograph is often useful for comparison purposes should the response to therapy be delayed or poor. Scintigraphy, CT scanning, or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) can detect effusions and inflammation in joints that are difficult to examine, especially in the hip and sacroiliac joints [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/septic-arthritis-in-adults/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>].</p><p>In the setting of septic arthritis due to <em>S. aureus</em>, echocardiography to evaluate for infective endocarditis is warranted for patients with known valvular heart disease <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> polyarticular involvement, in the absence of a clear source of infection. Echocardiography need not be pursued for patients with negative blood cultures, no clinical stigmata of infective endocarditis or other sites of metastatic infection, and clear source of infection (such as cellulitis, recent injection, recent surgery, or penetrating trauma).

The diagnosis is established via identification of <em>Neisseria gonorrhoeae</em> with synovial fluid nucleic acid amplification testing (NAAT) or culture (which requires processing on plates of chocolate agar or Thayer-Martin medium); the organism cannot be cultured on routine culture media. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=disseminated-gonococcal-infection\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Disseminated gonococcal infection&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Lyme disease &ndash; Lyme disease should be suspected in patients with an acute monoarthritis in the setting of epidemiologic exposure in an endemic area; erythema migrans rash, fever, and migratory arthralgias may occur weeks or months prior. The diagnosis is established via serologic testing. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diagnosis-of-lyme-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Diagnosis of Lyme disease&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Tuberculous arthritis &ndash; Tuberculous arthritis should be suspected in patients with indolent presentation of persistent culture-negative oligoarthritis or monoarthritis, in the setting of relevant epidemiologic exposure. The sensitivity of synovial fluid Ziehl-Neelsen stain for detection of acid-fast bacilli is low; the diagnosis is established via synovial membrane histopathology and culture. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=skeletal-tuberculosis#H8\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Skeletal tuberculosis&quot;, section on 'Arthritis'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Fungal arthritis &ndash; Fungal arthritis should be suspected in patients with indolent presentation of persistent culture-negative oligoarthritis or monoarthritis, in the setting of relevant epidemiologic exposure; it is most common in the setting of immunosuppression. Fungal causes of arthritis include sporotrichosis, coccidioidomycosis, candidiasis and others. The diagnosis is established via fungal stain and culture of synovial fluid or via synovial membrane histopathology and culture. (See related topics.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Viral causes of arthritis &ndash; Viral causes of arthritis typically present with polyarthritis; they include dengue fever, chikungunya, Zika virus, parvovirus, and rubella. A number of other viruses including enterovirus, adenovirus, and alphaviruses may also cause arthritis (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=specific-viruses-that-cause-arthritis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Specific viruses that cause arthritis&quot;</a>).

Clinical clues suggestive of gout include involvement of the first metatarsophalangeal joint, prior self-limited attacks of arthritis, and presence of tophi. If the knee or wrist are involved, radiographs may demonstrate chondrocalcinosis, which would be more consistent with pseudogout. The diagnosis can be established by synovial fluid analysis demonstrating monosodium urate crystals of gout or calcium pyrophosphate dihydrate (CPPD) crystals of pseudogout. Concurrent crystal-induced and bacterial arthritis can occur.

This is especially common in the seronegative spondyloarthropathies such as reactive arthritis. Most patients with reactive arthritis have recent genitourinary or gastrointestinal signs or symptoms, conjunctivitis, or skin or mucus membrane lesions. Occasionally, patients with ankylosing spondylitis present with acute-onset hip arthritis that mimics septic arthritis.

The diagnosis may be difficult to establish because the clinical findings may be somewhat atypical; many patients with RA present indolently (rather than acutely) with bacterial arthritis, often with little fever or leukocytosis. Conversely, RA itself may present with a &quot;pseudoseptic arthritis&quot; picture, including an explosive acute synovitis with a marked synovial fluid leukocytosis. Thus, Gram stain and culture of synovial fluid are essential when evaluating the new onset of synovitis in these patients.

The approach depends on the joint affected and the duration of infection.</p><p>In general, joint drainage should be performed in the setting of septic arthritis as this condition represents a closed abscess collection. Options for drainage include needle aspiration (single or multiple), arthroscopic drainage, or arthrotomy (open surgical drainage). If adequate drainage cannot be obtained by needle aspiration, either arthroscopy or open drainage is necessary. [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/septic-arthritis-in-adults/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>]. Adequacy of needle aspiration is best assessed using clinical criteria, including improvement in temperature, white cell count, joint swelling, and pain. Improvement in joint swelling is easier to assess in the knee than in the hip or shoulder.</p><p>In most cases, initial surgical drainage is warranted for hips, shoulders, and prosthetic joint infections. Surgical drainage should also be undertaken for any joint that is not improving clinically after serial needle aspiration or if needle drainage is inadequate to remove the fluid [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/septic-arthritis-in-adults/abstract/7,8,38\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,8,38</a>]. In general, if daily needle aspiration is not adequate for joint decompression after three to five days, surgical drainage may be warranted.</p><p>For knee, shoulder, and wrist infections, arthroscopy is often preferred because of easier irrigation and better visualization of the joint [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/septic-arthritis-in-adults/abstract/39-41\" class=\"abstract_t\">39-41</a>]. A multicenter study of 46 cases of septic arthritis of the knee treated by arthroscopic drainage showed a bacteriologic cure rate of 78 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/septic-arthritis-in-adults/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>]. A retrospective study of 76 patients with septic arthritis (62 knee, 10 shoulder, 5 ankle joints, and 1 hip joint) evaluated initial arthroscopic management [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/septic-arthritis-in-adults/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>]. Outcomes were dependent on the stage of infection, with more severe infections more likely to require repeated arthroscopic irrigations.</p><p>For hip infections, initial open surgical drainage may be necessary. Although arthrotomy has been considered standard treatment, a retrospective study involving six patients with septic hips found that arthroscopic treatment with large-volume irrigation was effective [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/septic-arthritis-in-adults/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>]. Further clinical studies will be needed to determine the best approach.</p><p>If joint drainage is manage initially via needle aspiration(s), serial synovial fluid analyses should demonstrate that the fluid has become sterile and that the total leukocyte count is decreasing. If not, more definitive joint drainage <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> an alteration in the antimicrobial regimen may be warranted. Infected knees often continue to accumulate synovial fluid and require daily aspiration for 7 to 10 days. Attention should also be paid to joint position and rapid mobilization to prevent contractures and promote optimal nutrition to the articular cartilage.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H22\"><span class=\"h1\">PROGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>It is difficult to predict the functional outcome of individual patients during and at the conclusion of treatment. The outcome is directly related to host factors, such as prior joint damage, the virulence of the infecting organism, and duration of infection prior to initiation of therapy.</p><p>As an example, in one study including 121 adults and 31 children with bacterial arthritis, a poor joint outcome (as defined by the need for amputation, arthrodesis, prosthetic surgery, or severe functional deterioration) occurred in one-third of the patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/septic-arthritis-in-adults/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. Adverse prognostic factors included older age, preexisting joint disease, and an infected joint containing synthetic material.</p><p>Inflammation and joint destruction may continue even in the setting of a sterile joint, despite effective antimicrobial therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/septic-arthritis-in-adults/abstract/43\" class=\"abstract_t\">43</a>]. This may be due to the persistence of bacterial DNA within the joint, which has been shown to induce arthritis in an animal model of septic arthritis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/septic-arthritis-in-adults/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>].</p><p>The pathogen may also have an important influence on the outcome of treatment. In the series of patients with pneumococcal bacterial arthritis, for example, 95 percent of adults and 90 percent of children had a return to baseline joint function or only mild limitation of joint motion following the completion of therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/septic-arthritis-in-adults/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. These results are in contrast with other studies of <em>S. aureus</em> bacterial arthritis that report 46 to 50 percent with poor joint outcomes following therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/septic-arthritis-in-adults/abstract/8,44\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,44</a>].</p><p>Mortality due to bacterial arthritis depends on the presence of comorbid conditions such as advanced age, coexistent renal or cardiac disease, and immunosuppression. The mortality rates in most series have ranged from 10 to 15 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/septic-arthritis-in-adults/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. Polyarticular septic arthritis, particularly when it is due to <em>S. aureus</em> or occurs in the presence of rheumatoid arthritis, has an extremely poor prognosis, with mortality rates as high as 50 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/septic-arthritis-in-adults/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>].

In most cases, bacterial arthritis arises from hematogenous spread to the joint. Bacterial arthritis can also arise as a result of a bite or other trauma, direct inoculation of bacteria during joint surgery, or, in rare cases, following extension of preexisting bony infection through the cortex into the joint space. (See <a href=\"#H4533994\" class=\"local\">'Mechanism of infection'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Bacteremia is more likely to localize in a joint with preexisting arthritis, particularly if associated with synovitis. Patients with rheumatoid arthritis appear to be especially prone to bacterial arthritis; the risk may also be increased in gout, pseudogout, osteoarthritis, and Charcot arthropathy. (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Predisposing factors'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Many pathogens are capable of causing bacterial arthritis (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RHEUM%2F57688\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef57688 \">table 1</a>). Organisms such as <em>Staphylococcus aureus</em> and streptococci have a higher propensity to cause joint infections than gram-negative bacilli, which typically cause infections following trauma or in patients with severe underlying immunosuppression. (See <a href=\"#H8\" class=\"local\">'Microbiology'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients with bacterial arthritis usually present acutely with a single swollen and painful joint (ie, monoarticular arthritis). The knee is involved in more than 50 percent of cases; wrists, ankles, and hips are also commonly affected. (See <a href=\"#H9\" class=\"local\">'Clinical manifestations'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The definitive diagnostic test is identification of bacteria in the synovial fluid.

The initial choice of antibiotics for treatment of septic arthritis is based on the Gram stain. The initial regimen should be tailored to culture and susceptibility results when available.
