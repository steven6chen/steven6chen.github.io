It consists of weekly individual psychotherapy and group skills training for approximately one year. The therapists treating these patients are expected to attend a regular consultation group to discuss issues and problems inherent in the treatment as well as to ensure that the treatment remains focused on DBT-prioritized issues.</p><p>A meta-analysis of randomized trials of DBT in patients with BPD concluded that DBT improved symptoms of the disorder, including reductions in anger and parasuicidality [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-borderline-personality-disorder/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. As an example, a trial of 101 women with BPD found that fewer patients treated with DBT attempted suicide (23 versus 46 percent), used hospital emergency department services (43 versus 58 percent), or required psychiatric hospitalization (20 versus 49 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-borderline-personality-disorder/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3591097979\"><span class=\"h3\">Mentalization-based therapy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Mentalization-based therapy is primarily a psychodynamic therapy that also incorporates cognitive techniques.

The APA guidelines were written by clinicians with expertise in treating BPD drawing from clinical trials and experience. Compared with the other therapies listed here, this approach involves less of a distinct conceptual model and psychotherapeutic techniques. Instead, it provides a set of principles and practices to meet the patient&rsquo;s clinical needs and assist the general psychiatrist in avoiding many of the pitfalls that can occur in the treatment of BPD.

Patients received weekly treatment for one year. Therapists for both groups received weekly supervision. Both therapies, as delivered in the study, were assessed by patients and audiotape reviewers, and found to be adherent to their respective treatment models. Sixty-two percent of patients completed the year of treatment, with no difference in retention between groups. At the end of one year, both groups experienced reductions in suicidal and self-injurious episodes, BPD symptoms, and improved functioning; no difference was seen between groups. Treatment gains were found to be sustained in both groups at two-year follow-up [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-borderline-personality-disorder/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. These results would benefit from further study in a well powered, &ldquo;noninferiority&rdquo; trial. In our clinical experience, good psychiatric management is an effective approach to treatment of BPD.

Patients receiving MACT experienced less frequent self-harm at the intervention&rsquo;s completion compared with the control group; self-harm was less frequent and severe in the MACT group at six-month posttreatment follow-up.

DBT was the most robustly supported by clinical trials, which additionally supported the use of mentalization based and schema-focused therapy. Clinical trials of <span class=\"nowrap\">CBT/cognitive</span> therapies have found mixed results. Transference-focused therapy was found to be superior to community psychotherapy in one trial, but less effective than schema-focused therapy in another.

(See <a href=\"#H540951798\" class=\"local\">'Psychotherapies'</a> above.)</p><p>Our clinical experience is that many, if not most, BPD patients require many months to years of treatment, which is consistent with the course of the disorder, severity of associated mood and behavioral problems, and the long-term process of achieving sustained insight, self-control, and improved occupational and social functioning. While some suggest a minimum of 20 sessions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-borderline-personality-disorder/abstract/29,30\" class=\"abstract_t\">29,30</a>], we believe that the ability to maintain a consistent relationship with a therapist over many months and in many cases years helps the patient appreciate and work through the problems and interpersonal difficulties that are inherent in maintaining any long-term relationship. </p><p>The intensity of treatment varies with fluctuations in the severity of symptoms and associated risks. During acute periods of severe illness, the patient may require a brief inpatient stay (eg, to prevent suicidal behavior), participation in a partial hospitalization or intensive outpatient program, or multiple outpatient sessions weekly. Less frequent outpatient treatment may be needed during periods of mild symptoms and greater stability. </p><p>The decision to stop treatment optimally is made jointly by the patient and clinician. It is typically advisable to continue therapy until safety has been maintained for an extended period and sufficient progress has been achieved in reducing the patient&rsquo;s symptoms and functional impairment. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H118367531\"><span class=\"h2\">Comparing psychotherapies</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There are few head-to-head trials comparing psychotherapies for borderline personality disorders, with mixed results:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Schema-focused versus transference-focused therapy &ndash; A study randomized 88 BPD patients to either schema-focused therapy or transference-focused therapy, with each treatment provided twice a week for three years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-borderline-personality-disorder/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. Both treatment groups improved significantly over a three-year treatment period; patients receiving schema-focused therapy were more likely to experience improvement in BPD symptoms and quality of life, and to meet criteria for BPD recovery (RR 2.18, 95% CI 1.02-4.66) compared with transference-focused therapy. (See <a href=\"#H118367845\" class=\"local\">'Schema-focused therapy'</a> above and <a href=\"#H2649772271\" class=\"local\">'Transference-focused therapy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Good psychiatric management versus DBT &ndash; Improvement was seen with both interventions with no differences between them in primary outcomes, in described above.

Patients showed positive responses to both therapies. The cognitive therapy group experienced greater improvement in anxiety and psychological functioning. The interpersonal therapy group had greater improvement in social functioning and interpersonal problems. (See <a href=\"#H9\" class=\"local\">'Cognitive behavioral therapy'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H118368107\"><span class=\"h2\">Therapy selection</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Based on very limited clinical trial data and our clinical experience, we consider the psychotherapies for BPD described above to be comparably effective. We presently lack sufficient knowledge to match individual patients to particular therapies. (See <a href=\"#H9\" class=\"local\">'Cognitive behavioral therapy'</a> above and <a href=\"#H470487746\" class=\"local\">'Dialectical behavior therapy'</a> above and <a href=\"#H118367845\" class=\"local\">'Schema-focused therapy'</a> above and <a href=\"#H2649772271\" class=\"local\">'Transference-focused therapy'</a> above and <a href=\"#H3591097979\" class=\"local\">'Mentalization-based therapy'</a> above and <a href=\"#H1918816662\" class=\"local\">'Good psychiatric management'</a> above.)</p><p>A sequencing of psychotherapies (or a shift in emphasis within a psychotherapy) may be useful for BPD patients. In our clinical experience, a more structured psychotherapy (DBT or CBT), which strongly focus on behavior, can be particularly helpful during acute periods of illness characterized by significant behavioral dyscontrol and problems with safety. After behavior and safety have stabilized, a less structured, more insight-oriented or interpersonally-focused approach, along the lines of mentalization-based or transference-focused therapy, or &ldquo;good psychiatric management,&rdquo; may yield the best results. </p><p>As an example, more specifically clinical experience, has led us to conclude the following. For the most regressed patients or for those with high levels of self-destructiveness, one should consider DBT. The reason for this is because DBT focuses on increasing coping skills and tolerance of unwanted or previously intolerable affect, and much self-destructive behavior and acting out behavior appears to be triggered by being overwhelmed by affect (emotion dysregulation). DBT addresses directly a building up of greater resistance to being overwhelmed by affect and provides practical suggestions, especially through its group therapy component, on how to better manage these periods.</p><p>For patients who have been able to handle better their emotions and have some, even if only fluctuating, distance from their emotions, transitioning them to an mentalization-type therapy should be considered. Further progress in frustration tolerance and greater distance and perspective with respect to their emotions could allow for a shift into insight oriented, transference-focused therapy. A reasonable, alternative perspective is that success in DBT or mentalization-based therapy does not mean that one must move on to a different form of psychotherapeutic treatment of BPD.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H16\"><span class=\"h1\">PHARMACOTHERAPY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Medication is considered an adjunct to psychotherapy, the first-line treatment for borderline personality disorder (BPD). By lessening symptoms, it is thought that pharmacotherapy may facilitate the cognitive, behavioral, and relational work of therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-borderline-personality-disorder/abstract/4,31-35\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,31-35</a>]. The psychotherapies described in this topic are compatible with concurrent pharmacotherapy; many patients in the trials reviewed here were taking medication alongside the interventions.

As with all patients treated with medication, patients with BPD should be monitored for drug side effects.</p><p>Polypharmacy is common in BPD patients, and should be avoided when possible. As an example, in a study of 290 patients with BPD, 46 percent had a history of taking three or more psychotropic medications concurrently [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-borderline-personality-disorder/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>]. There is little evidence to support the use of drug combinations in BPD. Following an adequate trial of an insufficiently effective medication for a symptom cluster, clinicians should consider trying a second monotherapy trial rather than augmentation. </p><p>Clinicians should generally seek to avoid prescribing benzodiazepines and other <span class=\"nowrap\">sedative/hypnotic</span> drugs in patients with BPD because of the potential for misuse and dependence, the lack of evidence of beneficial effects, and the added complexity of treatment with controlled substances. Many patients with BPD have comorbid substance use disorders.</p><p>An elevated risk of overdose is a concern in treating BPD patients. While in cases of active suicidality or very high risk patients, the prescribing clinicians may limit the amount of medication dispensed by the pharmacy or have a family member maintain possession of the medication, these procedures may be counterproductive in reaching therapeutic goals of increased patient autonomy with increased responsibility for her or his behavior. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H118371643\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL MANAGEMENT</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H118371580\"><span class=\"h2\">General principles</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Management of borderline personality disorder (BPD) is guided by principles derived from clinical experience [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-borderline-personality-disorder/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Develop and maintain a therapeutic alliance </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Interact with patients in an active and empathic manner and use validation</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Encourage patients to take responsibility for their actions and problems</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Maintain regular appointments that patients are expected to keep</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Establish clear boundaries with respect to the treatment relationship and patient behaviors </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Set limits when necessary to maintain these boundaries</p><p/><p>In patients with BPD and a co-occurring mood or anxiety disorder, both diagnoses should be subjects of clinical attention, but treatment should focus principally on BPD. Research and our clinical experience suggest that effective treatment of BPD, rather than the co-occurring disorder, is more likely to lead to remission or improvement of both disorders [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-borderline-personality-disorder/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>]. As an example, the affect of depression as presented by patients with BPD is not always (or even often) a major depressive episode. We should be cautious about prescribing more and higher doses of antidepressant medication to treat these subthreshold symptoms when there is little evidence to support drug efficacy. This does not mean that the comorbid diagnosis should be ignored. Comorbid psychiatric disorders with effective pharmacologic interventions should be treated.</p><p>Issues such as overwhelming and immobilizing anxiety or panic attacks, sleep disturbance, regular excessive use of substances, sexual impulsivity, etc, can and should be addressed either through psychoeducation, motivational interviewing, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> medications in parallel to the treatment of the BPD.</p><p>Treatment of BPD is very difficult in patients with ongoing substance use. In patients with a co-occurring substance use disorder (SUD), treatment of the SUD should take precedence over BPD (other than for issues of safety). Physiologically dependent patients, if willing, should undergo medically supervised withdrawal followed by maintenance treatment. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ambulatory-management-of-alcohol-withdrawal\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Ambulatory management of alcohol withdrawal&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=continuing-care-for-addiction-implementation\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Continuing care for addiction: Implementation&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=medically-supervised-opioid-withdrawal-during-treatment-for-addiction\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Medically supervised opioid withdrawal during treatment for addiction&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Patients with BPD can be so intensely demanding and difficult to treat that clinicians may &quot;burn out&quot; and terminate the treatment. One way to avoid burn out is to assemble a team of clinicians to treat these patients, rather than trying to do so individually. Clinicians can seek supervision from a more experienced colleague or to participate in a consultation group for support and clinical guidance.</p><p>Regular communication is required when multiple clinicians treat a patient with BPD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-borderline-personality-disorder/abstract/4,30\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,30</a>]. Collaboration among clinicians can minimize splitting and facilitate the provision of coordinated, effective care. Ongoing discussion among members of the treatment team can also help clinicians manage clinical issues such as countertransference and projective identification that they may experience in the course of treatment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-borderline-personality-disorder/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>].</p><p>When there are multiple clinicians involved in the treatment of the patient, agreement needs to reached as to who is principally following what symptoms or behaviors, particularly <span class=\"nowrap\">suicidality/self-injury,</span> substance use, activities of daily living, and medication adherence and side effects. &#160; </p><p>Many of these principles are discussed in detail separately.

Potential negative effects of hospitalization should also be considered. The patient can regress and become even more passive or suicidal in the hospital. The patient may be treated with contempt in clinical settings where BPD is poorly understood. (BPD is stigmatized in some mental health settings.) The patient may be overmedicated by clinicians who, for example, are unaware that BPD patients can experience transient psychotic symptoms during periods of high stress that may resolve without antipsychotic medication or respond to lower antipsychotic doses that those used for psychotic disorders.</p><p>Patients with BPD should be treated in an outpatient setting when their clinical status and safety permit, with its frequency and intensity modified based on their status. Partial hospitalization (or &ldquo;day treatment&rdquo;), typically a program that meets several hours a day, Monday through Friday, can be helpful for patients who do not respond to multiple outpatient visits each week, though its availability varies geographically. Mainly provided in a group setting, treatment in a partial hospital program focuses principally on reducing harmful and self-destructive behaviors, including substance misuse, and improving coping skills. Partial hospitalization is useful when a patient appears to be deteriorating, but the symptoms are not significant enough to require hospital care. Partial hospital programs may or may not be covered by health insurance. </p><p>Evaluation of a patient with BPD to determine an appropriate level of care includes:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Severity of signs and symptoms</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Presence of violent or potentially lethal ideation directed at self or others</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Ability to control dangerous impulses</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Presence of comorbid disorders</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Recent psychosocial stressors</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Level of functioning at home and work</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Current social supports</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Coping strategies and behaviors</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Personal strengths and weaknesses</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Goals for treatment</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H540947739\"><span class=\"h2\">Monitoring</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients with BPD should be systematically monitored over their course of treatment, with serial assessment of their symptoms, functioning, safety, medication adherence, and side effects.
