However, complications can occur such that acute grief is unrelenting, intense, and functionally debilitating. Complicated grief is a unique and recognizable syndrome that requires specific treatment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complicated-grief-in-adults-treatment/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p>This topic reviews treatment of complicated grief. The epidemiology, clinical manifestations, assessment, diagnosis, and differential diagnosis of complicated grief are discussed separately, as are the clinical features of grief and bereavement, management of grief and bereavement, and palliative care.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=complicated-grief-in-adults-epidemiology-clinical-features-assessment-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Complicated grief in adults: Epidemiology, clinical features, assessment, and diagnosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=grief-and-bereavement-in-adults-clinical-features\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Grief and bereavement in adults: Clinical features&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=grief-and-bereavement-in-adults-management\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Grief and bereavement in adults: Management&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=benefits-services-and-models-of-subspecialty-palliative-care\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Benefits, services, and models of subspecialty palliative care&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H732354\"><span class=\"h1\">TERMINOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Complicated grief is a form of acute grief that is unusually prolonged, intense, and disabling; troubling thoughts, dysfunctional behaviors, dysregulated emotions, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> serious psychosocial problems impede adaptation to the loss. The syndrome of complicated grief is a unique and recognizable condition that can be differentiated from other mental disorders. Other terms that have been used to describe complicated grief include chronic grief, complex grief, pathological grief, persistent complex bereavement disorder, prolonged grief disorder, traumatic grief, and unresolved grief.</p><p>Additional information about the terminology that describes different aspects of death is discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=complicated-grief-in-adults-epidemiology-clinical-features-assessment-and-diagnosis#H86315645\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Complicated grief in adults: Epidemiology, clinical features, assessment, and diagnosis&quot;, section on 'Terminology'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1518081\"><span class=\"h1\">GENERAL PRINCIPLES</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3255411\"><span class=\"h2\">Goals</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The goals of treatment include resolving grief complications and fostering adaptation to the loss. Achievement of these goals is indicated by:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Relief of:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Ruminations related to the deceased</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Excessive proximity seeking (eg, wanting to see, touch, hear, or smell things to feel close to the deceased)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Excessive avoidance behavior (ie, avoiding reminders of the deceased)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Improved emotion regulation &ndash; Ability to experience negative emotions (eg, sadness, anxiety, or anger) and set them aside, and increased experiences of positive emotions</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Accepting the finality of the loss and understanding its consequences</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A feeling of enduring connection to the deceased, in a manner different from when the deceased was alive</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>An ability to envision life with the possibility for happiness</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Engagement in satisfying activities and relationships</p><p/><p>Treatment of complicated grief does not entail remission of all grief symptoms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complicated-grief-in-adults-treatment/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Although grief diminishes in frequency, intensity, and duration as the loss is integrated, bereaved people continue to miss the deceased and feel some sadness. In addition, acute grief symptoms may spike at times when reminders of the lost loved one are prominent (eg, holidays, the anniversary of the death, or family celebrations). These are normal experiences and should not be considered unresolved complicated grief.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H293267462\"><span class=\"h2\">Education</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Education about complicated grief is an essential component of treatment. Many patients with complicated grief are discouraged by the prolonged acute grief and feel hopeless, and are relieved to receive the diagnosis as well as education about the disorder [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complicated-grief-in-adults-treatment/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Some patients may have been misdiagnosed with major depression or another disorder, and thus treated unsuccessfully. In addition, family and friends who initially were supportive may be critical and tired of trying to help because they do not realize the patient has a treatable condition. Education is an element of psychotherapies that have demonstrated efficacy for complicated grief [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complicated-grief-in-adults-treatment/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H355926405\" class=\"local\">'First line'</a> below and <a href=\"#H355926412\" class=\"local\">'Second line'</a> below.)</p><p>Evidence that supports educating patients about complicated grief includes a randomized trial that compared education plus usual care with usual care alone (n = 67 patients treated by primary care clinicians) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complicated-grief-in-adults-treatment/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Information about complicated grief was provided to both the patients and clinicians who were assigned to the active intervention. The information described the symptoms and risk factors for complicated grief, as well as two strategies for adapting to the loss: confronting the painful reality of the loss and setting the pain aside to focus upon something emotionally neutral or positive. There was a trend for a greater response in the group who received education.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4671709\"><span class=\"h2\">Monitoring</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Outpatients with complicated grief should be monitored every one to four weeks, depending upon symptom acuity. Response to treatment can be monitored with the Clinical Global Impression Scale for Complicated Grief (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PSYCH%2F93614\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef93614 \">table 1</a>). The instrument rates the global severity of complicated grief symptoms as well as global improvement on Likert scales ranging from 1 to 7; behavioral descriptions anchor each point of the scale.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1627096\"><span class=\"h2\">Comorbidity</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Complicated grief is often accompanied by comorbid psychiatric disorders such as unipolar major depression and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Following successful treatment of complicated grief, comorbidity that persists should be managed with treatments (eg, pharmacotherapy <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> psychotherapy) that are indicated in other contexts. In patients with prominent comorbidities such as major depression, concurrent treatment of complicated grief and co-occurring psychiatric disorders may represent an optimal approach. Comorbid disorders that occur in complicated grief are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=complicated-grief-in-adults-epidemiology-clinical-features-assessment-and-diagnosis#H15816530\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Complicated grief in adults: Epidemiology, clinical features, assessment, and diagnosis&quot;, section on 'Comorbidity'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5887045\"><span class=\"h1\">PREVENTION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The use of psychotherapy during acute grief to prevent complicated grief is discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=grief-and-bereavement-in-adults-management#H427660\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Grief and bereavement in adults: Management&quot;, section on 'General approach'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4670119\"><span class=\"h1\">CHOOSING TREATMENT</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H355926345\"><span class=\"h2\">Overview</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Randomized trials indicate that the best treatment for complicated grief is psychotherapy that is specific for complicated grief. As an example, a meta-analysis of five trials compared psychotherapies (eg, cognitive-behavioral therapy [CBT]) adapted for complicated grief with control conditions (eg, nonspecific supportive psychotherapy) in 368 patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complicated-grief-in-adults-treatment/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. Improvement was greater with psychotherapies adapted for complicated grief and the clinical benefit was moderately large. In addition, one study followed patients beyond the end of treatment and found that improvement remained greater in patients who received active treatment. However, the heterogeneity across the five trials was large.</p><p>Based upon clinical experience, support groups led by clinicians or peers may be helpful as add-on treatment for complicated grief [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complicated-grief-in-adults-treatment/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H355926405\"><span class=\"h2\">First line</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>For patients with complicated grief, we recommend CBT adapted for complicated grief as first-line treatment. CBT has been widely studied and multiple randomized trials indicate that CBT targeted for complicated grief is efficacious; the evidence supporting CBT includes head-to-head trials comparing CBT with other active treatments (rather than waiting list controls or usual care). As an example, a 12-week trial compared CBT with grief counseling in 54 patients, and found that improvement of complicated grief was greater with CBT and that its clinical effect was large [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complicated-grief-in-adults-treatment/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. Clinicians can expect that response (eg, much or very much improved on the Clinical Global Impression Scale for Complicated Grief (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PSYCH%2F93614\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef93614 \">table 1</a>)) will occur in approximately 50 to 70 percent of patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complicated-grief-in-adults-treatment/abstract/6-9\" class=\"abstract_t\">6-9</a>].</p><p>CBT can be administered in different formats, including individual, group, and internet [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complicated-grief-in-adults-treatment/abstract/8-10\" class=\"abstract_t\">8-10</a>]. Based upon observational studies, an adjunctive antidepressant (eg, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor) may be helpful, especially for patients with comorbid major depression [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complicated-grief-in-adults-treatment/abstract/11,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,12</a>]. Other observational studies suggest that the benefits of CBT can persist beyond the end of treatment (eg, at least one to two years) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complicated-grief-in-adults-treatment/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>].</p><p>One form of CBT that has been well studied is called &ldquo;complicated grief therapy.&rdquo; Complicated grief therapy includes techniques adapted from prolonged exposure, interpersonal psychotherapy, and motivational interviewing [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complicated-grief-in-adults-treatment/abstract/2,6,8,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,6,8,14</a>]. Evidence for the efficacy of complicated grief therapy includes randomized trials that were conducted by the same principal investigator in different age groups [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complicated-grief-in-adults-treatment/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>One trial compared complicated grief therapy with interpersonal psychotherapy in 95 patients (mean age approximately 48 years) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complicated-grief-in-adults-treatment/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. Both treatments were administered in 16 weekly sessions, and patients were allowed to continue antidepressants initiated prior to study intake. Response (baseline symptoms improved considerably or greatly) occurred in more patients who received complicated grief therapy than interpersonal psychotherapy (51 versus 28 percent).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A second trial using similar methods, compared complicated grief therapy with interpersonal psychotherapy in 151 patients (mean age approximately 66 years) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complicated-grief-in-adults-treatment/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. More patients responded to complicated grief therapy than interpersonal psychotherapy (70 versus 32 percent), and response was sustained six months post-treatment.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A 20-week trial enrolled 395 patients (mean age 53 years) and randomly assigned them to one of four treatments: complicated grief therapy plus <a href=\"topic.htm?path=citalopram-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">citalopram</a>, complicated grief therapy plus placebo, citalopram alone, or placebo alone [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complicated-grief-in-adults-treatment/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. The mean dose of citalopram was 34 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day</span>. The results included the following:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>More patients responded to complicated grief therapy plus placebo than placebo alone (83 versus 55 percent).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>The number of patients who responded to complicated grief therapy plus <a href=\"topic.htm?path=citalopram-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">citalopram</a> and to complicated grief therapy plus placebo was nearly identical (84 and 83 percent). </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Response was greater with complicated grief therapy plus <a href=\"topic.htm?path=citalopram-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">citalopram</a> than citalopram alone (84 versus 69 percent of patients). In addition, improvement of suicidal ideation was greater with combination treatment than pharmacotherapy alone.</p><p/><p>In addition, observational studies suggest that complicated grief therapy may be helpful for patients with complicated grief and comorbid substance use disorders [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complicated-grief-in-adults-treatment/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>], as well as patients with complicated grief in non-Western settings [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complicated-grief-in-adults-treatment/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>].</p><p>The theoretical foundation for complicated grief therapy includes an attachment theory model. The model hypothesizes that people are biologically driven to form close relationships with other people, and that adaptation to losing a close relationship requires acknowledging the finality and consequences of the loss, revising the internalized representation of the deceased, and re-envisioning life plans and goals [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complicated-grief-in-adults-treatment/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=grief-and-bereavement-in-adults-clinical-features#H11407409\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Grief and bereavement in adults: Clinical features&quot;, section on 'Loss of attachment'</a>.)</p><p>Complicated grief therapy facilitates adaptive coping by focusing upon two key areas [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complicated-grief-in-adults-treatment/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Loss &ndash; Thinking about the loss of a loved one in a more acceptable and peaceful manner, with less anguish, anxiety, guilt, or anger</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Restoration &ndash; Restoring a satisfying life without the deceased</p><p/><p>Although efficacious treatments for complicated grief include the element of exposure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complicated-grief-in-adults-treatment/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>], focusing solely upon the thoughts, emotions, and memories associated with the loss is not beneficial and is akin to rumination [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complicated-grief-in-adults-treatment/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>].</p><p>The protocol for administering complicated grief therapy includes four phases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complicated-grief-in-adults-treatment/abstract/1,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,8</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Getting Started (sessions 1 to 3) &ndash; Therapists educate patients about acute, integrated, and complicated grief as well as the elements of complicated grief therapy; elicit a history of the patient&rsquo;s relationships and long-term aspirational goals; monitor grief symptoms; and encourage patients to invite a close friend or relative to the third session.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The Core Revisiting Sequence (sessions 4 to 9) &ndash; This phase focuses upon:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Loss &ndash; Techniques that address losing a loved one include imaginal revisiting of the time that the patient learned about the loss. During imaginal revisiting, patients repeatedly visualize the period of learning about the death, retell the story of the death, and reflect on this story. Another technique involves gradually confronting painful reminders of the loss by revisiting, in vivo, avoided situations that are challenging but doable, and then progressively revisiting more painful reminders. Patients also begin a five-session component on memories of the loss. The therapist monitors distress during the use of exposure techniques, supporting and encouraging patients to allow themselves to feel the pain that they have been avoiding during prolonged grief. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Restoration &ndash; Patients work on self-care and relationships with others by defining and addressing aspirational goals, developing plans that generate positive emotions, and engaging in pleasurable activities.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Grief monitoring (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PSYCH%2F93614\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef93614 \">table 1</a>).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Midcourse review (session 10) &ndash; Progress to date is discussed and plans for the closing sequence are outlined.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Closing Sequence (sessions 11 to 16) &ndash; Patients continue to work on adjusting to the loss by completing memories work and having an imaginal conversation with their deceased loved one. Restoration and future plans are progressively emphasized, and patients complete a segment on termination, which includes relapse prevention and expressing one&rsquo;s thoughts and feelings about ending treatment and the relationship with the clinician.</p><p/><p>Each session is structured and focused upon reviewing activities (homework) from the preceding week, discussing both loss and restoration issues, and deciding upon activities to be completed prior to the next session. Self-observation and reflection is emphasized throughout the treatment, as is practice of self-compassion.</p><p>Serious psychosocial problems may occur after bereavement, and therapists should address any such problems prior to undertaking a psychotherapy targeting complicated grief. As an example, patients may face severe financial, occupational, or interpersonal problems, such as lawsuits related to the death, disability due to incapacitating symptoms, or conflicts with family members in settling the estate. If psychosocial problems are present and unrecognized, grief focused treatment may stall (eg, poor adherence may occur after 4 to 6 sessions, or patients may demonstrate little or no improvement after 10 to 12 sessions).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H355926412\"><span class=\"h2\">Second line</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>If patients with complicated grief do not respond adequately to an entire course of CBT specific for complicated grief, they should be re-evaluated to determine whether the diagnosis is complicated grief or a different disorder such as major depression or posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). In addition, many patients with complicated grief have comorbid major depression, anxiety disorders, PTSD, or substance use disorders. If a disorder other than complicated grief is more salient, treatment should refocus upon the primary problem. The differential diagnosis and comorbidity of complicated grief are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=complicated-grief-in-adults-epidemiology-clinical-features-assessment-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Complicated grief in adults: Epidemiology, clinical features, assessment, and diagnosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p>CBT adapted for complicated grief may not be available or may be declined, or patients whose primary problem is complicated grief may be unresponsive to CBT despite addressing psychosocial problems. For these patients, we suggest behavioral activation as second-line treatment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complicated-grief-in-adults-treatment/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. Evidence for the efficacy of behavioral activation includes a 12-week randomized trial that compared behavioral activation with a waiting list control in 25 patients; after 12 weeks, patients in the control group received behavioral activation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complicated-grief-in-adults-treatment/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. Behavioral activation was administered in 12 to 14 individual sessions, and included education about complicated grief, self-monitoring of activities, identifying patterns and reinforcers of avoidant behavior, and scheduling alternative rewarding activities. Improvement was greater with active treatment; among the 25 patients, response at posttreatment occurred in 45 percent. At the follow-up assessment 12 weeks after treatment ended, response was observed in 60 percent of patients. In addition, symptoms of depression and PTSD also improved.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H355926419\"><span class=\"h2\">Other options</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>For patients with complicated grief who decline, do not respond to, or do not have access to first- and second-line treatments, we suggest an approach that combines each of the following [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complicated-grief-in-adults-treatment/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Education about complicated grief.

(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=complicated-grief-in-adults-epidemiology-clinical-features-assessment-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Complicated grief in adults: Epidemiology, clinical features, assessment, and diagnosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The goals of treatment include resolving grief complications and fostering adaptation to the loss; however, resolution of grief complications is not the same as remission of all grief symptoms. Patients with complicated grief are often relieved to receive the diagnosis and education about the disorder. Response to treatment can be monitored with the Clinical Global Impression Scale for Complicated Grief (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PSYCH%2F93614\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef93614 \">table 1</a>). (See <a href=\"#H1518081\" class=\"local\">'General principles'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The best proven treatment for complicated grief is psychotherapy that is specific for the condition. (See <a href=\"#H355926345\" class=\"local\">'Overview'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients with complicated grief, we recommend cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) adapted for complicated grief as first-line treatment, rather than other psychotherapies (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=1\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1A</a>). We typically use a form of CBT called &ldquo;complicated grief therapy.&rdquo; If patients are not responding to first-line treatment, patients should be re-evaluated with respect to psychosocial problems that require attention. (See <a href=\"#H355926405\" class=\"local\">'First line'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients unresponsive to CBT specific for complicated grief should be re-evaluated to verify the diagnosis of complicated grief. For patients with an established diagnosis of complicated grief who do not respond adequately to CBT, as well as patients who decline or do not have access to CBT, we suggest behavioral activation as second-line treatment, rather than other treatments (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=5\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2B</a>). (See <a href=\"#H355926412\" class=\"local\">'Second line'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>One option for patients with complicated grief who decline or do not respond to or have access to first- and second-line treatments is an approach that combines each of the following: education about complicated grief, grief counseling and support, encouragement to reduce avoidance behavior, correcting dysfunctional thoughts, anticipating anniversary dates, encouragement to consider aspirations and goals, and an antidepressant medication. (See <a href=\"#H355926419\" class=\"local\">'Other options'</a> above.)</p></div><div id=\"topicAgreement\">Use of UpToDate is subject to the <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/legal/license\" class=\"licenseLink\" id=\"sla_in_page\">Subscription and License Agreement</a>.</div><div id=\"references\" class=\"headingAnchor\"><h1>REFERENCES</h1><ol id=\"reference\"><li><a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complicated-grief-in-adults-treatment/abstract/1\" class=\"nounderline abstract_t\">Shear MK.
