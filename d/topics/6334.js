Seizures are waves of abnormal electrical activity in the brain. Seizures can make you pass out, or move or behave strangely.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10157368\"><span class=\"h1\">Can women with epilepsy have a normal pregnancy?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Yes. Most women with epilepsy can have a healthy pregnancy.</p><p>If you have epilepsy and want to have a baby, you will need to work closely with your doctors. They will make sure that you are doing the right things to control your epilepsy and protect your baby.</p><p>More than one doctor will take care of you during pregnancy. One doctor will take care of your pregnancy. Your epilepsy doctor will take care of your epilepsy.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10157383\"><span class=\"h1\">What should I do before trying to get pregnant?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>It is very important to talk with your doctor <strong>before</strong> you try to get pregnant. That way, he or she has enough time to check your anti-seizure medicine and change it, if needed. That's because certain anti-seizure medicines and doses can harm an unborn baby.</p><p>Your doctor might:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Change your anti-seizure medicine &ndash; He or she will make sure that your anti-seizure medicine is adjusted to be as safe as possible during pregnancy.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Stop your anti-seizure medicine &ndash; If you have not had any seizures for 2 years, your doctor might talk with you about stopping your medicine. But don't ever stop an anti-seizure medicine on your own.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Lower your dose of anti-seizure medicine</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Reduce the number of anti-seizure medicines you take (if you take more than one)</p><p/><p>In addition to checking your medicine, your doctor will prescribe a vitamin called &quot;folate&quot; or &quot;<a href=\"topic.htm?path=folic-acid-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">folic acid</a>.&quot; All women who are trying to get pregnant should take folate, because it helps prevent birth defects. Women who take certain anti-seizure medicines might need extra folate.</p><p>There are also steps that all women should take before trying to get pregnant.

If you fall down, you could hurt yourself and your baby.

Being pregnant will probably not make you have more seizures. But you could have more seizures if you don't follow your doctor's instructions and take your anti-seizure medicine (if you need medicine).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10157430\"><span class=\"h1\">How can I lower my chances of having a seizure?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>To lower your chances of having a seizure, you can:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Take your anti-seizure medicine exactly as directed &ndash; Do not stop or change your medicine without talking to your doctor. You might worry that your anti-seizure medicine will harm your baby. There is some chance that the medicine could do harm, but having a seizure can also harm your baby.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Let your doctor know if you start any new prescription or non-prescription medicines, or herbal drugs</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Get enough sleep &ndash; Not getting enough sleep raises your chances of having a seizure.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Eat a healthy diet</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10157445\"><span class=\"h1\">Will I have tests during pregnancy?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Yes. You will have tests to check your baby's health. These can include blood tests and an imaging test called an ultrasound. An ultrasound creates pictures of your baby.</p><p>You might also have blood tests to check the amount of anti-seizure medicine in your body.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10157460\"><span class=\"h1\">Can I have a normal vaginal delivery?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Yes. Most women can have a normal vaginal delivery. It is uncommon for women to have a seizure during delivery. Even so, your doctor will watch you closely during your delivery and adjust your medicine, if needed.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10157475\"><span class=\"h1\">Will my baby be healthy?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>If your epilepsy was under control during your pregnancy, chances are very good that your baby will be healthy.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10157490\"><span class=\"h1\">Will I be able to breastfeed?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Yes. Most women are able to breastfeed. If you want to breastfeed, talk with your doctor. He or she will make sure that your anti-seizure medicine is safe to take if you breastfeed.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10157505\"><span class=\"h1\">What else can I do to protect my baby?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>If you have frequent seizures, there are things you can do to help keep your baby safe after he or she is born. You can:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Change your baby's diaper on the floor &ndash; That way, if you have a seizure, your baby won't fall off a changing table.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Have someone else with you when you bathe your baby &ndash; That way, your baby won't be alone in the bathtub if you have a seizure.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10157527\"><span class=\"h1\">More on this topic</span></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=epilepsy-in-adults-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Epilepsy in adults (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=eeg-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: EEG (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=seizures-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Seizures (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=how-to-plan-and-prepare-for-a-healthy-pregnancy-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: How to plan and prepare for a healthy pregnancy (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=deciding-to-breastfeed-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Deciding to breastfeed (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=reducing-the-costs-of-medicines-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Reducing the costs of medicines (The Basics)</a></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=seizures-in-adults-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Seizures in adults (Beyond the Basics)</a></p></div><div id=\"reviewProcess\"><span>All topics are updated as new evidence becomes available and our <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/home/editorial-policy\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"policy policy_editorialpolicy\">peer review process</a> is complete.</span></div><div id=\"topicRetrievedDate\"><span class=\"emphasis\">This topic retrieved from UpToDate on: </span>Apr 02, 2018.</div><div id=\"disclaimer\">The content on the UpToDate website is not intended nor recommended as a substitute for medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.
