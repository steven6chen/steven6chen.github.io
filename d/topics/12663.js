Systemic therapy <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> metastasectomy is also used for patients who have relapsed with advanced disease following prior definitive treatment.

The approach should recognize the palliative intent of treatment.</p><p>The development of contemporary cytotoxic chemotherapy agents, targeted agents, and immunotherapy provides a range of options for patients who are candidates for systemic therapy. The integration of these modalities as initial and subsequent therapies is summarized in the algorithms (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F113419\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef113419 \">algorithm 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F113408\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef113408 \">algorithm 2</a>).</p><p>These approaches have been evaluated in numerous randomized, phase III clinical trials that were conducted primarily in younger patients with a good performance status (Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status [PS] 0 or 1, (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F72901\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef72901 \">table 2</a>)).</p><p>For nonelderly patients without significant comorbidity, the choice of initial systemic therapy should be individualized based upon molecular and histologic features of the tumor. Whenever possible, patients should have tumor tissue assessed for the presence of a driver mutation that stimulates tumor growth [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-treatment-of-advanced-non-small-cell-lung-cancer/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>].
