Family studies and advances in molecular genetics have provided important insights into the molecular pathways underlying the pathogenesis of these syndromes, as well as new insights into sporadic renal cell carcinoma (RCC) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hereditary-kidney-cancer-syndromes/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>]. Each of these syndromes has its own molecular alteration, and these are often reflected in distinctive histologic features and clinical course. Less than 5 percent of all RCC cases are thought to be due to a hereditary syndrome [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hereditary-kidney-cancer-syndromes/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].</p><p>The inherited kidney cancer syndromes are summarized and reviewed here (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F53600\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef53600 \">table 1</a>). Other topics provide more general discussions of RCC and its management.

It is estimated that less than one-half of these cases are diagnosed during an individual's lifetime, since the disease is often clinically silent. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=genetics-of-autosomal-dominant-polycystic-kidney-disease-and-mechanisms-of-cyst-growth\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Genetics of autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease and mechanisms of cyst growth&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=course-and-treatment-of-autosomal-dominant-polycystic-kidney-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Course and treatment of autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=renal-manifestations-of-autosomal-dominant-polycystic-kidney-disease#H7\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Renal manifestations of autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease&quot;, section on 'Renal cancer'</a>.)</p><p>The incidence of renal cell carcinoma (RCC) in patients with polycystic kidney disease does not appear to be increased compared with the general population [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hereditary-kidney-cancer-syndromes/abstract/4,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,5</a>]. However, the tumors are more often bilateral at presentation (12 versus 1 to 4 percent in sporadic RCC in the general population), multicentric (28 versus 6 percent), and sarcomatoid in type (33 versus 1 to 5 percent).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">HEREDITARY PAPILLARY RENAL CARCINOMA</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Hereditary papillary renal carcinoma (HPRC) is a familial cancer syndrome in which affected individuals are at risk for the development of type 1 papillary renal cell carcinomas [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hereditary-kidney-cancer-syndromes/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].</p><p>HPRC is a highly penetrant, autosomal dominant condition. Both early- and late-onset forms of HPRC have been described [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hereditary-kidney-cancer-syndromes/abstract/7,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,8</a>]. HPRC is manifested primarily by the development of papillary renal tumors, which are often multifocal and bilateral. On imaging studies, the lesions are relatively hypovascular and grow slowly [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hereditary-kidney-cancer-syndromes/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].</p><p>Genetic linkage analyses found that the <em>HPRC</em> gene (the <em>MET</em> protooncogene) is located on the long arm of chromosome 7 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hereditary-kidney-cancer-syndromes/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. This gene codes for a membrane-bound receptor for hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) and has an intracellular tyrosine kinase domain. Mutations in <em>MET</em> constitutively activate the tyrosine kinase domain of this protein in patients with HPRC [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hereditary-kidney-cancer-syndromes/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>].</p><p>Most patients have bilateral, multifocal tumors. As such, nephron-sparing procedures such as partial nephrectomy are preferred to maintain renal function while minimizing the risk of distant metastases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hereditary-kidney-cancer-syndromes/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. Patients with tumors less than 3 cm generally are managed with observation. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diagnostic-approach-differential-diagnosis-and-management-of-a-small-renal-mass\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Diagnostic approach, differential diagnosis, and management of a small renal mass&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=definitive-surgical-management-of-renal-cell-carcinoma#H387391471\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Definitive surgical management of renal cell carcinoma&quot;, section on 'Partial nephrectomy'</a>.)</p><p>In patients with distant metastases or unresectable disease, agents targeting the <em>MET</em> pathway are being developed. As an example, a phase II multicenter study of the dual <em>MET</em><span class=\"nowrap\">/vascular</span> endothelial growth factor receptor 2 (VEGFR2) inhibitor foretinib demonstrated a response in 5 out of 10 patients with HPRC [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hereditary-kidney-cancer-syndromes/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>].</p><p>Germline <em>MET</em> mutation analysis is recommended for patients with HPRC. Techniques are being developed to detect carriers of germline mutations in family members of patients with HPRC [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hereditary-kidney-cancer-syndromes/abstract/8,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,10</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2142544\"><span class=\"h1\">KIDNEY CANCER ASSOCIATED WITH GERMLINE MUTATIONS OF THE TRICARBOXYLIC ACID CYCLE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Inherited mutations involving enzymes of the tricarboxylic acid (Krebs) cycle are associated with aggressive forms of renal cell carcinoma (RCC) that have a propensity to metastasize even at a small size (&lt;1 cm). Therefore, early surgical intervention is warranted, even for very small tumors. To date, two enzyme mutations have been characterized: fumarate hydratase, which causes hereditary leiomyomatosis and RCC, and succinate dehydrogenase, which is associated with hereditary paraganglioma and pheochromocytoma, and rarely, RCC.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Hereditary leiomyomatosis and renal cell cancer syndrome</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Hereditary leiomyomatosis and renal cell cancer (HLRCC) is a syndrome in which affected family members have cutaneous and uterine leiomyomas, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> papillary type 2 RCCs. This syndrome is also called the multiple cutaneous and uterine leiomyomatosis syndrome (MCUL1) or Reed's syndrome. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=variants-of-uterine-leiomyomas-fibroids#H23364055\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Variants of uterine leiomyomas (fibroids)&quot;, section on 'Hereditary leiomyomatosis and renal cell carcinoma syndrome'</a>.)</p><p>Family studies have linked HLRCC to abnormalities in the fumarate hydratase (<em>FH</em>) gene, which is located on the long arm of chromosome 1 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hereditary-kidney-cancer-syndromes/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. <em>FH</em> is part of the mitochondrial Krebs or tricarboxylic acid cycle. The mechanism by which alterations in <em>FH</em> lead to HLRCC is not completely understood, although it may involve increased cellular dependence on glycolysis and pseudohypoxia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hereditary-kidney-cancer-syndromes/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. One study showed that an antioxidant response element-controlled gene, the aldo-keto reductase family 1 member B10 (<em>AKR1B10</em>), is upregulated in <em>FH</em> knockdown and <em>FH</em> null cell lines [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hereditary-kidney-cancer-syndromes/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. Other experiments have found that inactivating mutations of <em>FH</em> appear to result in the generation of reactive oxygen species and stabilization of hypoxia-inducible factor 1 alpha (HIF1A), which is necessary for the generation of pseudohypoxia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hereditary-kidney-cancer-syndromes/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=molecular-biology-and-pathogenesis-of-von-hippel-lindau-disease#H3\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Molecular biology and pathogenesis of von Hippel-Lindau disease&quot;, section on 'Hypoxia-inducible factor 1 and 2'</a>.) </p><p>HLRCC is transmitted in an autosomal dominant fashion, and the <em>FH</em> gene is thought to act as a tumor suppressor gene. Germline alterations that have been identified include missense, nonsense, insertion, deletion, and splice-site mutations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hereditary-kidney-cancer-syndromes/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>].</p><p>The most striking clinical feature of the disease is the occurrence of severely symptomatic uterine fibroids among affected women, often requiring hysterectomy at a young age due to uterine bleeding or discomfort [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hereditary-kidney-cancer-syndromes/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. Transformation of leiomyomas to leiomyosarcomas has been reported in rare cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hereditary-kidney-cancer-syndromes/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>].</p><p>Cutaneous leiomyomas are common among individuals with HLRCC. These leiomyomas typically develop on the trunk and extremities and are quite apparent and symptomatic. In a few cases, patients may have only subtle skin findings [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hereditary-kidney-cancer-syndromes/abstract/19,21\" class=\"abstract_t\">19,21</a>].</p><p>Renal tumors occur in 20 to 30 percent of patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hereditary-kidney-cancer-syndromes/abstract/14,21\" class=\"abstract_t\">14,21</a>]. These renal carcinomas tend to be aggressive, with rapid nodal and distant dissemination, even if the primary tumor is relatively small and contained. As an example, in a French series of 182 patients with HLRCC, the median age at diagnosis was 40 years old, and 82 percent had metastatic disease at diagnosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hereditary-kidney-cancer-syndromes/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. Skin leiomyosarcomas were rare, and most histologies were consistent with type 2 papillary RCC. Median survival for metastatic disease was 18 months.</p><p>Patients with suspected HLRCC should undergo a thorough imaging evaluation and early intervention. Complete wide excision including lymph node dissection has been recommended in patients with localized or locally advanced disease. Close follow-up is required after initial treatment. Systemic therapy has not been shown to be effective for patients with metastatic disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hereditary-kidney-cancer-syndromes/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>].</p><p>A multidisciplinary approach including gynecologists, dermatologists, and genetic counselors is required for optimal patient management.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2142734\"><span class=\"h2\">Succinate dehydrogenase mutation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>This enzyme deficiency is associated with an autosomal dominant condition called hereditary paraganglioma and pheochromocytoma. The syndrome is characterized by paragangliomas involving the head and neck region, thorax, abdomen, pelvis, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> urinary bladder. Paragangliomas typically develop in patients in their thirties. However, rarely, an aggressive variant of RCC is also seen with this syndrome. Succinate dehydrogenase (<em>SDH</em>) is comprised of four subunits (<em>SDHA</em>, <em>SDHB</em>, <em>SDHC</em>, and <em>SDHD</em>), and each subunit has been associated with cases of RCC [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hereditary-kidney-cancer-syndromes/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. <em>SDH</em>-associated RCC presents at an early age [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hereditary-kidney-cancer-syndromes/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>], although the age at diagnosis ranges from 24 to 73 years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hereditary-kidney-cancer-syndromes/abstract/25,26\" class=\"abstract_t\">25,26</a>]. The histologic type of kidney cancer varies, although in most cases, pathologic analysis showed either a clear cell or chromophobe type RCC [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hereditary-kidney-cancer-syndromes/abstract/25,26\" class=\"abstract_t\">25,26</a>]. Cases of metastatic <em>SDH</em>-associated RCC responding to <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sunitinib-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">sunitinib</a> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pazopanib-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">pazopanib</a> have been reported [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hereditary-kidney-cancer-syndromes/abstract/27,28\" class=\"abstract_t\">27,28</a>].</p><p>Testing for <em>SDH</em> mutations is advised in patients with early-onset kidney cancer (ie, age &lt;45 years), bilateral or multifocal tumors, and a family history of pheochromocytoma or paraganglioma and kidney cancer [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hereditary-kidney-cancer-syndromes/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>].

(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=birt-hogg-dube-syndrome\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Birt-Hogg-Dub&eacute; syndrome&quot;</a>.)</p><p>BHD syndrome is caused by mutations in the folliculin (<em>FLCN</em>) gene (also known as the BHD gene), which is localized to the short arm of chromosome 17 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hereditary-kidney-cancer-syndromes/abstract/30,31\" class=\"abstract_t\">30,31</a>]. Mutations in the germline of affected individuals have been identified in 90 percent of affected families [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hereditary-kidney-cancer-syndromes/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>]. DNA sequencing of renal tumors from patients with germline <em>FLCN</em> mutations has identified somatic mutations in the wild-type copy of the gene, suggesting that <em>FLCN</em> is a loss-of-function tumor suppressor gene [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hereditary-kidney-cancer-syndromes/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>].</p><p>The <em>FLCN</em> gene may be involved in energy, metabolism, and nutrient sensing through the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway. The folliculin-interacting protein (FNIP1) interacts with 5' AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), a key molecule for energy sensing to negatively regulate mTOR activity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hereditary-kidney-cancer-syndromes/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>].</p><p>The penetrance of renal cancer in patients with BHD is up to 30 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hereditary-kidney-cancer-syndromes/abstract/35,36\" class=\"abstract_t\">35,36</a>]. In one series, the risk of renal tumors was 27 percent at a mean age of 50 years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hereditary-kidney-cancer-syndromes/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>]. However, the incidence of renal tumors may vary in different families, and BHD may be underdiagnosed in patients with variable skin findings. One series that included 115 <em>FLCN</em> carriers estimated penetrance for renal cancer and pneumothorax to be 16 and 29 percent, respectively, at 70 years of age [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hereditary-kidney-cancer-syndromes/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>].</p><p>The histology of renal tumors in patients with BHD syndrome varies. Tumors containing a mixed pattern of chromophobe and oncocytic renal cancer are typical, but other histologies may be present [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hereditary-kidney-cancer-syndromes/abstract/29,35\" class=\"abstract_t\">29,35</a>].</p><p>Dermatologic manifestations of BHD syndrome include skin lesions called fibrofolliculomas, which are benign hamartomatous tumors of hair follicles [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hereditary-kidney-cancer-syndromes/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. These whitish papules are most common on the nose and cheeks, and typically are first observed around age 20 years.</p><p>Approximately 80 percent of patients with BHD have multiple pulmonary cysts that can be identified by computed tomography (CT) of the lungs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hereditary-kidney-cancer-syndromes/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. Spontaneous pneumothorax may be seen in up to one-fourth of patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hereditary-kidney-cancer-syndromes/abstract/37-39\" class=\"abstract_t\">37-39</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=primary-spontaneous-pneumothorax-in-adults#H5\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Primary spontaneous pneumothorax in adults&quot;, section on 'Family history'</a>.)</p><p>The kidney cancers observed in patients with BHD syndrome tend to be bilateral or multifocal in more than one-half of cases and are usually slow growing. Thus, the recommended management approach includes observation of tumors less than 3 cm; when surgery is recommended, all visible tumors should be removed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hereditary-kidney-cancer-syndromes/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>]. As with hereditary papillary renal carcinoma, nephron-sparing surgery is preferred to radical nephrectomy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hereditary-kidney-cancer-syndromes/abstract/29,41\" class=\"abstract_t\">29,41</a>]. Follow-up in patients undergoing nephron-sparing surgery is important given the high risk of disease recurrence in the ipsilateral kidney.</p><p>An animal model of BHD has been developed to provide a model for the evaluation of therapeutic approaches to this syndrome [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hereditary-kidney-cancer-syndromes/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>]. In this model, treatment with the mTOR inhibitor rapamycin led to tumor shrinkage.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h1\">TUBEROUS SCLEROSIS COMPLEX</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC; also called tuberous sclerosis) is a hereditary condition that is due to mutations in one of two interacting tumor suppressor gene products, hamartin (TSC1) or tuberin (TSC2). The clinical manifestations include bilateral, multifocal renal lesions, which typically are angiomyolipomas. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tuberous-sclerosis-complex-genetics-clinical-features-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Tuberous sclerosis complex: Genetics, clinical features, and diagnosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The predominant management issue for patients with TSC is the risk of growth and bleeding from the renal angiomyolipoma.
