The pain is not restricted to a specific nerve territory or dermatome and usually has a distal predominance of abnormal sensory, motor, sudomotor, vasomotor, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> trophic findings. The syndrome shows variable progression over time.</p><p>The prevention and management of CRPS will be reviewed here. Other aspects of CRPS in adults and children are presented separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=complex-regional-pain-syndrome-in-adults-pathogenesis-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Complex regional pain syndrome in adults: Pathogenesis, clinical manifestations, and diagnosis&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=complex-regional-pain-syndrome-in-children\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Complex regional pain syndrome in children&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-the-treatment-of-chronic-non-cancer-pain\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of the treatment of chronic non-cancer pain&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">PREVENTION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The best treatment of CRPS is prevention. Supplementation with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=vitamin-c-ascorbic-acid-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">vitamin C</a> following fracture or surgery appears to reduce the risk of developing CRPS. Supportive evidence comes from a meta-analysis of four studies that compared daily vitamin C (&ge;500 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day)</span> versus no vitamin C or placebo in patients with trauma or patients having surgery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complex-regional-pain-syndrome-in-adults-prevention-and-management/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Two of the studies were randomized controlled trials [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complex-regional-pain-syndrome-in-adults-prevention-and-management/abstract/2,3\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,3</a>] and the other two lacked randomization or blinding [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complex-regional-pain-syndrome-in-adults-prevention-and-management/abstract/4,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,5</a>]. Vitamin C treatment was associated with a significant reduction in the development of CRPS (risk ratio 0.22, 95% CI 0.12-0.39) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complex-regional-pain-syndrome-in-adults-prevention-and-management/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. </p><p>The largest trial included in the meta-analysis randomly assigned 416 older women with wrist fractures to receive placebo or one of three daily doses (200, 500, or 1500 mg) of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=vitamin-c-ascorbic-acid-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">vitamin C</a> for 50 days [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complex-regional-pain-syndrome-in-adults-prevention-and-management/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. CRPS was less prevalent in those who received vitamin C (any dose versus placebo, 2.4 versus 10.1 percent). Each of the three doses was statistically superior to placebo, and the higher doses (500 and 1500 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day)</span> had greater mean reductions in the relative risk (RR) of CRPS than the lower dose (RR 0.13, 0.17, and 0.41, respectively).</p><p>Although the mechanism underlying the beneficial effect of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=vitamin-c-ascorbic-acid-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">vitamin C</a> is uncertain, there is little risk from use. The optimal dose of vitamin C remains uncertain, but doses of 500 to 1500 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day</span> are probably more effective than lower doses. There appears to be no clinically significant difference between 500 mg and 1500 mg daily.</p><p>Given these data, we recommend treatment with supplemental <a href=\"topic.htm?path=vitamin-c-ascorbic-acid-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">vitamin C</a> for those with distal limb fractures or patients having limb surgery to prevent the development of CRPS. A typical dose is 500 mg daily, and the duration is 50 days. </p><p>Early mobilization after limb injury may also reduce the risk of CRPS, though there are no high-quality data to confirm benefit. Despite the paucity of supporting evidence, we suggest early mobilization to prevent CRPS following limb injuries, with the recognition that casting for fractures and activity limitations may be unavoidable.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h1\">MANAGEMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A multidisciplinary approach is suggested for the management of CRPS [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complex-regional-pain-syndrome-in-adults-prevention-and-management/abstract/6,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,7</a>]. Clinical experience suggests that treatment is more effective when begun in early in the course of the disease, ideally as soon as the diagnosis is established and before radiographic changes appear. However, it is uncertain whether immediate referral to a specialist in pain management results in superior outcomes compared with early physical or occupational therapy for protective and assisted mobilization of the affected limb within pain limits, supplemented by conservative pharmacologic interventions, and followed by referral to a pain management specialist if the patient does not improve. On the other hand, early referral to an interventional pain specialist for appropriate nerve block may reduce pain and enable patients with CRPS to tolerate aggressive physical therapy.</p><p>Some interventions that are appropriate for all patients with CRPS include the following:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patient education (see <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'Patient education'</a> below)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Physical therapy and occupational therapy, which are initiated as quickly as is practical following diagnosis of CRPS (see <a href=\"#H9\" class=\"local\">'Physical and occupational therapy'</a> below)</p><p/><p>Patients with CRPS who have pre-existing or suspected psychological or psychiatric issues and those who have insufficient improvement with physical, pharmacologic, and interventional therapies may benefit from psychosocial and behavioral management. (See <a href=\"#H8\" class=\"local\">'Psychosocial and behavioral management'</a> below.)</p><p>Pharmacologic and interventional procedures for pain control are utilized in an escalating fashion, beginning with those which are relatively safe and for which there is some evidence of effectiveness, and progressing to more risky interventions if a desired response is not achieved after a few weeks of therapeutic trial. The goals of pain management are to allow active participation in a rehabilitation regimen and to restore movement and strength of the affected limb.</p><p>For patients with early CRPS, we suggest starting with one or more of the following agents:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID). A typical initial regimen is <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ibuprofen-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ibuprofen</a> 400 to 800 mg three times a day or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=naproxen-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">naproxen</a> 250 to 500 mg twice daily. Dose adjustments must be made for older adult patients. (See <a href=\"#H859585532\" class=\"local\">'Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>An anticonvulsant, such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=gabapentin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">gabapentin</a> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pregabalin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">pregabalin</a>. (See <a href=\"#H2037660\" class=\"local\">'Anticonvulsants'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A tricyclic or other antidepressant drug that is effective for neuropathic pain. We typically start with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=amitriptyline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">amitriptyline</a> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nortriptyline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">nortriptyline</a> (10 to 25 mg at bedtime or earlier in the evening if morning drowsiness occurs) and increase the dose, as tolerated. Other tricyclic antidepressants and dual uptake inhibitors that are indicated for treatment of neuropathic pain are alternatives to amitriptyline. (See <a href=\"#H699347708\" class=\"local\">'Antidepressants'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Bisphosphonate treatment; intravenous (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clodronate-united-states-not-available-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">clodronate</a> 300 mg or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pamidronate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">pamidronate</a> 1 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg)</span> or oral (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=alendronate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">alendronate</a> 70 mg weekly) bisphosphonates may be used. (See <a href=\"#H628538230\" class=\"local\">'Bisphosphonates'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Topical <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lidocaine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">lidocaine</a> cream (2 to 5 percent) or topical <a href=\"topic.htm?path=capsaicin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">capsaicin</a> cream (0.025 to 0.075 percent), which may be discontinued if it is too irritating or if there is no benefit after three to five days of use. The author prefers topical lidocaine instead of capsaicin for most patients. (See <a href=\"#H699348079\" class=\"local\">'Topical lidocaine and capsaicin'</a> below.)</p><p/><p>Referral to a pain management specialist with experience in management of CRPS is appropriate for patients with progressive symptoms and signs of CRPS who have an unsatisfactory response to the measures outlined above, as well as for patients with severe or chronic CRPS. Trigger <span class=\"nowrap\">point/tender</span> point injections, regional sympathetic nerve block, spinal cord stimulation, or epidural <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clonidine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">clonidine</a> may be the preferred intervention, depending upon the expertise of the specialist and the values and preferences of the patient. (See <a href=\"#H18\" class=\"local\">'Interventional procedures'</a> below.)</p><p>An alternative approach, suitable for patients with progressive CRPS who are unwilling to consider interventional procedures, is the sequential addition of different pharmacologic agents, including <a href=\"topic.htm?path=calcitonin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">calcitonin</a> and oral glucocorticoids, to the initial treatment regimen. (See <a href=\"#H11\" class=\"local\">'Pharmacologic approaches'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Patient education</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patient participation in physical and occupational therapy may be facilitated by an explanation that the pain associated with CRPS, which is presumably related to neuropathic and central mechanisms, does not indicate tissue damage in the hyperalgesic region but arises from an unknown cause. Prior to a referral to a specialist in rehabilitation or to a physical or occupational therapist, the clinician should stress the importance of working to regain use of the affected limb while recognizing the difficulty of doing so in the face of ongoing pain.</p><p>A support group available for patients and families in the United States is the RSDSA at <a href=\"http://rsds.org/&amp;token=dJZqigSxyCkqnANC8s1d1h5Jvh5AKkySoRng8RGAGa0=&amp;TOPIC_ID=5630\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">rsds.org</a>.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Psychosocial and behavioral management</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>We suggest consulting a clinical psychologist if any of the following are present:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>CRPS of more than two months duration at presentation</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Insufficient response to treatment</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Suspected comorbid psychologic or psychiatric disorder</p><p/><p>The goals of psychosocial and behavioral management include the following [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complex-regional-pain-syndrome-in-adults-prevention-and-management/abstract/8,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,9</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Identify any psychological factors contributing to pain and disability</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Treat anxiety and depression</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Identify, explore, and proactively address any internal factors (eg, counter-productive behavior patterns) or external influences (eg, perverse incentives, family dynamics, etc.) that may perpetuate disability or dependency</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Consider needs of family and caregivers and provide psychological intervention and counselling where appropriate</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Provide a practical problem-solving, goal-orientated approach (involving both the patient and their family) to reduce barriers and promote healthy functioning</p><p/><p>Although psychologic assessment and therapy have not been well-studied in patients with CRPS, their usefulness in other chronic painful disorders suggests that this approach may be beneficial to those with CRPS.

The recurrence was mild and temporary in five of the six patients in whom it occurred [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complex-regional-pain-syndrome-in-adults-prevention-and-management/abstract/64\" class=\"abstract_t\">64</a>].</p><p>Other measures that have been proposed to prevent or minimize risk of recurrence include intensive rehabilitation, sympathetic block before surgery, regional <span class=\"nowrap\">anesthesia/analgesia</span> techniques, pretreatment with perioperative <a href=\"topic.htm?path=calcitonin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">calcitonin</a> prophylaxis, and neuromodulation post-surgery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complex-regional-pain-syndrome-in-adults-prevention-and-management/abstract/65-69\" class=\"abstract_t\">65-69</a>]. However, the data supporting use of these approaches are limited. Most reports are of small case series, and some are limited to children. Thus, these approaches have not been tested in randomized trials, and it is uncertain whether the results in children can be generalized to CRPS in adults. CRPS in children is reviewed separately.

The recurrence of CRPS occurred twice as often in a different limb than in the initial episode (76 patients) compared with recurrence in the originally affected limb that had become largely asymptomatic (34 patients). In 10 patients, CRPS started in symmetrical limbs. Recurrences were usually spontaneous (53 percent) and were often associated with few signs and symptoms. Most of the remainder was associated with trauma or surgery (32 and 12 percent, respectively). The estimated incidence of a recurrence was 1.8 percent per patient per year.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"PATIENT_INFORMATION\"><span class=\"h1\">INFORMATION FOR PATIENTS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>UpToDate offers two types of patient education materials, &quot;The Basics&quot; and &quot;Beyond the Basics.&quot; The Basics patient education pieces are written in plain language, at the 5<sup>th</sup> to 6<sup>th</sup> grade reading level, and they answer the four or five key questions a patient might have about a given condition.

The pain is not restricted to a specific nerve territory or dermatome and usually has a distal predominance of abnormal sensory, motor, sudomotor, vasomotor, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> trophic findings. The syndrome shows variable progression over time. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=complex-regional-pain-syndrome-in-adults-pathogenesis-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis#H1488898902\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Complex regional pain syndrome in adults: Pathogenesis, clinical manifestations, and diagnosis&quot;, section on 'Definition and terminology'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>To prevent the development of CRPS in patients with acute distal limb fractures or patients having limb surgery, we recommend treatment with supplemental <a href=\"topic.htm?path=vitamin-c-ascorbic-acid-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">vitamin C</a> (500 mg daily) for 50 days (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=2\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1B</a>). (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Prevention'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A multidisciplinary approach is suggested for the management of CRPS. Interventions appropriate for all patients with CRPS include patient education, physical therapy, and occupational therapy. (See <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'Management'</a> above and <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'Patient education'</a> above and <a href=\"#H9\" class=\"local\">'Physical and occupational therapy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients with CRPS who have pre-existing or suspected psychological or psychiatric issues and those who have insufficient improvement with physical and pharmacologic therapies may benefit from psychosocial and behavioral management. (See <a href=\"#H8\" class=\"local\">'Psychosocial and behavioral management'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pharmacologic and invasive procedures for pain control are utilized in an escalating fashion, beginning with those which are relatively safe and for which there is some evidence of effectiveness, and progressing to more risky interventions if a desired response is not achieved after a few weeks of therapeutic trial. The goals of pain management are to allow active participation in a rehabilitation regimen and to restore movement and strength of the affected limb.
