They occur sporadically or in a familial setting.

The terms &quot;atypical nevi&quot; and &quot;dysplastic nevi&quot; are clinically used interchangeably, although in theory a dysplastic nevus refers to a histologic diagnosis.</p><p>Although atypical nevi are benign lesions, they are strong phenotypic markers of an increased risk of melanoma, especially in individuals with numerous nevi <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> a family history of melanoma.

Some of the prevalence variation is explained by differences in the diagnostic criteria used.

Individuals with atypical nevi have a 3- to 20-fold higher risk of developing a melanoma than individuals without atypical nevi [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/atypical-dysplastic-nevi/abstract/17,21-23\" class=\"abstract_t\">17,21-23</a>]. </p><p>The risk of melanoma increases in a dose-response fashion with the number of clinically atypical nevi and is greatest in individuals with atypical nevi and personal or family history of melanoma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/atypical-dysplastic-nevi/abstract/17,21,24\" class=\"abstract_t\">17,21,24</a>]. In a meta-analysis of observational studies, the relative risk of melanoma associated with atypical nevi was 1.5 (95% CI 1.3-1.6) for the presence of a single atypical nevus and 6.36 (95% CI 3.80-10.33) for five atypical nevi versus none [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/atypical-dysplastic-nevi/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14454935\"><span class=\"h1\">PATHOGENESIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The development and density of nevi appear to be predominantly under genetic control, with ultraviolet light exposure playing an important modifying role [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/atypical-dysplastic-nevi/abstract/25-28\" class=\"abstract_t\">25-28</a>]. Data suggest that activating mutations of the oncogene <em>BRAFV600E</em> is sufficient for common nevogenesis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/atypical-dysplastic-nevi/abstract/29-33\" class=\"abstract_t\">29-33</a>]. Data also suggest that syndromic atypical nevi arise de novo rather than from a pre-existing common nevus and have multiple driver mutations, including mutations known to activate mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPK) signaling, telomerase reverse transcriptase (TERT) promoter mutations, or hemizygous alterations of <em>CDKN2A</em> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/atypical-dysplastic-nevi/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>]. Sporadic atypical nevi acquire somatic mutations, show a higher overall mutation burden than common nevi, and have <em>NRAS</em> or <em>BRAF</em> non-V600E mutations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/atypical-dysplastic-nevi/abstract/33,34\" class=\"abstract_t\">33,34</a>]. Exome sequencing reveals that atypical nevi harbor a substantially lower mutational load than melanoma and differing ultraviolet signature mutation patterns, with cytosine to thymine transitions (eg, TC&gt;TT) more frequently found in melanoma than in atypical nevi [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/atypical-dysplastic-nevi/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>]. Recurrent TERT promoter mutations have been found in a significant proportion of atypical nevi [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/atypical-dysplastic-nevi/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>]. Germline mutations of the melanoma susceptibility genes (<em>CDKN2A, ARF, CDK4, PTEN, BRAF</em>) have not been found in individuals with sporadic atypical mole syndrome [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/atypical-dysplastic-nevi/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H237810\"><span class=\"h2\">FAMMM syndrome</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The familial atypical multiple mole and melanoma (FAMMM) syndrome is an autosomal dominant condition characterized by a high number of common and atypical nevi (&gt;50) and history of melanoma in one or more first- or second-degree relatives [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/atypical-dysplastic-nevi/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>]. This syndrome is associated with mutations in the <em>CDKN2A</em> gene with reduced penetrance and variable expressivity.</p><p>The <em>CDKN2A</em> gene is located on chromosome 9p21.3 and encodes the proteins p14ARF, p16(INK4), p15(INK4b), p18(INK4), and p19ARF, which are involved in the regulation of critical cell cycle pathways [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/atypical-dysplastic-nevi/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>].

In contrast, acquired common nevi appear after the age of six months, reach a peak count in the third decade, and then slowly regress with age. Atypical nevi arising on the scalp, breasts, or buttocks during childhood may be an early sign of high total body nevus count in adulthood [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/atypical-dysplastic-nevi/abstract/41-43\" class=\"abstract_t\">41-43</a>]. </p><p>Atypical nevi are dynamic in their clinical appearance. In a prospective study of 593 atypical nevi in 153 patients, 50 percent of nevi changed over an average of 89 months of follow-up, with 15 percent showing more atypical features [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/atypical-dysplastic-nevi/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. </p><p>The role of atypical nevi as precursors of melanoma is controversial. Although the presence of atypical nevi is a strong risk factor for melanoma, approximately half of melanomas arising in patients with atypical nevi develop de novo and do not evolve from a precursor atypical nevus [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/atypical-dysplastic-nevi/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>]. This is also true in patients with multiple atypical nevi. However, although the risk of an individual atypical nevus progressing to melanoma is very small, it does occur, and has been documented through sequential photographs and histologic studies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/atypical-dysplastic-nevi/abstract/44-46\" class=\"abstract_t\">44-46</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1008077\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL FEATURES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Atypical nevi are most often seen on the trunk and extremities, although they can develop anywhere on the body, including the scalp, breasts, buttocks, and genitalia (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F78891%7EDERM%2F53622\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef78891 graphicRef53622 \">picture 2A-B</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/atypical-dysplastic-nevi/abstract/47\" class=\"abstract_t\">47</a>].

(See <a href=\"#H14454900\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Individuals with atypical nevi have a 3- to 20-fold higher risk of developing a melanoma than individuals without atypical nevi. The risk of melanoma increases in a dose-response fashion with the number of atypical nevi and is greatest in individuals with atypical nevi and a personal or family history of melanoma. (See <a href=\"#H416834\" class=\"local\">'Clinical significance'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Atypical nevi are most often seen on the trunk and extremities, although they can develop anywhere on the body, including the scalp, breasts, buttocks, and genitalia (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F78891%7EDERM%2F83351\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef78891 graphicRef83351 \">picture 1A, 2A</a>).
