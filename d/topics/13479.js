In general, infectious disease and pediatric gastroenterology texts use the World Health Organization (WHO) cutoff of &ge;2 weeks to delineate persistent from acute episodes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/persistent-diarrhea-in-children-in-resource-limited-countries/abstract/1-3\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-3</a>]. Some authors use the term &quot;chronic&quot; for diarrheal illnesses lasting 30 days or longer [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/persistent-diarrhea-in-children-in-resource-limited-countries/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Persistent diarrhea may be associated with a chronic enteropathy, with impaired mucosal healing and diminished digestive and absorptive capacity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/persistent-diarrhea-in-children-in-resource-limited-countries/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>], resulting in malabsorption or maldigestion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/persistent-diarrhea-in-children-in-resource-limited-countries/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. In resource-limited (&quot;developing&quot;) countries, persistent diarrhea is most common in children younger than two years of age, especially in children under one year [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/persistent-diarrhea-in-children-in-resource-limited-countries/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>], but can also occur in older children. Although less common than acute diarrhea in resource-limited settings, these prolonged episodes are important not only because of the unpleasantness of having diarrhea but because of their association with overall diarrheal burdens, including malnutrition and increased risk of death [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/persistent-diarrhea-in-children-in-resource-limited-countries/abstract/7,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,8</a>].</p><p>The major causes and the prevalence of persistent diarrhea differ between resource-limited and resource-rich countries. In resource-limited settings, persistent diarrhea usually follows an acute episode and typically is associated with serial enteric infections without sufficient time to recover between episodes. Children are at risk of malnutrition and often have other intercurrent illnesses, such as respiratory infections.</p><p>In resource-rich countries, children are less likely to be exposed to serial enteric infections and ensuing malnutrition. In these populations, chronic diarrhea is more likely to be caused by underlying disease, such as celiac disease or other autoimmune inflammatory bowel disease. However, enteric infections (particularly in immunocompromised patients), malnutrition, food allergy, and other dietary factors (eg, excessive consumption of juice or withholding feeding during diarrhea and delaying in returning to normal feeding), can play a role in some cases.</p><p>The difference in pathophysiology underlying most cases of persistent diarrhea in resource-limited countries as compared with those in resource-rich countries calls for different approaches to diagnosis and management in the two settings.</p><p>The pathophysiology and management of persistent diarrhea in resource-limited countries will be reviewed here. Approaches to diagnosis and treatment of diarrheal diseases in resource-rich countries are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=approach-to-the-diagnosis-of-chronic-diarrhea-in-children-in-resource-rich-countries\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Approach to the diagnosis of chronic diarrhea in children in resource-rich countries&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-the-causes-of-chronic-diarrhea-in-children-in-resource-rich-countries\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of the causes of chronic diarrhea in children in resource-rich countries&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">DEFINITION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Persistent diarrhea is defined as loose or watery stools occurring at least three times a day for 14 days or more; the change in stool consistency is more important than stool frequency [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/persistent-diarrhea-in-children-in-resource-limited-countries/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. This typically translates to a stool volume of more than 10 <span class=\"nowrap\">grams/kg/day</span> in infants and toddlers, or more than 200 <span class=\"nowrap\">grams/day</span> in older children [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/persistent-diarrhea-in-children-in-resource-limited-countries/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. Some authors make a distinction between persistent diarrhea, which they define as having a sudden onset, and chronic diarrhea, which they define as having a gradual onset usually lasting more than 30 days. However, it is frequently difficult to identify the time of onset of the diarrhea and clearly delineate the two entities. Lack of consensus on symptom-based and duration-based definitions of diarrhea remains a challenge [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/persistent-diarrhea-in-children-in-resource-limited-countries/abstract/10,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,11</a>]. Consequently, for the purposes of this review we will not differentiate between persistent and chronic diarrhea.</p><p>In resource-limited settings, most cases of persistent diarrhea (also known as &quot;syndromic persistent diarrhea&quot;) are triggered by enteric infections. Malnutrition and dietary deficiency of micronutrients such as zinc, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=vitamin-a-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">vitamin A</a>, folate, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> immunodeficiency, contribute to the development of chronic enteropathy and persistent diarrhea [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/persistent-diarrhea-in-children-in-resource-limited-countries/abstract/12-14\" class=\"abstract_t\">12-14</a>]. Although persistent diarrhea lasting 14 days or longer is regarded as a distinct entity, there is evidence that diarrhea that lasts 7 to 13 days is also associated with adverse outcomes, including stunting, and identifies children at risk of developing persistent diarrhea in the future [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/persistent-diarrhea-in-children-in-resource-limited-countries/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">PREVALENCE AND MORBIDITY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In resource-limited settings, persistent diarrhea is a common condition, but the extent to which diarrhea episodes become persistent is highly variable. Overall, fewer than 10 percent of episodes of diarrhea persist for two or more weeks, but reports range from 1.4 to 28.4 percent, and the risk depends on many factors including the initial enteropathogen, nutritional status, geographical location, and socioeconomic conditions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/persistent-diarrhea-in-children-in-resource-limited-countries/abstract/15,16\" class=\"abstract_t\">15,16</a>]. It is estimated that diarrhea lasting more than two weeks occurs in up to 3 to 5 percent of the infant population worldwide [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/persistent-diarrhea-in-children-in-resource-limited-countries/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. However, there is some evidence that the proportion of episodes of diarrhea that become persistent and the total number of children with persistent diarrhea is decreasing [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/persistent-diarrhea-in-children-in-resource-limited-countries/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>].</p><p>One report estimated that one million deaths could be averted annually by scaling up well-established preventive measures for diarrhea, including breastfeeding, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=vitamin-a-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">vitamin A</a> supplementation, handwashing with soap, improved sanitation, safe drinking water, and rotavirus vaccination, as well as specific therapies including <a href=\"topic.htm?path=oral-rehydration-solutions-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">oral rehydration solutions</a> (ORS), zinc, and antibiotics for dysentery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/persistent-diarrhea-in-children-in-resource-limited-countries/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. More than half of these deaths are attributable to persistent diarrhea and 30 to 50 percent of deaths occur among children younger than five years of age in resource-limited settings [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/persistent-diarrhea-in-children-in-resource-limited-countries/abstract/20-22\" class=\"abstract_t\">20-22</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h1\">PATHOPHYSIOLOGY</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3827144950\"><span class=\"h2\">Persistent diarrhea</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The basic pathophysiology underlying all diarrheas is incomplete absorption of water and electrolytes from the intestinal lumen, either because of a reduced rate of net water absorption (related to impaired electrolyte absorption or excessive electrolyte secretion) or due to osmotic retention of water within the lumen. Reduction of net water absorption by as little as 1 percent may be sufficient to cause diarrhea. Consequently, even relatively modest compromise of absorptive function can lead to loose stools [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/persistent-diarrhea-in-children-in-resource-limited-countries/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>].</p><p>Diarrhea may result from pathology in the small intestine or the colon or both, and may have secretory <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> osmotic components. </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Secretory diarrhea (also known as electrolyte transport-related diarrhea) occurs when pathogens produce toxins that stimulate small intestinal secretion of chloride ions,<sup> </sup>with concomitant fluid movement into the intestinal lumen that overwhelms the absorptive capacity of the colon. The classic example is cholera and enterotoxigenic<em> Escherichia coli </em>(ETEC) infections. Pathogens that directly damage the small intestinal mucosa, such as norovirus, have a similar effect. Diarrhea may be severe, especially in the first two to three days. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pathogenesis-of-acute-diarrhea-in-children#H4221532165\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pathogenesis of acute diarrhea in children&quot;, section on 'Electrolyte transport-related (secretory)'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Osmotic diarrhea (also known as diet-induced diarrhea) occurs when unabsorbed nutrients, especially carbohydrates and sugars, cause an osmotic gradient, drawing water into the intestinal lumen. This is by far the most common mechanism of acute infectious and persistent diarrhea. This may occur in the small or large intestine, or both. Diarrhea typically is exacerbated by ingestion of carbohydrates or sugars, and stools may be acidic and contain reducing substances. Unabsorbed dietary fat does not exert the same osmotic effect and steatorrhea is not necessarily associated with diarrhea. The colon is important, as much of the fluid secreted by the small intestine is reabsorbed in the colon. Additionally, small chain fatty acids produced by bacteria are important as they facilitate fluid absorption by nonionic diffusion and serve as a metabolic fuel for colonocytes. Pathogens that cause inflammation of colonic mucosa classically cause frequent small diarrheal stools with blood and mucus. Inflammatory cells may be seen on microscopy of stools. All these processes may occur together. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pathogenesis-of-acute-diarrhea-in-children#H1881281505\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pathogenesis of acute diarrhea in children&quot;, section on 'Diet-induced (osmotic)'</a>.)</p><p/><p>In resource-limited countries, most cases of persistent diarrhea are triggered by infection. Different mechanisms for persistence of an infectious episode are illustrated in the figure (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F64008\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef64008 \">figure 1</a>). </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>First, the original infectious agent may be particularly virulent and difficult to clear. Some bacteria such as <em>shigella</em> spp contain plasmids capable of downregulating the host cell expression of antibacterial peptides, thus delaying clearance of the bacteria [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/persistent-diarrhea-in-children-in-resource-limited-countries/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Second, the infection may cause intestinal damage that leads to continuing diarrhea (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F81123\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef81123 \">figure 2</a>). The most common example of this is secondary lactose intolerance, resulting from destruction of the villus tips where the enzyme lactase is located. Studies have also shown that intestinal damage leads to a decrease in intestinal absorptive surface area, which in turn interferes with the absorption of nutrients, particularly sugars [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/persistent-diarrhea-in-children-in-resource-limited-countries/abstract/25,26\" class=\"abstract_t\">25,26</a>]. Disturbance of the intestinal flora, such as occurs in antibiotic-associated diarrhea, is another example of a secondary effect. Also, irritable bowel syndrome develops in susceptible travelers following acute traveler's diarrhea.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Third, delayed healing of the intestine may prolong the diarrhea. Host factors such as zinc or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=vitamin-a-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">vitamin A</a> deficiency, or generalized malnutrition impair the host response to the infection, resulting in longer duration. Host factors affect immunity and delay recovery in immune deficiency conditions such as <span class=\"nowrap\">HIV/AIDS</span>. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Finally, exposure to enteropathogens may be so common that new infections with different pathogens occur before the child has had a chance to recover and these sequential acute episodes merge into one episode of persistent diarrhea. </p><p/><p>These mechanisms are not exclusive, and often exacerbate each other; for instance, delayed recovery makes it more likely that a new infection will lead to continuing symptoms.</p><p>Infection, malnutrition, and impaired immunity exacerbate one another (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F81123\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef81123 \">figure 2</a>). Infection, anorexia, and food withdrawal or dilution reduce nutrient intake, cause increased net loss of nutrients, altered permeability, immune dysregulation, mucosal injury, altered intestinal microflora, and nutritional deficits thereby contributing to the vicious cycle that leads to persistent diarrhea, increasing malnutrition, and risk of death [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/persistent-diarrhea-in-children-in-resource-limited-countries/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H548420915\"><span class=\"h2\">Environmental enteric dysfunction</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Environmental enteric dysfunction, also known as environmental enteropathy, is a subclinical syndrome of altered enteric structure and function resulting in poor absorption, increased intestinal permeability, and chronic mucosal inflammation among infants and children who live in resource-limited settings. It is caused by the interaction of enteric infections, malnutrition, and impaired host defense mechanisms (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F64008\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef64008 \">figure 1</a>). </p><p>Although subclinical, chronic environmental enteropathy is often associated with persistent low-grade malabsorption and is characterized by abnormalities and altered permeability of the small intestinal mucosa [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/persistent-diarrhea-in-children-in-resource-limited-countries/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. There is evidence of an inflammatory response in the mucosa with a variety of immunological abnormalities [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/persistent-diarrhea-in-children-in-resource-limited-countries/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. In severe cases, the chronic enteropathy typically exhibits villous atrophy, with crypt cell hypoplasia with decreased mitotic figures [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/persistent-diarrhea-in-children-in-resource-limited-countries/abstract/29,30\" class=\"abstract_t\">29,30</a>]. The latter feature appears to be associated with protein malnutrition and sometimes helps to distinguish the disorder morphologically from celiac disease. The increased intestinal permeability, especially in children younger than 12 months, may lead to enhanced sensitization to dietary antigens and subsequent allergic enteropathy. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=food-protein-induced-proctocolitis-of-infancy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Food protein-induced proctocolitis of infancy&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The enteropathy contributes to malnutrition by causing malabsorption of macronutrients and micronutrients due to reduced surface area for absorption, reduced bile acid production and function, impaired intestinal motility, and bacterial overgrowth. Small intestinal bacterial overgrowth (SIBO) is associated with increased intestinal permeability, especially in children younger than 12 months, which in turn may lead to enhanced sensitization to dietary antigens and an allergic enteropathy (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=food-protein-induced-proctocolitis-of-infancy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Food protein-induced proctocolitis of infancy&quot;</a>). However, SIBO is very common in children living in unhygienic environments and is found in asymptomatic children as well as those with acute and persistent diarrhea [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/persistent-diarrhea-in-children-in-resource-limited-countries/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]. Although associated with nutrient malabsorption [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/persistent-diarrhea-in-children-in-resource-limited-countries/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>], it is not clear if and when SIBO per se causes diarrhea. It rapidly clears when clean food and water is provided.</p><p>Evidence points to an interaction between diet and the gut microbiome (the bacteria present in the intestine) in the etiology of malnutrition, in particular kwashiorkor. It is likely that further research on the microbiome will also be relevant to understanding persistent diarrhea [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/persistent-diarrhea-in-children-in-resource-limited-countries/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>].

Some pathogens have been associated with more prolonged episodes, although results of studies are inconsistent. A literature review identified more than 30 bacterial, viral, and parasitic potential pathogens in persistent digestive disorders including persistent diarrhea. Among the most commonly cited culprits are enteroaggregative <em>E. coli</em> (also known as enteroadherent <em>E. coli</em>, EAEC) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/persistent-diarrhea-in-children-in-resource-limited-countries/abstract/20,34-36\" class=\"abstract_t\">20,34-36</a>], enteropathogenic <em>E. coli</em> (EPEC) in infants younger than six months [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/persistent-diarrhea-in-children-in-resource-limited-countries/abstract/7,37-39\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,37-39</a>], <em>Shigella </em>[<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/persistent-diarrhea-in-children-in-resource-limited-countries/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>], <em>Cryptosporidium </em>[<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/persistent-diarrhea-in-children-in-resource-limited-countries/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>], <em>Yersinia</em>, and <em>Campylobacter</em>.

Among the intestinal parasites, <em>Cryptosporidium</em> has been found in chronic episodes of diarrhea in Bangladesh but not in Peru, while Giardia lamblia showed similar incidence rates in acute and chronic diarrhea [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/persistent-diarrhea-in-children-in-resource-limited-countries/abstract/27,42-44\" class=\"abstract_t\">27,42-44</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=giardiasis-treatment-and-prevention\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Giardiasis: Treatment and prevention&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Twelve different types of viruses have been implicated, including adenovirus, norovirus, cytomegalovirus, human rotavirus, and HIV [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/persistent-diarrhea-in-children-in-resource-limited-countries/abstract/36,40\" class=\"abstract_t\">36,40</a>]. Viral pathogens such as rotavirus and cytomegalovirus have been associated with protracted diarrhea usually following particularly severe acute episodes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/persistent-diarrhea-in-children-in-resource-limited-countries/abstract/42,45,46\" class=\"abstract_t\">42,45,46</a>]. Rotavirus is the principal cause of severe acute dehydrating diarrhea in young children, but most episodes of rotavirus infection are short lived and self-limited. Nevertheless, rotavirus has been implicated in protracted diarrhea syndrome in both immunodeficient and immunocompetent hosts [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/persistent-diarrhea-in-children-in-resource-limited-countries/abstract/47,48\" class=\"abstract_t\">47,48</a>]. The reduction in diarrheal episodes associated with introduction of a vaccine against rotavirus in the infant vaccine schedules of many countries will allow a better estimate of the effect of this virus in persistent diarrhea. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acute-viral-gastroenteritis-in-children-in-resource-rich-countries-clinical-features-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Acute viral gastroenteritis in children in resource-rich countries: Clinical features and diagnosis&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-rotavirus-infection#H3\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of rotavirus infection&quot;, section on 'Clinical manifestations'</a>.)</p><p>Torovirus and astrovirus also have been associated with chronic diarrhea [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/persistent-diarrhea-in-children-in-resource-limited-countries/abstract/49,50\" class=\"abstract_t\">49,50</a>]. Some viral infections such as measles or HIV cause chronic diarrhea through immunosuppression [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/persistent-diarrhea-in-children-in-resource-limited-countries/abstract/51,52\" class=\"abstract_t\">51,52</a>]. Immunosuppressed children are more likely to develop enteric infections with multiple pathogens <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> with opportunistic pathogens such as <em>Mycobacterium avium </em>complex, <em>Isospora</em>, and <em>microsporidia </em>[<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/persistent-diarrhea-in-children-in-resource-limited-countries/abstract/53\" class=\"abstract_t\">53</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pediatric-hiv-infection-classification-clinical-manifestations-and-outcome#H18840561\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pediatric HIV infection: Classification, clinical manifestations, and outcome&quot;, section on 'Other'</a>.)</p><p>However, serial stool cultures during episodes of chronic diarrhea suggest that sequential infections with the same or different pathogens are more often responsible for prolonged diarrhea [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/persistent-diarrhea-in-children-in-resource-limited-countries/abstract/42,43\" class=\"abstract_t\">42,43</a>] than persistence of a single etiological agent. When complete analyses are undertaken, multiple pathogens often are identified. Studies in resource-limited settings where fecal contamination is common show high rates of enteropathogens even in stools of children without diarrhea [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/persistent-diarrhea-in-children-in-resource-limited-countries/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>]. Therefore, the presence of a particular bacteria, virus, or parasite does not mean it is the causal agent, perhaps explaining some apparent treatment failures. On the other hand, no enteropathogens are detected in many cases of persistent diarrhea. [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/persistent-diarrhea-in-children-in-resource-limited-countries/abstract/20,34\" class=\"abstract_t\">20,34</a>]. This may be because it is almost impossible to test for all possible pathogens, particularly in resource-limited settings; or because the pathogen is intermittently excreted; was present during the acute phase of the diarrhea; or because the diarrhea has a non-infectious cause.</p><p>Advances in genetics are increasing understanding of the interaction between the virulence mechanisms of enteropathogens and the host immune response, and are likely to explain why some children have persistent diarrhea, whereas others harboring the same pathogens remain symptom-free [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/persistent-diarrhea-in-children-in-resource-limited-countries/abstract/54\" class=\"abstract_t\">54</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h3\">Malnutrition</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Chronic and acute under-nutrition impair the development and function of the immune system [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/persistent-diarrhea-in-children-in-resource-limited-countries/abstract/55\" class=\"abstract_t\">55</a>]. This leads to suboptimal immune responses that are also associated with a generalized increase in inflammatory mediators, which can contribute to the tissue damage caused by enteric infection. Malnutrition also impairs tissue repair mechanisms so that infections tend to be more severe and of longer duration.</p><p>Specific nutrient deficiencies, such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=vitamin-a-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">vitamin A</a> and zinc deficiencies, are associated with persistent diarrhea [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/persistent-diarrhea-in-children-in-resource-limited-countries/abstract/56-58\" class=\"abstract_t\">56-58</a>]. Randomized controlled studies in a variety of populations have shown that zinc supplementation given during an episode of diarrhea reduces the severity and duration of acute and persistent diarrhea in children over 6 months of age [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/persistent-diarrhea-in-children-in-resource-limited-countries/abstract/59\" class=\"abstract_t\">59</a>]. Zinc supplements given prophylactically in populations where zinc deficiency is common also reduce the incidence of diarrhea, including persistent diarrhea [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/persistent-diarrhea-in-children-in-resource-limited-countries/abstract/60-62\" class=\"abstract_t\">60-62</a>].

Both acute and persistent diarrhea is less common in breastfed children. The positive effects of breastfeeding continue even after other foods are introduced; breastfeeding to 2 years old is the recommendation by the World Health Organization (WHO) and other agencies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/persistent-diarrhea-in-children-in-resource-limited-countries/abstract/63,64\" class=\"abstract_t\">63,64</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h3\">HIV disease</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Persistent diarrhea is commonly associated with HIV, and provides a paradigm for the complex interactions between the immunocompromised host, malnutrition, and enteric infection. Malnutrition is often an early manifestation of HIV disease, and is associated with a rapid decrease in the CD4+ cell number and an increased rate of opportunistic infections [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/persistent-diarrhea-in-children-in-resource-limited-countries/abstract/65\" class=\"abstract_t\">65</a>]. Combined dysfunctions of the digestive-absorptive processes are common in children with HIV infection and may involve the intestine, the liver, and the pancreas [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/persistent-diarrhea-in-children-in-resource-limited-countries/abstract/66\" class=\"abstract_t\">66</a>]. Iron and lactose malabsorption are particularly common [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/persistent-diarrhea-in-children-in-resource-limited-countries/abstract/67\" class=\"abstract_t\">67</a>].</p><p>Several cellular mechanisms appear to be directly affected by HIV infection. As an example, the HIV transactivating factor protein (Tat) protein released by the virus can directly impact enterocytes both as a viral cytotoxin and an enterotoxin. This protein-cell interaction impairs cell growth and proliferation, and inhibits ion transport [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/persistent-diarrhea-in-children-in-resource-limited-countries/abstract/68\" class=\"abstract_t\">68</a>]. In the setting of immunosuppression, superinfection with opportunistic agents such as <em>Cryptosporidium</em>, <em>Blastocystis hominis</em>, <em>Candida albicans</em>, and others can lead to diarrhea and mucosal injury. Consequently, HIV infection both directly and indirectly induces intestinal dysfunction, malnutrition, and immune impairment. Antiretroviral therapy may also cause persistent diarrhea [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/persistent-diarrhea-in-children-in-resource-limited-countries/abstract/69\" class=\"abstract_t\">69</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h1\">DIAGNOSTIC APPROACH</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Because persistent diarrhea following an acute infection is the predominant type of diarrhea seen in resource-limited settings, and because diagnostic resources often will be limited, an diagnostic and management algorithm is practical and usually effective. This approach requires categorical assessment of the child's nutritional status and type of diarrhea, specific testing for pathogens when possible, and in some cases empiric therapy based on the clinical findings and prevalence rates.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h2\">Assess for complications and comorbid conditions</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The first step in the evaluation is to assess the child for dehydration and sepsis, as both require urgent treatment. Follow standard guidelines to diagnose and treat hypovolemia (dehydration). Children with mild or no dehydration should be given extra fluids and can be managed at home; moderate dehydration should be treated orally or by nasogastric tube, using a rehydration fluid consisting of glucose, sugar or rice flour, sodium, and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=potassium-chloride-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">potassium chloride</a> and a base such as bicarbonate or citrate. The recommended fluid is the low-osmolar rehydration solution made according to World Health Organization (WHO) guidelines, which has established efficacy and safety in clinical trials [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/persistent-diarrhea-in-children-in-resource-limited-countries/abstract/70\" class=\"abstract_t\">70</a>]. Severe dehydration, associated with hypovolemic shock, requires intravenous rehydration, as described separately and in standard protocols. (See <a href=\"#H14\" class=\"local\">'Rehydration'</a> below and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-assessment-and-diagnosis-of-hypovolemia-dehydration-in-children\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical assessment and diagnosis of hypovolemia (dehydration) in children&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Children should be weighed, measured, and examined for bilateral edema in order to recognize severe malnutrition that will require special attention. For all children with severe malnutrition (&lt;70 percent of median reference weight for height or mid upper arm circumference [MUAC] &lt;115 mm), and especially for those with edematous malnutrition, intravenous fluids should be carefully monitored to avoid overhydration, and treatment should always include the low-osmolar rehydration solution mentioned above as well as early and frequent feeds. It is important to continue oral feeding although the diarrhea continues. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=malnutrition-in-children-in-resource-limited-countries-clinical-assessment#H6\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Malnutrition in children in resource-limited countries: Clinical assessment&quot;, section on 'Clinical assessment'</a>.)</p><p>All children should be evaluated for non-intestinal infections, including pneumonia, urinary tract infections, sepsis, and otitis media. Treatment of these infections should follow standard protocols.</p><p>Clinicians should look for comorbid conditions that may be the underlying cause of the malnutrition, such as cerebral palsy, cystic fibrosis, congenital heart disease, HIV disease, and tuberculosis. These diseases may cause or complicate the child's illness and nutritional status. Tuberculosis may be difficult to diagnose in severely malnourished children. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=latent-tuberculosis-infection-in-children\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Latent tuberculosis infection in children&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tuberculosis-disease-in-children\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Tuberculosis disease in children&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Studies in different parts of the world have shown that the use of the WHO protocol for the management of severe malnutrition reduces mortality considerably. This protocol should be familiar to all staff in emergency and pediatric departments and conscientiously applied by all medical, nursing, and auxiliary technical staff. Local protocols may be necessary to determine which children are admitted to the hospital depending on local conditions, but a malnourished child who also has edema, fever, dehydration, or bloody stools should be managed in a hospital.

These children usually respond to interventions designed to improve nutrition and reduce the likelihood of reinfection. Because serial infections are common, enteropathogens not usually associated with persistent diarrhea may present as acute or chronic infections. As an example, cholera typically presents with acute onset watery diarrhea in children or adults (often with vomiting). In children younger than two years of age, the clinical presentation is not readily distinguishable from that of rotavirus. Cholera should be suspected in a child presenting with an acute exacerbation of watery chronic diarrhea if other cases of cholera are reported in the area.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Bloody diarrhea &ndash; In resource-limited settings, most cases of acute bloody diarrhea are caused by <em>Shigella</em> spp (45 to 67 percent of cases), and <em>Campylobacter</em> (35 to 37 percent of cases) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/persistent-diarrhea-in-children-in-resource-limited-countries/abstract/71\" class=\"abstract_t\">71</a>]. <em>E. histolytica</em> is the most important non-bacterial pathogen, but is responsible for fewer than 3 percent of episodes. Most infections with these organisms result in acute diarrhea illnesses, and cause low-volume bloody stools, often associated with fever. However, in children with underlying malnutrition or immunodeficiency, these pathogens may cause chronic diarrhea and may be associated with higher volume diarrhea and dehydration. Children presenting with bloody diarrhea are at particularly high risk for morbidity and mortality [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/persistent-diarrhea-in-children-in-resource-limited-countries/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h2\">Laboratory testing</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Specific laboratory testing is not essential for the management of persistent diarrhea in resource-limited settings. Essential fluid, electrolyte, and dietary management are not dependent on etiology. There are rarely facilities for a complete enteropathic screen and results of stool cultures are generally not available in time to be valuable clinically for these patients.</p><p>Nonetheless, some simple bedside laboratory tests may be helpful. In cases where diarrhea has persisted more than two weeks, testing the stool for glucose and pH can be helpful in identifying those children with severe villous atrophy. This can be done easily at the bedside with a urine dipstick if available. Glucose test tape, nitrazine paper, and clinitest tablets also have been used. A stool glucose of greater than 2+ or a pH of less than 5.0 suggests substantial villous atrophy.</p><p>In selected cases, laboratory testing also can help identify enteropathogens that respond to antimicrobial therapy. If the diarrhea contains red blood or blood mixed with mucus, and facilities are available, the stool should be cultured for bacterial pathogens (particularly <em>Shigella</em> spp and <em>Campylobacter</em>). In these cases, antibiotic treatment for <em>Shigella</em> infection, based on local resistance patterns, should be started empirically (see <a href=\"#H17\" class=\"local\">'Antimicrobials'</a> below). In some clinical settings, laboratory testing is used as surveillance for epidemiologic reasons, such as the detection of cholera outbreaks.</p><p>For children with persistent watery stools, stool microscopy can be performed to detect trophozoites or cysts of <em>E. Histolytica</em> or other parasites. However, microscopy typically over-diagnoses amebiasis because of the difficulty of distinguishing pathologic from nonpathologic entamoeba. If available, fecal antigen assays also may be used to detect <em>Giardia </em>infection. Rotavirus should also be sought and rapid tests are now available in many locales. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=giardiasis-epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Giardiasis: Epidemiology, clinical manifestations, and diagnosis&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=intestinal-entamoeba-histolytica-amebiasis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Intestinal Entamoeba histolytica amebiasis&quot;</a>.)</p><p>If cholera is suspected (eg, in a child presenting with an acute exacerbation of diarrhea, with &quot;rice-water&quot; stools and vomiting), dark-field or phase contrast microscopy can be performed to identify the organism. Antimicrobial therapy generally is not necessary for individuals with mild symptoms, so there is no benefit to specific testing for these patients.

Children with moderate malnutrition, evidence of dehydration, systemic infections, or infants younger than four months of age should be treated in an inpatient setting if possible [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/persistent-diarrhea-in-children-in-resource-limited-countries/abstract/72\" class=\"abstract_t\">72</a>]. Children with severe malnutrition should be treated as inpatients until stable, as described separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-complicated-severe-acute-malnutrition-in-children-in-resource-limited-countries\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of complicated severe acute malnutrition in children in resource-limited countries&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14\"><span class=\"h2\">Rehydration</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Death in the context of persistent diarrhea is usually caused either by hypovolemia (dehydration) or severe malnutrition. Consequently, replacement of fluid and electrolyte losses is the major early intervention. The ideal form of rehydration is through the oral or nasogastric route with low osmolarity oral rehydration solution (ORS) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/persistent-diarrhea-in-children-in-resource-limited-countries/abstract/73\" class=\"abstract_t\">73</a>]. The World Health Organization (WHO) now recommends the use of low osmolarity ORS in all diarrheal episodes (the new WHO solution contains 75 <span class=\"nowrap\">mMol/L</span> of glucose, 75 <span class=\"nowrap\">mEq/L</span> sodium, 20 <span class=\"nowrap\">mEq/L</span> potassium, at an osmolarity of 245 <span class=\"nowrap\">mOsm/L)</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/persistent-diarrhea-in-children-in-resource-limited-countries/abstract/74\" class=\"abstract_t\">74</a>]. Severely malnourished children are potassium depleted and additional <a href=\"topic.htm?path=potassium-chloride-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">potassium chloride</a> can be added to the oral rehydration fluid to provide 40 <span class=\"nowrap\">mEq/L</span> of potassium. In most cases, breast feeding should be continued. The evaluation of a child for dehydration and treatment with ORS according to the degree of dehydration are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=oral-rehydration-therapy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Oral rehydration therapy&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=malnutrition-in-children-in-resource-limited-countries-clinical-assessment\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Malnutrition in children in resource-limited countries: Clinical assessment&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15\"><span class=\"h2\">Dietary management</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Nutritional compromise plays a role in most cases of persistent diarrhea in resource-limited settings, and is the primary target for treatment. It is essential to start oral feeding as soon as the child has been rehydrated. Delays in starting feeding worsen malnutrition. </p><p>Most children will respond to dietary management using locally available foods designed to provide approximately 150 <span class=\"nowrap\">kcals/kg/day</span> and 10 percent of calories from protein [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/persistent-diarrhea-in-children-in-resource-limited-countries/abstract/75\" class=\"abstract_t\">75</a>]. If possible, at least half the protein should come from an animal source such as milk, egg, or chicken. Additional potassium should be added to the diet to provide at least 5 <span class=\"nowrap\">mEq/kg</span> per day. Breastfeeding may provide some of these nutrients, and is continued when possible. At first the diet should be given in frequent small amounts, for instance every three hours, in which the total amount mentioned above is divided into eight feedings. If children refuse food, a nasogastric tube may be necessary. Feeding should be continued, either orally or by nasogastric tube, during the night to avoid long periods without food. This approach is similar to that used for nutritional rehabilitation in other children with malnutrition. However, many infants and children with chronic diarrhea have secondary disaccharidase deficiencies, caused by mucosal damage. Consequently, a low-lactose diet and sometimes a diet also low in sucrose or total carbohydrates may be necessary. It is often sufficient to reduce lactose by mixing milk with cereals such as rice or noodles and giving small frequent feedings. However, a minority of children benefit from a lactose-free diet. Egg or pureed chicken have been successfully used and are palatable. Yogurt-based diets have also been used successfully [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/persistent-diarrhea-in-children-in-resource-limited-countries/abstract/76\" class=\"abstract_t\">76</a>]. Lactose-free formulas are an alternative if available, but it is important to ensure that the family can afford these formulas and will not dilute or give less than the required amounts in order to save money. There is no need to limit fat intake; indeed, fat can be beneficial because it provides concentrated calories, and enables less carbohydrate to be included in the diet. Ready to use therapeutic food (RUTF) is not contraindicated.</p><p>The efficacy of dietary management, with an algorithm for lactose inclusion, was demonstrated in a multinational trial designed by the WHO [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/persistent-diarrhea-in-children-in-resource-limited-countries/abstract/75\" class=\"abstract_t\">75</a>]. After evaluation and treatment for acute comorbidities (including hypovolemia, sepsis, and pneumonia), all children were treated with a low-lactose diet, containing &lt;3.7 grams of <span class=\"nowrap\">lactose/150</span> kcals, as compared with about 10 grams of <span class=\"nowrap\">lactose/150</span> kcals in the standard WHO full-milk diet. The ingredients varied by region, but consisted of cereals, legumes, vegetable oil, and milk products, with added micronutrient supplements, with an energy density of 65 to 100 <span class=\"nowrap\">kcals/100</span> g. Children who did not respond to this low-lactose diet within seven days were advanced to a lactose-free diet, in which the protein component was supplied by chicken or egg white. The overall success rate for the treatment algorithm was 80 percent (95% CI 76-84%). Sixty-five percent of children recovered with low-lactose diet alone. Among the 35 percent of children who failed the low-lactose diet and moved on to treatment with a lactose-free diet, 71 percent recovered on this diet. </p><p>For patients with severe malnutrition, management typically includes a gradual increase to full caloric intake, with a course of broad-spectrum antibiotics. Hypophosphatemia is common during the early phases of refeeding (known as &quot;refeeding syndrome&quot;) and can be mitigated by feeds that are relatively high in phosphorus (eg, milk-based feeds). Measurement of serum phosphorus concentrations is not routinely available in most centers managing acute malnutrition in resource-limited settings.

(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=society-guideline-links-acute-diarrhea-in-children\" class=\"medical medical_society_guidelines\">&quot;Society guideline links: Acute diarrhea in children&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=society-guideline-links-pediatric-malnutrition\" class=\"medical medical_society_guidelines\">&quot;Society guideline links: Pediatric malnutrition&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H19\"><span class=\"h1\">SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Persistent diarrhea is defined as loose or watery stools occurring at least three times a day for 14 days or more, where the change in stool consistency is more important than stool frequency. This typically translates to a stool volume of more than 10 <span class=\"nowrap\">grams/kg/day</span> in infants and toddlers, or more than 200 <span class=\"nowrap\">grams/day</span> in older children. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Definition'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In resource-limited settings, most cases of persistent diarrhea are caused by a combination of enteric infections, under-nutrition, and impaired immunity (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F81123\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef81123 \">figure 2</a>). These factors interact to cause a chronic enteropathy and diarrhea. (See <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Pathophysiology'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The first step in evaluating a child with persistent diarrhea is to diagnose comorbid conditions that may cause or complicate the diarrheal illness, including dehydration, malnutrition, and associated non-enteric infections, including sepsis and HIV disease. (See <a href=\"#H10\" class=\"local\">'Assess for complications and comorbid conditions'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The next step is to classify the diarrhea based on its appearance. Bloody diarrhea is most likely caused by Shigella, confers a worse prognosis, and requires antimicrobial treatment. An acute exacerbation of watery diarrhea should raise the possibility of cholera in children older than two years of age. (See <a href=\"#H11\" class=\"local\">'Categorize the diarrhea'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Laboratory testing of stool is not essential for management. When available, it may be helpful to test the stools for the presence of glucose or acidic pH, to culture bloody stools for <em>Shigella</em> and <em>Campylobacter</em>, and to examine stools for parasites including <em>Giardia</em>, <em>Cryptosporidium</em>, and <em>E. histolytica</em>. (See <a href=\"#H12\" class=\"local\">'Laboratory testing'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The first step in treatment is to stabilize children with severe intercurrent infection or dehydration, according to standard protocols. Children with mild or moderate dehydration can be treated with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=oral-rehydration-solutions-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">oral rehydration solutions</a>; those with severe dehydration and hypovolemic or septic shock may require intravenous repletion. (See <a href=\"#H14\" class=\"local\">'Rehydration'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The main component of treatment is nutritional rehabilitation. Breastfeeding is continued when possible, and supplemented with a balanced diet of locally available foods, including an animal protein source such as yogurt, milk, chicken, or egg. Many children with chronic enteropathy have a secondary carbohydrate intolerance and respond better to a low-lactose or low-carbohydrate diet. (See <a href=\"#H15\" class=\"local\">'Dietary management'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We recommend that all children with chronic diarrhea be treated with zinc supplements (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=2\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1B</a>). (See <a href=\"#H16\" class=\"local\">'Micronutrients and vitamins'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In general, we suggest NOT treating the diarrhea empirically with antibiotics (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=5\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2B</a>). However, in children with bloody diarrhea we suggest empiric therapy directed against <em>Shigella</em> (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=5\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2B</a>). We also suggest antimicrobial treatment for patients with severe symptoms and suspected or proven cholera or <em>Cryptosporidium</em> (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). Antibiotics should be selected based on sensitivities of local strains. If this information is not available, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ciprofloxacin-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">ciprofloxacin</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ceftriaxone-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">ceftriaxone</a>, or pivmecillinam are recommended.
