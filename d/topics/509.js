Examples include laryngoscopy or bronchoscopy requiring visualization of vocal cord movement, gastrointestinal endoscopy, radiologic procedures (eg, computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging), and minor diagnostic procedures. Dual channel nasal cannulae that allow simultaneous oxygen delivery and capnography during spontaneous ventilation are available. For very short procedures, such as myringotomy and tympanostomy tube placement, deep inhalation anesthesia by facemask may be used.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H163136373\"><span class=\"h4\">Supraglottic airway</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>SGAs (eg, laryngeal mask airway [LMA], i-gel, air-Q) are available in sizes that may be used for neonates as small as 2 kg (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ANEST%2F116402\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef116402 \">table 3</a>). An SGA can be used as the elective airway device throughout the anesthetic, as a conduit for endotracheal intubation, or as a rescue device when mask ventilation or endotracheal intubation is difficult. An SGA can also be used temporarily after inhalation induction and before endotracheal intubation, to free the clinician's hands for IV catheter placement [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/airway-management-for-pediatric-anesthesia/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. SGAs may be used with spontaneous or controlled ventilation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/airway-management-for-pediatric-anesthesia/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>], and with or without neuromuscular blocking agents. The choice between use of an SGA and an ETT for airway management is discussed below.

However, SGA failure is rare in both children and adults, and slightly less likely in children, with reported failure rates of 0.85 percent in children aged six months to eight years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/airway-management-for-pediatric-anesthesia/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>], and 1.1 percent in adults [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/airway-management-for-pediatric-anesthesia/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. In a retrospective, single-institution database study of 11,910 children who underwent anesthesia with an LMA, risk factors for LMA failure included prolonged surgical duration (with increasing risk for each 30 minutes of duration); ear, nose, and throat procedures; inpatient admission status; airway abnormalities; and room-to-room transport with the LMA in place (eg, from anesthesia induction room to procedure room) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/airway-management-for-pediatric-anesthesia/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. LMA failure was defined as abandonment of the LMA and subsequent endotracheal intubation.</p><p>SGAs have been used in select brief (&lt;1 hour) laparoscopic surgeries (such as inguinal herniorrhaphy) and procedures in the prone position (such as perirectal abscess drainage) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/airway-management-for-pediatric-anesthesia/abstract/8-10\" class=\"abstract_t\">8-10</a>]. We use SGAs electively for both short laparoscopic and prone surgeries if no risk factors for difficult airway management are anticipated and if we will have access to the airway throughout the procedure. For laparoscopic surgery, in practice this means that we usually use SGAs only for lower abdominal or pelvic procedures. </p><p>For prone surgeries, we prove the ability to mask ventilate prior to SGA placement, whether the SGA is initially placed in the prone or supine position. The technique for prone SGA placement for an older child with IV access is similar to the technique used in adults; the patient is assisted in lying prone on the operating table in a comfortable position with the head turned to the side, after which the patient is preoxygenated and anesthesia is induced. The technique for induction of anesthesia in this setting is described separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=supraglottic-devices-including-laryngeal-mask-airways-for-airway-management-for-anesthesia-in-adults#H519470597\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Supraglottic devices (including laryngeal mask airways) for airway management for anesthesia in adults&quot;, section on 'Prone position'</a>.) &#160;</p><p>Younger, lighter children may undergo induction of anesthesia and SGA placement in the supine position, then turned prone with the head turned to the side.</p><p>SGAs appear as rescue devices in multiple guidelines and algorithms for management of the difficult airway (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-the-difficult-airway-for-pediatric-anesthesia\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of the difficult airway for pediatric anesthesia&quot;</a>). They may also be used for temporary airway rescue following inadvertent extubation during more complicated prone procedures, such as spine surgery. In these instances, the SGA provides an avenue for oxygenation and ventilation while airway equipment is prepared and the patient repositioned for reintubation. &#160;</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1068699519\"><span class=\"h4\">Endotracheal tube</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>An ETT provides a secure, sealed airway. ETTs for small children are available both with and without an inflatable tracheal cuff. We recommend the use of cuffed ETTs for routine intubation for children of all ages during anesthesia. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2078238409\"><span class=\"h5\">Cuffed versus uncuffed endotracheal tubes</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Advantages to the use of cuffed ETTs in children include the following:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Uncuffed ETTs may need to be replaced for a different size immediately after intubation more often than cuffed ETTs, and may therefore prevent the complications that result from multiple intubation attempts [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/airway-management-for-pediatric-anesthesia/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. A smaller sized cuffed tube than uncuffed tube is used for a given child, and the cuff is inflated as needed, limited to 20 cm H<sub>2</sub>O cuff pressure, to form a seal with the tracheal wall and improve efficiency of mechanical ventilation. In one multicenter study including 2246 children &lt;5 years of age who underwent endotracheal intubation for anesthesia, reintubation was required for incorrect sizing (too large or too small) in 30.8 percent of children who were randomly assigned to uncuffed ETTs, compared with 2.1 percent of those who were randomly assigned to cuffed ETTs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/airway-management-for-pediatric-anesthesia/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Cuffed ETTs are associated with a similar [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/airway-management-for-pediatric-anesthesia/abstract/12,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,13</a>] or lower [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/airway-management-for-pediatric-anesthesia/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>] risk of perioperative laryngospasm and stridor than uncuffed ETTs. This may be due to a decreased need for repeat intubations or because cuffed ETTs place less pressure on the narrowest glottic and subglottic structures than uncuffed ETT. An uncuffed ETT contacts the trachea at the glottic opening, which has the smallest transverse diameter of the airway and the cricoid ring, which is the narrowest non-distensible portion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/airway-management-for-pediatric-anesthesia/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. An appropriately sized and positioned cuffed ETT seals the airway in the wider, distensible distal trachea, placing less pressure on the glottis and cricoid. &#160; </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Cuffed ETTs more effectively seal the trachea than uncuffed tubes, and therefore allow more accurate capnography and measurement of end tidal anesthetic gases, reduce consumption of and operating room pollution by anesthetic gases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/airway-management-for-pediatric-anesthesia/abstract/16,17\" class=\"abstract_t\">16,17</a>], and may decrease the risk of airway fire by reducing leakage of high concentration oxygen. </p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H604001051\"><span class=\"h5\">Choosing endotracheal tube size</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Importantly, an appropriately sized ETT should be used. The formula for choosing an uncuffed ETT is 4 + (age in <span class=\"nowrap\">years/4),</span> and for cuffed tubes is 3.5 + (age in <span class=\"nowrap\">years/4)</span>. When the age is an odd number, the tube size should be rounded down from the calculated number. As an example, for a five year old, the calculated size for a cuffed ETT would be 4.75, so a 4.5 ETT should be used. Children younger than six to eight months often require a 3.0, rather than 3.5, cuffed ETT (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ANEST%2F112121\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef112121 \">table 4</a>). The smallest cuffed ETTs available have an inner diameter of 3.0 mm. Therefore, in very small premature infants for whom a 3.0 is expected or found to be too large, an uncuffed ETT (available as small as 2.0) must be used. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=emergency-endotracheal-intubation-in-children#H1618848\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Emergency endotracheal intubation in children&quot;, section on 'Endotracheal tube size'</a>.)</p><p>After intubation, inflation of the ETT cuff, and confirmation of placement by auscultation of bilateral breath sounds and capnography, the ETT size should be evaluated. </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A tube that is too small will fail to make a seal with the tracheal wall, compromising positive pressure ventilation. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A tube that is too large may restrict blood flow to the tracheal mucosa, leading to postoperative edema and croup. </p><p/><p>To confirm appropriate size, the cuff (if present) should be completely deflated, and a positive pressure breath administered while monitoring the airway pressure. A correctly sized ETT will have an audible air leak at 20 cm H<sub>2</sub>O airway pressure. Absence of a leak indicates that the ETT is too large, and replacement with a smaller size should be considered. With an uncuffed ETT, a large leak at low airway pressures is an indication that the ETT is too small, and it should be replaced with the next larger size. With a cuffed ETT, for most surgical procedures the cuff should be inflated until a leak first becomes audible at 20 cm H<sub>2</sub>O airway pressure. If excessive intra-cuff pressure is required to achieve this seal (&gt;20 cm H2O intra-cuff pressure, as measured by manometer), the ETT should be replaced with a larger size. </p><p>The decision to replace an ETT for a different size should be individualized, depending on patient factors (eg, high risk of aspiration, difficult ETT placement) and the clinical setting (eg, length of procedure, need for positive pressure ventilation). In certain circumstances, the risk of removing and replacing the ETT may be greater than the risk of leaving the poorly-sized ETT in place. Additionally, when mechanical ventilation will likely require higher airway pressures, such as with laparoscopic or intrathoracic surgery, or in patients with poor lung compliance, additional air may have to be added to the cuff to maintain a seal at airway pressures greater than 20 cm H<sub>2</sub>O. For these patients, the risks of postoperative tracheal edema must be weighed against adequate intraoperative ventilation, and an appropriate airway leak determined on a case-by-case basis.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3311654014\"><span class=\"h5\">Microcuff pediatric endotracheal tube</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The Microcuff pediatric ETT is specifically designed for use in children. It has a high-volume, low-pressure, short, thin-walled cuff located more distally on the tube than conventional cuffed ETTs. By creating a lower-pressure seal further from the cricoid, this device may be less likely than other cuffed ETTs to cause pressure-related damage to fragile airway structures. There have been no studies comparing the Microcuff with standard cuffed ETTs, but both have performed favorably compared with uncuffed ETTs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/airway-management-for-pediatric-anesthesia/abstract/12,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,14</a>]. </p><p>Microcuff ETTs are more expensive than standard cuffed ETTs. Despite the added cost, the Microcuff ETT may be preferable for patients who are at increased risk for pressure-related airway complications (eg, for long surgical procedures, or expected postoperative ventilation).</p><p>The manufacturer of the Microcuff ETT does not recommend their use in children weighing less than 3 kg. Conventional cuffed ETTs may be too large for these very small infants, who are intubated with uncuffed tubes in most centers. However some experts recommend the use of Microcuff ETTs in small infants who exhibit a problematic air leak during mechanical ventilation with a size 3.0 uncuffed ETT in place [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/airway-management-for-pediatric-anesthesia/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>].

In general, we perform endotracheal intubation, rather than using an SGA, for longer procedures (&gt;2 to 3 hours), for patients at high risk of aspiration, and for procedures that require prolonged periods of muscle relaxation or abdominal or intrathoracic gas insufflation. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=airway-management-for-induction-of-general-anesthesia#H322256546\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Airway management for induction of general anesthesia&quot;, section on 'Supraglottic airway versus endotracheal tube'</a>.)</p><p>SGAs are usually easily placed, and placement is less stimulating that endotracheal intubation. However, they do not provide protection from laryngospasm, do not protect against aspiration as well as ETTs, and do not allow controlled ventilation with airway pressures as high as those possible with an ETT. Since they sit above the glottis, SGAs should not be used for children with subglottic airway obstruction or tracheomalacia. We usually avoid SGAs for procedures expected to last more than three hours, and in procedures in which access to the airway for troubleshooting or endotracheal intubation is limited.</p><p>The following issues are of particular concern in children:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Patient age </strong>&ndash;<strong> </strong>The use of SGAs in very young children is debated among anesthesiologists. Some UpToDate contributors avoid SGAs in children younger than one year of age, while others (including the authors of this topic) use SGAs in these children when access to the airway will be possible throughout the anesthetic. SGAs may not seat well in infants, and tend to become dislodged. Infants desaturate quickly, and there is less time to react to problems with the airway device. Therefore, with younger patients, one must be able to rapidly troubleshoot the SGA with repositioning or removal for mask ventilation and endotracheal intubation. If patient positioning or surgical site limits airway access, an ETT may be more appropriate.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">There is little literature comparing the success of airway management with SGAs in infants versus older children. In a retrospective single institution study of 11,910 children who underwent general anesthesia with an LMA, age was not identified as an independent risk factor for failure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/airway-management-for-pediatric-anesthesia/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. In another study, fiberoptic evaluation after LMA placement in 350 children revealed an increasingly higher incidence of an obstructed view of the glottis with decreasing LMA sizes, but no clinical evidence of airway obstruction in any patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/airway-management-for-pediatric-anesthesia/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Perioperative respiratory adverse events</strong> &ndash; For children over the age of one year who are at high risk of perioperative respiratory adverse events (PRAEs; eg, laryngospasm, bronchospasm, postoperative stridor) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ANEST%2F99883\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef99883 \">table 5</a>) in whom either an ETT or SGA would be appropriate, we suggest the use of an SGA; the choice of airway device for younger infants is less clear. In general, increasing airway stimulation is associated with higher risk of at least some PRAEs (ie, mask ventilation &lt; supraglottic airway &lt; endotracheal intubation). </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span><strong>PRAEs in</strong> <strong>older children </strong>&ndash;<strong> </strong>Multiple studies have reported a reduction in PRAEs with the use of an SGA compared with ETT in older children. A meta-analysis of 19 randomized controlled studies including 1498 children age 6 months to 12 years found that emergence laryngospasm, desaturation, cough and breathholding were lower with LMAs than ETT [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/airway-management-for-pediatric-anesthesia/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. This advantage is particularly important in patients with reactive airways, either due to upper respiratory tract infections or asthma, for whom an ETT is more likely to cause complications [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/airway-management-for-pediatric-anesthesia/abstract/23,24\" class=\"abstract_t\">23,24</a>].

In one single center study, 180 infants &lt;1 year of age were randomly assigned to LMA or ETT for airway management for general anesthesia during minor elective surgery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/airway-management-for-pediatric-anesthesia/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. LMAs were associated with a lower risk of all PRAEs than ETTs (18 versus 53 percent) and a lower risk of major PRAEs, defined as laryngospasm or bronchospasm (4 versus 19 percent). However, it may not be possible to generalize the results of this study, as the incidence of PRAE was unusually high, criteria for extubation were not specified, the anesthetic techniques were not standardized, and all patients were cared for by attending pediatric anesthesia specialists. In addition, most of the patients in the study were over seven months old. Therefore, further study is required before basing the choice of airway device for infants on the risk of PRAEs, especially for patients less than six months old.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3305944524\"><span class=\"h2\">Choice of intubation technique</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Endotracheal intubation in children is usually performed with direct laryngoscopy (DL), in which the laryngoscope is used to create a view of the glottis with direct line of sight. DL is the fastest and simplest intubation technique to prepare for and to perform. Alternative airway management devices should be prepared in advance if difficulty with DL is expected, and should be immediately available for all airway management episodes in case of unanticipated difficulty. Commonly used advanced techniques in children include flexible scope intubation (for nasal or oral intubation with or without the use of an SGA as a conduit), videolaryngoscopy, and a hybrid technique using the flexible scope as a maneuverable stylet in combination with videolaryngoscopy. Choice of advanced airway technique will depend on clinician preference and patient factors, such as physiologic reserve and anatomic features.

Chin lift, jaw thrust, oral or nasopharyngeal airways, two-person mask ventilation, and continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) with a tight mask seal are all strategies for alleviating anatomical obstruction during mask ventilation, similar to adults. When applying a chin lift or jaw thrust, care should be taken not to apply pressure to the soft tissue within the mandible, as this will compress the tongue against the palate and worsen obstruction. Obstruction due to partial laryngospasm can be overcome by applying CPAP or deepening the plane of anesthesia, while complete laryngospasm requires the rapid administration of neuromuscular blocking agents.

An estimate for the appropriate depth (in centimeters from the tip of the tube to the lip) for an uncuffed ETT can be calculated by multiplying the internal diameter of the ETT (in mm) by three. For cuffed ETTs, the optimal depth can be calculated using the formula (3 X internal diameter in mm + 1.5 cm) to reflect the fact that a cuffed tube 0.5 mm smaller is typically placed, compared with the uncuffed tube that would be used. For example, in a two year old, a 4.0 mm cuffed ETT should be taped at 13.5 cm at the lip. In neonates and small children in particular, the distance between the vocal cords and carina is very short, and it may be difficult to accurately estimate correct tube placement based on patient size. Therefore, in these patients the ETT should be advanced so that the entire cuff is just past the vocal cords during direct laryngoscopy. </p><p>Bilateral breath sounds should be confirmed, and the ETT securely taped.
