Because the risks of complications such as recurrent laryngeal nerve (RLN) injury, permanent hypoparathyroidism, and nontherapeutic re-exploration are higher, these operations should be performed by surgeons experienced with reoperative neck surgery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/parathyroid-exploration-for-primary-hyperparathyroidism/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. It is generally recommended that two concordant imaging studies for localization be obtained prior to re-exploration.

Hyperextension may potentially cause spinal cord injury in patients with cervical disc disease. Thus, if cervical disc disease is present, it should be evaluated and in some cases corrected by an orthopedic surgeon or neurosurgeon prior to parathyroidectomy.

These patients do not have PHPT, and surgical intervention does not result in cure. FHH is an autosomal dominant inherited disorder that often leads to unnecessary parathyroid surgery. The disease is suspected when persistent, mildly elevated serum calcium levels and a high-normal or mildly elevated parathyroid hormone (PTH) level are noted in association with normal renal function and low 24-hour urine calcium excretion (urine <span class=\"nowrap\">calcium/creatinine</span> ratio &lt;0.01). The low urinary calcium level (&lt;100 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/24</span> hours) is the mainstay of the diagnosis. FHH results from a higher renal set point for calcium excretion.

Because hyperthyroidism can complicate parathyroid exploration, a preoperative thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) level and T4 level should also be obtained [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/parathyroid-exploration-for-primary-hyperparathyroidism/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. </p><p>Imaging should focus on evaluation of potential end-organ damages caused or exacerbated by PHPT. Silent nephrolithiasis or nephrocalcinosis in patients with PHPT may be detected by renal ultrasound, noncontrast computed tomography (CT), or plain abdominal radiographs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/parathyroid-exploration-for-primary-hyperparathyroidism/abstract/2,27\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,27</a>]. Dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) should be performed to evaluate for osteopenia or osteoporosis.

The goal of parathyroid surgery is durable biochemical cure. Although cure is technically defined as eucalcemia at six months postoperatively, in the vast majority of patients, lifelong eucalcemia is expected. In order to ensure the best postoperative outcome, careful considerations should be given to patient history when deciding on the operative approach. (See <a href=\"#H3609736\" class=\"local\">'Preoperative evaluation and management'</a> above.)</p><p>Approximately 15 percent of patients with primary hyperparathyroidism (PHPT) have hyperplasia or double adenoma.

It has been well demonstrated to exclude or identify multigland disease with high surgical cure rates (95 to 99 percent). It is a time-tested standard of efficacy and safety in the definitive treatment of PHPT. </p><p>Bilateral parathyroid exploration is the preferred operative strategy when intraoperative parathyroid hormone (IOPTH) monitoring is not available or at the discretion of the surgeon.

The experienced endocrine surgeon can accurately recognize size and shape differences among parathyroid glands and reliably estimate their weights. In addition, the surgeon must be able to intraoperatively recognize and properly treat parathyroid carcinoma.

The choice should be driven by experience and comfort level of the surgical and anesthesia teams. An oral or nasogastric tube, an esophageal stethoscope, or a temperature probe may be placed in the esophagus to facilitate digital palpation of a gland deep in the tracheoesophageal groove. A tube in the esophagus provides a solid, consistent structure against which the mobile, enlarged parathyroid gland can be palpated. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10466908\"><span class=\"h3\">Positioning</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The patient is positioned on the operating table in the semi-Fowler position with both arms tucked. A roll can be placed transversely under the scapulae to put the neck in mild extension, which increases exposure of the region posterior to the tracheoesophageal groove (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F67508\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef67508 \">figure 2</a>). Care should be taken to prevent overextension of the neck, which can lead to vertigo, headache, and postoperative nausea. The head of the operating table is tilted up by approximately 30 degrees (reverse Trendelenburg).</p><p>The skin should be prepped from the lower <span class=\"nowrap\">lip/angle</span> of the mandible to the anterior chest. Mediastinal exploration, though rarely needed, should only be performed after preoperative discussion with the patient and operating room staff.

Efforts should be made to place this incision in a skin crease, if possible. A longer incision may be needed if the patient is obese, the gland is large, or the neck is foreshortened as with kyphoscoliosis (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F82297\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef82297 \">figure 3</a>).

The strap muscles on the side of dissection are elevated off the thyroid lobe. In planned bilateral exploration, the initial laterality of dissection may be guided by thyroid pathology or surgeon preference. </p><p>Parathyroid exploration begins after inspection of the ipsilateral thyroid lobe. The lobe is retracted anterior-medially. At all times, the surgeon should be cognizant of the course of the recurrent laryngeal nerve (RLN) and strive to maintain excellent hemostasis of the surgical field (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F50925\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef50925 \">figure 4</a>).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10466936\"><span class=\"h3\">Exploration</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The lateral, inferior, and posterior surfaces of the thyroid lobe, and the tracheoesophageal groove, are palpated to search for an enlarged gland (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F55183\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef55183 \">picture 1</a>). Normal and enlarged parathyroid glands are usually soft, have a yellow-brown color, and can be found nested within a lobule of surrounding yellow adipose or thymic tissue. A single hilar vascular pedicle is frequently a visual clue to the gland and must be carefully preserved. </p><p>While parathyroid adenomas are classically described with respect to their superior, inferior, or supernumerary embryologic origin, a classification scheme that utilizes details of preoperative imaging and intraoperative anatomic findings has been described [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/parathyroid-exploration-for-primary-hyperparathyroidism/abstract/64\" class=\"abstract_t\">64</a>]. </p><p>The most common locations of parathyroid adenomas should be explored in a logical order, from superficial to deep. Areolar tissue between the thyroid and carotid sheath is gently swept laterally (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F87045\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef87045 \">figure 5</a>). To find an enlarged superior parathyroid gland, the undersurface of the superior pole of the thyroid lobe is also inspected. Exploration continues until the first enlarged parathyroid gland is identified, while taking note of the locations of <span class=\"nowrap\">normal/suppressed</span> parathyroid glands as well.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1850183\"><span class=\"h3\">First gland</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Once identified, a first enlarged parathyroid gland is dissected circumferentially and isolated on its vascular pedicle, with great care not to rupture its capsule. Manipulating the connective tissue around the enlarged gland is preferable to direct handling of the parathyroid as capsular rupture is a cause of parathyromatosis or seeding of hyperfunctioning parathyroid tissue in the soft tissues of the neck <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> mediastinum. Overgrowth of spilled parathyroid tissue can cause recurrent hyperparathyroidism [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/parathyroid-exploration-for-primary-hyperparathyroidism/abstract/65,66\" class=\"abstract_t\">65,66</a>]. </p><p>Starting dissection from the lateral aspect of an adenoma helps the surgeon appreciate the full extent and size of an adenoma visually as &quot;the tip of the iceberg.&quot; Prior to division and ligation of the vascular pedicle, it is imperative to confirm safety of the ipsilateral RLN (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F74541\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef74541 \">figure 6</a>). Enlarged parathyroid glands can sometimes be wedged between the RLN and the trachea at the ligament of Berry and must be freed by gently dissection.</p><p>Upon excision and inspection of the suspected adenoma, all resected parathyroid tissue should be measured and weighed. When in doubt, frozen section analysis may be utilized to confirm that the specimen is in fact parathyroid tissue. Ectopic thyroid tissue, thyroid nodules, and lymph nodes can easily resemble an enlarged parathyroid gland, especially in a reoperative case or when the patient has concomitant thyroiditis. In vivo or ex vivo parathyroid hormone (PTH) aspiration may also be used to confirm the tissue origin of the specimen. Direct fine needle aspiration of the excised gland's parenchyma can be performed with a 21- to 24-gauge needle attached to a small syringe. The aspirate is sent for intraoperative PTH assessment in a small amount of saline, and values that are exceedingly high or above the upper limit of the assay are highly suggestive of parathyroid tissue. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3610120\"><span class=\"h3\">Second gland</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>After resecting the first enlarged gland, many surgeons search for the second ipsilateral parathyroid gland. A normal parathyroid gland weighs 35 to 50 mg. In primary hyperparathyroidism, a &quot;suppressed&quot; normal gland can be even smaller. Routine biopsy of normal glands is not recommended. When in doubt, shave or hemi-biopsy of the second ipsilateral gland can be accomplished by gently applying a titanium clip to the distal edge of the gland opposite the vascular pedicle and sharply excising a 5- to 15-mg fragment, which is then weighed and assessed by pathology. Care should be taken not to disrupt the vascular pedicle or to devascularize the gland.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3610128\"><span class=\"h3\">Multigland disease</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>If the second parathyroid gland ipsilateral to the first is enlarged, the diagnosis of multigland disease is made, and multigland resection should be performed after a four-gland exploration [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/parathyroid-exploration-for-primary-hyperparathyroidism/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Double adenomas are rare but do occur. Inspection of all four glands allows for double adenomas to be distinguished from four-gland hyperplasia. Double adenomas can be treated with removal of just two glands. </p><p>For patients who have multiple enlarged glands, it is important to visualize all the glands before a final decision is made on which glands are to be removed. In those with four-gland hyperplasia, all but a portion of one enlarged gland is removed, leaving a well-vascularized parathyroid remnant of 50- to 100-mg size. This is referred to as a subtotal or three-and-half-gland resection. The parathyroid remnant should be marked with a titanium clip or Prolene in case reoperation is required. Viability of the intended remnant is checked before the remaining enlarged glands are resected. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=parathyroidectomy-in-end-stage-renal-disease#H30749489\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Parathyroidectomy in end-stage renal disease&quot;, section on 'Subtotal parathyroidectomy'</a>.)</p><p>Another approach, which has somewhat fallen into disuse, is to remove all four glands and autotransplant parathyroid tissue into the forearm, where it is more accessible in case of recurrent disease. Total parathyroidectomy with autotransplantation can lead to temporary or permanent vitamin D and calcium dependency due to a lack of functional PTH. It is not recommended for first-time operations because it can result in severe hypocalcemia that is extremely difficult to manage and life-threatening.

Cryopreservation, however, requires preoperative planning for tissue transport and storage.

During bilateral parathyroid exploration, the surgeon must use <span class=\"nowrap\">his/her</span> knowledge of the embryology and anatomy of the parathyroid glands to determine whether a superior or an inferior gland is missing, or a supernumerary gland is present (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F87046\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef87046 \">figure 7</a>), and use that information to conduct an orderly search for the missing gland.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1687719\"><span class=\"h4\">Missing superior gland</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>For a missing superior gland, the surgeon should explore the middle and posterior neck compartments, particularly the paraesophageal spaces and the tracheoesophageal groove, extending the dissection caudad into the middle and posterior mediastinal planes (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F79942\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef79942 \">figure 8</a>). </p><p>The surgeon must confirm that there is not an enlarged gland in the paraesophageal or retroesophageal space, which is the most common place for missed superior glands. Such glands can often descend in the avascular plane to reside in a location inferior to the inferior gland and are posteriorly located along the lateral border of the esophagus. Digital palpation along the lateral border of the esophagus is an excellent way to identify the gland, which can be appreciated as a subtle bulge.</p><p>The superior thyroid vessels can be followed superiorly to assess for a partially undescended gland, palpating the piriform sinus and angle of the jaw cranial to the superior pole of the thyroid. The missing superior gland may also be found in the posterior retropharyngeal space. The majority of mediastinal parathyroid glands (over 90 percent) are accessible via a cervical approach.

A reduction of at least 50 percent in PTH level from the baseline is an accepted standard for intraoperative confirmation of success, although a number of centers further require that the postexcision PTH level be in the normal range [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/parathyroid-exploration-for-primary-hyperparathyroidism/abstract/94,95\" class=\"abstract_t\">94,95</a>].

Using sestamibi uptake as an indirect measure of parathyroid gland hyperfunction, the surgeon uses a handheld gamma probe in conjunction with preoperative imaging results to focus the incision over the site of greatest radioactivity. Once the suspected offending gland or glands are removed, intraoperative PTH monitoring is typically used to confirm adequate parathyroidectomy. The gamma probe is also used to survey the surgical bed (background radioactivity). An ex vivo radioactivity count of &gt;20 percent of the background radioactivity is a suggested threshold for completion of the exploration. </p><p>Use of the gamma probe alone, however, may not reliably ensure operative cure.

Although rare, this complication can result in life-threatening airway compromise. Cervical hematoma results in venous congestion of airway structures, creating significant laryngeal edema and subsequent airway compromise. In addition, oropharyngeal swelling creates a narrow window for reintubation. With rare exceptions, the presence of hematoma indicates urgent surgical evaluation and treatment.

After a focused parathyroid exploration, low serum calcium may be the result of suppression of the other glands, which require the stimulus of hypocalcemia to resume function. If a bilateral exploration or prior contralateral exploration has taken place, the hypocalcemia may be caused by inadvertent injury to or loss of function of the remaining parathyroid glands. Thus, it is prudent to confirm function of the residual parathyroid tissue with a parathyroid hormone (PTH) assessment. The classic calcium nadir occurs within the first 24 to 48 hours after a parathyroidectomy, and a serum PTH value can be obtained on the first postoperative day prior to discharge. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H27512400\"><span class=\"h3\">Mild hypocalcemia</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Mild postoperative hypocalcemia may be due to bone hunger or functional hypoparathyroidism resulting from suppression of the remaining normal parathyroid tissue. Symptoms, including perioral or acral paresthesias and anxiety, can be exacerbated by hyperventilation. Mild hypocalcemia generally responds well to a short course of oral calcium supplementation, starting with 1500 to 2000 mg of elemental calcium daily in divided doses, given as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=calcium-carbonate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">calcium carbonate</a>&nbsp;or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=calcium-citrate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">calcium citrate</a>.

Clinical manifestations of PHPT include polydipsia and polyuria, nephrolithiasis, nephrocalcinosis, osteoporosis, fragility fractures, vertebral compression fractures, pancreatitis, peptic ulcer disease, gastroesophageal reflux, fatigue, depression, and significant neurocognitive dysfunction. Although some patients are completely asymptomatic, many have nonspecific and often subtle symptoms, such as fatigue, depression, irritability, anxiety, anorexia, difficulty with concentration, or memory impairment. (See <a href=\"#H28792026\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above and <a href=\"#H10466681\" class=\"local\">'Indications'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Parathyroidectomy is the definitive therapy for PHPT and is indicated for all patients with symptomatic PHPT, patients with familial PHPT (multiple endocrine neoplasia [MEN] type 1 and 2A, or familial hyperparathyroidism), and patients with asymptomatic disease who have decreased renal function (glomerular filtration rates &lt;60 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/minute),</span> hypercalciuria (24-hour urine calcium level &gt;400 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL),</span> osteoporosis, serum calcium &gt;1 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> above normal, age &lt;50 years, or who prefer surgery to observation. Parathyroid exploration is also indicated for patients with parathyroid cancer or parathyroid crisis and for selected patients with persistent or recurrent PHPT after a previous parathyroid surgery. (See <a href=\"#H10466681\" class=\"local\">'Indications'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Contralateral recurrent laryngeal nerve (RLN) injury and symptomatic cervical disc disease are relative contraindications to parathyroidectomy. Patients with familial hypocalciuric hypercalcemia do not have a primary parathyroid disorder and should not undergo parathyroidectomy. (See <a href=\"#H28793494\" class=\"local\">'Contraindications'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients who have unilateral pathology as localized by preoperative imaging, no concomitant thyroid disease, and no family history of MEN, we suggest focused parathyroidectomy, rather than bilateral cervical exploration (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=5\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2B</a>). The success of focused parathyroidectomy is dependent upon both preoperative localization studies that limit the operative field to the region where a presumed single adenoma is and the use of intraoperative parathyroid hormone (PTH) monitoring to confirm that no other hyperfunctioning gland remains in situ. (See <a href=\"#H10466851\" class=\"local\">'Choice of procedure'</a> above and <a href=\"#H10466865\" class=\"local\">'Focused parathyroid exploration'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Initial bilateral neck exploration should still be performed when a single hyperfunctioning gland cannot be identified on preoperative imaging, when a focused approach fails, when the preoperative or intraoperative findings suggest multigland disease, for most forms of familial diseases, and when there is concomitant thyroid pathology (see <a href=\"#H10466851\" class=\"local\">'Choice of procedure'</a> above and <a href=\"#H10466858\" class=\"local\">'Bilateral parathyroid exploration'</a> above). Intraoperative parathyroid hormone monitoring is necessary in virtually all cases.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For most patients, cure after parathyroidectomy is defined as the reestablishment of normal calcium homeostasis lasting a minimum of six months. For patients with normocalcemic PHPT, the PTH level must also normalize at six months after surgery to indicate cure. In experienced hands, surgical cure is achieved in &ge;95 percent of initial parathyroidectomies; the recurrence rate is higher with reoperations. During exploration for primary hyperparathyroidism, expert understanding of the embryology and anatomy of the parathyroid glands is essential to achieve surgical cure. A missed parathyroid adenoma is the most common cause for a failed initial parathyroid operation and persistent hyperparathyroidism.
