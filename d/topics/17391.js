The stress response to pain is associated with metabolic and hormonal changes that are attenuated by anesthesia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/topical-anesthetics-in-children/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>].</p><p>Anesthesia can be provided by injection. However, topical anesthetics can be applied painlessly without needles and reduce the need for physical and chemical restraints [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/topical-anesthetics-in-children/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. They also avoid the tissue distortion that occurs with infiltrated anesthetics [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/topical-anesthetics-in-children/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].</p><p>Nonpharmacologic interventions (eg, behavioral techniques, cognitive techniques) are an essential part of any attempt to attenuate pain in the conscious child and enhance the benefit of local anesthesia. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=procedural-sedation-in-children-outside-of-the-operating-room#H1684879\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Procedural sedation in children outside of the operating room&quot;, section on 'Nonpharmacologic interventions'</a>.)</p><p>The use of topical anesthetics is reviewed here. A general approach to the management of pain and sedation in children, and prevention and treatment of neonatal pain are discussed elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=procedural-sedation-in-children-outside-of-the-operating-room\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Procedural sedation in children outside of the operating room&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prevention-and-treatment-of-neonatal-pain\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Prevention and treatment of neonatal pain&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">LET</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>LET is a combination of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lidocaine-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">lidocaine</a> (4 percent), <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epinephrine-adrenaline-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">epinephrine</a> (0.1 percent), and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tetracaine-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">tetracaine</a> (0.5 percent) available as an aqueous solution or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methylcellulose-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">methylcellulose</a> based gel. The local anesthetics cause sensory and motor blockade primarily by reversible inhibition of axonal sodium channels, blocking conduction of action potentials [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/topical-anesthetics-in-children/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. This results in numbness and weakness. Epinephrine causes local vasoconstriction that slows systemic absorption and metabolism of the anesthetics [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/topical-anesthetics-in-children/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. Lidocaine, in the amide class of anesthetics, is metabolized by the liver; tetracaine, in the ester class, is metabolized in plasma by pseudocholinesterase [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/topical-anesthetics-in-children/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Efficacy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>LET is the topical anesthetic most frequently used for laceration repair. Based upon several trials, it provides adequate local anesthesia for wound closure in 75 to 90 percent of scalp and facial lacerations in a manner that is equivalent to <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tetracaine-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">tetracaine</a>, adrenaline, and cocaine (TAC) topical solution [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/topical-anesthetics-in-children/abstract/6-9\" class=\"abstract_t\">6-9</a>]. LET is less effective on extremity or truncal wounds [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/topical-anesthetics-in-children/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H43\" class=\"local\">'TAC'</a> below.)</p><p>If anesthesia is inadequate with LET alone, supplemental <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lidocaine-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">lidocaine</a> is injected through the wound edges for suturing.</p><p>LET also reduces the pain of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lidocaine-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">lidocaine</a> injection:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In one study, 43 patients (mostly children) with simple lacerations were randomly assigned to receive LET or a placebo containing <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epinephrine-adrenaline-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">epinephrine</a> prior to infiltration of the wound with supplemental <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lidocaine-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">lidocaine</a>&nbsp;[<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/topical-anesthetics-in-children/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. Adequate anesthesia occurred in more patients treated with LET (46 versus 14 percent) compared with controls, and they experienced less pain from injection (22 versus 42 mm on a 100 mm visual pain scale).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In another study, LET or EMLA was used prior to <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lidocaine-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">lidocaine</a> infiltration for suturing of simple lacerations; the median pain scores were similar [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/topical-anesthetics-in-children/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. However, more wounds treated with LET were anesthetic to a needlestick (73 versus 40 percent).</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Indications and contraindications</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>LET is used for anesthesia for laceration repair on the face or scalp.</p><p>LET should not be applied in areas that have an end arterial supply, such as the digits, penis, nose, and ears [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/topical-anesthetics-in-children/abstract/5,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,6</a>]. This is because <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epinephrine-adrenaline-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">epinephrine</a> may result in excessive vasoconstriction and compromise perfusion of an area without a compensatory blood supply. Known allergy to <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lidocaine-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">lidocaine</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tetracaine-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">tetracaine</a>, or other amide or ester type anesthetics is another contraindication. LET may not be appropriate for large wounds because the amount required for adequate anesthesia might exceed the recommended dose [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/topical-anesthetics-in-children/abstract/5,6,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,6,8</a>]. LET should be used with caution on mucous membranes because of the potential of excessive absorption of lidocaine.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Adverse effects</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Adverse effects are due to excessive absorption of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lidocaine-and-tetracaine-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">lidocaine-tetracaine</a>, resulting in systemic toxicity. This is caused primarily by exposure to mucous membranes or ingestion of large doses. Adverse effects are rare if recommended doses are not exceeded and application to mucous membranes is avoided [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/topical-anesthetics-in-children/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. For example, a systematic review of 23 randomized controlled trials in 3218 patients that assessed multiple topical anesthetics, including LET, found no reports of serious complications [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/topical-anesthetics-in-children/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>].</p><p>Toxic effects of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lidocaine-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">lidocaine</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tetracaine-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">tetracaine</a> are primarily on the cardiovascular and central nervous systems. Central nervous system (CNS) symptoms include headache, irritability, restlessness, metallic taste, tingling around the lips, somnolence, blurred vision, and seizures [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/topical-anesthetics-in-children/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. Cardiovascular effects are bradycardia, decreased contractility, atrioventricular block, vasodilation, ventricular ectopy, and cardiac arrest. Methemoglobinemia has rarely been reported in association with the use of topical lidocaine [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/topical-anesthetics-in-children/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-features-diagnosis-and-treatment-of-methemoglobinemia#H13\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical features, diagnosis, and treatment of methemoglobinemia&quot;, section on 'Acquired methemoglobinemia'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Dose and application</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>LET in a dose of 1 to 3 mL is applied to an open wound for 20 to 30 minutes.</p><p>Irrigation of the wound and removal of debris and blood clots before application maximizes penetration of the anesthetic although it is not necessary for most simple lacerations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/topical-anesthetics-in-children/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. LET is available in an aqueous solution and a <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methylcellulose-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">methylcellulose</a> based gel. The gel is preferred because it maintains better contact with the open wound and is easier to apply.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h3\">Gel</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Gels are applied to the wound and wound edges with a cotton-tipped applicator [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/topical-anesthetics-in-children/abstract/8,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,9</a>]. The wound is then covered with sterile gauze held in place by an adhesive dressing, tape, or an elastic wrap for 20 to 30 minutes. The gel is removed before suturing. The duration of action following removal of the anesthetic is 45 to 60 minutes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/topical-anesthetics-in-children/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].</p><p>Gels provide similar anesthesia to aqueous solutions but offer practical advantages. In one study of suturing of uncomplicated scalp and facial lacerations in 200 children, more patients treated with gel had complete anesthesia (85 versus 76 percent) and fewer had partial anesthesia (5 versus 21 percent), although more had incomplete anesthesia (9 versus 3 percent), compared with the solution [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/topical-anesthetics-in-children/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. In addition, problems seen with the solution, such as difficulty in application, loss of anesthetic volume due to drainage from the laceration, and inadvertent contact with mucous membranes, are less likely with the gel.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H920909\"><span class=\"h3\">Solution</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The aqueous solution of LET is first painted into the wound with a cotton-tipped swab, then applied directly using a cotton ball saturated with the solution [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/topical-anesthetics-in-children/abstract/7,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,9</a>]. Alternatively, the saturated cotton ball can be applied directly to the laceration. Anesthesia becomes effective in approximately 20 minutes.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h2\">Use</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>We suggest that LET gel in a dose of up to 3 mL, on a cotton-tipped applicator or LET solution on a cotton ball, be applied to uncomplicated facial or scalp lacerations less than 5 cm long in infants and children older than one month of age for at least 20 minutes before suturing. Injected buffered 1 percent <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lidocaine-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">lidocaine</a> may also be necessary to achieve complete analgesia. In addition, LET may provide some analgesia for uncomplicated lacerations in other sites but may not obviate the need for infiltrative anesthetics. LET should not be applied to the genitalia, ear lobes, fingers, or toes. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'LET'</a> above and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=subcutaneous-infiltration-of-local-anesthetics#H2\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Subcutaneous infiltration of local anesthetics&quot;, section on 'Lidocaine'</a>.)</p><p>The use of up to 3 mL of LET gel or solution as described is supported by extensive clinical experience with this dose without reported serious adverse effects. As an example, in a trial of 203 children between the ages of three months to 17 years receiving 3 mL of LET prior to wound closure with tissue adhesives, no serious toxicity occurred in any patient [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/topical-anesthetics-in-children/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. Although the administered dose of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lidocaine-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">lidocaine</a> in 3 mL of LET is approximately 135 mg, the amount of lidocaine and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tetracaine-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">tetracaine</a> actually absorbed is limited by the size of the laceration and the presence of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epinephrine-adrenaline-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">epinephrine</a>. Much larger topical doses of lidocaine without epinephrine (up to 90 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg)</span> have been tolerated in adults with partial thickness burns without serious toxicity although the plasma concentration of lidocaine (5.8 <span class=\"nowrap\">mcg/mL)</span> was above the therapeutic level [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/topical-anesthetics-in-children/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>].</p><p>Weight-based dosing has been suggested for children &lt;17 kg (eg, 0.175 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/kg)</span> to prevent application of &gt;5 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lidocaine-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">lidocaine</a> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/topical-anesthetics-in-children/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. This approach appears conservative given the lack of toxicity associated with the use of LET and evidence is lacking to indicate that weight-based dosing is needed.</p><p>Alternatively, clinicians can use dosing guidance as for other local anesthetic formulations. However, LET is likely to have lower potential for systemic absorption than these agents due to epinephrine-induced vasoconstriction. (See <a href=\"#H22\" class=\"local\">'Dose'</a> below.)</p><p>Because of the higher potential for systemic absorption of topical agents in neonates and the theoretical risk of methemoglobinemia posed by the <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tetracaine-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">tetracaine</a> component, LET should be used with caution in infants younger than one month of age.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h3\">Standing orders</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Many hospital emergency departments (EDs) have standing orders for application of LET in triage in order to avoid delays in laceration care in children [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/topical-anesthetics-in-children/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. Standing orders help encourage the use of topical anesthetics and are an important part of implementing a systemic approach to pain management for venous access in the ED or other hospital unit [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/topical-anesthetics-in-children/abstract/17,19\" class=\"abstract_t\">17,19</a>]. When implementing standing orders, we suggest the following criteria [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/topical-anesthetics-in-children/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Eligible patients</strong> &ndash; Simple lacerations &lt;5 cm in length</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Contraindications</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Lacerations of mucous membranes (eg, lip, vulva) or regions where it may cause vascular compromise (eg, digits, penis, ear, nose)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Grossly contaminated wounds</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Patients with allergy to amide or ester local anesthetics</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Procedure</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Place 3 mL of LET mixed with cellulose on the open wound OR apply a cotton ball soaked with no more than 3 mL LET solution into the wound</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Cover with an occlusive dressing (eg, gauze with tape)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Document the time of placement in the patient's medical record</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h1\">EMLA</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>EMLA (an acronym for &ldquo;eutectic mixture of local anesthetics&rdquo;) is a mixture of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lidocaine-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">lidocaine</a> (2.5 percent) and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prilocaine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">prilocaine</a> (2.5 percent) in a cream base. These local anesthetics cause sensory and motor blockade primarily by reversible inhibition of axonal sodium channels, blocking conduction of action potentials [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/topical-anesthetics-in-children/abstract/5,20\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,20</a>]. This action results in numbness.</p><p>The anesthetics in EMLA cream are concentrated in micron-sized droplets. The small size of the droplets and the high concentration gradient promote penetration of the anesthetic through intact skin [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/topical-anesthetics-in-children/abstract/21,22\" class=\"abstract_t\">21,22</a>].</p><p>A eutectic mixture has a lower melting point than its individual components; consequently, it is in liquid form at room temperature [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/topical-anesthetics-in-children/abstract/21,23\" class=\"abstract_t\">21,23</a>].

As an example, in a randomized trial in 258 children, subjective pain scores in response to venipuncture and venous cannulation were significantly lower with EMLA than with placebo [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/topical-anesthetics-in-children/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. Another randomized trial evaluated the effect of EMLA on distress and ease of procedure in children undergoing phlebotomy in an office practice [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/topical-anesthetics-in-children/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>].

In one study, the depth of anesthesia measured by needle insertion was approximately 3 mm one hour after application to intact skin; maximum penetration was 5 mm after 1.5 to 2 hours [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/topical-anesthetics-in-children/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. The depth of anesthesia penetration continued to increase for 30 to 60 minutes after removal of the cream [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/topical-anesthetics-in-children/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>].</p><p>Absorption of EMLA is increased in diseased or denuded skin.

Levels were well below the toxic range. The anesthetic effect was shorter but had a more rapid onset. However, in another study in which EMLA was used for laceration repair, sufficient anesthesia required application for approximately one hour, similar to normal skin [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/topical-anesthetics-in-children/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15\"><span class=\"h3\">Duration</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>EMLA effectively reduces pain for at least one to two hours after removal of the cream [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/topical-anesthetics-in-children/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].

Systemic toxicity is unlikely if EMLA cream is applied correctly. With appropriate application, plasma concentrations of the anesthetics are low and the increase in methemoglobin level is negligible [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/topical-anesthetics-in-children/abstract/5,30\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,30</a>]. However, cases of methemoglobinemia, seizures, and respiratory depression have been described with excessive skin application of EMLA in children, including those patients with skin conditions that may have increased systemic absorption [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/topical-anesthetics-in-children/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>].</p><p>Methemoglobinemia is more likely to occur in children with a predisposing condition, such as glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency or concurrent use of methemoglobin-inducing medications (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F51406\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef51406 \">table 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/topical-anesthetics-in-children/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>] (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-features-diagnosis-and-treatment-of-methemoglobinemia\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical features, diagnosis, and treatment of methemoglobinemia&quot;</a>).

The electric current delivered is titrated from 0 to a maximum of 4 milliamperes (mA).

Alternative agents, such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lidocaine-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">lidocaine</a> spray or 2 percent viscous lidocaine are much less likely to cause methemoglobinemia and appear to have similar efficacy.</p><p>Methemoglobinemia has been reported in association with the use of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=benzocaine-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">benzocaine</a> spray in the mouth and throat [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/topical-anesthetics-in-children/abstract/63-65\" class=\"abstract_t\">63-65</a>]. The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has issued two public health advisories announcing an ongoing review of benzocaine spray safety, highlighting the risk of benzocaine spray use during medical procedures and suggesting that benzocaine spray be avoided in patients at elevated risk, including all children less than four months of age and those with significant airway or cardiac disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/topical-anesthetics-in-children/abstract/66,67\" class=\"abstract_t\">66,67</a>]. An analysis of adverse events voluntarily reported to the US FDA between 1997 and 2002 suggests that, when a dose was specified, the usual dose of benzocaine spray was exceeded in 32 of 69 reports of methemoglobinemia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/topical-anesthetics-in-children/abstract/68\" class=\"abstract_t\">68</a>]. However, the development of methemoglobinemia after use of benzocaine spray may not correlate with the amount applied. Many cases reported to the FDA describe methemoglobinemia occurring after a single benzocaine spray [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/topical-anesthetics-in-children/abstract/66\" class=\"abstract_t\">66</a>]. Methemoglobinemia is also more likely to occur in patients with a predisposing condition, such as glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency or concurrent use of methemoglobin-inducing medications (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F51406\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef51406 \">table 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/topical-anesthetics-in-children/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].
