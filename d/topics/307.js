Opiates belong to the larger class of drugs, the opioids, which include synthetic and semi-synthetic drugs, as well. Opioid abuse is a worldwide problem and deaths from opioid overdose are numerous and increasing [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-opioid-intoxication-in-adults/abstract/1-5\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-5</a>]. </p><p>This topic review will discuss the mechanisms, clinical manifestations, and management of acute opioid toxicity. A summary table to facilitate emergent management is provided (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F55540\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef55540 \">table 1</a>). Issues related to opioid withdrawal, chronic opioid abuse, and general management of the poisoned patient are found elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=opioid-withdrawal-in-the-emergency-setting\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Opioid withdrawal in the emergency setting&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pharmacotherapy-for-opioid-use-disorder\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pharmacotherapy for opioid use disorder&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=opioid-use-disorder-epidemiology-pharmacology-clinical-manifestations-course-screening-assessment-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Opioid use disorder: Epidemiology, pharmacology, clinical manifestations, course, screening, assessment, and diagnosis&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=general-approach-to-drug-poisoning-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;General approach to drug poisoning in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">PHARMACOLOGY AND CELLULAR TOXICOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The opioid pharmaceuticals are analogous to the three families of endogenous opioid peptides: enkephalins, endorphins, and dynorphin. The most recent classification scheme identifies three major classes of opioid receptor, with several minor classes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-opioid-intoxication-in-adults/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. Within each receptor class there are distinct subtypes. Each subtype produces a variety of distinct clinical effects, although there is some overlap (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F64386\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef64386 \">table 2</a>). For most clinicians, the nomenclature derived from the Greek alphabet is more familiar, although the International Union of Pharmacology (IUPHAR) Committee on Receptor Nomenclature has recommended a change from the original Greek system to make opioid receptor names more consistent with other neurotransmitter systems [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-opioid-intoxication-in-adults/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. </p><p>The opioid receptors are distinct in their locations and clinical effects, but they are structurally similar (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F64386\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef64386 \">table 2</a>). Each consists of seven transmembrane segments, with amino acid and carboxy termini. Although the opioid receptors are all coupled to G proteins, they use a variety of signal transduction mechanisms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-opioid-intoxication-in-adults/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. These include reducing the capacity of adenylate cyclase to produce cAMP, closing calcium channels that reduce the signal to release neurotransmitters, or opening potassium channels to hyperpolarize the cell [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-opioid-intoxication-in-adults/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. The net result of these mechanisms is to modulate the release of neurotransmitters.</p><p>Opioid receptors exist throughout the central and peripheral nervous system and are linked to a variety of neurotransmitters, which explains the diversity of their clinical effects. The analgesic effects of opioids result from inhibition of nociceptive information at multiple points of its transmission from the peripheral nerve to the spinal cord to the brain. Euphoria results from increased <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dopamine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">dopamine</a> released in the mesolimbic system [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-opioid-intoxication-in-adults/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. Anxiolysis results from effects on noradrenergic neurons in the locus ceruleus [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-opioid-intoxication-in-adults/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">KINETICS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The vast number of opioids precludes presenting pharmacokinetic data for each one, but a few clinically important generalizations can be made. The majority of opioids have volumes of distribution of 1 to 10 <span class=\"nowrap\">L/kg,</span> which makes removal of a significant quantity of drug by hemodialysis impossible. They have variable protein binding (from 7.1 percent for <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hydrocodone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">hydrocodone</a> to 89 percent for <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methadone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">methadone</a>) and are renally eliminated. Many opioids are metabolized by the liver to active metabolites. Examples include hydrocodone (metabolized to <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hydromorphone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">hydromorphone</a> by Cytochrome P450 [CYP] 2D6) and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=morphine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">morphine</a> (metabolized to morphine-6-glucuronide). Cytochrome P450 polymorphisms cause variations in clinical effect.</p><p>The most clinically important pharmacokinetic difference is a wide variation in serum half-life (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F70480\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef70480 \">table 3</a>). The half-life data in these tables, taken from healthy subjects receiving therapeutic doses, should serve only as a rough guide to duration of clinical effect. Actual effects are influenced by dose, an individual's tolerance, and the presence of active metabolites.</p><p>In overdose, the apparent half-life may vary significantly from therapeutic dosing. If many tablets are taken, dissolution and absorption will be delayed, prolonging the apparent half-life. Duration of action may also be shortened in overdose. As an example, when a sustained-release formulation of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=oxycodone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">oxycodone</a> is crushed before ingestion, the drug is rapidly absorbed. While the user's intent is to increase euphoria, the chance of significant morbidity is increased as well.</p><p>Although active metabolites of some opioids (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=morphine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">morphine</a>) accumulate in patients with impaired kidney function, such metabolites are not dialyzable and management is unchanged [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-opioid-intoxication-in-adults/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL FEATURES OF OVERDOSE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Important clinical features related to opioid toxicity are discussed here. A general approach to the overdose patient is found elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=general-approach-to-drug-poisoning-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;General approach to drug poisoning in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">History</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The clinician should attempt to identify the specific drug, dose, and formulation to which the patient was exposed, the presence of nonopioid co-exposures, and the individual's prior history of opioid use. One review found the &quot;typical&quot; heroin death to involve experienced users in their 20s to 30s using coingestants [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-opioid-intoxication-in-adults/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. Recently released prisoners are at higher risk of opioid overdose in the post-release period because of lost tolerance during incarceration [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-opioid-intoxication-in-adults/abstract/11,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,12</a>]. </p><p>While not essential for management, historical features help predict the expected duration of poisoning. History should also determine the reason for poisoning, as the patient's intention will influence post-overdose management. Generally, opioid exposures will fall into one of several categories: therapeutic use, recreational use, intended self-harm, attempt to hide drugs from law enforcement out of fear for arrest (&quot;body stuffing&quot;), swallowing large quantities of packaged drugs in order to transport them across borders (&quot;body packing&quot;), and unintentional pediatric exposures. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Physical examination</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Physical examination helps to: confirm the diagnosis of opioid poisoning; determine the extent of intoxication; identify other conditions requiring treatment; and prevent further exposure (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F77213\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef77213 \">table 4</a>).</p><p>The classic signs of opioid toxicity include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Depressed mental status</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Decreased respiratory rate</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Decreased tidal volume</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Decreased bowel sounds</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Miotic (constricted) pupils</p><p/><p>Normal pupil examination does <strong>not</strong> exclude opioid toxicity. Users of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=meperidine-pethidine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">meperidine</a> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-opioid-intoxication-in-adults/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>] often present with normal pupils, and the presence of coingestants (such as sympathomimetics or anticholinergics) make pupils appear normal or large. The best predictor of opioid toxicity is a respiratory rate <span class=\"nowrap\">&lt;12/minute,</span> which predicted response to <a href=\"topic.htm?path=naloxone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">naloxone</a> in virtually all patients in one series [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-opioid-intoxication-in-adults/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. The clinician should measure the respiratory rate and pay close attention to chest wall excursion, as subtle changes in respiratory effort are often not identified using triage vital signs.</p><p>While decreased respiratory rate is the most notable vital sign abnormality, heart rate ranges from normal to low, although this is not usually consequential. Mild hypotension (from histamine release) may develop in some patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-opioid-intoxication-in-adults/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. Pulse oximetry should be performed in every patient, although the clinician should be wary that hypercapnia can be present in the setting of normal oxygen saturation, particularly when the patient is placed on supplemental oxygen. To monitor end-tidal CO<sub>2 </sub>(EtCO<sub>2</sub>), and thereby ventilation, directly, clinicians can use capnography. When increased, EtCO<sub>2</sub> often predicts respiratory complications, although a normal value does not exclude such problems [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-opioid-intoxication-in-adults/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. </p><p>Obtain a core temperature from any patient with more than minimal symptoms. Hypothermia, which results from a combination of environmental exposure and impaired thermogenesis, should be identified and treated. In a severely obtunded patient, even room temperature can produce significant hypothermia. Elevated temperature suggests early aspiration pneumonia or complications of injection drug use, such as endocarditis.</p><p>Mental status can range from euphoria to coma, or be nearly normal. Seizures typically occur in the setting of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tapentadol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">tapentadol</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tramadol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">tramadol</a>, or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=meperidine-pethidine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">meperidine</a> overdose, or as a result of hypoxia from any opioid.</p><p>During the secondary survey, look for signs of trauma, particularly to the head. Not only do opioids predispose the patient to trauma, but obtundation from traumatic brain injury can be misidentified as drug toxicity. Pulmonary findings such as crackles indicate the presence of aspiration or acute respiratory distress syndrome. If the patient is suspected of attempting to hide drugs out of fear for arrest, rectal and vaginal examination should be performed with the patient's permission. If the patient cannot give consent because of poisoning, consent is inferred based on medical necessity. Examination of the skin may identify medication patches that must be removed, track marks suggesting history of chronic injection drug use, or coexisting soft tissue infections (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F86745\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef86745 \">picture 1</a>).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Toxicities of specific agents</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In addition to the general features described above, some agents have specific toxicities.

Ethanol, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clonidine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">clonidine</a>, and sedative-hypnotics (eg, benzodiazepines) may be the most clinically-relevant drugs in the differential diagnosis, because they occur frequently. While clonidine produces miosis and obtundation, bradycardia, and hypotension are more prominent. Ethanol intoxication produces little to no miosis and no change in bowel sounds. The sedative-hypnotic agents result in much less respiratory depression than the opioids, especially when taken orally. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ethanol-intoxication-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Ethanol intoxication in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The presence of coingestants often confounds the diagnosis of opioid toxicity. While it is frequently impossible to determine the exact substances to which the patient was exposed, a careful history, physical examination, and judicious use of laboratory studies will determine the correct course of management. The sine qua non of opioid toxicity is a clinical response to an antagonist, although giving large doses of antagonist to establish the diagnosis of opioid toxicity is usually not helpful and potentially dangerous, and therefore not recommended. (See <a href=\"#H13\" class=\"local\">'Management'</a> below and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=general-approach-to-drug-poisoning-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;General approach to drug poisoning in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Any medical condition that produces coma may be mistaken for (or occur in conjunction with) opioid poisoning. The most important conditions to exclude are those in which delay of diagnosis will delay definitive care, such as stroke, electrolyte abnormality, and sepsis (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F65571\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef65571 \">table 6</a>). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=stupor-and-coma-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Stupor and coma in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h1\">LABORATORY EVALUATION AND ANCILLARY STUDIES</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h2\">Laboratory evaluation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A rapid serum glucose concentration should be obtained in all suspected cases of opioid toxicity. Hypoglycemia is prevalent, easily detectable, rapidly correctable, and potentially confused with opioid toxicity. Most patients with mild or moderate unintentional or recreational poisoning can be managed successfully without any further laboratory investigation.</p><p>After any overdose in which the opioid is formulated with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acetaminophen-paracetamol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">acetaminophen</a>, or any overdose that is the result of intended self-harm, serum acetaminophen concentration should be obtained. In one series, 1 in 365 individuals with suicidal ingestion and history negative for acetaminophen ingestion had a potentially hepatotoxic acetaminophen concentration [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-opioid-intoxication-in-adults/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. It is not essential to obtain a salicylate concentration in the absence of clinical suspicion or signs of overdose (eg, tachypnea or increased anion gap). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acetaminophen-paracetamol-poisoning-in-adults-treatment\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Acetaminophen (paracetamol) poisoning in adults: Treatment&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=salicylate-aspirin-poisoning-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Salicylate (aspirin) poisoning in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p>To exclude rhabdomyolysis in the patient presenting after prolonged immobilization, serum creatine phosphokinase concentration should be obtained. Further testing, such as serum creatinine and electrolytes, may be needed depending on clinical circumstances. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-rhabdomyolysis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of rhabdomyolysis&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-heme-pigment-induced-acute-kidney-injury#H11512176\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical features and diagnosis of heme pigment-induced acute kidney injury&quot;, section on 'Clinical manifestations'</a>.)</p><p>Urine toxicologic screens should <strong>NOT</strong> be routinely obtained. Acute opioid toxicity is a clinical diagnosis; the management of a patient with an opioid toxidrome is unchanged by the result of a urine opioid screen. A positive test indicates recent use but does not confirm active toxicity, and may even represent a false positive. Conversely, many opioids, especially the synthetic drugs, will produce false-negative results in many commonly available urine screens. Commonly available laboratory assays (eg, for <a href=\"topic.htm?path=phenytoin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">phenytoin</a>) can be performed if the history or examination suggests coingestion.

With a few exceptions, electrocardiography can be omitted in other types of opioid exposure.</p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=loperamide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Loperamide</a> is associated with cardiac conduction disturbances ranging in severity from QRS widening to QT prolongation, ventricular tachycardia (polymorphic and monomorphic), and idioventricular rhythm [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-opioid-intoxication-in-adults/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methadone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Methadone</a> also increases the QT interval and can cause Torsade de Pointes.

However, the observations that most people who take very large doses of methadone tolerate it well and that some have developed QT prolongation from lower doses suggest individual susceptibility to the condition varies.

The presence of elevated end tidal CO<sub>2</sub> (EtCO<sub>2</sub>) in opioid-toxic patients may predict complications, although its absence cannot exclude them. In a prospective cohort study of 201 patients poisoned with respiratory depressants, noninvasive end tidal EtCO<sub>2</sub> &gt;50 mmHg predicted complications of hypoventilation with 46 percent sensitivity and 86 percent specificity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-opioid-intoxication-in-adults/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>].

When given by these routes, there is slower absorption and delayed elimination, making the drug much more difficult to titrate. Naloxone is also absorbed in the respiratory tract, and thus, can be administered into an endotracheal tube or nebulized. Conceptually, there is little role for nebulized or nasal naloxone in the hospital setting because the dose administered is determined by the patient's ventilation, thus the most severely poisoned patients will absorb the least amount of antidote [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-opioid-intoxication-in-adults/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>]. The respiratory route and other routes of administration are less predictable. In addition, intravenous access is required in these patients as other medications (such as hypertonic dextrose) may be needed.</p><p>If the clinician &quot;overshoots&quot; the appropriate dose of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=naloxone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">naloxone</a> in an opioid-dependent individual, withdrawal will ensue. Symptoms of withdrawal should be managed expectantly only, <strong>NOT</strong> with additional opioids. To overcome naloxone antagonism requires a large dose of opioids. More importantly, because naloxone has a short duration of action, any opioid administered will result in even more toxicity once the effects of naloxone subside. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=opioid-withdrawal-in-the-emergency-setting\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Opioid withdrawal in the emergency setting&quot;</a>.)</p><p>After ventilation is restored with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=naloxone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">naloxone</a>, repeat doses may be required, depending on the quantity and duration of action of the opioid.

Compared with body packers, body stuffers typically carry a far smaller quantity of drug, but the drug is more poorly packaged.</p><p>In many cases, body packers or stuffers are identified by law enforcement officials and referred to clinicians for evaluation, but a substantial number of body packers present to physicians with symptoms either related to intestinal obstruction or drug toxicity.

When taken alone, buprenorphine can cause respiratory depression, but likely to a limited degree. Although most fatalities associated with buprenorphine have occurred in the setting of mixed overdose where the coingestant produced or contributed to respiratory depression (eg, alcohol or benzodiazepines), fatalities have occurred from buprenorphine toxicity alone [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-opioid-intoxication-in-adults/abstract/45\" class=\"abstract_t\">45</a>]. </p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=buprenorphine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Buprenorphine</a> binds to the opioid receptor with high affinity.

While the intravenous (IV) route is preferred, naloxone may be given nasally, subcutaneously or intramuscularly if IV access is unavailable.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>When spontaneous ventilations are present, an initial <a href=\"topic.htm?path=naloxone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">naloxone</a> dose of 0.04 to 0.05 mg is an appropriate starting point, and the dose should be titrated upward every few minutes until the respiratory rate is 12 or greater. Bag mask ventilation should be performed prior to and during administration of naloxone in apneic patients and patients with very low respiratory rates or shallow respirations. Apneic patients should receive higher initial doses of naloxone (0.2 to 1 mg). Patients in cardiac arrest should receive a dose no less than 2 mg.

In the absence of signs of opioid withdrawal, there is no maximum safe dose of naloxone. If a clinical effect does not occur after 5 to 10 mg, the diagnosis should be reconsidered. (See <a href=\"#H14\" class=\"local\">'Basic measures and antidotal therapy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>If the clinician &quot;overshoots&quot; the appropriate dose of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=naloxone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">naloxone</a> in an opioid-dependent individual, withdrawal will ensue. Symptoms of withdrawal should be managed expectantly only, <strong>NOT</strong> with opioids.

The large volume of distribution of the opioids precludes removal of a significant quantity of drug by hemodialysis. (See <a href=\"#H15\" class=\"local\">'Gastrointestinal decontamination'</a> above and <a href=\"#H16\" class=\"local\">'Extracorporeal removal'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In most cases, the patient may be discharged or transferred for psychiatric evaluation once respiration and mental status are normal and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=naloxone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">naloxone</a> has not been administered for two to three hours.
