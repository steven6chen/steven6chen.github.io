In people with dilated cardiomyopathy, the space inside the left ventricle gets bigger. The space inside the right ventricle might also get bigger (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F58474\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef58474 \">figure 1</a>). When the heart does not pump blood as well as it should, this can lead to a problem called &quot;heart failure.&quot;</p><p>The term &quot;heart failure&quot; is misleading. If your doctor tells you that you have heart failure, it does not mean your heart has stopped working. It just means that your heart has trouble keeping up with your body's demand for blood and oxygen (which is carried in the blood). But it is still working.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1731152977\"><span class=\"h1\">What are the symptoms of dilated cardiomyopathy?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>At first, dilated cardiomyopathy often does not cause symptoms. But as the condition gets worse, it can cause:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Trouble breathing, especially during exercise</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Trouble breathing when lying down or asleep</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Trouble doing physical activity or exercise</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Swelling in the feet, ankles, or legs (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F61706\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef61706 \">figure 2</a>)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1731152984\"><span class=\"h1\">Is there a test for dilated cardiomyopathy?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Yes. If your doctor or nurse suspects you have cardiomyopathy, he or she will ask you questions and do an exam. He or she might also order 1 or more of these tests:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>A chest X-ray</strong> &ndash; A chest X-ray shows if there is fluid in the lungs. It also shows the general shape and size of the heart and large blood vessels in the chest.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>An electrocardiogram (ECG or EKG)</strong> &ndash; This test measures the electrical activity in your heart. It can show if your heart beats in a normal rhythm and if you have had a heart attack in the past.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>An echocardiogram (or &quot;echo&quot; for short)</strong> &ndash; An echo uses sound waves to create an image of the heart. This test allows doctors to measure the walls and chambers of the heart, see how well the heart is pumping, and see how well the heart valves are working. (Heart valves are flaps of tissue that open and close like swinging doors. They help keep blood flowing in the right direction.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>A stress test</strong> &ndash; During a stress test, you might be asked to run or walk on a treadmill while you also have an ECG. Physical activity makes the heart pump faster and increases the heart's need for blood. This test helps doctors see if the heart is getting enough blood. If you cannot walk or run, your doctor might do this test by giving you a medicine to make your blood vessels widen or make your heart pump faster.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Cardiac catheterization (also called &quot;cardiac cath&quot;)</strong> &ndash; During this test, the doctor puts a thin tube into a blood vessel in your leg or arm. Then he or she moves the tube up to your heart. When the tube is in your heart or blood vessels, he or she will take measurements. The doctor might also put a dye that shows up on an X-ray into a tube. This can show if any of the arteries in your heart are narrowed or blocked. This part of the test is called &quot;coronary angiography.&quot; In some cases, the doctor will also take a tiny piece of heart muscle (a &quot;biopsy&quot;). This can help the doctor find the cause of your cardiomyopathy.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1731152991\"><span class=\"h1\">How is dilated cardiomyopathy treated?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Treatment for dilated cardiomyopathy depends on what is causing it and how severe it is. For example, in people who have cardiomyopathy caused by alcohol use, an important part of treatment is avoiding alcohol. If dilated cardiomyopathy is causing heart failure, the treatment is generally similar to that for other causes of heart failure.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1731152998\"><span class=\"h1\">More on this topic</span></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=heart-failure-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Heart failure (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=hypertrophic-cardiomyopathy-in-adults-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy in adults (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=echocardiogram-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Echocardiogram (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=ecg-and-stress-test-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: ECG and stress test (The Basics)</a></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=dilated-cardiomyopathy-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Dilated cardiomyopathy (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=heart-failure-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Heart failure (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=hypertrophic-cardiomyopathy-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (Beyond the Basics)</a></p></div><div id=\"reviewProcess\"><span>All topics are updated as new evidence becomes available and our <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/home/editorial-policy\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"policy policy_editorialpolicy\">peer review process</a> is complete.</span></div><div id=\"topicRetrievedDate\"><span class=\"emphasis\">This topic retrieved from UpToDate on: </span>Apr 02, 2018.</div><div id=\"disclaimer\">The content on the UpToDate website is not intended nor recommended as a substitute for medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.
