If you had a transient ischemic attack, sometimes called a &quot;mini-stroke&quot; or TIA, these same things can help prevent a full-blown stroke.</p><p>Medicines and lifestyle changes work together to give the most benefit. It's very important that you take all the medicines your doctor prescribes. It's just as important to make the lifestyle changes your doctor recommends.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13589294\"><span class=\"h1\">Medicines</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>If you had a stroke or TIA, your doctor or nurse will prescribe medicines to lower your risk of having another stroke. Some of these medicines work by &quot;lowering your risk factors.&quot; That means that they help lower blood pressure, blood sugar and cholesterol. Other medicines help by keeping blood clots from forming. (Blood clots cause many strokes.)</p><p>Medicines that are especially important in preventing strokes include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Medicines to lower blood pressure</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Medicines called statins, which lower cholesterol</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Medicines to prevent blood clots, such <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aspirin-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">aspirin</a> or blood thinners</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Medicines that help to keep your blood sugar as close to normal as possible (if you have diabetes)</p><p/><p>Whatever medicines your doctor prescribes, make sure you take them every day as directed (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F59726\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef59726 \">table 1</a>). If you cannot afford your medicines or if they cause side effects, talk to your doctor or nurse. There are often ways to deal with these problems.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13589309\"><span class=\"h1\">Lifestyle changes</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Lifestyle changes can do a lot to lower your risk of stroke. That's partly because the right lifestyle choices can help control risk factors such as blood pressure, blood sugar, and cholesterol. Besides, the lifestyle changes that help lower your risk of stroke can also help prevent lots of other health problems.</p><p>Here are the most important lifestyle changes:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Stop smoking, if you smoke</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Get regular exercise (if your doctor says it's safe) for at least 30 minutes a day on most days of the week</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Lose weight, if you are overweight</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Eat a &quot;Mediterranean&quot; diet rich in fruits, vegetables, and low-fat dairy products, and low in meats, sweets, and refined grains (such as white bread or white rice)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Eat less salt (sodium)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Limit the amount of alcohol you drink</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>If you are a woman, do not drink more than 1 drink a day</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>If you are a man, do not drink more than 2 drinks a day</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13589324\"><span class=\"h1\">Help with quitting smoking</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>If you smoke, ask your doctor or nurse about how to quit. There are strategies and medicines that can improve your chances of success. Studies show that people are most successful at quitting if they take medicines to help them quit and work with a counselor. You might also have a better chance at success if you combine nicotine replacement with one of the prescription medicines that help people quit.</p><p>You can also get help from a free phone line (1-800-QUIT-NOW) or online at <a href=\"http://www.smokefree.gov/&amp;token=QKIBSNX8g6AhU0aUawfvSwz/fATci3Tb0gogNY35g6DdWFW7z/4PEn14RDdsVp+n&amp;TOPIC_ID=16544\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">www.smokefree.gov</a>.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13589339\"><span class=\"h1\">More on this topic</span></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=stroke-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Stroke (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=controlling-your-blood-pressure-through-lifestyle-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Controlling your blood pressure through lifestyle (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=quitting-smoking-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Quitting smoking (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=low-sodium-diet-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Low-sodium diet (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=type-2-diabetes-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Type 2 diabetes (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=exercise-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Exercise (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=medicines-after-an-ischemic-stroke-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Medicines after an ischemic stroke (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=medicines-for-high-blood-pressure-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Medicines for high blood pressure (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=reducing-the-costs-of-medicines-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Reducing the costs of medicines (The Basics)</a> </p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=ischemic-stroke-treatment-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Ischemic stroke treatment (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=high-cholesterol-and-lipids-hyperlipidemia-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: High cholesterol and lipids (hyperlipidemia) (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=aspirin-in-the-primary-prevention-of-cardiovascular-disease-and-cancer-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Aspirin in the primary prevention of cardiovascular disease and cancer (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=high-blood-pressure-treatment-in-adults-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: High blood pressure treatment in adults (Beyond the Basics)</a></p></div><div id=\"reviewProcess\"><span>All topics are updated as new evidence becomes available and our <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/home/editorial-policy\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"policy policy_editorialpolicy\">peer review process</a> is complete.</span></div><div id=\"topicRetrievedDate\"><span class=\"emphasis\">This topic retrieved from UpToDate on: </span>Apr 02, 2018.</div><div id=\"disclaimer\">The content on the UpToDate website is not intended nor recommended as a substitute for medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.
