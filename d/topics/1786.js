The most common Bartholin masses are cysts or abscesses. The mainstay of management of a Bartholin abscess is incision and drainage (I&amp;D), and a Word catheter is often placed as well (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F65445\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef65445 \">picture 1</a>). The Word catheter is a balloon that is placed in the Bartholin gland after I&amp;D to allow continued drainage and reepithelialization of a tract for future drainage.</p><p>This topic will review the procedure for incision, drainage, and placement of a Word catheter for treatment of a Bartholin cyst or abscess. General principles of the diagnosis and management of a Bartholin cyst or abscess and the management of other types of vulvar abscess are discussed in detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=bartholin-gland-masses-diagnosis-and-management\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Bartholin gland masses: Diagnosis and management&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=vulvar-abscess\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Vulvar abscess&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H438949873\"><span class=\"h1\">INDICATIONS AND CONTRAINDICATIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The indication for incision and drainage (I&amp;D) and Word catheter placement is the presence of an uncomplicated Bartholin abscess. Placement of a Word catheter into the abscess allows the contents to drain and, over time, to form around the catheter a fistulous tract from the dilated duct or abscess to the vestibule to allow future drainage.</p><p>The stem of the Word catheter is latex, and thus use of this device is contraindicated in patients with <strong>latex allergy</strong>. There are few other contraindications to Word catheter placement. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H363593866\"><span class=\"h1\">PREPROCEDURE EVALUATION AND PREPARATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The patient is evaluated prior to the procedure to confirm that a vulvar mass is a Bartholin abscess, rather than another vulvar mass. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=bartholin-gland-masses-diagnosis-and-management#H363592057\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Bartholin gland masses: Diagnosis and management&quot;, section on 'Evaluation'</a>.)</p><p>Informed consent is obtained, including a discussion of risks and benefits. This is documented in the medical record.</p><p>Ensure that the patient does not have any allergies or hypersensitivity reactions to any agents that will be administered (eg, latex, iodine, amide-type anesthetics). </p><p>For women &ge;40 years old, most experts advise a biopsy of a Bartholin gland mass. Bartholin gland carcinoma is rare, but the risk is increased in this age group.

Recurrence rates of between 2 and 15 percent have been reported with this procedure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bartholin-gland-cyst-and-abscess-word-catheter-placement/abstract/3-5\" class=\"abstract_t\">3-5</a>]. If recurrence occurs, we perform a second incision and drainage and Word catheter placement and also treat with antibiotics. If a second recurrence occurs, we perform a marsupialization.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h1\">FOLLOW-UP</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The patient should wear a peripad to absorb discharge.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>She should maintain pelvic rest (ie, nothing in the vagina) while the Word catheter is in place. She should call to be examined if she experiences increasing swelling, pain, vaginal discharge, or fever.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>She may use sitz baths and mild analgesics to treat pain, if present during the first postoperative day or two.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The catheter is left in place for at least four weeks to promote formation of an epithelialized tract for permanent drainage of glandular secretions. Epithelialization may occur as soon as three weeks.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In patients with a catheter in place who have persistent discomfort despite analgesics, we remove 0.5 to 1 mL of fluid from the balloon.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>When the tract appears well-epithelialized, remove the catheter by deflating the balloon in the office.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>If the catheter falls out, determine further treatment based on examination results. With normal wound healing and no sign of recurrence, no further treatment is necessary [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bartholin-gland-cyst-and-abscess-word-catheter-placement/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>If recurrent cysts occur or as an alternative to Word catheter placement, marsupialization or excision may be performed, usually in an operating room or ambulatory surgical facility. Marsupialization refers to a procedure whereby a large (1.5 to 3 cm) incision is made over the center of the cyst and then the inside edges of the cyst are everted and sewn with interrupted stitches to the vestibular mucosa (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F60294\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef60294 \">figure 4</a>).</p><p/><p>If the catheter falls out before the tract is epithelialized and the cyst or abscess remains, the patient may need a repeat Word catheter placement or another procedure, such as marsupialization or excision.
