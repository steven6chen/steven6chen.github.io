IBS symptoms are more prevalent in patients with chronic IBD compared to control groups; 39 percent versus 8 percent in one study [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/irritable-bowel-syndrome-in-patients-with-inflammatory-bowel-disease/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Coexistent IBS in the IBD patient can lead to significant impairment in quality of life, anxiety, and depression, as well as unhealthy coping strategies and increased use of health care resources [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/irritable-bowel-syndrome-in-patients-with-inflammatory-bowel-disease/abstract/2-7\" class=\"abstract_t\">2-7</a>]. Furthermore, it can also lead to the increased use of IBD medications, with their potential side effects. Therefore, it is important to be able to recognize IBS in patients with IBD and also to use treatment approaches that are both practical and effective.</p><p>This topic reviews the approach to recognizing symptoms of IBS in patients with IBD as well as their diagnosis and management. The clinical symptoms, diagnosis, and management of IBS in general are discussed separately.

However, there are some clinical characteristics that can help differentiate between them:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Abdominal pain is increased in patients who have both IBS and IBD because the perception of pain can be increased due to hypersensitivity to painful stimuli. Abdominal pain due to IBS is often cramping, diffuse, and relieved by a bowel movement, while abdominal pain due to IBD is often constant, in a specific location, and not relieved by a bowel movement.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Watery diarrhea is common in both IBS and active Crohn's disease. However, bloody diarrhea is consistent with active ulcerative colitis, and does not occur in IBS.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Excess gas, bloating, heartburn, and dyspeptic symptoms are more likely to be due to IBS, rather than IBD.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Nausea, vomiting, fever, and chills are more likely to be associated with IBD, rather than IBS.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Weight loss is common in active IBD, but is uncommon in IBS. Nevertheless, patients with severe IBS can lose weight due to fear of eating.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Constipation may occur in active left-sided ulcerative colitis or in IBS; these may be difficult to distinguish.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6829227\"><span class=\"h1\">DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Diagnoses other than irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) should be considered when patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) present with an exacerbation of their symptoms.</p><p>The differential diagnoses of diarrhea in patients with IBD include infections such as <em>Clostridium difficile</em> or cytomegalovirus (CMV).

(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diagnosis-of-celiac-disease-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Diagnosis of celiac disease in adults&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-malabsorption\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical features and diagnosis of malabsorption&quot;</a>.)</p><p>In patients with Crohn's disease, small bowel bacterial overgrowth (SBO) may be a cause for diarrhea, especially in the presence of strictures, fistulae, or a blind loop. Studies have also demonstrated impaired propulsive function<sup> </sup>in inactive Crohn's disease that may result in stasis and SBO [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/irritable-bowel-syndrome-in-patients-with-inflammatory-bowel-disease/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].

(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-chronic-pancreatitis-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of chronic pancreatitis in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Involvement of the rectum and perianal structures with fistulae in IBD may lead to pelvic floor dysfunction (PFD) in patients with IBD. This may cause urgency and overflow diarrhea, abdominal or pelvic pain, and bloating [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/irritable-bowel-syndrome-in-patients-with-inflammatory-bowel-disease/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].</p><p>In patients with IBD and severe abdominal pain, obstruction, abscesses, and fistulae should be considered.</p><p>In postsurgical patients with an ileal pouch-anal anastomosis (IPAA), it is important to consider a diagnosis of irritable pouch syndrome (IPS) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/irritable-bowel-syndrome-in-patients-with-inflammatory-bowel-disease/abstract/10-13\" class=\"abstract_t\">10-13</a>].

The first step in the evaluation of symptomatic patients with IBD is to exclude an infection with cytomegalovirus (CMV) or <em>C. difficile</em>, and to confirm that the inflammatory process is sufficiently controlled and unlikely to be the cause of symptoms.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6829241\"><span class=\"h2\">Laboratory testing</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Normal C-reactive protein (CRP), erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), white blood cell count, hematocrit, and platelet count [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/irritable-bowel-syndrome-in-patients-with-inflammatory-bowel-disease/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>] are more consistent with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) rather than active IBD. In contrast, significantly abnormal blood work results are not consistent with IBS, but rather more likely to be associated with active IBD.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6829248\"><span class=\"h2\">Stool studies</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Stool evaluation for <em>C. difficile</em> toxin and CMV culture, in addition to routine stool cultures, microscopy for ova and parasites, and stool Giardia antigen, are important to exclude a concurrent infection.

Studies have reported a sensitivity and specificity of calprotectin ranging from 64 to 100 and 80 percent, respectively. The sensitivity and specificity of fecal lactoferrin is 80 and 78 percent, respectively.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6829255\"><span class=\"h2\">Endoscopy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Colonoscopy allows for an assessment of the extent and activity of both colitis and terminal ileitis.</p><p>Biopsies can also be obtained to rule out infection with CMV. CMV gastrointestinal disease is characterized histologically by mucosal inflammation, tissue necrosis, and vascular endothelial involvement. Characteristically, cytomegalic cells (large cells containing eosinophilic intranuclear and frequently basophilic intracytoplasmic inclusions) are present in mucosal biopsies stained with hematoxylin and eosin (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F52984\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef52984 \">picture 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/irritable-bowel-syndrome-in-patients-with-inflammatory-bowel-disease/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6829262\"><span class=\"h2\">Radiologic imaging</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Once a colonoscopy has excluded active colitis or terminal ileitis, approaches to image the small bowel include small bowel follow through (SBFT), capsule endoscopy, abdominal computed tomography (CT) scan, CT enterography, and magnetic resonance (MR) enterography. These tests are considered when there is residual concern for active inflammation (because of serum or stool studies or suggestive clinical features) and a normal colonoscopy.</p><p>MR and CT enterography have high sensitivities for detecting active small bowel inflammation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/irritable-bowel-syndrome-in-patients-with-inflammatory-bowel-disease/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. MR enterography has the advantage of avoiding radiation exposure and better characterization of stenotic lesions. CT enterography has the advantage of better temporal resolution, mesenteric imaging, and shorter length of examination [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/irritable-bowel-syndrome-in-patients-with-inflammatory-bowel-disease/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6829269\"><span class=\"h1\">TREATMENT</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6829276\"><span class=\"h2\">Dietary modification</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) patients have a chronically inflamed gastrointestinal tract, which leads to increased visceral hyper-responsiveness and hypersensitivity to foods and beverages, which can worsen gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms due to irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/irritable-bowel-syndrome-in-patients-with-inflammatory-bowel-disease/abstract/20-23\" class=\"abstract_t\">20-23</a>]. Because many of the GI symptoms in patients with IBS in IBD are induced by multiple food and beverage intolerances, dietary modification is our first step in the management of these patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/irritable-bowel-syndrome-in-patients-with-inflammatory-bowel-disease/abstract/24-32\" class=\"abstract_t\">24-32</a>].</p><p>A careful dietary history may reveal patterns of symptoms related to specific foods. It is important to note that the effects of many foods and beverages can be amount-dependent, delayed, additive, and cumulative [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/irritable-bowel-syndrome-in-patients-with-inflammatory-bowel-disease/abstract/24-32\" class=\"abstract_t\">24-32</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6829283\"><span class=\"h3\">Exclusion of foods associated with diarrhea, bloating, and cramping</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There are many foods and beverages that frequently cause diarrhea, abdominal cramping, gas, and bloating (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F73175\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef73175 \">table 1</a>). Milk products frequently cause diarrhea and abdominal cramping even in the absence of lactose deficiency. This is because milk contains many other substances in addition to lactose, including fats, proteins, sugars, and immunoglobulins, which may stimulate the GI tract. While skim milk and lactose free products will help some patients tolerate milk, for many patients, switching to soy <span class=\"nowrap\">milk/products</span> or rice <span class=\"nowrap\">milk/products</span> provides much more relief. These patients should avoid all forms of dairy and foods that contain milk products [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/irritable-bowel-syndrome-in-patients-with-inflammatory-bowel-disease/abstract/24-32\" class=\"abstract_t\">24-32</a>].</p><p>A diet low in fermentable oligo-, di-, and monosaccharides and polyols (FODMAP) may help IBS symptoms (but not constipation) in the setting of inflammatory bowel disease, with a 50 percent rate of improvement in uncontrolled studies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/irritable-bowel-syndrome-in-patients-with-inflammatory-bowel-disease/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>].

While it is possible that food allergy has a role in the development of symptoms, there are no reliable means to identify such individuals. Testing for serum immunoglobulins directed at specific dietary antigens (and elimination of responsible foods) has been proposed. However, the relationship between results of testing and improvement of symptoms requires validation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/irritable-bowel-syndrome-in-patients-with-inflammatory-bowel-disease/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>]. Other methods used in evaluating food allergies (eg, skin prick testing, RAST testing, and atopy patch testing) have not been well studied in IBS.

Chronic use of narcotics can conceal complications of IBD such as a perforation or abscess formation, and has been found to be associated with toxic megacolon, increased rate of infections, and increased mortality. Patients who chronically use large amounts of narcotics can also develop narcotic bowel syndrome, which can mimic small bowel obstruction.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Patients with both IBS and IBD can often become narcotic dependent. A history of illicit drug use, alcohol abuse, stress, anxiety, depression, physical abuse, mental abuse, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> sexual abuse is common in IBD patients with narcotic dependence.
