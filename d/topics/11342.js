Thus, the term was used to describe the smoky angiographic appearance of the vascular collateral network [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/moyamoya-disease-etiology-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>].</p><p>Moyamoya disease was first described in Japan in 1957. Many similar cases have subsequently been reported, mainly in Japan and other Asian countries. The disease is found less frequently in North America and Europe.</p><p>This topic will review the etiology and clinical aspects of moyamoya disease. Prognosis and treatment are discussed elsewhere.

The high incidence among the Japanese and Asian population, together with a familial occurrence of approximately 10 to 15 percent of cases, strongly suggests a genetic etiology.</p><p>Accumulating evidence suggests that the RNF213 gene on chromosome 17q25.3 is an important susceptibility factor for MMD in East Asian populations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/moyamoya-disease-etiology-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/3-8\" class=\"abstract_t\">3-8</a>].</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A report from Japan found that the c.14576G&gt;A variant of RNF213 was present in 95 percent of 41 patients with familial MMD, 79 percent of 163 patients with sporadic MMD, and 2 percent of 283 normal control subjects [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/moyamoya-disease-etiology-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A study in the Han Chinese population demonstrated that mutations in RNF213 gene were associated with increased susceptibility to MMD; ischemic MMD was related to the R4810K mutation, whereas hemorrhagic MMD was associated with the A4399T mutation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/moyamoya-disease-etiology-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a report from Korea of 352 subjects with intracranial large artery stenosis, the c.14429G&gt;A variant of RNF213 was detected in 76 percent of subjects meeting all criteria for MMD (n = 131), in 35 percent of 221 subjects with intracranial stenosis (n = 221), and in none of the healthy control subjects (n = 51) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/moyamoya-disease-etiology-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. </p><p/><p>Other reports have linked familial moyamoya disease to chromosomes 3p24.2-p26, 6q25, 8q23, and 12p12 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/moyamoya-disease-etiology-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/11-13\" class=\"abstract_t\">11-13</a>]. Although the mode of inheritance is not established, one study suggested that familial moyamoya is an autosomal dominant disease with incomplete penetrance [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/moyamoya-disease-etiology-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. The authors proposed that genomic imprinting and epigenetic modification may account for the predominantly maternal transmission and elevated female to male incidence ratio.

High levels of fibroblast growth factor, which may stimulate arterial growth, have been found in the vascular intima, media, and smooth muscle, as well as cerebrospinal fluid among patients with moyamoya [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/moyamoya-disease-etiology-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/16,17\" class=\"abstract_t\">16,17</a>].

High levels of hepatocyte growth factor, a strong inducer of angiogenesis, have been detected in the carotid fork and cerebrospinal fluid in patients with moyamoya disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/moyamoya-disease-etiology-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>].</p><p>An association between upper respiratory tract infection, especially tonsillitis, and moyamoya disease has been observed, suggesting the possibility of autoimmune disease.

Data from Japan regarding the peak age of moyamoya disease onset are conflicting.

Methodologic differences between studies and improved clinical detection over time may, at least in part, account for the apparent change in age distribution of moyamoya in Japan.

In an earlier study from Japan not included in the systematic review, ischemic events were more prevalent than hemorrhagic events in children with moyamoya, while hemorrhagic stroke (mainly intraparenchymal and intraventricular hemorrhage) was more common in adults [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/moyamoya-disease-etiology-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/90\" class=\"abstract_t\">90</a>].

The high incidence among the Japanese and Asian population, together with a familial occurrence of approximately 10 percent of cases, strongly suggests a genetic etiology. Accumulating evidence suggests that the RNF213 gene on chromosome 17q25.3 is an important susceptibility factor for moyamoya disease in East Asian populations. Patients with the angiographic appearance of moyamoya and no known risk factors are considered to have moyamoya disease, while those with one of the well-recognized associated conditions (neurofibromatosis type 1, cranial irradiation, Down syndrome, and sickle cell disease) are classified as having moyamoya syndrome. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Etiology'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Ischemic cerebrovascular events, either transient ischemic attack or infarction, are more prevalent than hemorrhagic events in children with moyamoya, while hemorrhagic stroke is more common in adults. (See <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'Clinical features'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Cranial CT <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> MRI are useful for the detection of brain infarction and hemorrhage in patients with moyamoya. Vascular imaging with magnetic resonance angiography, Computed tomographic angiography, or conventional catheter angiography is essential to demonstrate stenotic or occlusive lesions in the distal internal carotid arteries and the arteries around the circle of Willis. (See <a href=\"#H8\" class=\"local\">'Neuroimaging'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Transcranial Doppler ultrasonography provides a noninvasive way to evaluate intracranial hemodynamics and large artery stenosis. Perfusion CT, xenon-enhanced CT, perfusion-weighted MRI, positron emission tomography, and single-photon emission CT with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acetazolamide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">acetazolamide</a> challenge may be useful to estimate resting brain perfusion and blood flow reserve. (See <a href=\"#H12\" class=\"local\">'Hemodynamic studies'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The pathologic hallmarks of moyamoya are (see <a href=\"#H13\" class=\"local\">'Pathology'</a> above):</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Concentric stenosis or occlusion in the distal internal carotid arteries and large vessels of the circle of Willis</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>A collateral meshwork of overgrown and dilated small arteries, the moyamoya vessels, which branch from the circle of Willis </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The diagnosis of moyamoya disease is based upon the characteristic angiographic appearance of bilateral stenoses affecting the distal internal carotid arteries and proximal circle of Willis vessels, along with the presence of prominent basal collateral vessels.
