SS occurs in a primary form not associated with other diseases and a secondary form that complicates or overlaps other rheumatic conditions, most commonly rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE).</p><p>In both primary and secondary SS, decreased exocrine gland function leads to a combination of dry eye (keratoconjunctivitis sicca) and dry mouth (xerostomia) symptoms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-of-sjogrens-syndrome-extraglandular-disease/abstract/2,3\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,3</a>]. In addition, a variety of other disease manifestations can occur that may affect a range of tissues involving most organ systems.</p><p>The extraglandular disease manifestations of SS will be reviewed here. The exocrine manifestations, diagnosis, treatment, and prognosis of both sicca and extraglandular manifestations are discussed separately.

Some represent autoimmune-induced inflammation centered on ductal epithelial structures in various organs, such as the liver (eg, primary biliary cholangitis [PBC; previously referred to as primary biliary cirrhosis]) and kidney (eg, interstitial nephritis). These are akin to the inflammation occurring in the salivary and lacrimal glands (termed &quot;autoimmune epithelitis&quot; by some authors) and tend to be relatively stable and chronic.</p><p>Other extraglandular manifestations, such as glomerulonephritis and vasculitis, arise from immune-complex deposition. These develop most often in the context of cryoglobulinemia and may have a higher degree of morbidity and mortality compared with the immune response in ductal epithelial structures. Additionally, some manifestations relate to lymphoproliferation, such as lymphocytic interstitial pneumonitis (LIP) and lymphoma. The pathogenesis of other extraglandular manifestations is not well-understood; a prime example is the fatigue that occurs in many patients. The pathogenesis of SS is discussed in more detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pathogenesis-of-sjogrens-syndrome\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pathogenesis of Sj&ouml;gren's syndrome&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">EXTRAGLANDULAR ORGAN INVOLVEMENT</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H53039305\"><span class=\"h2\">Disease spectrum</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Many organs other than the exocrine glands may be affected in patients with Sj&ouml;gren's syndrome (SS); these include the skin and joints; the lungs, heart, and gastrointestinal tract, including the pancreas and liver; the kidneys, bladder, and gynecologic system; and both the peripheral nervous system (PNS) and central nervous system (CNS) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-of-sjogrens-syndrome-extraglandular-disease/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Additionally, hematologic abnormalities are often present and there is an increased risk of lymphoproliferative disorders. Vascular disease, including cutaneous vasculitis and Raynaud phenomenon, may occur. Some extraglandular manifestations result from SS itself, while others result from comorbid rheumatic or other autoimmune disease. Examples of the latter include autoimmune thyroid disorders and celiac disease. The presence of primary SS in a pregnant woman also has potential implications for the fetus and newborn during gestation and after delivery. (See <a href=\"#H32\" class=\"local\">'Pregnancy'</a> below.)</p><p>The relatively common overlap of SS with other autoimmune diseases may confound the interpretation of its extraglandular manifestations, since some organ involvement may not be unique to SS but instead reflects overlap with another autoimmune disorder that may be fully or only partially expressed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-of-sjogrens-syndrome-extraglandular-disease/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. In addition, the presence of an associated rheumatic disease may increase the risk of lymphoma development in SS [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-of-sjogrens-syndrome-extraglandular-disease/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. In some cases (eg, interstitial cystitis, psychiatric symptoms), it is unclear whether abnormalities are related to the SS itself or an associated but separate condition. However, the presence of relatively disease-specific autoantibodies in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA), systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), myositis, and systemic sclerosis (SSc, scleroderma) may help in making these distinctions, particularly when these antibodies are found in SS patients with overlap features of another systemic rheumatic disease.</p><p>A series of different classification criteria has been used to define and characterize SS; thus, different classification criteria have been used in the various studies that describe the frequency with which an area or organ may be affected in SS patients. This has resulted in varying estimates of the frequency and severity of particular clinical manifestations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-of-sjogrens-syndrome-extraglandular-disease/abstract/7,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,8</a>]. Most information cited in this topic review relied upon the 2002 American European Consensus Group (AECG) classification criteria [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-of-sjogrens-syndrome-extraglandular-disease/abstract/9,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,10</a>]. These differed from earlier criteria for SS in their requirement for either anti-SSA <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> anti-SSB antibodies or the finding of focal lymphocytic sialadenitis with a focus score of 1 or higher on a minor salivary gland biopsy (ie, a positive lip biopsy). Thus, publications using the AECG criteria excluded patients who might have dry eyes and dry mouth but lacked both of these other features (serology and histopathology).</p><p>In 2016, a different set of criteria was jointly approved by the American College of Rheumatology (ACR) and European League Against Rheumatism (EULAR) that differed from the AECG criteria in several respects, including the exclusion of subjective ocular or oral dryness and parotid scintigraphy and sialography as criteria. The criteria were specifically validated for primary SS but can be applied to SS in association with other autoimmune diseases pending additional study. The <span class=\"nowrap\">ACR/EULAR</span> criteria maintain the requirement for either positive <span class=\"nowrap\">anti-SSA/SSB</span> serology or a positive lip biopsy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-of-sjogrens-syndrome-extraglandular-disease/abstract/11,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,12</a>].

Xerosis is estimated to occur in 23 to 67 percent of SS patients and is characterized by dry, scaly skin, most often affecting the lower extremities and axillary creases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-of-sjogrens-syndrome-extraglandular-disease/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. It appears linked to a specific alteration in the protective function of the skin's outer layer, the stratum corneum, rather than decreased sebaceous or sweat gland secretion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-of-sjogrens-syndrome-extraglandular-disease/abstract/17,18\" class=\"abstract_t\">17,18</a>].

It typically involves capillaries, arterioles, and venules, which leads to clinical manifestations typical of small-vessel vasculitis. Palpable purpura is the most common sign, but urticarial lesions, macules, papules, and small ulcerated areas may also occur. The lesions are commonly distributed over the lower extremities, but urticarial lesions are occasionally seen over the arms, the trunk, or even the face [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-of-sjogrens-syndrome-extraglandular-disease/abstract/15,26\" class=\"abstract_t\">15,26</a>].

This latter entity is characterized by recurrent purpuric lesions (usually on the lower extremities), an elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), anemia, leukopenia, normal platelet counts, polyclonal hypergammaglobulinemia, and antibodies to the <span class=\"nowrap\">Ro/SSA</span> antigen (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=the-anti-ro-ssa-and-anti-la-ssb-antigen-antibody-systems\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;The anti-Ro/SSA and anti-La/SSB antigen-antibody systems&quot;</a>). It can be primary, especially in young women, and secondary, most frequently in SS, RA, and SLE, and rarely in patients with lymphoma and multiple myeloma. In a study of a large Italian multicenter cohort, stratification of SS patients with hypergammaglobulinemic purpura by the presence or absence of cryoglobulins revealed important clinical and biologic differences; those with cryoglobulins were at increased risk of lymphoma and peripheral nerve and renal involvement [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-of-sjogrens-syndrome-extraglandular-disease/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>].</p><p>The development of cutaneous vasculitis may have important prognostic implications, as such patients are more likely than those lacking vasculitis to develop other extraglandular manifestations, including lymphoma, and to die of disease-related complications [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-of-sjogrens-syndrome-extraglandular-disease/abstract/26,32,33\" class=\"abstract_t\">26,32,33</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14\"><span class=\"h3\">Annular erythema</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A cutaneous eruption characterized as annular erythema, has been described in a minority of patients with SS [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-of-sjogrens-syndrome-extraglandular-disease/abstract/34,35\" class=\"abstract_t\">34,35</a>]. It was described as a manifestation of primary SS in Japanese patients in a number of case reports in the 1980s and 1990s. Reports of this skin lesion in SS were initially rare in Western populations. However, in a 2014 analysis of a Spanish cohort of primary SS, the prevalence of annular erythema was 9 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-of-sjogrens-syndrome-extraglandular-disease/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>]. The annular erythema resembles but may be distinct from subacute cutaneous lupus (SCLE), which may also develop in patients with SS. Annular erythema occurs more commonly in women and in patients with antibodies to <span class=\"nowrap\">Ro/SSA</span> and or <span class=\"nowrap\">La/SSB</span> antigens [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-of-sjogrens-syndrome-extraglandular-disease/abstract/34,35\" class=\"abstract_t\">34,35</a>]. Infrequently, other immunological markers are present.</p><p>Three clinical patterns have been identified: an erythematous elevated indurated ring-like lesion resembling Sweet disease, a marginally scaling polycyclic erythema clinically very similar to SCLE, and an erythematous papular eruption resembling an insect bite reaction. None of these lesions result in scarring or atrophy. The eruption favors the face and neck but can involve the extremities and trunk. Photosensitivity is seen more frequently in non-Asians. Histopathologic findings of annular erythema in SS include a perivascular and or peri-appendageal lymphocytic infiltrate; the patients do not have SLE and lack the specific epidermal changes of SLE [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-of-sjogrens-syndrome-extraglandular-disease/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>].

Reduction of fatigue was the primary outcome measure in a randomized trial of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=rituximab-intravenous-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">rituximab</a> in 17 patients with primary SS [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-of-sjogrens-syndrome-extraglandular-disease/abstract/50\" class=\"abstract_t\">50</a>]; significant improvement from baseline in patient-reported fatigue was observed in the rituximab group in contrast to the placebo group, consistent with the view that fatigue in SS is immune-mediated.

Another cause of fatigue affecting some patients with SS is hypothyroidism.

However, whether thyroid disease has a specific association with SS remains uncertain, with some data suggesting there is no significant association.</p><p>Further support for a relationship comes from reports that the risk of developing SS was significantly increased in women with thyroid disorders in a longitudinal population-based study in Taiwan [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-of-sjogrens-syndrome-extraglandular-disease/abstract/55\" class=\"abstract_t\">55</a>]. Moreover, autoimmune diseases, particularly autoimmune thyroid disease, tend to aggregate in the first-degree relatives of patients with primary SS [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-of-sjogrens-syndrome-extraglandular-disease/abstract/56\" class=\"abstract_t\">56</a>].</p><p>Other observations do not support a link between SS and thyroid disease. As an example, patients with SS, being older and predominantly female, would be expected to have a higher incidence of thyroid disease than the general population. Consistent with this, in a well-designed study that compared 160 patients with primary SS with 75 age- and sex-matched controls from a primary care center, there was no statistically significant difference between the groups in the overall prevalence of thyroid disease or any particular type of thyroid disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-of-sjogrens-syndrome-extraglandular-disease/abstract/57\" class=\"abstract_t\">57</a>]. Similarly, in a case-control study from Turkey, the frequency of thyroid antibodies was not increased in patients with primary SS compared with those with either RA, secondary SS, or healthy controls [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-of-sjogrens-syndrome-extraglandular-disease/abstract/58\" class=\"abstract_t\">58</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H20\"><span class=\"h2\">Lungs</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The airways and interstitium are the primary targets of lung disease in SS [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-of-sjogrens-syndrome-extraglandular-disease/abstract/59-61\" class=\"abstract_t\">59-61</a>]. Approximately 10 to 20 percent of SS patients have clinically significant lung disease defined classically by symptoms and an abnormal pulmonary function test or chest radiograph [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-of-sjogrens-syndrome-extraglandular-disease/abstract/62\" class=\"abstract_t\">62</a>]. However, a far greater number of patients have lung abnormalities detectable with pulmonary function tests, bronchoalveolar lavage, and computed tomography (CT), and some may report cough or dyspnea [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-of-sjogrens-syndrome-extraglandular-disease/abstract/61,62\" class=\"abstract_t\">61,62</a>].

Saliva acts as a buffer for refluxed gastric acid and its deficiency can thus lead to laryngeal damage and symptoms of globus, excessive throat clearing, cough, and hoarseness. Lymphocytic infiltration of the submucosal glands in the nasopharynx, larynx, trachea, and bronchi leads to desiccation of the mucosa of the respiratory tree, alteration in the viscosity of the mucus, and impaired mucociliary clearance, resulting in a persistent dry cough, hoarseness, and nasal dryness and crusting. In cross-sectional studies of SS patients, there is a high frequency of large airway disease, as evidenced by CT scanning and pulmonary function tests [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-of-sjogrens-syndrome-extraglandular-disease/abstract/61\" class=\"abstract_t\">61</a>]. Patients may report dry cough, recurrent bronchitis, and dyspnea. High-resolution CT imaging may show bronchial airway thickening, bronchiectasis, centrilobular nodules, reticular or reticulonodular infiltrates, and air trapping. Pulmonary function studies show varied and usually mild abnormalities, including reductions in maximal expiratory flows at 25 percent of vital capacity (MEF<sub>25</sub>) and a reduced diffusing capacity for carbon monoxide [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-of-sjogrens-syndrome-extraglandular-disease/abstract/62\" class=\"abstract_t\">62</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">The pathologic basis for airway disease in SS has been largely deduced from analysis of lung biopsy material from patients with symptomatic interstitial lung disease. Bronchiolitis is the main airway lesion, including follicular, chronic, and obliterative forms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-of-sjogrens-syndrome-extraglandular-disease/abstract/63,64\" class=\"abstract_t\">63,64</a>]. Follicular bronchiolitis has been specifically linked to connective tissue diseases, such as SS and RA. It is characterized by the formation of hyperplastic lymphoid follicles in the bronchiolar walls leading to obstruction of the bronchiolar lumen [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-of-sjogrens-syndrome-extraglandular-disease/abstract/65\" class=\"abstract_t\">65</a>]. The ensuing submucosal and peribronchial fibrosis can also restrict the lumen. A valve phenomenon may ensue and result in lung cysts or bullae.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Interstitial lung disease</strong> &ndash; Interstitial lung disease in SS has several forms, including non-specific interstitial pneumonitis (NSIP), usual interstitial pneumonitis (UIP), lymphocytic interstitial pneumonitis (LIP), and cryptogenic organizing pneumonia (COP) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-of-sjogrens-syndrome-extraglandular-disease/abstract/66,67\" class=\"abstract_t\">66,67</a>]. Dyspnea and cough are the usual presenting symptoms. NSIP is the most common histopathologic lesion but is a form of lung injury common to a variety of connective tissue diseases and hypersensitivity reactions. LIP has a strong association with primary SS. It is characterized by a lymphoplasmacytic infiltrates within the interstitium, often forming nodular lymphoid aggregates with or without germinal centers, and lymphocytes within alveolar spaces [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-of-sjogrens-syndrome-extraglandular-disease/abstract/68\" class=\"abstract_t\">68</a>]. Follicular bronchiolitis often coexists. Affected patients usually have a polyclonal or monoclonal gammopathy. LIP can be a precursor to a bronchus-associated lymphoid tissue (BALT) lymphoma. These are discussed in more detail elsewhere.

Similarly, the risk of ischemic heart disease was modestly decreased among SS patients, compared with controls, in a cross-sectional study of a large administrative database of inpatient encounters at United States hospitals [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-of-sjogrens-syndrome-extraglandular-disease/abstract/73\" class=\"abstract_t\">73</a>].</p><p>Acute pericarditis and myocarditis are rare complications of primary SS [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-of-sjogrens-syndrome-extraglandular-disease/abstract/74,75\" class=\"abstract_t\">74,75</a>], but echocardiographic evidence of prior pericarditis or left ventricular diastolic dysfunction is more common [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-of-sjogrens-syndrome-extraglandular-disease/abstract/74\" class=\"abstract_t\">74</a>].

However, some patients may have an asymmetric and patchy &quot;non-length-dependent&quot; distribution, not confined to the distal extremities [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-of-sjogrens-syndrome-extraglandular-disease/abstract/110\" class=\"abstract_t\">110</a>]. This may represent a dorsal root ganglionitis affecting small neurons [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-of-sjogrens-syndrome-extraglandular-disease/abstract/111\" class=\"abstract_t\">111</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Painful sensory neuropathies in SS typically have no electrophysiologic findings unless there is a concomitant large fiber neuropathy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-of-sjogrens-syndrome-extraglandular-disease/abstract/112,113\" class=\"abstract_t\">112,113</a>]. Decreased density of epidermal nerve fibers in a skin biopsy is a feature of small fiber neuropathy of various causes, including SS and diabetes mellitus.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Sensory ataxic neuropathy &ndash; Sensory ataxia is characterized by the prominent loss of kinesthesia and proprioception, leading to gait ataxia, pseudoathetosis, and difficulties finding the limbs in space [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-of-sjogrens-syndrome-extraglandular-disease/abstract/114\" class=\"abstract_t\">114</a>]. Generalized areflexia is typically present. Autonomic lesions are frequent, including Adie's pupil (a dilated pupil that is poorly reactive to light but does react slowly to accommodation), fixed tachycardia, anhidrosis, and orthostatic hypotension. Patients with advanced disease may become wheelchair-bound. High-intensity signal is often demonstrated on T2-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the dorsal columns of the spinal cord. This distinctive neuropathy is related to a dorsal root ganglionitis; biopsy specimens of the dorsal root ganglia in affected patients have shown CD8 lymphocytic infiltration, with clustering around neurons [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-of-sjogrens-syndrome-extraglandular-disease/abstract/114\" class=\"abstract_t\">114</a>]. In unselected cohort studies of SS, this form of peripheral neuropathy is the least common, occurring in less than 5 percent of patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-of-sjogrens-syndrome-extraglandular-disease/abstract/115\" class=\"abstract_t\">115</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pure sensory trigeminal neuropathy &ndash; The characteristic feature is numbness or paresthesia restricted to the trigeminal region. Trigeminal nerve dysfunction in SS is caused by damage to the gasserian ganglion. The ophthalmic division is usually spared, thereby preserving the corneal reflex.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Axonal sensorimotor polyneuropathy &ndash; This form of neuropathy has approximately the same frequency as non-ataxic sensory neuropathies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-of-sjogrens-syndrome-extraglandular-disease/abstract/107-109\" class=\"abstract_t\">107-109</a>]. Affected patients initially develop symptoms of a distal sensory neuropathy, with distal paresthesias [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-of-sjogrens-syndrome-extraglandular-disease/abstract/110\" class=\"abstract_t\">110</a>]. There is impairment of light touch and pinprick and diminution or loss of deep tendon reflexes. Muscle weakness, usually mild, primarily affects the toe or foot extensors. Nerve conduction studies show evidence of an axonal polyneuropathy affecting motor and sensory fibers.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Mononeuritis multiplex &ndash; Mononeuritis multiplex (also called multiple mononeuropathy) occurred in 3 percent of 102 primary SS patients in one study [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-of-sjogrens-syndrome-extraglandular-disease/abstract/109\" class=\"abstract_t\">109</a>]. The initial symptom of mononeuritis multiplex is the acute onset of tingling or painful dysesthesia in the distal limbs. Subsequently, motor and sensory symptoms occur episodically and extend to multiple nerve distributions, primarily in the limbs. The sudden onset and mononeuritis multiplex pattern is suggestive of a vasculitic neuropathy. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diagnosis-and-treatment-of-vasculitic-neuropathy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Diagnosis and treatment of vasculitic neuropathy&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Nerve biopsy may be required to confirm the diagnosis of vasculitic neuropathy unless vasculitis is confirmed by biopsy of other involved organs. Biopsy of affected nerves often shows axonal degeneration and a perivascular inflammatory infiltrate, suggesting an underlying vasculitic cause in many cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-of-sjogrens-syndrome-extraglandular-disease/abstract/116\" class=\"abstract_t\">116</a>]. However, lymphocytic neural infiltration without vasculitis has been noted in some patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-of-sjogrens-syndrome-extraglandular-disease/abstract/105\" class=\"abstract_t\">105</a>].

The cranial nerves most commonly affected are VII (Bell palsy); VIII (resulting in neural deafness and vestibular dysfunction); and III, IV, or VI (resulting in diplopia). Hearing may also be affected in a significant proportion of patients, although many cases are subclinical [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-of-sjogrens-syndrome-extraglandular-disease/abstract/117\" class=\"abstract_t\">117</a>]. In a study of 30 SS patients, all subjects underwent systematic evaluations for hearing loss [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-of-sjogrens-syndrome-extraglandular-disease/abstract/118\" class=\"abstract_t\">118</a>]. Fourteen (46 percent) had sensorineural hearing loss on audiometric testing, compared with only 2.5 percent of the controls. Five of the 14 SS patients had clinically apparent hearing loss.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Radiculoneuropathy &ndash; This rare disorder is characterized by sensorimotor dysfunction with both progressive sensory impairment and muscle weakness. The primary lesion in these patients appears to be in the spinal nerve roots or in the most proximal nerve trunks, consistent with an inflammatory radiculoneuropathy. The cerebrospinal fluid protein concentration is usually elevated, but pleocytosis is absent.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Autonomic neuropathy &ndash; The prevalence of autonomic neuropathy is difficult to estimate. In studies of peripheral neuropathies in SS, it is the rarest form [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-of-sjogrens-syndrome-extraglandular-disease/abstract/110\" class=\"abstract_t\">110</a>]. However, mild autonomic dysfunction is more common in SS, when evidenced by abnormal cardiovascular reflex testing, delayed gastric emptying, urinary bladder dysfunction, and the quantitative sudomotor axon reflex test [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-of-sjogrens-syndrome-extraglandular-disease/abstract/110\" class=\"abstract_t\">110</a>]. Clinically overt autonomic neuropathies are manifested by severe orthostatic hypotension, hypohidrosis or anhidrosis of the trunk and limbs, abdominal pain, constipation, diarrhea, and Adie's pupils (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diabetic-autonomic-neuropathy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Diabetic autonomic neuropathy&quot;</a>). This form of autonomic neuropathy may occur in association with a sensory ataxic neuropathy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-of-sjogrens-syndrome-extraglandular-disease/abstract/114\" class=\"abstract_t\">114</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Autonomic dysfunction may also contribute to the decreased lacrimation and salivation of the sicca complex.

The pattern is generally one of multifocal recurrent episodes, often separated by long disease-free intervals, resulting in an insidious progressive neurologic deficit [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-of-sjogrens-syndrome-extraglandular-disease/abstract/105\" class=\"abstract_t\">105</a>]. In many patients, the neurologic symptoms precede the onset of other signs and symptoms of SS [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-of-sjogrens-syndrome-extraglandular-disease/abstract/105\" class=\"abstract_t\">105</a>]. The frequency of CNS involvement in SS (CNS-SS) has long been controversial, and estimates vary widely [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-of-sjogrens-syndrome-extraglandular-disease/abstract/119\" class=\"abstract_t\">119</a>]. In some studies, 20 to 25 percent of patients with primary SS had CNS manifestations, ranging from focal central lesions to dementia and conditions that mimic multiple sclerosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-of-sjogrens-syndrome-extraglandular-disease/abstract/120\" class=\"abstract_t\">120</a>]. By contrast, other groups have found a much lower prevalence of CNS-SS [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-of-sjogrens-syndrome-extraglandular-disease/abstract/116,121,122\" class=\"abstract_t\">116,121,122</a>].</p><p>Potential explanations for the apparent discrepancy in prevalence of CNS-SS include referral bias, disagreement about diagnostic criteria, differences in the thoroughness with which CNS-SS is sought, and lack of a standard with which to interpret MRI findings. There is also disagreement regarding whether cerebral white matter lesions on magnetic resonance imaging are more prevalent in patients with SS [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-of-sjogrens-syndrome-extraglandular-disease/abstract/123,124\" class=\"abstract_t\">123,124</a>] and whether they correlate with clinical manifestations of the disease or with age and cerebrovascular risk factors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-of-sjogrens-syndrome-extraglandular-disease/abstract/125\" class=\"abstract_t\">125</a>].</p><p>The range of CNS findings has been defined in several series of primary SS patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-of-sjogrens-syndrome-extraglandular-disease/abstract/105,126,127\" class=\"abstract_t\">105,126,127</a>] and is described below.

In most patients, lymphoproliferation remains confined to the glandular tissue and does not undergo malignant transformation. The transition from SS to lymphoma is a process that requires many years. In two series, the diagnosis of lymphoma occurred at a mean of 6.5 to 7.5 years after the diagnosis of SS [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-of-sjogrens-syndrome-extraglandular-disease/abstract/33,151\" class=\"abstract_t\">33,151</a>].</p><p>The mechanisms by which SS predisposes some patients to develop lymphoma are matters of ongoing study [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-of-sjogrens-syndrome-extraglandular-disease/abstract/155\" class=\"abstract_t\">155</a>]. Extranodal marginal zone lymphoma of mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (also called MALT lymphoma) can arise in the salivary glands from a reactive lymphoid infiltrate called lymphoepithelial sialadenitis or benign lymphoepithelial lesion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-of-sjogrens-syndrome-extraglandular-disease/abstract/163\" class=\"abstract_t\">163</a>]. Clinically, patients with lymphoepithelial sialadenitis have persistent salivary gland enlargement. The distinction between this benign lymphoid proliferation and malignant MALT lymphoma can be difficult and requires integration of findings from histopathologic, immunohistochemical, and flow cytometric analyses of appropriate biopsy material [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-of-sjogrens-syndrome-extraglandular-disease/abstract/164-166\" class=\"abstract_t\">164-166</a>].

The lymphoid infiltrate is initially periductal but then extends peripherally and contains lymphoid follicles with germinal centers. Centrocyte-like B lymphocytes present in a zone beyond the mantle of these follicles focally invade the ductal epithelium. Lymphoepithelial lesions are a characteristic finding within the lymphoid infiltrate and likely represent a later stage of this process. They are comprised of &quot;islands&quot; of hyperplastic ductal epithelium, both invaded and surrounded by centrocyte-like B cells, the latter process leading to a perilesional halo.</p><p>The progression of this pathologic lesion to MALT lymphoma is characterized by the expansion of the population of centrocyte-like B cells to form broad confluent zones around the lymphoepithelial lesions. In more advanced cases, the infiltrating centrocyte-like cells have a monotonous blast-like morphology [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-of-sjogrens-syndrome-extraglandular-disease/abstract/167\" class=\"abstract_t\">167</a>]. There may be soft tissue or perineural invasion and sheets of plasma cells. Monoclonal B-cell populations can be found in both benign and malignant lymphoid proliferation.

Other laboratory findings in patients with extraglandular manifestations of SS depend largely upon the degree of systemic inflammation and specific organ involvement.
