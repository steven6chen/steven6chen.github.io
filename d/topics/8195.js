The Dyck classification developed in the 1970s helped to define specific types based upon clinical and electrophysiologic features [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hereditary-sensory-and-autonomic-neuropathies/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Many of the primary hereditary neuropathies were divided into motor-sensory and sensory-autonomic neuropathies.</p><p>The primary hereditary sensory and autonomic neuropathies are reviewed here. The primary hereditary motor sensory neuropathies and the disorders affecting both the central and peripheral nervous systems are discussed separately.

The major feature of the HSANs is loss of large myelinated and unmyelinated fibers. They have been categorized into multiple types and subtypes, although some children do not fit well into this classification (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F67377\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef67377 \">table 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hereditary-sensory-and-autonomic-neuropathies/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>]. Our understanding of the basic genetic abnormalities in these diseases is substantially less than that of the hereditary motor sensory neuropathies.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">HSAN1</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Hereditary sensory and autonomic neuropathy type I (also known as hereditary sensory neuropathy type I and hereditary sensory radicular neuropathy) is the most common form of HSAN [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hereditary-sensory-and-autonomic-neuropathies/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. It is characterized by progressive degeneration of dorsal root ganglion and motor neurons, leading to distal sensory loss and later distal muscle wasting and weakness and variable neural deafness [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hereditary-sensory-and-autonomic-neuropathies/abstract/4,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,5</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Genetics</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>HSAN1 is genetically heterogeneous. Most cases show autosomal dominant inheritance. At least five genes have been implicated in the disorder [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hereditary-sensory-and-autonomic-neuropathies/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>HSAN1A is associated with several missense mutations in the SPTLC1 gene on chromosome 9q22.31 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hereditary-sensory-and-autonomic-neuropathies/abstract/7-9\" class=\"abstract_t\">7-9</a>]. The gene encodes for serine palmitoyltransferase, long-chain base subunit-1, which is involved in the synthesis of sphingolipids. Mutations in this gene are associated with the accumulation of neurotoxic sphingolipid metabolites [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hereditary-sensory-and-autonomic-neuropathies/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>HSAN1B, reported in a small number of families, is linked to chromosome location 3p24-p22 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hereditary-sensory-and-autonomic-neuropathies/abstract/11,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,12</a>]. The clinical features include adult onset of cough, gastroesophageal reflux, and axonal neuropathy with distal sensory impairment.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>HSAN1C is caused by missense mutations in the SPTLC2 gene on chromosome 14q24 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hereditary-sensory-and-autonomic-neuropathies/abstract/13,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,14</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>HSN1D is caused by mutations in the ATL1 gene on chromosome 14q [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hereditary-sensory-and-autonomic-neuropathies/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. The same gene is implicated as the cause of early-onset hereditary spastic paraplegia 3A [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hereditary-sensory-and-autonomic-neuropathies/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>HSN1E is caused by mutations in the DNMT1 gene on chromosome 19p13.2 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hereditary-sensory-and-autonomic-neuropathies/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. Onset occurs early in adulthood and is characterized by the triad of progressive dementia, hearing loss, and distal sensory neuropathy. Variable manifestations include myoclonic seizures, sleep disorders, narcolepsy, auditory or visual hallucinations, and renal failure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hereditary-sensory-and-autonomic-neuropathies/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>HSN1F is caused by mutations in the ATL3 gene [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hereditary-sensory-and-autonomic-neuropathies/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. The disorder predominantly affects the lower limbs. Distal sensory impairment becomes apparent by the third decade of life, resulting in painless ulceration of the feet with poor healing. This can progress to osteomyelitis, bone destruction, and amputation. </p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Clinical features</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Symptom onset is usually during early adulthood, but ranges from early childhood until late adulthood. The core clinical features of HSAN1 are prominent sensory loss and a variable involvement of autonomic and motor systems. Sensory loss or sharp, brief leg pain typically is the initial symptom, followed by the development of motor weakness and foot ulcers caused by reduced sensation in the legs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hereditary-sensory-and-autonomic-neuropathies/abstract/20,21\" class=\"abstract_t\">20,21</a>]. Complete sensation is lost with time, with the exception of facial sensation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hereditary-sensory-and-autonomic-neuropathies/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. Involvement of the thinly myelinated A-delta and unmyelinated C-nerve fibers results in abnormal quantitative psychophysical testing to warm, cold, and pain sensation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hereditary-sensory-and-autonomic-neuropathies/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Motor findings, including pes cavus, peroneal muscle atrophy, and loss of reflexes, may be present, and bone necrosis and spontaneous distal amputation can occur [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hereditary-sensory-and-autonomic-neuropathies/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>].</p><p>In detailed characterizations of families with SPTLC1 mutations, the following observations have been made [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hereditary-sensory-and-autonomic-neuropathies/abstract/5,21\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,21</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The mean age of onset was 29 years, but ranged from age 12 to 70. One individual at age 89 was unaffected. There was a statistically nonsignificant tendency for females compared with males to have a later mean age of onset (39 versus 25 years); females also tended to have less severe disease. There was considerable heterogeneity both within and between families regarding the clinical and electrophysiologic findings.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The most frequent presenting feature was decreased sensation in the feet. Limb pain, painless blisters, and foot ulcers were also common, as was severe shooting or burning limb pain. Symptom onset tended to follow a predictable sequence, beginning with sensory symptoms, and followed by weakness, ulcers, pain, and balance problems.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Sensory involvement was typically dissociated, with pain and temperature affected first and most severely, and light touch affected to a lesser degree. Vibration and joint position sense were affected later and much less than superficial sensation.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Motor signs were more severe than expected from the earlier descriptions of HSAN1, and autonomic symptoms scant. Severe and often early motor signs were seen in most of the affected family members. The proximal and distal weakness and wasting was the most prominent feature of the disease in some patients, leading in some to a misdiagnosis of Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=charcot-marie-tooth-disease-genetics-clinical-features-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease: Genetics, clinical features, and diagnosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Nerve conduction studies most frequently showed an axonal motor and sensory peripheral neuropathy; sensory potentials were usually absent in the lower limbs but were often present and in some cases normal in the upper limbs. Motor conduction showed great variability, with velocities ranging from normal (&ge;50 <span class=\"nowrap\">m/s)</span> through intermediate slowing (35 to 50 <span class=\"nowrap\">m/s)</span> to unequivocal slowing in the demyelinating range (&le;35 <span class=\"nowrap\">m/s)</span>. Conduction slowing, conduction block, and motor dispersion (all suggestive of demyelination) were seen in several subjects.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Needle electromyography of distal limb muscles showed moderate to severe chronic denervation.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Sural nerve biopsy and postmortem examination showed significant loss of myelinated axons, but there was scant evidence of demyelination. The dorsal spinal roots were mildly fibrotic while ventral roots were relatively well preserved.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Skin biopsies in adults showed loss of epidermal innervation at the distal leg with relative preservation at the thigh.</p><p/><p>To summarize, the electrophysiologic studies showed a predominately axonal and sensory peripheral neuropathy, but a significant motor neuropathy was also present in most patients, and a minority had conduction studies suggestive of demyelination. Given the lack of significant demyelination on biopsy and postmortem samples, the authors speculated that abnormal axonal function and altered excitability rather than a defect of myelin itself may have been responsible for the motor slowing seen in these patients.</p><p>Thus, the diagnosis of HSAN1 secondary to SPTLC1 mutations should be considered in patients with a motor and sensory neuropathy, even in the presence of demyelinating features, particularly if there is marked sensory involvement and a family history [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hereditary-sensory-and-autonomic-neuropathies/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H535107360\"><span class=\"h2\">Management of HSAN1</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>No specific treatment exists for HSAN1. Management requires meticulous care of the distal limbs, which includes proper fit of shoes, prevention and treatment of callus formation, cleaning and protection of wounds, and avoidance of trauma to the hands and feet [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hereditary-sensory-and-autonomic-neuropathies/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. Chronic ulcerations and infections can lead to osteomyelitis and the need for surgical amputation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hereditary-sensory-and-autonomic-neuropathies/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. Ankle-foot orthotics are used for foot drop and arthrodesis for Charcot arthropathy.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H25769873\"><span class=\"h2\">Experimental therapy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The hypothesis that HSAN1 is caused by the accumulation of neurotoxic sphingolipid metabolites suggests that interventions aimed at reducing the level of toxic metabolites may be beneficial. The SPTLC1 mutations that cause HSAN1 are associated with reduced activity of the enzyme serine palmitoyltransferase, which catalyzes the condensation of L-serine and palmitoyl-CoA [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hereditary-sensory-and-autonomic-neuropathies/abstract/10,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,13</a>]. In addition, SPTLC1 mutations result in reduced substrate specificity such that L-alanine and L-glycine are also condensed with palmitoyl-CoA [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hereditary-sensory-and-autonomic-neuropathies/abstract/10,26\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,26</a>], theoretically leading to formation of neurotoxic deoxysphingolipids.</p><p>One proposed intervention involves dietary supplementation with oral L-serine. In a mouse model of HSAN1, SPTLC1 mutant mice placed on an L-serine enriched dieted demonstrated reduced deoxysphingolipid levels and improved performance on measures of motor and sensory neuropathy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hereditary-sensory-and-autonomic-neuropathies/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. In addition, 14 patients with HSAN1 who received L-serine supplementation for 10 weeks showed reduced deoxysphingolipid levels. The study did not evaluate for any improvement in neurologic symptoms. A trial is ongoing to determine whether L-serine therapy is clinically safe and effective as a treatment for HSAN1 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hereditary-sensory-and-autonomic-neuropathies/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h1\">HSAN2</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The symptoms in hereditary sensory and autonomic neuropathy type 2 (HSAN2) are caused also by loss of pain, temperature, pressure, and touch sensation with large and small fiber sensory involvement [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hereditary-sensory-and-autonomic-neuropathies/abstract/1,29\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,29</a>]. Fractures and recurrent infections of the digits occur in early childhood, and mutilation of the fingers and toes occurs as the disease progresses. A stable, nonprogressive congenital form also has been recognized [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hereditary-sensory-and-autonomic-neuropathies/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>].</p><p>Sensory nerve action potentials are unobtainable with nerve conduction studies, while motor conduction velocity is only mildly slowed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hereditary-sensory-and-autonomic-neuropathies/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]. Sural nerve biopsy shows a marked decrease or absence of large and small myelinated fibers but only slight reduction of unmyelinated fibers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hereditary-sensory-and-autonomic-neuropathies/abstract/29,32,33\" class=\"abstract_t\">29,32,33</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Genetics</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>HSAN2 is transmitted as an autosomal recessive trait [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hereditary-sensory-and-autonomic-neuropathies/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. Subtypes with different genetic origins have been described.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>HSAN2A is caused by mutations in HSN2 gene, which is specific to the nervous system and located within exon 8 of the WNK1 gene on chromosome 12p13.33 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hereditary-sensory-and-autonomic-neuropathies/abstract/34,35\" class=\"abstract_t\">34,35</a>]. This complex is referred to as the <span class=\"nowrap\">WNK1/HSN2</span> isoform. The apparently higher prevalence of HSAN2 in French Canadians may be due to the presence of two distinct founder mutations in the HSN2 gene [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hereditary-sensory-and-autonomic-neuropathies/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>HSAN2B is caused by loss-of-function mutations in the FAM134B gene on chromosome 5p15.1 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hereditary-sensory-and-autonomic-neuropathies/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>]. The phenotype of HSAN2B is similar to the progressive form of HSAN2A.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>HSAN2C is caused by mutations in the KIF1A gene on chromosome 2q37.3 that encodes for a kinesin family protein involved in axonal transport of synaptic vesicles [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hereditary-sensory-and-autonomic-neuropathies/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>]. The protein also interacts with the domain encoded by the HSN2 exon of the neuron-specific <span class=\"nowrap\">WNK1/HSN2</span> isoform. A mutation in the KIF1A gene is implicated as the cause of hereditary spastic paraplegia 30 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hereditary-sensory-and-autonomic-neuropathies/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>HSAN2D is caused by a loss-of-function mutation in the SCN9A gene [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hereditary-sensory-and-autonomic-neuropathies/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>]. The phenotype involves congenital or adolescent onset with loss of pain and temperature sensation, autonomic dysfunction, hearing loss, and hyposmia. Loss-of-function SCN9A mutations are also linked to channelopathy-associated insensitivity to pain [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hereditary-sensory-and-autonomic-neuropathies/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>].
