Ideally, good glycemic control is achieved before conception and maintained through the postpartum period.</p><p>The medical management of pregestational diabetes mellitus during pregnancy will be discussed here.

SMBG enables timely treatment of hyperglycemia and hypoglycemia through adjustments of diet and insulin therapy while A1C provides a laboratory-based method for assessing the patient's mean blood glucose level over recent weeks for comparison with SMBG records.</p><p>Glycemic control can be monitored by SMBG or continuous glucose monitoring (CGM), which is then reviewed by providers during ambulatory or telemedicine visits. In a 2014 systematic review of these methods for monitoring blood glucose levels during pregnancy in women with pre-existing diabetes, no method was superior, although available data were inadequate to allow a clear conclusion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pregestational-diabetes-mellitus-glycemic-control-during-pregnancy/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. </p><p>Subsequent to this review, data from a large trial of CGM in pregnant women with type 1 diabetes were published. The multicenter CONCEPTT Collaborative Group ran parallel randomized, open label trials in which 325 women with type 1 diabetes receiving intensive insulin therapy were randomly assigned to either CGM plus capillary glucose monitoring or capillary glucose monitoring alone [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pregestational-diabetes-mellitus-glycemic-control-during-pregnancy/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. One trial enrolled women at &le;13 weeks 6 days of gestation (n = 215) and the second trial enrolled women planning pregnancy (n = 110) Both groups were stratified by insulin delivery schedule, ie, multiple daily injections or continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion (insulin pump). Major findings were:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In women planning pregnancy, the CGM and control groups had similar outcomes, including change in A1C at conception or at 24 weeks follow-up if not pregnant, A1C at pregnancy confirmation, and percentage achieving target A1C &le;7.0 percent (53 <span class=\"nowrap\">mmol/mol)</span> before pregnancy</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In pregnant women, CGM resulted in better glycemic outcomes, which were associated with some better newborn outcomes:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Glycemic control &ndash; Compared with the control group, CGM users achieved a greater reduction in A1C at 34 weeks (6.35 versus 6.53 percent, mean difference -0.19 percent, 95% CI -0.34 to -0.03), spent more time in the glucose target range of 63 to 140 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> ([3.5 to 7.8 <span class=\"nowrap\">mmol/L]</span> 68 versus 61 percent), and spent less time above the target glucose range, with similar rates of maternal hypoglycemia. Over 50 percent of women in both groups achieved A1C &le;6.5 percent (48 <span class=\"nowrap\">mmol/mol)</span> at 34 weeks (66 versus 52 percent).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Neonatal outcomes &ndash; Fewer newborns in the CGM group were treated for hypoglycemia with intravenous glucose (15 versus 28 percent). Mean birth weight was nearly identical in both groups and about 25 percent of infants in both groups were macrosomic (&ge;4000 g). The prevalence of large for gestational age (LGA) was high in both groups, although fewer newborns in the CGM group were LGA (53 versus 69 percent).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Pregnancy outcomes &ndash; CGM users had similar rates of miscarriage, hypertensive disorders, preeclampsia, cesarean delivery, and preterm delivery as the control group. The incidence of preterm birth &lt;37 weeks was unusually high (about 40 percent) since over 60 percent of women had uncomplicated diabetes.</p><p/><p>Because treatment was not blinded to either patients or providers, several of the neonatal outcomes that were significantly different between groups may have been influenced by provider prejudice or expectation regarding treatment group assignment. These outcomes included those dependent on provider discretion, such as initiation of IV glucose for hypoglycemia, length of stay, and high level of neonatal care. Approximately 80 percent of the study participants had some post-secondary (college) education. These women, and likely their degree of compliance with monitoring, may not be representative of the general obstetric population.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3995393\"><span class=\"h3\">Timing/frequency</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>We suggest monitoring blood glucose levels daily at the following times:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>All patients:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span><strong>Fasting</strong>.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span><strong>Preprandial <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> postprandial (one or two hours after the first bite of each meal)</strong> &ndash; High preprandial and high postprandial glucose levels have been correlated with excessive fetal size [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pregestational-diabetes-mellitus-glycemic-control-during-pregnancy/abstract/3-5\" class=\"abstract_t\">3-5</a>]; it is unclear whether monitoring glucose levels both before and after meals is superior to monitoring at one or the other time point [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pregestational-diabetes-mellitus-glycemic-control-during-pregnancy/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].

This target is achievable in most patients. As pregnancy progresses, &lt;6 percent (42 <span class=\"nowrap\">mmol/mol)</span> is advised to reduce to reduce risks of large for gestational age infants and preeclampsia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pregestational-diabetes-mellitus-glycemic-control-during-pregnancy/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>], if safely achievable without causing frequent or severe episodes of hypoglycemia that interfere with daily life [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pregestational-diabetes-mellitus-glycemic-control-during-pregnancy/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].

More frequent monitoring with timely detection of higher than expected results enables timely correction of unsuspected dietary and insulin issues.</p><p>The optimum frequency of A1C monitoring in pregnancy is unclear. A1C is generally checked two to four times per year in nonpregnant women, but the frequency is sometimes increased in pregnancy because of the alteration in red blood cell kinetics and physiological changes in glycemic parameters. ACOG guidelines recommend measuring A1C at least in each trimester, beginning at the initial prenatal visit [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pregestational-diabetes-mellitus-glycemic-control-during-pregnancy/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>].

Testing for ketonuria should also be performed during periods of illness or stress or if there are symptoms compatible with ketoacidosis such as nausea, vomiting, and abdominal pain. In some countries, meters are available to measure capillary blood beta-hydroxybutyrate directly.

Additional insulin can be prescribed to prevent diabetic ketoacidosis, which is both a medical and an obstetric emergency because it is associated with risks to both the mother and the fetus (eg, demise, developmental delay in childhood). Diabetic ketoacidosis is diagnosed when the triad of hyperglycemia, anion gap metabolic acidosis, and ketonemia is present. The most common precipitating factors are infection and discontinuation or inadequate insulin therapy.

Ketonuria can be corrected by increased caloric intake, particularly increased carbohydrates matched to insulin dose adjustments. Ketonemia is not present when ketonuria occurs in this setting.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3118923754\"><span class=\"h1\">RISKS OF STRICT GLYCEMIC CONTROL</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2950194361\"><span class=\"h2\">Hypoglycemia</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Normoglycemia during pregnancy reduces the frequency of maternal, obstetric, and neonatal complications; however, hypoglycemia is more common when normoglycemia is the therapeutic goal. On a case-by-case basis, providers should balance the potential improvement in some pregnancy outcomes with an A1C target &lt;6.0 percent (lower rates of preeclampsia and large for gestational age infants) against the higher risk for hypoglycemia at this target compared with an A1C target &lt;6.5 or &lt;7.0 percent.

Dosing is continuously adjusted based on self-monitoring of blood glucose and A1C values.

As an example, a systematic review including six randomized trials that compared use of multiple daily insulin (MDI) with CSII in pregnant women found no significant differences between groups in glycemic control or pregnancy outcome [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pregestational-diabetes-mellitus-glycemic-control-during-pregnancy/abstract/66\" class=\"abstract_t\">66</a>]. Outcomes evaluated included third trimester A1C; frequency of maternal and neonatal hypoglycemia; and the rates of preterm birth, cesarean delivery, stillbirth, and large or small for gestational age infants. The risk of acidosis with CSII after accidental catheter disconnection is potentially hazardous to mother and fetus, and gestational weight gain may be higher with CSII. Thus, we feel there is inadequate evidence for recommending CSII over MDI.</p><p>In general, if a woman is using CSII effectively prepregnancy, there is no need to discontinue this approach. However, even women with good glycemic control can expect a threefold increase in insulin requirements from preconception to 36 weeks of gestation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pregestational-diabetes-mellitus-glycemic-control-during-pregnancy/abstract/68\" class=\"abstract_t\">68</a>].</p><p>We do not generally start women on insulin pumps during pregnancy because they have not been proven to provide superior pregnancy outcomes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pregestational-diabetes-mellitus-glycemic-control-during-pregnancy/abstract/66\" class=\"abstract_t\">66</a>], catheters are difficult to manage with the gravid abdomen, and cost is high. Most pregnant women require at least two to three basal infusion rates in a 24-hour period, in particular an increased rate in the early morning hours (5 to 9 AM) to counteract the increased release of the anti-insulin hormones cortisol and growth hormone. Nonetheless, some women prefer this approach to facilitate the management of the intensive insulin requirements during pregnancy. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H681701697\"><span class=\"h5\">Types of insulin pumps</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion (CSII) pumps may be used with intermittent manual SMBG or in conjunction with a continuous glucose monitoring device (sensor-augmented insulin pump). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-blood-glucose-in-adults-with-type-1-diabetes-mellitus#H12\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of blood glucose in adults with type 1 diabetes mellitus&quot;, section on 'Continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion (insulin pump)'</a>.)</p><p>A proof of principle trial found that use of a partially automated closed-loop insulin pump safely achieved good glycemic control in pregnant women with type 1 diabetes. In this trial, 16 pregnant women at 14&plusmn;3 weeks of gestation were randomly assigned to a four week period using a CSII pump and a continuous glucose sensor with (group A) or without (group B) a tablet computer whose software &quot;closed the loop&quot; to automatically adjust the pump's basal insulin rate at night [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pregestational-diabetes-mellitus-glycemic-control-during-pregnancy/abstract/69\" class=\"abstract_t\">69</a>]. After four weeks, they were switched to the other treatment group. Both groups manually administered insulin boluses before meals. Closed loop therapy resulted in a higher percentage of time in the designated euglycemic range (63 to 140 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> [3.5 to 7.8 <span class=\"nowrap\">mmol/L])</span> than open loop therapy (74.7 versus 59.5 percent) and overnight mean blood glucose was lower (119 versus 133 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> [6.6 versus 7.4 <span class=\"nowrap\">mmol/L]),</span> with no differences between groups in incidence of hypoglycemia. &#160;</p><p>At the end of the initial eight week trial, 14 participants continued to use the closed loop system around the clock for up to 14.6 additional weeks, including time in labor and delivery. Glucose levels were in the target range 68.7 percent of the time, with a mean glucose level of 126 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> (7.0 <span class=\"nowrap\">mmol/L)</span>. However, there was no clear benefit in pregnancy outcome as 13 of the 16 infants in the entire cohort had a birth weight &gt;90<sup>th</sup> percentile. This technology is not readily available and its role in pregnancy remains unclear. Larger trials with more prolonged duration of the intervention are needed to better assess its efficacy.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3312813902\"><span class=\"h3\">Implications of a fall in insulin requirements</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Insulin requirements sometimes fall after 35 weeks of gestation. This is observed more often in women with type 1 diabetes than in women with gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) and in women with longer durations of type 1 diabetes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pregestational-diabetes-mellitus-glycemic-control-during-pregnancy/abstract/51,70-72\" class=\"abstract_t\">51,70-72</a>].</p><p>A fall in insulin dose greater than 5 to 10 percent should prompt assessment of fetal well-being and a search for medical conditions or other factors that could account for the drop. Decreasing insulin requirements, specifically &ge;15 percent, are weakly associated with placental insufficiency, as well as decreased maternal intake or vomiting [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pregestational-diabetes-mellitus-glycemic-control-during-pregnancy/abstract/73,74\" class=\"abstract_t\">73,74</a>]. If fetal well-being is confirmed, then a fall in insulin requirement is not associated with adverse fetal outcome and is not an indication for delivery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pregestational-diabetes-mellitus-glycemic-control-during-pregnancy/abstract/75\" class=\"abstract_t\">75</a>].

The reduced need for insulin may be related to increased fetal demand for maternal glucose, increased maternal sensitivity to insulin in the fasting state, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> a decrease in human chorionic somatomammotropin (formerly human placental lactogen), which has been observed in women with GDM [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pregestational-diabetes-mellitus-glycemic-control-during-pregnancy/abstract/32,51,71,77,78\" class=\"abstract_t\">32,51,71,77,78</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14\"><span class=\"h2\">Oral anti-hyperglycemic agents</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In nonpregnant women with type 2 diabetes, use of oral anti-hyperglycemic agents (OHAs) is common (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=initial-management-of-blood-glucose-in-adults-with-type-2-diabetes-mellitus\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Initial management of blood glucose in adults with type 2 diabetes mellitus&quot;</a>). In pregnancy, however, the American Diabetes Association consensus statement advises discontinuation of these agents prior to pregnancy but cautions against doing so in the first trimester since metabolic control may be disrupted during the transition [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pregestational-diabetes-mellitus-glycemic-control-during-pregnancy/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>]. They recommend initiation of insulin therapy as soon as possible thereafter due to concerns about the ability of OHAs to provide adequate glycemic control throughout pregnancy and the implications of transplacental passage causing potential fetal and neonatal effects. The American Diabetes Association considers insulin the preferred agent for management of pregestational diabetes in pregnancy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pregestational-diabetes-mellitus-glycemic-control-during-pregnancy/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. Additionally, the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists recommends insulin therapy and states that use of oral agents for control of type 2 diabetes mellitus during pregnancy should be limited and individualized until more data confirming safety and efficacy become available [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pregestational-diabetes-mellitus-glycemic-control-during-pregnancy/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>].</p><p>Whether OHAs should be considered in pregnant women with type 2 diabetes who are not compliant with, or do not want to take, insulin injections remains to be determined [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pregestational-diabetes-mellitus-glycemic-control-during-pregnancy/abstract/79\" class=\"abstract_t\">79</a>]. Although it has been suggested that the use of OHAs may lead to improved glycemic control compared with insulin therapy because of better compliance, this hypothesis has not been tested clinically nor has there been a trial in pregnant women with type 2 diabetes.
