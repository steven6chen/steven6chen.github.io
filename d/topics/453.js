ALD consists of a spectrum of phenotypes (including adrenomyeloneuropathy [AMN]) that vary in the age and severity of clinical presentation (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F70311\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef70311 \">table 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/adrenoleukodystrophy/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>].

(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=peroxisomal-disorders\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Peroxisomal disorders&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">EPIDEMIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>ALD is the most common peroxisomal disorder [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/adrenoleukodystrophy/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. In a report that included data from the two laboratories that perform most of the assays for the disorder, the minimum frequency in the United States was estimated at 1 in 21,000 and 1 in 16,800 for hemizygotes and hemizygotes plus heterozygotes, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/adrenoleukodystrophy/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">GENETICS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>ALD is an X-linked disorder. It is caused by mutations in the adenosine triphosphate (ATP)-binding cassette (ABC), subfamily D, member 1 gene (<a href=\"http://www.omim.org/entry/300371&amp;token=G+kOOgscg7PQzd0gXq5S95p5YXBzP3lIaYBBBbQVxGq6Ed+JSG6CooYoBTv57sbf&amp;TOPIC_ID=6200\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">ABCD1 gene</a>), located at Xq28, that encodes an ABC transporter, similar to cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/adrenoleukodystrophy/abstract/5-9\" class=\"abstract_t\">5-9</a>]. The ABC transporter helps form the channel through which very long chain fatty acids move into the peroxisome, probably as coenzyme A (CoA)-esters [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/adrenoleukodystrophy/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. The phenotype does not correlate with the type of mutation.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h1\">PATHOGENESIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span><em>ABCD1</em> mutations may prevent normal transport of very long chain fatty acids (VLCFAs) into peroxisomes, thereby preventing beta-oxidation and breakdown of VLCFAs. Accumulation of abnormal VLCFAs in affected organs (central nervous system [CNS], Leydig cells of the testes, and the adrenal cortex) is presumed to underlie the pathologic process of the adrenoleukodystrophies (ALD) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/adrenoleukodystrophy/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. However, plasma VLCFA levels do not predict phenotype and cell-specific functions of <em>ABCD1</em> may play a role in the pathogenesis independent of VLCFA [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/adrenoleukodystrophy/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>].</p><p>The distribution of the adrenoleukodystrophy protein (ALDP) maps to regions of high metabolic activity (heart, skeletal muscle, and liver) and to critical neural regions, including subcortical and cerebellar white matter, hypothalamus, adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH)-producing cells in the pituitary, and dorsal root ganglia (DRG). Of interest, the DRG undergo atrophy in adrenomyeloneuropathy (AMN). Remarkably, ALDP is scarcely present in the corticospinal tract and corpus callosum [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/adrenoleukodystrophy/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>].</p><p>Pathology in the CNS is characterized by diverse immune responses involving cellular and humoral mechanisms as well as cytokines and complement [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/adrenoleukodystrophy/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. A case series of three males with X-linked ALD and two with X-linked AMN cites head trauma as the initiating feature in the cerebral neuropathology and a possible mechanism for the associated immune response [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/adrenoleukodystrophy/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. The profound mononuclear response is distinct from that seen in multiple sclerosis and is characterized by microglial activation followed by apoptosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/adrenoleukodystrophy/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. In addition, evidence of oxidative stress and damage (lipid peroxidation) is present [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/adrenoleukodystrophy/abstract/17,18\" class=\"abstract_t\">17,18</a>]. However, mitochondrial dysfunction was not noted in muscle or brain from individuals with ALD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/adrenoleukodystrophy/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. Alternatively, it is possible that VLCFA toxicity leads to mitochondrial dysfunction and abnormal calcium regulation, as suggested by in vitro studies in neurons and glia from rat brain [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/adrenoleukodystrophy/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. Interestingly, in vitro changes in blood-brain barrier permeability due to lack of <em>ABCD1</em> occur prior to elevations in VLCFA [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/adrenoleukodystrophy/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>].</p><p>In the adrenal gland, abnormal VLCFAs may directly alter cellular function by inhibiting the effects of ACTH on the adrenocortical cells, or indirectly by initiating an autoimmune response. In almost all instances, adrenocortical failure occurs along with irreversible degenerative neurologic defects. Adrenal failure may predate, occur simultaneously with, or follow the onset of the neurologic deterioration.</p><p>Comparison of this pathophysiology to that of other peroxisomal disorders is discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=peroxisomal-disorders\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Peroxisomal disorders&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h1\">NEUROPATHOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In the central nervous system (CNS), ALD is characterized by inflammatory demyelination, resulting in confluent and bilaterally symmetric loss of myelin in the cerebral and cerebellar white matter [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/adrenoleukodystrophy/abstract/21,22\" class=\"abstract_t\">21,22</a>]. The occipitoparietal regions are usually affected first, with asymmetric progression of the lesions toward the frontal or temporal lobes. In general, arcuate fibers are spared, except in chronic cases. Axonal loss may be considerable, but myelin loss is usually greater. Lesions may sometimes involve the brainstem, especially the pons. The spinal cord is usually spared, except for bilateral corticospinal tract degeneration.</p><p>When peripheral nerves are affected in ALD, characteristic lamellar and lamellar-lipid inclusions are seen in Schwann cell cytoplasm or within endoneurial macrophages. CNS macrophages, but not oligodendrocytes, may also have inclusions. Spicular or trilaminar inclusions may also occur in the CNS.</p><p>The inflammatory demyelination in ALD appears to occur in the following specific sequence [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/adrenoleukodystrophy/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Enlargement of the extraneural space</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Vacuolization and myelin swelling with reactive astrocytes and macrophage infiltration</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Perivascular lymphocytic and increased permeability of the blood brain barrier</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Loss of myelin with lipophage formation</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Loss of oligodendroglia and axons</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Dystrophic mineralization</p><p/><p>The lymphocytes in acute demyelinative lesions of patients with childhood cerebral X-linked ALD are mainly CD8 cytotoxic T cells. There is cytolysis of oligodendrocytes. In addition, CD1 molecules have been noted, suggesting that CD1-mediated lipid antigen presentation may occur with very long chain fatty acids (VLCFA)-containing lipids, such as gangliosides or proteolipids, acting as antigens [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/adrenoleukodystrophy/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. In vitro studies suggest that the VLCFA accumulation that occurs in the absence of <em>ABDC1</em> function promotes inflammation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/adrenoleukodystrophy/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. However, most studies that suggest that VLCFAs are toxic employ supraphysiologic doses in vitro or in vivo that are never encountered in humans with ALD.</p><p>In adrenomyeloneuropathy, both inflammatory and noninflammatory demyelination lesions occur [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/adrenoleukodystrophy/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. Affected individuals also develop a degenerative axonopathy that involves the ascending and descending tracts of the spinal cord, especially in fasciculus gracilis and the lateral corticospinal tracts. The histologic pattern is Wallerian degeneration [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/adrenoleukodystrophy/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. Mitochondrial pathology [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/adrenoleukodystrophy/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>] and oxidative stress [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/adrenoleukodystrophy/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>] also contribute to pathogenesis.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL FEATURES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Abnormalities primarily affect the central nervous system (CNS), adrenal cortex, and Leydig cells in the testes.

This is followed by neurologic deterioration that includes increasing cognitive and behavioral abnormalities, blindness, and the development of quadriparesis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/adrenoleukodystrophy/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. Approximately 20 percent of affected boys have seizures, which may be the first manifestation in some.

AMN may also present as a progressive cerebellar disorder.</p><p>Physiologic and radiologic (magnetic resonance fractional anisotropy) assessments confirmed the presence of sensorimotor abnormalities in the dorsal columns extending into the brainstem, and correlated with overall severity in AMN [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/adrenoleukodystrophy/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]. Auditory brainstem evoked responses correlated more with AMN than ALD, while auditory function was generally normal [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/adrenoleukodystrophy/abstract/32,33\" class=\"abstract_t\">32,33</a>].

The diagnostic approach is as follows:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In males, the very long chain fatty acid (VLCFA) panel is highly sensitive for detecting <span class=\"nowrap\">ALD/adrenomyeloneuropathy</span> (AMN), and is the appropriate first step in the diagnosis. If the VLCFA levels are elevated, or if the ratios of VLCFA are abnormal, genetic testing should be performed to confirm the diagnosis.

It is an X-linked genetic disorder, caused by mutations in the <a href=\"http://www.omim.org/entry/300371&amp;token=G+kOOgscg7PQzd0gXq5S95p5YXBzP3lIaYBBBbQVxGq6Ed+JSG6CooYoBTv57sbf&amp;TOPIC_ID=6200\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">ABCD1</a> gene. ALD consists of a spectrum of phenotypes (including adrenomyeloneuropathy [AMN]) that vary in the age and severity of clinical presentation (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F70311\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef70311 \">table 1</a>). Together, these conditions are known as the <span class=\"nowrap\">ALD/AMN</span> complex. (See <a href=\"#H1\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above and <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Genetics'</a> above and <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Pathogenesis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Affected males have one of three main phenotypes and can present from childhood through adulthood (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F70311\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef70311 \">table 1</a>):</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Childhood cerebral forms &ndash; Affected boys typically present between four and eight years of age with learning disabilities and behavior problems, followed by neurologic deterioration that includes increasing cognitive and behavioral abnormalities, blindness, and the development of quadriparesis. Approximately 20 percent of affected individuals have seizures. (See <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'Childhood cerebral forms'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>AMN &ndash; AMN typically presents in adult males between 20 and 40 years of age. The primary manifestation is spinal cord dysfunction with progressive stiffness and weakness of the legs (spastic paraparesis), abnormal sphincter control, neurogenic bladder, and sexual dysfunction. Most individuals have adrenal insufficiency. AMN may also present as a progressive cerebellar disorder. (See <a href=\"#H8\" class=\"local\">'Adrenomyeloneuropathy (AMN)'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Addison disease only phenotype &ndash; Isolated adrenal insufficiency occurs in approximately 10 percent of individuals with ALD. This form presents in males between two years of age and adulthood, but usually before 7.5 years. Most of these individuals go on to develop AMN by mid-adulthood. (See <a href=\"#H9\" class=\"local\">'Addison disease only'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Female carriers often develop myelopathy symptoms during adulthood (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F70311\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef70311 \">table 1</a>). The frequency of symptoms rises from &lt;20 percent in women under 40 years of age to almost 90 percent in women older than 60 years. (See <a href=\"#H11\" class=\"local\">'Female carriers'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Newborn screening for X-linked ALD is available in some areas. If the newborn screen is positive, follow-up confirmation testing should be completed as soon as possible. (See <a href=\"#H3908394196\" class=\"local\">'Newborn screening'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Laboratory testing for ALD begins with measuring VLCFA levels. The plasma concentration of VLCFAs is elevated in nearly all males with the <span class=\"nowrap\">ALD/AMN</span> complex. If elevated VLCFA levels are detected, confirmatory genetic testing is performed. In addition, adrenal function testing should be performed at the time of diagnosis and re-evaluated yearly. (See <a href=\"#H13\" class=\"local\">'Laboratory testing'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>All individuals with confirmed <span class=\"nowrap\">ALD/AMN</span> complex should undergo neuroimaging with brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) at the time of diagnosis. In symptomatic males with forms of ALD other than pure AMN, MRI is always abnormal, demonstrating demyelination in cerebral white matter. By contrast, brain MRI is often normal in patients with AMN. Presymptomatic boys with childhood ALD who initially have normal MRI should undergo follow-up imaging every 6 to 12 months. (See <a href=\"#H14\" class=\"local\">'Neuroimaging'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Treatment options for <span class=\"nowrap\">ALD/AMN</span> are targeted to specific phenotypes (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F70311\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef70311 \">table 1</a>):</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Childhood cerebral ALD (see <a href=\"#H3657245543\" class=\"local\">'Childhood cerebral ALD'</a> above):</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent3\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#45;</span>For most boys with childhood cerebral ALD who are early in their disease course, we suggest allogenic hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) rather than supportive care alone (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). HCT should <strong>not</strong> be undertaken in patients with advanced neurologic disease as it does not appear to improve clinical outcomes in this setting. Similarly, HCT should <strong>not</strong> be undertaken in presymptomatic boys who lack MRI evidence of cerebral involvement because approximately half of this group will remain free of neurological disease. (See <a href=\"#H18\" class=\"local\">'Hematopoietic cell transplantation'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent3\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#45;</span>Gene therapy may be an option for boys with early cerebral ALD who do not have a matched related donor for allogenic HCT.

The available data on HCT in this setting are extremely limited. As is the case with childhood ALD, adult patients with advanced neurologic disease are generally not considered candidates for HCT.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent3\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#45;</span>Pure AMN &ndash; AMN without cerebral involvement does not appear to benefit from HCT. Treatment of these patients is supportive and is similar to other types of myelopathy. Interventions are aimed at preventing and treating complications of spinal cord disease (eg, spasticity, bladder dysfunction, sexual dysfunction, pressure ulcers). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=chronic-complications-of-spinal-cord-injury-and-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Chronic complications of spinal cord injury and disease&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Adrenal insufficiency &ndash; Individuals with adrenal insufficiency, with or without other manifestations of ALD or AMN, require lifelong corticosteroid replacement therapy.
