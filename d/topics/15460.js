Approximately 10 percent of patients die prior to reaching the hospital and, of those who make it in time, only one-third will have a &quot;good result&quot; after treatment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/screening-for-intracranial-aneurysm/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p>Most SAHs are caused by ruptured saccular aneurysms. Recommendations for screening for aneurysms and methods of screening are discussed here. The epidemiology and pathogenesis of intracranial aneurysms and management of unruptured aneurysms, and screening for new aneurysms after treatment for SAH are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=unruptured-intracranial-aneurysms\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Unruptured intracranial aneurysms&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-cerebral-aneurysms#H259181003\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of cerebral aneurysms&quot;, section on 'Early rebleeding'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">RATIONALE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The prevalence of intracranial saccular aneurysms by radiographic and autopsy series is approximately 0.4 to 6.0 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/screening-for-intracranial-aneurysm/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>], or between 1 to 18 million people in the United States. In adult patients without risk factors, the best estimate is that approximately 2 percent harbor asymptomatic cerebral aneurysms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/screening-for-intracranial-aneurysm/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Of patients with cerebral aneurysms, 20 to 30 percent have multiple aneurysms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/screening-for-intracranial-aneurysm/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. Aneurysmal SAH occurs at an estimated rate of 6 to 16 per 100,000 population [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/screening-for-intracranial-aneurysm/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. In North America, this translates into approximately 30,000 affected persons per year. Thus, most aneurysms do not rupture.</p><p>The probability of rupture is related to the size of the aneurysm. Small aneurysms (less than 6 mm in diameter) are most commonly identified with screening, and these are at low risk for rupture (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F63534\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef63534 \">figure 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/screening-for-intracranial-aneurysm/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. In addition, patients with smaller aneurysms (&lt;10 mm) that have ruptured have a better prognosis than larger aneurysm rupture [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/screening-for-intracranial-aneurysm/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].</p><p>Aneurysm surgery is associated with significant morbidity and mortality. In an international multicenter report of 1449 patients with unruptured intracranial aneurysms, the rate of surgery-related morbidity and mortality in those without a prior history of bleeding from a different aneurysm was 18 percent at 30 days and 16 percent at one year [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/screening-for-intracranial-aneurysm/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. The one-year rates were affected by age: 6.5 percent under age 45; 14 percent between the ages of 45 and 64; and 32 percent over the age of 64. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-aneurysmal-subarachnoid-hemorrhage\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage&quot;</a>.)</p><p>These findings suggest that widespread screening for cerebral aneurysm is not warranted. This was also the conclusion in guidelines published by the American Stroke Association [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/screening-for-intracranial-aneurysm/abstract/7,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,8</a>].</p><p>However, screening may be considered in some populations at relatively high risk of cerebral aneurysm formation:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>First-degree relatives of patients with cerebral aneurysm, when two or more family members have been affected.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients with a heritable disorder associated with the presence of intracranial aneurysm, such as autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD), glucocorticoid remediable hyperaldosteronism (GRA), and connective tissue diseases such as Ehlers-Danlos syndrome IV and pseudoxanthoma elasticum [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/screening-for-intracranial-aneurysm/abstract/9,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,10</a>].</p><p/><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">RELATIVES OF PATIENTS WITH CEREBRAL ANEURYSM</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Family members of patients with intracranial aneurysms are at increased risk of having an aneurysm. In one study, for example, the age-adjusted prevalence of incidental aneurysms in first-degree relatives of patients with an aneurysm was 9 percent, a number significantly higher than the general population [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/screening-for-intracranial-aneurysm/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. Only a small proportion of these families had an identifiable hereditary syndrome known to be associated with aneurysms. In a second report of patients with mostly sporadic SAH, intracranial aneurysms were found in 4 percent of first-degree relatives (approximately twice that of the general population) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/screening-for-intracranial-aneurysm/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. The mode of inheritance is variable, with autosomal dominant, recessive, and multifactorial transmission evident in different families [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/screening-for-intracranial-aneurysm/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>].</p><p>In a large population study from Scotland, the estimated 10-year prospective risk of SAH for relatives free of SAH at the time of the index SAH increased in an ascending manner according to the relationship to the index case as follows [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/screening-for-intracranial-aneurysm/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>One second degree relative, 0.3 percent (95% CI 0.0-0.6)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>One first degree relative, 0.8 percent (95% CI 0.2-1.5)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Two first degree relatives, 7.1 percent (95% CI 0.2-14.0)</p><p/><p>The wide confidence intervals around these risk estimates reflect the small numbers of SAH events that occur in relatives of index cases, even in large population studies. Nonetheless, the risk for first degree relatives of patients with SAH appear to be much higher than that of the general population, where the 10-year prospective risk of SAH is about 0.1 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/screening-for-intracranial-aneurysm/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. The risk of aneurysm among family members of patients with aneurysm is also influenced by those risk factors (cigarette smoking, hypertension) that affect aneurysm formation in the general population [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/screening-for-intracranial-aneurysm/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=unruptured-intracranial-aneurysms#H796071790\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Unruptured intracranial aneurysms&quot;, section on 'Pathogenesis of aneurysm formation'</a>.)</p><p>Familial aneurysms tend to rupture at a smaller size and younger age than sporadic aneurysms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/screening-for-intracranial-aneurysm/abstract/11,17,18\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,17,18</a>]. Siblings often experience rupture in the same decade of life [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/screening-for-intracranial-aneurysm/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. Families with intracranial aneurysms do not appear to demonstrate the phenomenon of anticipation, ie subsequent generations are not more likely to develop SAH at younger ages than previous generations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/screening-for-intracranial-aneurysm/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>].</p><p>Multiple cerebral aneurysms are also more common in the familial syndrome than among those with sporadic aneurysms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/screening-for-intracranial-aneurysm/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>].</p><p>Most cerebral aneurysms are initially discovered in families after rupture causes SAH. Thus, screening studies have predominantly looked at relatives of patients who have suffered a SAH. Recommendations for screening asymptomatic family members of patients with SAH for the presence of intracranial aneurysms depend upon the number of affected relatives.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Two or more affected first-degree relatives</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Screening of asymptomatic first-degree relatives is generally recommended in families that have two or more individuals with aneurysms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/screening-for-intracranial-aneurysm/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. One study that employed this approach found aneurysms by magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) in 37 of 400 (9 percent) asymptomatic individuals among 68 families with a history of aneurysmal SAH [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/screening-for-intracranial-aneurysm/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>].</p><p>Analytic models have come to different conclusions regarding the efficacy of screening, depending in part on the role of conventional angiography in screening and the choice of aneurysm treatment used in their model. One study suggested that this approach would not be effective in reducing morbidity and mortality unless aneurysm prevalence was substantially greater than 10 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/screening-for-intracranial-aneurysm/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. However, another study found that a screening program could reduce morbidity and mortality in this population in a cost-effective manner [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/screening-for-intracranial-aneurysm/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>].</p><p>If the decision is made to screen, it is uncertain what screening interval is appropriate. In a study that recommended repeat screening at five-year intervals, 74 patients had one repeat screening and 28 patients had a second repeat screening [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/screening-for-intracranial-aneurysm/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. Ten new aneurysms were detected in nine patients; two patients had a SAH three years after a negative screening procedure.</p><p>The American Stroke Association guidelines concluded that while people with two or more first degree relatives with intracranial aneurysm have an increased incidence of intracranial aneurysms, the cost effectiveness of screening in these populations has not been evaluated. They suggest that screening in these individual should be considered on an individual basis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/screening-for-intracranial-aneurysm/abstract/7,8,26\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,8,26</a>].</p><p>Our usual practice is to screen relatives with MRA yearly for three years and then expand the screening interval to every five years for those who had no aneurysms detected on the initial three scans.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">One affected first-degree relative</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The lifetime risk of SAH for individuals with only one affected first-degree relative is relatively small, ranging from 1 to 4.7 percent at age 70 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/screening-for-intracranial-aneurysm/abstract/12,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,14</a>], although the risk of aneurysm formation may be higher [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/screening-for-intracranial-aneurysm/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>].</p><p>Some advocate screening in this population as well, but this approach is not generally recommended [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/screening-for-intracranial-aneurysm/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. In one study, for example, 626 first-degree relatives of 160 patients with sporadic subarachnoid hemorrhage were screened with magnetic resonance angiography, followed by conventional angiography in those thought to have aneurysms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/screening-for-intracranial-aneurysm/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. Aneurysms were found in 25 first-degree relatives (4 percent), twice the prevalence in the general population, but less than one-half the prevalence of people with two or more first-degree relatives with SAH. Eighteen underwent surgery: 5 with medium sized aneurysms (5 to 11 mm in diameter); 11 with small aneurysm (less than 5 mm); and 2 with both small and medium-sized aneurysms. Outcome was assessed at six months after surgery and was combined with a decision analysis model to estimate the effectiveness of screening:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Eleven patients who underwent surgery experienced a <strong>decrease in function</strong> at six months.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Surgery increased life expectancy by 0.9 <span class=\"nowrap\">month/person</span> screened at the expense of 19 years of decreased function per person.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The number of relatives who would need to be screened to prevent one SAH during a lifetime was 149; 298 would have to be screened to prevent a fatal SAH.</p><p/><p>Other studies have also found that the quality of life and functional outcome of many patients who undergo screening followed by angiography and surgery is diminished for at least one year [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/screening-for-intracranial-aneurysm/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. Furthermore, the gain in life expectancy per person screened is considerably lower than the benefits offered by other screening programs. These observations suggest that screening of patients with only one affected first-degree relative is not warranted. Guidelines published by the American Stroke Association in 2012 state that while it might be reasonable to offer noninvasive screening, further study is needed to define the risks and benefits of this approach [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/screening-for-intracranial-aneurysm/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. &#160;</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h1\">HEREDITARY SYNDROMES ASSOCIATED WITH ANEURYSM FORMATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Cerebral aneurysm formation is more common in individuals with certain hereditary syndromes as discussed below. Despite this risk, the American Stroke Association guidelines concluded that screening is not efficacious in these populations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/screening-for-intracranial-aneurysm/abstract/7,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,8</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The incidence of cerebral aneurysm in ADPKD is approximately 5 percent in young adults, increasing with age to as high as 10 percent in older patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/screening-for-intracranial-aneurysm/abstract/29-33\" class=\"abstract_t\">29-33</a>]. Patients with a family history of intracranial aneurysm or SAH appear to be at greatest risk [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/screening-for-intracranial-aneurysm/abstract/29,33,34\" class=\"abstract_t\">29,33,34</a>]. In one study, for example, asymptomatic intracranial aneurysms were found in 6 of 27 patients (22 percent) with, and only 3 of 56 patients (5 percent) without a positive family history [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/screening-for-intracranial-aneurysm/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=extrarenal-manifestations-of-autosomal-dominant-polycystic-kidney-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Extrarenal manifestations of autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease&quot;</a>.)</p><p>It has been estimated that aneurysm rupture occurs in 65 to 75 percent of affected patients with ADPKD, a value higher than that of non-ADPKD patients with an intracerebral aneurysm [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/screening-for-intracranial-aneurysm/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>]. Aneurysm rupture in ADPKD most often occurs before the age of 50 and in patients with poorly controlled hypertension [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/screening-for-intracranial-aneurysm/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>]. In addition, patients who have already had one aneurysm clipped following a cerebral bleed may be at increased risk of new aneurysm formation for as long as 15 years after the initial surgery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/screening-for-intracranial-aneurysm/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>].</p><p>Nevertheless, the role for radiologic screening of asymptomatic patients with ADPKD is unsettled. As mentioned above, the decision is based upon weighing the risks of aneurysm surgery versus the benefits of possibly preventing aneurysm rupture; the risk-benefit ratio in asymptomatic patients with ADPKD is uncertain. At present, routine screening is recommended only for high-risk patients, such as those with a previous rupture, a positive family history of an intracerebral bleed, warning symptoms, a high-risk occupation in which loss of consciousness would place the patient or others at extreme risk, and prior to surgery that is likely to be associated with hemodynamic instability with hypertension [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/screening-for-intracranial-aneurysm/abstract/29,34\" class=\"abstract_t\">29,34</a>].
