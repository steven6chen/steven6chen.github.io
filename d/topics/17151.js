The chromones are listed as alternate initial controller therapies for mild asthma in national and international guidelines, although inhaled glucocorticoids (also known as inhaled corticosteroids) are the preferred agents [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-use-of-chromones-cromoglycates-in-the-treatment-of-asthma/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>]. The low incidence of side effects compared with inhaled glucocorticoids is a leading reason some patients prefer chromones over inhaled glucocorticoids.</p><p>This topic will review the pharmacology and use of chromones in the management of asthma. A more general discussion of asthma therapy is found separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=an-overview-of-asthma-management\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;An overview of asthma management&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">LIMITATIONS ON AVAILABILITY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span><a href=\"topic.htm?path=cromolyn-sodium-cromoglicate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Cromolyn</a> first became available in the 1970s. At present, availability of cromoglycates varies from one country to another, due in part to the need to change the propellants used in cromoglycate metered-dose inhalers (MDIs) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-use-of-chromones-cromoglycates-in-the-treatment-of-asthma/abstract/3,4\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,4</a>]. The propellant originally had been a chlorofluorocarbon (CFC). Following adoption of the Montreal protocol (an international agreement to ban CFCs), inhalers that contain hydrofluoroalkane (HFA) were developed for some drugs. HFA formulations of cromolyn are available in the United Kingdom and a Spinhaler device is available in Australia, although neither of these is sold in the United States. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=the-use-of-inhaler-devices-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;The use of inhaler devices in adults&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=the-use-of-inhaler-devices-in-children\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;The use of inhaler devices in children&quot;</a>.)</p><p>In the United States, neither <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cromolyn-sodium-cromoglicate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cromolyn</a> nor <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nedocromil-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">nedocromil</a> is available in HFA-containing MDIs, and no formulation of nedocromil is marketed for asthma. As a result, the only remaining formulations for asthma are solutions of cromolyn (10 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/mL)</span> for nebulization. However, dry-powder inhaler formulations for cromolyn and nedocromil are available in other countries (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F56418\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef56418 \">table 1</a>).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">PHARMACOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The chromones have potent effects in preventing both early and late asthmatic responses to inhaled allergens, such as pollen, and reducing airway reactivity to a range of inhaled irritants, such as sulfur dioxide and cold air [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-use-of-chromones-cromoglycates-in-the-treatment-of-asthma/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].</p><p>The hypothesis proposed to explain the mechanism of action of the chromones involves two related and possibly sequential processes, which act to stabilize airway mast cells and perhaps other inflammatory cells.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>First, the drugs cause phosphorylation of a cell membrane moesin-like protein that is responsible for the termination of mediator release from mast cells and probably a broad range of other cells responsible for allergic inflammation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-use-of-chromones-cromoglycates-in-the-treatment-of-asthma/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. As such, chromones appear to activate a natural &quot;turn-off switch&quot; in the very early stages of an asthmatic response to an external noxious stimulus. This action may explain the ability of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cromolyn-sodium-cromoglicate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cromolyn</a> to block the acute bronchospastic response to inhaled antigen equally effectively whether administered one minute or one hour prior to challenge [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-use-of-chromones-cromoglycates-in-the-treatment-of-asthma/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Second, chromones inhibit the activation of a chloride current in cells undergoing shape and volume changes associated with cell activation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-use-of-chromones-cromoglycates-in-the-treatment-of-asthma/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. The opening of chloride channels is followed by opening of calcium channels and degranulation. Chromones affect only the chloride channels [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-use-of-chromones-cromoglycates-in-the-treatment-of-asthma/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].</p><p/><p>Other putative mechanisms have been proposed, including inhibition of the synthesis of immunoglobulin E (IgE) antibody by B lymphocytes and a gradual reduction in airway hyperreactivity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-use-of-chromones-cromoglycates-in-the-treatment-of-asthma/abstract/10,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,11</a>]. <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cromolyn-sodium-cromoglicate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Cromolyn</a> may also prevent lung damage by acting as an oxygen-free radical scavenger [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-use-of-chromones-cromoglycates-in-the-treatment-of-asthma/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>].</p><p>Pharmacologically, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cromolyn-sodium-cromoglicate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cromolyn</a> is a chromone, whereas <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nedocromil-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">nedocromil</a> belongs to the structural class of pyranoquinolines. Both agents contain a chromone ring configuration (one ring in nedocromil, two in cromolyn) and they share many clinical characteristics. Both medications are potent G protein-coupled receptor 35 (GPR 35) agonists. GPR 35 is upregulated upon challenge with IgE antibody and is expressed in mast cells, basophils, and eosinophils [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-use-of-chromones-cromoglycates-in-the-treatment-of-asthma/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h1\">ROLE IN ASTHMA THERAPY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The chromones have clinical utility in two distinct clinical situations: prophylactic use before exposure to a known asthma trigger and chronic use as a controller therapy.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Prevention of acute bronchoconstriction</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A single treatment (one nebulized 20 mg dose of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cromolyn-sodium-cromoglicate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cromolyn</a> or two or more puffs of either cromolyn or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nedocromil-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">nedocromil</a> from a metered-dose inhaler [MDI]) administered 10 to 15 minutes before an anticipated trigger exposure (ie, pollen or animals in patient allergic to these things or exercise) is usually sufficient to provide protection. For protection against stronger challenges or in more sensitive patients, inhaled beta-agonists may be administered immediately prior to the chromone because the combination is additive in benefit [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-use-of-chromones-cromoglycates-in-the-treatment-of-asthma/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. We know of no studies that compared the chromones with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=albuterol-salbutamol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">albuterol</a> directly for the prevention of bronchoconstriction. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=exercise-induced-bronchoconstriction\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Exercise-induced bronchoconstriction&quot;</a>.)</p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=cromolyn-sodium-cromoglicate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Cromolyn</a> was originally introduced in Europe and later in the United States primarily for the prevention of allergic asthma (the trade name Intal was a contraction of &quot;interferes with allergy&quot;). The early emphasis on an allergic diathesis and the restriction of its use to the most severe asthmatics led to initial clinical confusion and disappointment. Subsequent analyses directed clinical usage toward those with milder asthma and nonallergic as well as allergic precipitants for their disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-use-of-chromones-cromoglycates-in-the-treatment-of-asthma/abstract/11,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,15</a>]. The chromones can be used to prevent bronchoconstriction, although they do not have bronchodilating properties for relief of acute symptoms, unlike the short-acting beta-agonists. It is therefore important to ensure that patients understand that beta-agonists should be used instead for rapid relief of symptoms.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Efficacy as long-term maintenance therapy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The chromones may also be used as antiinflammatory controller agents.

Inhaled glucocorticoids are the preferred initial antiinflammatory therapy for patients of all ages with mild persistent asthma, as mentioned previously. However, the chromones are considered alternative first-line agents [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-use-of-chromones-cromoglycates-in-the-treatment-of-asthma/abstract/1,2,11,16,17\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2,11,16,17</a>].

Fifteen trials including 1422 children were included, most of whom had mild- or moderate-persistent asthma. The primary outcome was an improvement in symptom-free days. Short-term studies (one to three months) showed some improvements in lung function with nedocromil. Two longer-term studies (one of six months duration and another of four to six years duration) found variable improvement in symptom-free days and some improvement in lung function parameters. Overall, these findings suggested mild efficacy.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h3\">Compared with inhaled glucocorticoids</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Several studies concluded that the chromones were less effective than inhaled glucocorticoids [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-use-of-chromones-cromoglycates-in-the-treatment-of-asthma/abstract/16,19,20\" class=\"abstract_t\">16,19,20</a>].</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A retrospective study compared risk of hospitalization for asthma with use of asthma medications in an analysis of 16,941 eligible adults and children in a managed healthcare setting [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-use-of-chromones-cromoglycates-in-the-treatment-of-asthma/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>].

Because chromones act solely to prevent bronchospasm and do not have acute bronchodilating capacity, some clinicians initiate therapy concomitantly with a short course of oral glucocorticoids to maximize lung function before relying on the chromone alone.

National and international guidelines, however, recommend inhaled glucocorticoids rather than chromones as the preferred initial controller therapy in patients of all ages (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=1\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1A</a>).
