They are more common in women than in men. Migraines often start off mild and then get worse.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3446642290\"><span class=\"h1\">What are the symptoms of migraines in adults?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Symptoms can include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Headache &ndash; The headache gets worse over several hours and is usually throbbing. It often affects 1 side of the head.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Nausea and sometimes vomiting</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Feeling sensitive to light and noise &ndash; Lying down in a quiet, dark room often helps.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Aura &ndash; Some people have something called a migraine &quot;aura.&quot; An aura is a symptom or feeling that happens before or during the migraine headache. Each person's aura is different, but in most cases the aura affects the vision. You might see flashing lights, bright spots, or zig-zag lines, or lose part of your vision. Or you might have numbness and tingling of the lips, lower face, and fingers of 1 hand. Some people hear sounds or have ringing in their ears as part of their aura. The aura usually lasts a few minutes to an hour and then goes away, but most often lasts 15 to 30 minutes.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Women who get migraines with aura usually cannot take birth control pills. That's because they might increase the risk of stroke.</p><p/><p>Many people get other symptoms that happen several hours or even a day before the migraine headache. Doctors call these &quot;premonitory&quot; or &quot;prodromal&quot; symptoms. They might include yawning, feeling depressed, irritability, food cravings, constipation, or a stiff neck.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3568521069\"><span class=\"h1\">Is there a test for migraines?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>No. There is no test. But your doctor should be able to tell if you have migraines by doing an exam and learning about your symptoms.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3675436037\"><span class=\"h1\">Should I see a doctor or nurse?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Yes. If you think you are having migraines, you should talk to your doctor or nurse. You should also see a doctor or nurse if your migraines get worse or more frequent, or if you have new symptoms.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3204494957\"><span class=\"h1\">Is there anything I can do to prevent migraines?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Yes. Some people find that their migraines are triggered by certain things. If you can avoid some of these things, you can lower your chances of getting migraines.</p><p>You can also keep a &quot;headache calendar.&quot; In the calendar, write down every time you have a migraine and what you ate and did before it started. That way you can find out if there is anything you should avoid eating or doing. You can also write down what medicine you took and whether or not it helped.</p><p>Common migraine triggers include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Stress</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Hormonal changes</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Skipping meals or not eating enough</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Changes in the weather</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Sleeping too much or too little</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Bright or flashing lights</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Drinking alcohol</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Certain drinks or foods, such as red wine, aged cheese, and hot dogs</p><p/><p>If your migraines are frequent or severe, your doctor can suggest others ways to help prevent them. For example, it might help to learn relaxation techniques and ways to manage stress. There are also medicines that can help.</p><p>Some women get migraines just before or during their period. Medicine can help with this, too.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2554802255\"><span class=\"h1\">How are migraines treated?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There are many different medicines that can help with migraines. Your doctor can help you find the best treatment for your situation.</p><p>For mild migraines, your doctor might suggest an over-the-counter medicine such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acetaminophen-paracetamol-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">acetaminophen</a> (sample brand name: Tylenol), <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ibuprofen-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">ibuprofen</a> (sample brand names: Advil, Motrin), or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=naproxen-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">naproxen</a> (sample brand name: Aleve). There is also a medicine that combines acetaminophen, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aspirin-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">aspirin</a>, and caffeine (sample brand name: Excedrin). For more severe migraines, there are prescription medicines that can help. If you have severe nausea or vomiting with your migraines, there are medicines that can help with that, too.</p><p>Do not try to treat frequent migraines on your own with non-prescription pain medicines. Taking non-prescription pain medicines too often can actually cause more headaches later.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1760090651\"><span class=\"h1\">What if I want to get pregnant?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>If you want to get pregnant, talk to your doctor or nurse about it before you start trying. Some medicines used to treat and prevent migraines are not safe during pregnancy, so you might need to switch medicines before you get pregnant.</p><p>Some women notice that their migraines actually get better during pregnancy and breastfeeding. This is related to hormonal changes in the body.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4196466333\"><span class=\"h1\">More on this topic</span></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=headaches-in-adults-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Headaches in adults (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=headaches-in-children-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Headaches in children (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=migraine-headaches-in-children-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Migraine headaches in children (The Basics)</a></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=migraine-headaches-in-adults-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Migraine headaches in adults (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=headache-causes-and-diagnosis-in-adults-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Headache causes and diagnosis in adults (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=headache-treatment-in-adults-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Headache treatment in adults (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=headache-in-children-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Headache in children (Beyond the Basics)</a></p></div><div id=\"reviewProcess\"><span>All topics are updated as new evidence becomes available and our <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/home/editorial-policy\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"policy policy_editorialpolicy\">peer review process</a> is complete.</span></div><div id=\"topicRetrievedDate\"><span class=\"emphasis\">This topic retrieved from UpToDate on: </span>Apr 03, 2018.</div><div id=\"disclaimer\">The content on the UpToDate website is not intended nor recommended as a substitute for medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.
