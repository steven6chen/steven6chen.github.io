(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-elevated-low-density-lipoprotein-cholesterol-ldl-c-in-primary-prevention-of-cardiovascular-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of elevated low density lipoprotein-cholesterol (LDL-C) in primary prevention of cardiovascular disease&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-low-density-lipoprotein-cholesterol-ldl-c-in-secondary-prevention-of-cardiovascular-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of low density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) in secondary prevention of cardiovascular disease&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Statins are both effective and generally safe. Although muscle toxicity remains a concern, severe myonecrosis leading to clinical rhabdomyolysis is unusual, affecting perhaps 0.1 percent of patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/statin-muscle-related-adverse-events/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>]. Muscle syndromes associated with statins, including myalgias, myopathy, myositis, and muscle injury (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F115539\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef115539 \">table 1</a>) , are discussed here [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/statin-muscle-related-adverse-events/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Other statin side effects are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=statins-actions-side-effects-and-administration\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Statins: Actions, side effects, and administration&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H107312583\"><span class=\"h1\">PATHOGENESIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The mechanism by which statins cause muscle toxicity is not well understood, but genetic studies have provided new insights [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/statin-muscle-related-adverse-events/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. They inhibit the conversion of HMG-CoA to mevalonic acid, which is an important early step in cholesterol synthesis.</p><p>Individual statins may have distinct effects on the synthesis of coenzyme Q10 (CoQ10, ubiquinone), which plays an important role in muscle cell energy production. It has been speculated that a reduction in ubiquinone in skeletal muscle may contribute to statin-induced muscle injury. Some studies have found that statins decrease skeletal muscle and plasma concentrations of ubiquinone [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/statin-muscle-related-adverse-events/abstract/5-7\" class=\"abstract_t\">5-7</a>]; however, other studies have not [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/statin-muscle-related-adverse-events/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>], and studies have come to different conclusions about whether statin treatment decreases levels of ubiquinone in skeletal muscle [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/statin-muscle-related-adverse-events/abstract/7,9,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,9,10</a>]. Long-term treatment with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=simvastatin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">simvastatin</a> (10 to 40 mg daily for &gt;12 months) reduced ubiquinone content in skeletal muscles and decreased maximal mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation capacity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/statin-muscle-related-adverse-events/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>].</p><p>One study found increased levels of plant sterols in skeletal muscle in patients treated with high-dose statins [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/statin-muscle-related-adverse-events/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. Specifically, sitosterol was increased by approximately 50 percent. The authors of the study proposed that these increased cellular levels could contribute to the muscle toxicity of statins. Beta-sitosterol is an activator of AMP-activated protein kinase, which inhibits acetyl-CoA carboxylase. This results in reduced fat synthesis and increased beta-oxidation. Preliminary evidence suggests that statin-intolerant patients demonstrate increased fatty acid oxidation (FAO) in response to <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lovastatin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">lovastatin</a>, implicating an intrinsic FAO abnormality [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/statin-muscle-related-adverse-events/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. Statins increase the expression of mitochondrial carnitine acylcarnitine translocase and this effect may contribute to the alteration in FAO [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/statin-muscle-related-adverse-events/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>].</p><p>Atrogin-1, a muscle-specific ubiquitin protein ligase, may play an important role in statin toxicity. <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lovastatin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Lovastatin</a> induces expression of atrogin-1 in humans with statin myopathy and in several in vitro models; in the models, myopathy could be prevented by knockdown of atrogin-1 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/statin-muscle-related-adverse-events/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. These and other proposed mechanisms require further experimental confirmation.</p><p>Among patients experiencing statin-induced myalgia, skeletal muscle gene expression data show that persistent myalgia may result from cellular stress that results from mechanisms of post-inflammatory repair and end-organ susceptibility. The genetic basis for SAMS is supported by an increased frequency of single nucleotide polymorphisms that were increased in patients with statin myalgia (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F115538\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef115538 \">figure 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/statin-muscle-related-adverse-events/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10919350\"><span class=\"h1\">DEFINITIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Terminology around statin-associated adverse muscle events is variable and has changed over time [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/statin-muscle-related-adverse-events/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>].

A meta-analysis of 42 randomized trials of statins found little or no excess risk of myalgias, creatine kinase elevations, rhabdomyolysis, or discontinuation of therapy versus placebo [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/statin-muscle-related-adverse-events/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. However, experience in clinical practice suggests that muscle side effects are relatively common, including side effects requiring discontinuation of statin therapy. The explanation for this difference is uncertain, but may relate to selection criteria in randomized trials that limit the ability to generalize their results to the side effect profiles seen in a broader population of patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/statin-muscle-related-adverse-events/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>].</p><p>Consistent with this, a six-month randomized trial in 420 healthy adults designed to examine the effects of statin therapy on muscle function found a higher incidence of myalgia in patients treated with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=atorvastatin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">atorvastatin</a> 80 mg daily than with placebo (9.3 versus 4.6 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/statin-muscle-related-adverse-events/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>].</p><p>Clinically-significant myonecrosis, defined as a serum CK elevation more than 10 times normal in association with muscle symptoms, occurred in less than 0.5 percent of patients in large clinical trials [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/statin-muscle-related-adverse-events/abstract/20-23\" class=\"abstract_t\">20-23</a>]. A review of one year of records for 1014 patients taking statins in a primary care practice found that 0.9 percent of patients had CK elevations more than five times normal, and none of these appeared to be related to statin use [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/statin-muscle-related-adverse-events/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. Fourteen patients (2.1 percent) had elevations 2.5 to 5.0 times normal and, of these, two appeared to be potentially related to statin use.</p><p>In large clinical trials, massive rhabdomyolysis with acute renal failure was not seen in patients who did not have other risk factors. Rhabdomyolysis has primarily been seen when a statin is given concurrently with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cyclosporine-ciclosporin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cyclosporine</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=gemfibrozil-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">gemfibrozil</a>, or protease inhibitors (see <a href=\"#H107312713\" class=\"local\">'Concurrent drug therapy'</a> below) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/statin-muscle-related-adverse-events/abstract/25-27\" class=\"abstract_t\">25-27</a>]. In addition, there have been case reports of rhabdomyolysis in patients taking statins in combination with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=vitamin-b3-niacin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">niacin</a>, macrolide antibiotics, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=digoxin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">digoxin</a>, antifungal medications, and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=warfarin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">warfarin</a> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/statin-muscle-related-adverse-events/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>].</p><p>One study examined claims data from 11 managed care plans that included 252,460 patients treated with lipid lowering agents [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/statin-muscle-related-adverse-events/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. The average incidence of hospitalization for rhabdomyolysis was 0.44 per 10,000 patient-years (95% CI 0.20-0.84) for patients treated with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=atorvastatin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">atorvastatin</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pravastatin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">pravastatin</a>, or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=simvastatin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">simvastatin</a> monotherapy. Although the study did not find a statistical difference in the incidence of rhabdomyolysis among these three statins, no cases of rhabdomyolysis were seen with pravastatin. The incidence was higher with cerivastatin monotherapy (5.34 per 10,000 patient-years).</p><p>Many individuals who are prescribed statins discontinue treatment due to perceived side effects. An internet-based survey that included 10,138 respondents (88 percent current statin users, 12 percent former users) found that the primary reason for discontinuation of statin therapy was side effects [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/statin-muscle-related-adverse-events/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. Muscle-related side effects were reported by 60 percent of former users and 25 percent of current users. However the study did not make it clear whether the temporal relation between symptoms and starting or stopping statin therapy was assessed, and it is uncertain whether the 25 percent of current users with muscle symptoms attributed those symptoms to their therapy. Concomitant use of medications that inhibit statin metabolism increased the risk for muscle symptoms and for discontinuation of statin therapy for such symptoms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/statin-muscle-related-adverse-events/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H107312605\"><span class=\"h1\">RISK FACTORS</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H107312612\"><span class=\"h2\">Statin characteristics</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The ability to cause muscle injury appears to vary among the different statins.

The incidence of serum CK elevations was not different from placebo, and there were no cases of confirmed clinical myositis or rhabdomyolysis.</p><p>The possible differential sensitivity of statins on striated muscle has been evaluated in cell culture experiments [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/statin-muscle-related-adverse-events/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>]. <a href=\"topic.htm?path=simvastatin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Simvastatin</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lovastatin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">lovastatin</a> reduced cell viability by 50 percent at concentrations of 1 and 5 <span class=\"nowrap\">mcmol/L,</span> respectively; a much higher level of 300 <span class=\"nowrap\">mcmol/L</span> was required with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pravastatin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">pravastatin</a>, suggesting less toxicity. The toxic effect of these agents on dividing myocytes may contribute to the development of myositis. The more hydrophilic statins, pravastatin and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=rosuvastatin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">rosuvastatin</a>, may have less penetration into muscle than the other more lipophilic statins. However, individual patient differences appear more likely than statin differences to affect statin uptake into muscle.

In a trial in 17,802 apparently healthy adults, rates of muscle toxicity with rosuvastatin 20 mg daily were similar to placebo [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/statin-muscle-related-adverse-events/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>]. There have been reports of rhabdomyolysis with rosuvastatin, particularly in myopathy-prone patients treated with doses higher than those recommended by the FDA product labeling, and product labeling in Europe highlights this risk, particularly at the highest dose of 40 mg daily [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/statin-muscle-related-adverse-events/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H107312679\"><span class=\"h2\">Pre-existing neuromuscular disorders</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Underlying neuromuscular disorders may interact with statin therapy. In some cases statins can cause new neuromuscular disorders (see <a href=\"#H639421012\" class=\"local\">'Neuromuscular disorders'</a> below), however, others involve increased risk of toxicity in patients with known underlying neuromuscular disorders or the development of clinically-apparent disease in patients who had likely had preclinical disease before statins were initiated.</p><p>Statins appear to have deleterious effects in patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and conditions that mimic ALS [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/statin-muscle-related-adverse-events/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>]. Cholesterol levels may play an important role, as dyslipidemia has been associated with prolonged survival in ALS [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/statin-muscle-related-adverse-events/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>]. ALS-associated hypermetabolism may require more cholesterol availability. Indeed, calorie restriction exacerbates motor symptoms and high fat intake improves survival in a mouse model of ALS [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/statin-muscle-related-adverse-events/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>]. Sterol bioavailability and cholesterol synthesis represent pivotal adaptive responses to extracellular stress [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/statin-muscle-related-adverse-events/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>]. Although the optimal lipid levels are unknown for patients with ALS, it is considered reasonable to withdraw statins and other hypolipidemics in patients who develop ALS.</p><p>For genetically-based muscle disorders, statins are believed to trigger myogenic symptoms more readily than in healthy subjects, due to a reduced ability to compensate for drug-induced myotoxicity. In such patients, myopathic symptoms often persist after statin withdrawal, and this is a clinical indicator for electromyography and, potentially, muscle biopsy. It seems likely that the diverse neuromuscular phenotypes associated with statin use reflect multiple mechanisms acting either singly or synergistically.</p><p>Reports of diseases that have become clinically apparent in patients on statins include myasthenia gravis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/statin-muscle-related-adverse-events/abstract/43,44\" class=\"abstract_t\">43,44</a>], mitochondrial myopathy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/statin-muscle-related-adverse-events/abstract/45-47\" class=\"abstract_t\">45-47</a>], McArdle disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/statin-muscle-related-adverse-events/abstract/47-49\" class=\"abstract_t\">47-49</a>], acid maltase deficiency [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/statin-muscle-related-adverse-events/abstract/50\" class=\"abstract_t\">50</a>], muscle phosphorylase b kinase deficiency [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/statin-muscle-related-adverse-events/abstract/51\" class=\"abstract_t\">51</a>], carnitine-palmitoyl transferase deficiency [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/statin-muscle-related-adverse-events/abstract/52\" class=\"abstract_t\">52</a>], rippling muscle disease (RMD) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/statin-muscle-related-adverse-events/abstract/53\" class=\"abstract_t\">53</a>], myotonic dystrophy types 1 and 2 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/statin-muscle-related-adverse-events/abstract/47,54\" class=\"abstract_t\">47,54</a>], cytoplasmic- and hyaline-body (myosin storage) myopathies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/statin-muscle-related-adverse-events/abstract/55,56\" class=\"abstract_t\">55,56</a>], and motor neuronopathies (ie, Kennedy disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/statin-muscle-related-adverse-events/abstract/47\" class=\"abstract_t\">47</a>] and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/statin-muscle-related-adverse-events/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>]).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H107314231\"><span class=\"h2\">Hypothyroidism, hypovitaminosis D, and other disorders</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Enhanced susceptibility to statin-associated myopathy occurs in patients with hypothyroidism, acute or chronic renal failure, and obstructive liver disease.

Testing for SLCO1B1 variants associated with statin myopathy is commercially available, but it seems unlikely that such a test would be clinically useful or worth the expense in most situations.</p><p>As discussed, it remains unclear whether lipid-soluble statins penetrate the muscle membrane more readily than water-soluble statins, leading to increased risk for myopathy (see <a href=\"#H107312612\" class=\"local\">'Statin characteristics'</a> above). The discovery that organic anion transport polypeptide 2B1 (SLCO2B1) is expressed on the sarcolemma and mediates uptake of statins into the myocyte argues against a significant pathogenic role for passive diffusion of the fat-soluble statins.

Autoantibodies directed against HMG CoA reductase have been detected in patients with statin-associated necrotizing myopathy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/statin-muscle-related-adverse-events/abstract/134\" class=\"abstract_t\">134</a>] (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pathogenesis-of-inflammatory-myopathies#H18308534\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pathogenesis of inflammatory myopathies&quot;, section on 'Immune-mediated necrotizing myopathy'</a>). Necrotizing myopathies can be idiopathic, paraneoplastic, or associated with a connective-tissue disorder and can develop or worsen after statin discontinuation. Patients typically have mild to moderate symmetric proximal muscle weakness. Rarely, mild joint pain or rash may be present [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/statin-muscle-related-adverse-events/abstract/135\" class=\"abstract_t\">135</a>]; the rash may affect the face, chest, or dorsal hand and therefore resemble dermatomyositis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/statin-muscle-related-adverse-events/abstract/136\" class=\"abstract_t\">136</a>]. The symptoms typically persist despite discontinuation of the statin.</p><p>Statin-associated necrotizing myopathy and inflammatory myopathy may represent a pathophysiological spectrum rather than categorical entities. Of 26 patients who were followed for statin-associated necrotizing myopathy, seven had a second biopsy, and four showed histopathologic transformation to a distinct inflammatory myopathy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/statin-muscle-related-adverse-events/abstract/137\" class=\"abstract_t\">137</a>].</p><p>Other disorders that may have been induced by statin therapy include mononeuritis multiplex [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/statin-muscle-related-adverse-events/abstract/138\" class=\"abstract_t\">138</a>] and statin-induced extraocular muscle myopathy mimicking Graves' ophthalmopathy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/statin-muscle-related-adverse-events/abstract/139\" class=\"abstract_t\">139</a>]. Additionally, patients who develop statin myopathy appear to be at increased risk for having malignant hyperthermia susceptibility [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/statin-muscle-related-adverse-events/abstract/140,141\" class=\"abstract_t\">140,141</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=susceptibility-to-malignant-hyperthermia-evaluation-and-management#H130378866\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Susceptibility to malignant hyperthermia: Evaluation and management&quot;, section on 'Myopathies with ryanodine receptor abnormalities'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H107311578\"><span class=\"h1\">DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The diagnosis of symptomatic and more severe myositis and myonecrosis with laboratory abnormalities (ie, increased serum creatine kinase [CK]) is typically straightforward and based on a temporal association for both onset with initiation of statin therapy and resolution with statin withdrawal.</p><p>However, many patients can have muscle symptoms from statin therapy without an elevation in serum CK. This issue was directly addressed in a crossover study in which 4 of 21 blinded patients who had muscle symptoms while taking a statin (aching, weakness, decreased exercise tolerance) could distinguish statin therapy from placebo because of reproducible muscle symptoms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/statin-muscle-related-adverse-events/abstract/45\" class=\"abstract_t\">45</a>]. Strength testing confirmed muscle weakness during statin therapy that resolved during placebo treatment; unblinded review of muscle biopsies showed evidence of mitochondrial dysfunction that also reversed with cessation of therapy. Serum statin concentrations were not inappropriately increased.</p><p>There are many other common causes of muscle pain and weakness, including overuse and other injuries, and pain syndromes such as fibromyalgia and myofascial pain syndrome. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-soft-tissue-rheumatic-disorders\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of soft tissue rheumatic disorders&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-fibromyalgia-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of fibromyalgia in adults&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=differential-diagnosis-of-fibromyalgia\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Differential diagnosis of fibromyalgia&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=approach-to-the-patient-with-myalgia\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Approach to the patient with myalgia&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Distinguishing among these is typically based on a careful history and trials of cessation and reintroduction of statin therapy. Even with this, in some patients it will be difficult to be certain whether muscle symptoms are due to statin therapy. A scoring system was proposed for statin-associated symptoms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/statin-muscle-related-adverse-events/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>] and later revised [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/statin-muscle-related-adverse-events/abstract/142\" class=\"abstract_t\">142</a>]. Validation of the statin-associated muscle symptoms clinical index (SAMS-CI) showed that a low score &lt;5 had a negative predictive value of 91 percent in correctly excluding patients with true statin myalgia but has not been evaluated for clinical utility. A general approach to patients with myalgia is discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=approach-to-the-patient-with-myalgia\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Approach to the patient with myalgia&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The sensitivity and specificity of muscle biopsy for statin myopathy are unknown, and we do not typically use this test clinically, unless the muscle symptoms signs (eg, weakness, elevation of CK, etc.) do not resolve upon statin discontinuation. Muscle biopsy obtained early in the course of rhabdomyolysis shows myonecrosis without vasculitis or significant inflammation. Biopsy later in the course may show some mononuclear cell infiltration suggestive of an inflammatory repair process [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/statin-muscle-related-adverse-events/abstract/25-27\" class=\"abstract_t\">25-27</a>].</p><p>Clinical judgment is necessary in interpreting increased CK levels in patients on statins. CK elevations can be related to hypothyroidism or muscle injury during sports (eg, running, hockey, impact or collision sports), and patients who engage in high-impact sports should be advised to have a CK measured before engaging in exercise that day. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=muscle-enzymes-in-the-evaluation-of-neuromuscular-diseases\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Muscle enzymes in the evaluation of neuromuscular diseases&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Some patients report pain with statin therapy after having been warned about the potential side effect, without a pattern that suggests typical statin myalgias. In some of these patients, the statins may not actually be causing physiologic pain, but instead concerns about side effects may be heightening patient perception of pain from other causes.</p><p>A study used n-of-1 trials in eight patients who developed pain within three weeks of initiating statin therapy and who had no clinically significant elevation in creatine kinase (CK), a measure of myonecrosis, to examine whether statins were actually the cause of the myalgias [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/statin-muscle-related-adverse-events/abstract/143\" class=\"abstract_t\">143</a>]. Seven patients underwent three pairs of treatments and one patient underwent two pairs of treatments, with each treatment pair consisting of three weeks of therapy with statin (at the dose that had been used clinically in that patient) or placebo, a three-week washout period, and the opposite therapy (placebo or statin). None of the eight patients had a statistically significant difference in pain scores between statin and placebo treatment periods. Five of the eight patients resumed and tolerated open-label statin therapy after learning the results of their n-of-1 trials.</p><p>It is uncertain whether these results would apply to typical patients seen outside of recruitment for a study, and where the diagnosis of statin myopathy is in doubt. Additionally, the total number of patients in the study was small. Although an editorial comment that accompanied the article suggested that n-of-1 trials could be clinically useful, patients in most clinical settings do not have simple access to such trials.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H16\"><span class=\"h1\">MONITORING</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Despite the increased risk of myopathy associated with statin therapy, routine monitoring of serum creatine kinase (CK) levels is not recommended [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/statin-muscle-related-adverse-events/abstract/24,144,145\" class=\"abstract_t\">24,144,145</a>]. However, it is useful to obtain a baseline serum CK before initiation of statin therapy for reference in case symptoms develop.</p><p>There are important differences in serum CK levels among racial groups; as an example, high concentrations of CK are observed in blacks [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/statin-muscle-related-adverse-events/abstract/146,147\" class=\"abstract_t\">146,147</a>].

In this topic, we use the categories of events defined by the 2014 National Lipid Association Statin Muscle Safety Task Force.

Myalgias and myopathy occur with a frequency of 2 to 11 percent. However, severe myonecrosis and clinical rhabdomyolysis are much rarer (0.5 percent and less than 0.1 percent, respectively). Patients can experience statin-induced myalgias without an elevation in serum creatine kinase (CK) concentration.

CK elevations can be related to hypothyroidism or muscle injury during sports (eg, running, diving for a volleyball, hockey), and patients who engage in high-impact sports should be advised to have a CK measured before engaging in exercise that day.
