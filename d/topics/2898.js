Beginning early in the 21<sup>st </sup>century, there has also been an expansion in the indications for cardiac implantable electronic devices (CIED, a term which includes PPMs and ICDs), resulting in device therapy becoming more complex and more prolonged over the patient's lifetime. As such, therapy with a CIED frequently involves multiple leads and multiple pulse generators per patient over each patient's lifetime with the device, exposing the patient to greater operative risk as well as ongoing risk related to the CIED.</p><p>There are a variety of potential complications associated with CIED use, both at and around the time of implantation as well as long-term over the life of the patient and <span class=\"nowrap\">his/her</span> device [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiac-implantable-electronic-devices-long-term-complications/abstract/1-3\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-3</a>]. Efforts to avoid some of these complications have led to the development of new technologies (ie, leadless pacemakers, subcutaneous ICDs). The long-term complications associated with a CIED will be reviewed here. Procedural and periprocedural complications associated with CIED implantation, as well as basic principles associated with PPMs, ICDs, and alternative technologies, are discussed separately.

Over a median follow-up of 2.7 years, ICD-related complications requiring hospitalization or reoperation occurred at a rate of 6.1 per 100 patient-years. A higher reoperation rate was seen in a Canadian study of 3410 first-time ICD recipients (implanted between 2003 and 2012, median follow-up 34 months), in which 12 percent of patients per year required reoperation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiac-implantable-electronic-devices-long-term-complications/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].</p><p>Pulse generator malfunctions are a rare but significant long-term complication, particularly for patients who are pacemaker-dependent. In a 2006 meta-analysis which included patients from three registries, including 475,618 PPMs and 20,633 ICDs implanted between 1974 and 2004, rates of device malfunction (pulse generator only, no data on lead malfunctions were reported) were 1.3 per 1000 person-years for PPMs and 26.5 per 1000 person-years for ICDs, although the complication rates fell significantly over time [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiac-implantable-electronic-devices-long-term-complications/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].</p><p>Lead malfunctions, another rare but significant potential long-term complication, are more common in ICD leads, with significant variability in the rates of malfunction in certain leads. Reported lead failure rates have varied from 1 to 9 percent at two years, 2 to 15 percent at five years and 5 to 40 percent at 8 to 10 years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiac-implantable-electronic-devices-long-term-complications/abstract/7-9\" class=\"abstract_t\">7-9</a>]. Comparison of rates are confounded by varying definitions of lead failure, differences among lead models, varying patient and clinician characteristics, and limitations of methods for detection of lead malfunction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiac-implantable-electronic-devices-long-term-complications/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h1\">LEAD COMPLICATIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Lead-related problems include infection, lead failure (resulting in failure to pace, failure to shock, or inappropriate shocks), tricuspid valve regurgitation <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> damage, implant vein occlusion, and increased defibrillation thresholds. Abandoned leads also represent another type of lead-related complication insofar that they represent a contraindication to magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scanning, which can be an impediment to medical care in some instances. Venous thrombosis is a less common complication that can cause upper extremity swelling and discomfort and may interfere with placement of additional leads [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiac-implantable-electronic-devices-long-term-complications/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3780356530\"><span class=\"h2\">Infection</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Infection of the generator pocket or leads can occur at the time of CIED implantation or at any subsequent time. Because infection of a CIED can be a life-threatening problem, complete hardware removal, including the CIED pulse generator and all leads, along with antibiotic therapy, are strongly recommended unless there is a reason to pursue palliative antibiotic therapy (eg, very short life-expectancy) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiac-implantable-electronic-devices-long-term-complications/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. These issues are discussed in detail separately.

Certain lead models and sizes have been identified as prone to failure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiac-implantable-electronic-devices-long-term-complications/abstract/9,14,16\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,14,16</a>]. Additionally, ICD leads seem more prone to failure compared with pacemaker leads, due to the increased complexity of the design to allow for both pacing and defibrillation functions. However, it is difficult to separate the relative contribution of materials, lead diameter, lead design, patient factors (eg, younger age, female gender, lower BMI, submuscular pectoral implant, etc) or other as yet unidentified factors with respect to failure rates.</p><p>In a series of 1317 consecutive patients with an ICD placed between 1993 and 2004 who were followed for a median of 6.4 years, 38 patients (2.9 percent) experienced a lead malfunction requiring lead revision, with 29 of the 38 patients (76 percent) experiencing inappropriate ICD therapies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiac-implantable-electronic-devices-long-term-complications/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. The main reasons for lead malfunction were insulation defects (26 percent), artifact oversensing (24 percent), and lead fractures (24 percent). The rate of recurrent ICD lead-related problems was 20 percent at five years. Deaths related to ICD lead failure have been reported but are exceedingly rare [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiac-implantable-electronic-devices-long-term-complications/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2648319020\"><span class=\"h3\">Detecting lead failure</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Lead failure has traditionally most commonly been diagnosed when a patient presents with symptoms related to the failed lead (eg, inappropriate ICD shocks, dizziness or syncope due to failure to pace, etc) and the device parameters are interrogated. Evidence of lead fracture is rarely identified on a chest radiograph. With modern systems, remote CIED follow-up has frequently revealed evidence of lead malfunction before it is manifested clinically. Patients with known hardware under advisory should be followed with remote monitoring in order to detect potential lead failure as soon as possible [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiac-implantable-electronic-devices-long-term-complications/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. </p><p>Devices often have software designed to detect emerging lead problems [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiac-implantable-electronic-devices-long-term-complications/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. For example, one manufacturer's algorithm that combines oversensing and impedance measurements to detect coaxial ICD lead failure found a sensitivity of 83 percent (24 of 29) and a specificity of 100 percent in 667 patients when tested in a population with various lead models [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiac-implantable-electronic-devices-long-term-complications/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. The algorithm was subsequently modified to add features beyond lead failure detection, including a more extensive alerting system and the implementation of real-time, automatic changes to the ventricular fibrillation (VF) detection parameters of the ICD when a lead failure is detected [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiac-implantable-electronic-devices-long-term-complications/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>].

The decision to remove a failed lead, versus capping the lead and leaving it in site (ie, abandoning the lead), is made on a case by case basis, with the decision largely dependent on the perceived <span class=\"nowrap\">risk/benefit</span> ratio, both periprocedural and long-term, in the individual patient. Indications and outcomes for lead removal are discussed separately. Unfortunately, long-term follow-up data comparing outcomes in patients who undergo lead extraction versus capping and abandoning are not currently available.

The frequency of developing significant TR is approximately 10 to 20 percent of persons receiving a CIED device with transvenous leads, ultimately resulting in heart failure symptoms in approximately 50 percent of those with severe TR [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiac-implantable-electronic-devices-long-term-complications/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. In a single-center cohort study of 58,556 patients (including 634 with PPMs; patients with ICDs were excluded from this study) who underwent echocardiograms over a seven-year period from 2005 to 2011, 16 percent of patients with a PPM had severe TR, compared with 2 percent of patients without a PPM [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiac-implantable-electronic-devices-long-term-complications/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. After adjusting for baseline comorbidities, significant TR remained significantly more likely in patients with a PPM (adjusted odds ratio 2.3; 95% CI 1.5-3.5).</p><p>Tricuspid regurgitation has also been reported amongst recipients of bioprosthetic tricuspid valves who subsequently undergo implantation of a permanent pacemaker (PPM) or ICD with a transvenous ventricular lead. In a retrospective cohort study of 323 patients who received a bioprosthetic tricuspid valve (58 patients with a <span class=\"nowrap\">PPM/ICD</span> lead, 265 patients without a lead) and were followed for a mean of over two years, there was a non-significant increase in the rate of moderate or severe TR in patients with a device lead (9 versus 5 percent), rates which compare favorably with the rate of TR development following transvenous lead placement through native tricuspid valves [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiac-implantable-electronic-devices-long-term-complications/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. While the study is limited due to its retrospective, non-randomized nature, these results suggest that transvenous device leads are relatively safe and feasible in patients with a bioprosthetic tricuspid valve. As an alternative, leadless cardiac pacemakers can be considered in this population.

Causes of both increased pacing and defibrillation threshold include lead <span class=\"nowrap\">dislodgement/micro-dislodgement,</span> inflammation around the tip, exit block, lead failure, progression of left ventricular dysfunction and left ventricle (LV) dilatation, and the effects of certain drugs. The defibrillation threshold (DFT, also called defibrillation energy requirement for an ICD) is usually &le;15 joules and often &lt;10 joules with biphasic shocks and improved lead systems. Routine DFT testing has not shown a clinical benefit in patients receiving an ICD for primary prevention. However, when the DFT is high (over 20 joules), high energy devices, reversed energy polarity, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> additional lead placements are used to achieve an adequate safety margin. When these measures fail, an additional defibrillation lead can be placed in the azygous vein (posterior to the heart) to improve the shocking vector. Rarely, placement of a tunneled subcutaneous array or an epicardial lead is required. </p><p>Frequent ICD discharges may produce a secondary increase in DFT due to intense fibrosis and cumulative damage at the ICD electrode-myocardial interface [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiac-implantable-electronic-devices-long-term-complications/abstract/26,27\" class=\"abstract_t\">26,27</a>]. However, in the absence of any changes in the clinical status of the patient, DFTs with current transvenous lead systems are generally stable over time [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiac-implantable-electronic-devices-long-term-complications/abstract/28,29\" class=\"abstract_t\">28,29</a>].</p><p>A more common problem is that patients with frequent appropriate shocks may be treated with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=amiodarone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">amiodarone</a>, which can increase the DFT and also alter the pacing threshold [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiac-implantable-electronic-devices-long-term-complications/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. Older professional society guidelines for amiodarone therapy recommended that, whenever amiodarone was initiated in a patient with an ICD, a noninvasive ICD evaluation or an electrophysiology study should be performed to test for adverse drug-device interactions once loading is complete [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiac-implantable-electronic-devices-long-term-complications/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]. However, a 2015 expert consensus statement did not specifically address the role of DFT testing in patients treated with amiodarone; however, the consensus statement did indicated that it was &quot;reasonable&quot; to omit routine DFT testing for most newly implanted ICD systems as well as for high-risk patients with cardiac comorbidities such as severe pulmonary hypertension or severely depressed left ventricular function (eg, LVEF &lt;20 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiac-implantable-electronic-devices-long-term-complications/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>]. Data supporting this move away from DFT testing in patients receiving amiodarone were reported from the OPTIC trial, in which the increase in DFT related to amiodarone was quite small, calling into question the necessity of verifying the defibrillation safety margin [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiac-implantable-electronic-devices-long-term-complications/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h1\">PULSE GENERATOR COMPLICATIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Long-term complications related to the CIED pulse generator are relatively uncommon, occurring in less than 2 percent of patients, and include skin <span class=\"nowrap\">erosion/infection,</span> device <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> lead migration, tissue necrosis (due to the size and weight of the generator) and electromechanical <span class=\"nowrap\">interference/damage</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiac-implantable-electronic-devices-long-term-complications/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. In addition, periprocedural complications (eg, hematomas, infection) can occur in the pulse generator pocket [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiac-implantable-electronic-devices-long-term-complications/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>].

Because infection of a CIED can be a life-threatening problem, complete removal of the CIED pulse generator and all leads, along with antibiotic therapy, are strongly recommended. In rare instances, a patient may elect to pursue palliative antibiotic therapy; however, such an approach is not curative. These issues are discussed in detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=infections-involving-cardiac-implantable-electronic-devices\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Infections involving cardiac implantable electronic devices&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cardiac-implantable-electronic-device-lead-removal\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Cardiac implantable electronic device lead removal&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Pulse generator infection occurring late (more than six months post-implantation) may be due a chronic, smoldering infection, which can be subclinical for a prolonged period of time. These infections are more common with low virulence organisms such as coagulase negative <em>Staphylococcus</em> species. This can be associated with device erosion through the skin. Though rare, this particular complication is more common amongst thin patients with minimal subcutaneous fat and other tissue overlying the device. Significant weight loss after implant predisposes to this complication. Once the integrity of the skin overlying the device has been compromised, system infection should be assumed, even in the absence of symptoms, and the device (and frequently leads) will need to be removed and replaced. Repeated device infection should also raise concern for potential allergy to device components, which can rarely occur. In cases of suspected device component allergies, skin testing with specialized panels should be performed by a dermatologist or allergist. </p><p>In patients who are at high risk for pocket infection, prophylactic use of a dissolving antibiotic pouch around the device may be useful. Randomized clinical trials are underway to test the efficacy of such an approach [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiac-implantable-electronic-devices-long-term-complications/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14\"><span class=\"h2\">Twiddler's syndrome</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Twiddler's syndrome is a condition in which twisting or rotating the CIED pulse generator within its pocket results in lead dislodgement and device malfunction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiac-implantable-electronic-devices-long-term-complications/abstract/36,37\" class=\"abstract_t\">36,37</a>]. Affected patients most often present with an increase in bradycardic pacing threshold or lead impedance, although pacemaker-dependent patients may present with symptoms related to bradyarrhythmia (eg, syncope, lightheadedness, etc). In patients with ventricular lead dislodgement and retraction, it is also possible that an ICD will fail to sense and treat an arrhythmia. Careful suturing of the lead suture sleeves, suturing the device to the fascia, using a nonabsorbable antimicrobial pouch, warning the patient not to manipulate the device, and ensuring appropriate pocket size are important proactive steps to reduce the likelihood of this complication [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiac-implantable-electronic-devices-long-term-complications/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15\"><span class=\"h2\">Electronic circuit damage</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Device failures are uncommon, with reports estimating an incidence between 0.01 and 0.1 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiac-implantable-electronic-devices-long-term-complications/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>].

Signs of such failure include loss of telemetry and inability to deliver therapy. Electrical overstress damage may occur during capacitor reformation or charging and the delivery of a shock, after cardioversion, or rarely with the use of electrocautery. It is recommended that routine follow-up examination of device function be performed in these settings. Radiation therapy can damage circuitry as well. Current recommendations include shielding the device from the radiation beam and careful follow-up, particularly in pacemaker-dependent patients.

The most common cause of inappropriate shocks are supraventricular tachyarrhythmia (SVT), including sinus tachycardia, atrial fibrillation, and other rapid supraventricular arrhythmias, which result in a ventricular heart rate that falls within a programmed treatment zone [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiac-implantable-electronic-devices-long-term-complications/abstract/44,48\" class=\"abstract_t\">44,48</a>]. Other causes of inappropriate shocks include electrical noise, inappropriate sensing (ie, T wave oversensing), and ICD malfunction (typically due to lead fracture). Patients who receive inappropriate shocks may become quite anxious or uncomfortable since the most common causes of inappropriate shocks (SVT and lead fracture) often result in the delivery of multiple shocks. </p><p>While inappropriate shocks due to lead fracture or other device malfunction are difficult to predict (and therefore prevent), the frequency of inappropriate shocks not related to lead malfunction (ie, those related to SVT) can usually be reduced with modern ICD programming strategies. The recommended modern approach to ICD programming is discussed in detail separately. </p><p>In addition to modern device programming (eg, high rate cutoffs, longer delays prior to initiating treatment), other device features such as arrhythmia discrimination and the placement of an atrial lead may reduce the frequency of inappropriate shocks [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiac-implantable-electronic-devices-long-term-complications/abstract/18,50\" class=\"abstract_t\">18,50</a>]. </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Dual chamber devices have an atrial lead for sensing, which allows for more effective discrimination between atrial and ventricular arrhythmias, with appropriate programming, dual chamber ICDs have been shown to decrease inappropriate detection compared with single chamber devices [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiac-implantable-electronic-devices-long-term-complications/abstract/51\" class=\"abstract_t\">51</a>]. However, device programming to limit unnecessary therapies may be more important than dual-chamber devices [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiac-implantable-electronic-devices-long-term-complications/abstract/52\" class=\"abstract_t\">52</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Modern devices nearly universally contain proprietary arrhythmia discrimination software, which aims to accurately discriminate between various atrial tachyarrhythmias (eg, atrial tachycardia, atrial flutter, and atrial fibrillation) and ventricular tachyarrhythmias.</p><p/><p>While there are conflicting data on an association between inappropriate shocks and mortality, most studies suggest a 1.5-to-2-fold increase in mortality among recipients of an inappropriate shock [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiac-implantable-electronic-devices-long-term-complications/abstract/44-46,53\" class=\"abstract_t\">44-46,53</a>]. As an example, among patients in the ALTITUDE study who received inappropriate shocks, those who were shocked for atrial fibrillation or atrial flutter had significantly increased mortality (hazard ratio [HR] 1.6 compared with those without any ICD shock), while those who were shocked for other supraventricular tachyarrhythmias or sinus tachycardia had no difference in mortality (HR 1.0 compared with no ICD shock) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiac-implantable-electronic-devices-long-term-complications/abstract/48\" class=\"abstract_t\">48</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H18\"><span class=\"h2\">Appropriate shocks</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Appropriately-delivered ICD shocks for ventricular tachyarrhythmias are not technically a complication but rather the intended response of the device.

(See <a href=\"#H25\" class=\"local\">'Quality of life'</a> below and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=driving-restrictions-in-patients-with-an-implantable-cardioverter-defibrillator#H4\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Driving restrictions in patients with an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator&quot;, section on 'Overall incidence of ventricular arrhythmias and ICD shocks'</a>.)</p><p>In a systematic review of seven trials of primary and secondary prevention of sudden cardiac death (SCD), appropriate ICD therapies outnumbered SCD events in the control groups by a factor of two to three [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiac-implantable-electronic-devices-long-term-complications/abstract/54\" class=\"abstract_t\">54</a>]. Subsequent studies have clarified that the likely reason for this discrepancy in outcomes relates to the treatment of arrhythmias that would have been hemodynamically tolerated <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> terminated spontaneously (ie, nonfatal events). Strategies to reduce the number of appropriate shocks include high rate cutoffs for delivering a shock, longer delays prior to initiating treatment, and antitachycardia pacing (ATP), which should terminate at least 90 percent of episodes of persistent VT [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiac-implantable-electronic-devices-long-term-complications/abstract/55,56\" class=\"abstract_t\">55,56</a>].

While the underlying reason for experiencing a phantom shock is not known, patients who do report phantom shocks are more likely to have received an actual ICD shock (and thus may have continued worry about receiving another shock) or to suffer from unrelated anxiety or depression [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiac-implantable-electronic-devices-long-term-complications/abstract/58,59\" class=\"abstract_t\">58,59</a>]. The optimal strategy to manage phantom shocks depends on the patient. For those who have continued worry about phantom shocks, counseling or pharmacotherapy may be necessary to address the patient's anxiety. For some patients, careful follow-up or transtelephonic monitoring may be valuable. Frequent follow-up and further discussions with the electrophysiologist may be necessary, but over time, symptoms tend to abate without the need for unnecessary interventions or the need to turn the device off.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H22\"><span class=\"h1\">MISCELLANEOUS COMPLICATIONS</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3499673509\"><span class=\"h2\">Heart failure</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>CIEDs may worsen left ventricular function <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> precipitate symptomatic heart failure (HF), particularly in patients with pre-existing systolic dysfunction, by one of two mechanisms:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Right ventricular pacing, producing ventricular dyssynchrony.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Improved long-term survival in patients with advanced cardiac disease can result in patients living long enough for HF to develop or progress.</p><p/><p>These issues are discussed in detail separately.
