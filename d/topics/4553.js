The surgery is also known as &quot;bypass surgery&quot; or as &quot;CABG&quot; (pronounced &quot;cabbage&quot;).</p><p>In people who have coronary heart disease, the arteries that supply blood to the heart get clogged with fatty deposits (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F61785\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef61785 \">figure 1</a>). This can block the flow of blood to parts of the heart muscle.</p><p>During bypass surgery, the surgeon uses healthy pieces of blood vessels from other parts of the body (called grafts) to re-route blood. Sometimes the surgeon does this by attaching a graft above and below a blockage, creating a bridge over the blockage. Other times, the surgeon redirects an artery that is supposed to supply the chest muscle and attaches it to the heart. These types of grafts allow blood to get past blockages and to the heart muscle that was not getting enough blood (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F73589\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef73589 \">figure 2</a>).</p><p>In many cases, a doctor can first try something called &quot;stent placement&quot; to treat coronary heart disease. This involves putting a thin plastic tube into the blocked artery, and using a tiny balloon to open the blockage. Then the doctor leaves a tiny mesh tube called a &quot;stent&quot; inside the artery to hold it open. Bypass surgery is usually recommended for people with coronary heart disease who:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Continue to have chest pain that does not get better with medicines, and angioplasty with stenting is not possible (or has already failed); <strong>or</strong></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Have blockages that a doctor thinks could lead to heart attack or death</p><p/><p>If your doctor recommends bypass surgery, ask these questions:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>How might this procedure help me?</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Will it help me live longer?</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Will it reduce my chance of having a heart attack?</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Will I feel better if I have this procedure than I would with medicines alone?</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>What are the risks of the procedure for me?</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>What happens if I don't have this procedure?</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H73855349\"><span class=\"h1\">How do I prepare for bypass surgery?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>You will get detailed instructions from the hospital on how to prepare for your surgery. In general, you will need to stop eating by midnight the night before the surgery. You might also need to stop taking certain medicines several days before the surgery. Otherwise, you will not need to change much of your routine before the surgery.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H73855332\"><span class=\"h1\">What happens during bypass surgery?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Before the surgery you will be given medicines (called anesthesia) to help you relax and then to make you unconscious. That way you will not be aware of what happens during the surgery.</p><p>After you are unconscious, the surgeon will make a cut in the skin over your breastbone, then split the breastbone to get at your heart. He or she will also cut out the piece or pieces of blood vessels that will be used as grafts. This could mean that the surgeon will need to make cuts in your arm, leg, belly, or within the chest itself.</p><p>When the surgeon is ready to attach the grafts, he or she will need to stop your heart for a short time. While your heart is stopped, a machine called the heart-lung machine will take over the work of your heart. The machine will keep blood flowing throughout your body. After the surgeon sews on the grafts, he or she can restart your heart and take you off the heart-lung machine. The breastbone and skin are put back together.</p><p>With one type of bypass surgery, called &quot;minimally invasive bypass surgery&quot; or &quot;off-pump surgery,&quot; your surgery might be different from that described above. These approaches use a smaller chest incision and are done with the heart still beating. But they are not appropriate for all bypass situations and are not necessarily &quot;better&quot; than traditional surgery.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H73855315\"><span class=\"h1\">What happens after bypass surgery?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>You will spend 1 to 2 days in an intensive care unit (also called an &quot;ICU&quot;). While in the ICU, you will be connected to machines that will monitor your heart, blood pressure, body temperature, and breathing. As you get stronger, you will need fewer and fewer of these machines. You might also have a number of tubes to help you breathe, urinate, and do other normal body functions. These will gradually be removed as you improve. When you are ready to leave the ICU, you will go to a regular hospital room for another couple of days.</p><p>The wound from the surgery will be sore for 2 to 3 days, but you will get pain medicines to deal with that. You will also have some tubes draining fluid from your chest.</p><p>During the few days after surgery, it is normal to have a poor appetite, be constipated, and have trouble sleeping. Give yourself time to get back to normal.</p><p>If you had a graft taken from your leg, you might notice some swelling in that leg after surgery. Elevating the leg and wearing special socks called &quot;compression stockings&quot; can help to reduce swelling.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H73855298\"><span class=\"h1\">What problems can happen after bypass surgery?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Most people do extremely well with bypass surgery, but there are a number of problems that can happen. The chances that any of them will affect you will depend on a lot of different factors, so ask your own doctor about the risks for you. In general, the most serious risks of bypass include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Major bleeding</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Heart attack</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Heart failure, which is when the heart cannot pump enough blood</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A heartbeat that is too fast or too slow</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Stroke</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Confusion and trouble thinking clearly</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Lung problems</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Wound infection (either in the chest or the body part where the grafts were taken)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Kidney failure</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Depression</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Death</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H73855283\"><span class=\"h1\">What will my recovery be like?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>To learn about recovery from bypass surgery, see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=recovery-after-coronary-artery-bypass-graft-surgery-cabg-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Recovery after coronary artery bypass graft surgery (CABG) (The Basics)</a>.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H73855267\"><span class=\"h1\">More on this topic</span></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=recovery-after-coronary-artery-bypass-graft-surgery-cabg-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Recovery after coronary artery bypass graft surgery (CABG) (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=coronary-heart-disease-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Coronary heart disease (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=coronary-heart-disease-in-women-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Coronary heart disease in women (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-choices-for-angina-chest-pain-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Treatment choices for angina (chest pain) (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=heart-attack-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Heart attack (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=medicines-after-a-heart-attack-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Medicines after a heart attack (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=heart-attack-recovery-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Heart attack recovery (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=what-can-go-wrong-after-a-heart-attack-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: What can go wrong after a heart attack?
