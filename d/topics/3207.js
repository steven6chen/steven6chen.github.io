The polyethylene glycol increases its plasma half-life and reduces the requirement for frequent dosing, possibly reducing immunogenicity as well. In vitro studies suggest that certolizumab also has a higher binding affinity for TNF as compared with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=adalimumab-including-biosimilars-of-adalimumab-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">adalimumab</a> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=infliximab-including-biosimilars-of-infliximab-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">infliximab</a> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/certolizumab-pegol-for-treatment-of-crohn-disease-in-adults/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p>Unlike anti-TNF monoclonal antibodies, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=certolizumab-pegol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">certolizumab pegol</a> does not have a Fc region; as a result, it does not activate the complement pathway, result in cell- or antibody-mediated cytotoxicity, or induce apoptosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/certolizumab-pegol-for-treatment-of-crohn-disease-in-adults/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].

Certolizumab is also available in Canada and European Union countries; however, it is not approved for the management of Crohn disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/certolizumab-pegol-for-treatment-of-crohn-disease-in-adults/abstract/3,4\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,4</a>].</p><p>Contraindications to certolizumab are the same as other TNF-alpha inhibitors and are discussed separately.

In one of the largest trials (Pegylated Antibody Fragment Evaluation in Crohn's Disease: Safety and Efficacy [PRECiSE] 1) included in the meta-analysis, 662 patients with moderate-to-severe active Crohn disease were randomly assigned to receive certolizumab pegol (400 mg) or placebo at weeks 0, 2, 4, and then every four weeks [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/certolizumab-pegol-for-treatment-of-crohn-disease-in-adults/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. The primary endpoints were induction of a response at week 6 and a response at both weeks 6 and 26. Response rates at weeks 6 and 26 were significantly higher in the certolizumab group as compared with placebo (35 versus 27 and 23 versus 16 percent, respectively). Response rates were increased in a subset of patients with a baseline serum C-reactive protein (CRP) level of at least 10 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/L</span>. However, rates of remission did not differ significantly between the groups or in the subset of patients with higher CRP levels.

The 428 patients (64 percent) who responded were randomly assigned to continue treatment (continuous therapy) or receive placebo (drug interruption) until a total of 26 weeks.

In an open-label trial (PRECiSE 4), patients who relapsed while on continuous therapy with certolizumab received treatment with a single extra dose and patients who relapsed after certolizumab interruption received certolizumab at weeks 0, 2, 4, and then every four weeks [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/certolizumab-pegol-for-treatment-of-crohn-disease-in-adults/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>].

The efficacy of certolizumab is highest in patients receiving it as a first-line therapy. However, certolizumab as a second- or third-line anti-TNF agent can still produce a significant benefit [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/certolizumab-pegol-for-treatment-of-crohn-disease-in-adults/abstract/15-18\" class=\"abstract_t\">15-18</a>]. An analysis of the PRECiSE 2 data suggested that individuals with prior treatment with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=infliximab-including-biosimilars-of-infliximab-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">infliximab</a> responded at week 26 at a higher rate as compared with patients receiving placebo (response: 44 versus 25 percent; remission: 33 versus 14 percent) but not as robustly as infliximab-na&iuml;ve patients (response: 69 versus 40 percent; remission: 53 versus 33 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/certolizumab-pegol-for-treatment-of-crohn-disease-in-adults/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>].
