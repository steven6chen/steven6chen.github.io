Blastomycosis of the lung can be an asymptomatic infection or can manifest as acute or chronic pneumonia. Hematogenous dissemination frequently occurs; extrapulmonary disease of the skin, bones, and genitourinary system is common, but almost any organ can be infected.</p><p>The basic mycology, pathogenesis, and epidemiology of blastomycosis will be reviewed here. The clinical manifestations and treatment of blastomycosis are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-blastomycosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of blastomycosis&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-blastomycosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of blastomycosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">MYCOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Phylogenetic analysis of 78 clinical and environmental isolates of <em>B. dermatitidis</em> from different geographic regions has revealed two distinct species of the fungus, <em>B. dermatitidis</em> and <em>B. gilchristii</em> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mycology-pathogenesis-and-epidemiology-of-blastomycosis/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. <em>B. gilchristii</em> was isolated from two North American locations known to be hyperendemic for blastomycosis, the Kenora region of Ontario and the Eagle River region of Wisconsin. There is speculation as to whether the high rates of infection in these areas might be due to <em>B. gilchristii</em> being a more pathogenic species or whether favorable environmental factors allowed emergence of this species. </p><p>The natural habitat of 169 strains of organisms collected from various geographic areas were examined with 25 microsatellite loci for phylogeographic analysis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mycology-pathogenesis-and-epidemiology-of-blastomycosis/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. <em>B. gilchristii</em> strains were found only in isolates from Canada and some northern states in the US, while <em>B. dermatitidis</em> were from those same locations, plus along the Mississippi River drainage system and in southeastern states. Both were closely linked to freshwater drainage systems, and the diversity was speculated to have begun with receding glaciers covering much of North America in the Pleistocene epoch [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mycology-pathogenesis-and-epidemiology-of-blastomycosis/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. </p><p>Clinically, the organisms appear to cause similar clinical illness and will be referred to as <em>B. dermatitidis</em> hereafter. <em>B. dermatitidis</em> refers to both the sexual and asexual stage of the organism. Previously, <em>Ajellomyces dermatitidis </em>was the name of the sexual stage of the organism, and <em>B. dermatitidis</em> was the name for the asexual state of the organism. Production of a sexual spore requires fusion of the nucleus of a positive type with a negative, the so-called heterothallic property; both mating types are equally capable of causing infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mycology-pathogenesis-and-epidemiology-of-blastomycosis/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].</p><p>Two serotypes of <em>B. dermatitidis</em> have been identified based upon the presence or absence of the A antigen. In a study of 102 isolates predominantly from North America, all of the North American isolates reacted with anti-A antibody, while 11 of 12 isolates from Africa failed to react [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mycology-pathogenesis-and-epidemiology-of-blastomycosis/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. Serologic differences in <em>B. dermatitidis</em> isolates from different geographic location in the United States and Africa have been detected using an enzyme-linked immunoassay, indicating that different genotypic groups exist [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mycology-pathogenesis-and-epidemiology-of-blastomycosis/abstract/5-7\" class=\"abstract_t\">5-7</a>].</p><p><em>B. dermatitidis</em> exhibits thermal dimorphism, growing as the mycelial phase at room temperature and as the yeast phase at 37&ordm;C. Primary isolation is most dependable for the mycelial phase; colonies usually appear after one to three weeks of incubation at 30&ordm;C. The mycelial colonies initially grow as a white mold that slowly turns light brown. The branching hyphae are 2 to 3 microns in diameter and have right angle conidiophores with a single round or oval terminal conidium. Early identification of mycelial cultures is possible using commercial test kits that identify fungal specific exoantigens or by chemiluminescent DNA probes that recognize unique rRNA sequences [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mycology-pathogenesis-and-epidemiology-of-blastomycosis/abstract/8,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,9</a>].</p><p><em>B. dermatitidis</em> changes into the yeast phase at 37&ordm;C. This dimorphism appears to result from a hybrid histidine kinase, which senses host signals and causes the mycelial to yeast shift of <em>B. dermatitidis</em> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mycology-pathogenesis-and-epidemiology-of-blastomycosis/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. The wrinkled yeast colonies are cream or tan in color.</p><p>Yeast cells, usually 8 to 15 microns in diameter, have a thick refractile cell wall (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F62300\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef62300 \">picture 1</a>) and are multinucleate (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F66379\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef66379 \">picture 2</a>). Reproduction is by a single broad-based bud (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F63105\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef63105 \">picture 3</a>); the daughter cell is often as large as the mother cell before detachment.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">PATHOGENESIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Blastomycosis infection begins with the inhalation of the conidia of <em>B. dermatitidis</em>. Following inhalation, conidia can undergo nonspecific phagocytosis and killing mediated by polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMN), monocytes, and alveolar macrophages. In contrast, the yeast forms of the organism are more resistant to phagocytosis and killing. As an example, PMN can ingest conidia and kill approximately 50 percent, compared with 20 percent killing of yeast, which are too large for ingestion and are killed by PMN attachment and degranulation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mycology-pathogenesis-and-epidemiology-of-blastomycosis/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. Conidia, the infectious stage, are converted to the yeast phase in tissue. This conversion results in a survival advantage and probably contributes to infection by <em>B. dermatitidis</em>.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Virulence factors</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Most dimorphic fungi grow as nonpathogenic molds in the environment and convert to pathogenic yeast in the host, suggesting that virulence factors are important for this phase change [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mycology-pathogenesis-and-epidemiology-of-blastomycosis/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. The cell wall of the yeast form of <em>B. dermatitidis</em> is the most well-studied virulence factor for the organism. The cell wall is quite thick, which contributes to its resistance to phagocytosis. The lipid and phospholipid content of the yeast cell wall have also been associated with virulence [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mycology-pathogenesis-and-epidemiology-of-blastomycosis/abstract/13,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,14</a>].</p><p>Conversion of <em>B. dermatitidis</em> to the yeast form induces the expression of an essential virulence factor, BAD-1 (formerly WI-1), a 120 kd glycoprotein adhesion and immune modulator of <em>B. dermatitidis</em> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mycology-pathogenesis-and-epidemiology-of-blastomycosis/abstract/12,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,15</a>]. BAD-1 is expressed on the cell surface and is released into the extracellular matrix [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mycology-pathogenesis-and-epidemiology-of-blastomycosis/abstract/12,16\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,16</a>]. Yeast phase-specific gene expression of BAD-1 is transcriptionally regulated and its promoter shares homology with that of the yeast phase-specific gene of <em>Histoplasma capsulatum</em> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mycology-pathogenesis-and-epidemiology-of-blastomycosis/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. BAD-1 functions as an adhesin that can bind to CR3 and CD14 of human macrophages [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mycology-pathogenesis-and-epidemiology-of-blastomycosis/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. It contains a cysteine-rich domain at its carboxy terminal end that is similar to epidermal growth factor (EGF) and may mediate binding to extracellular matrix [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mycology-pathogenesis-and-epidemiology-of-blastomycosis/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. The C terminal EGF-like domain is required for BAD-1 localization to yeast surfaces during cell wall biogenesis.</p><p>One group of investigators utilized a recombinant strain of <em>B. dermatitidis</em> that lacked BAD-1 (WI-1) and was not pathogenic in animals as a live-attenuated vaccine in mice; administration of the vaccine strain induced a cellular immune response by CD4+ and CD8+ type 1 (T1) cells and protected animals against lethal experimental pulmonary infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mycology-pathogenesis-and-epidemiology-of-blastomycosis/abstract/20,21\" class=\"abstract_t\">20,21</a>]. Although interleukin (IL)-12 was absolutely required for cellular immunity, a differential dependency was noted in that CD4+ T cells required IL-12 whereas CD8+ T cells were less dependent on this cytokine. However, once CD4+ and CD8+ T cells have acquired a protective T1 phenotype, the presence of IL-12 was not necessary for maintenance of protective memory [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mycology-pathogenesis-and-epidemiology-of-blastomycosis/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>].</p><p>The results of these studies indicate that developing a vaccine to prevent disease in humans is possible. Potential candidates for such a vaccine might include those at high risk of developing blastomycosis such as woodsmen, veterinarians, and immunocompromised hosts living in endemic areas. Although these animal studies are promising, this vaccine strain has not yet been tested in humans.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H406008341\"><span class=\"h2\">Genotype</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In one study, microsatellite genotyping was performed on 227 isolates of <em>B. dermatitidis</em> from Wisconsin collected over a 10-year period, and the genotype (group 1 or 2) was correlated to clinical phenotype [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mycology-pathogenesis-and-epidemiology-of-blastomycosis/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. On univariate analysis, genotype group 1 isolates were more likely to be associated with pulmonary-only infections and constitutional symptoms such as fever, whereas genotype group 2 isolates were more likely to be associated with disseminated disease, older age, and the presence of comorbidities. However, on multivariate analysis, only time from disease onset to diagnosis of &gt;1 month, older age, and cigarette smoking were found to be independently associated with group 2 genotype infections. It is possible that the associations observed on univariate analysis were not detected on multivariate analysis due to inadequate sample size. Additional research needs to be done to determine whether an association exists between genotype and clinical manifestations.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Host defense</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The major acquired host defense against <em>B. dermatitidis</em> is cellular immunity, which is mediated by antigen-specific T lymphocytes and lymphokine-activated macrophages. Subcutaneous injections of live or killed <em>B. dermatitidis</em> in mice induces cellular immunity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mycology-pathogenesis-and-epidemiology-of-blastomycosis/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>], and resistance to infection parallels the development of the cellular immune response, including delayed-type hypersensitivity and proliferative responses in splenocytes and lymph node cells [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mycology-pathogenesis-and-epidemiology-of-blastomycosis/abstract/24,25\" class=\"abstract_t\">24,25</a>]. The development of antigen-induced lymphocyte proliferation has been documented clinically with a variety of <em>Blastomyces</em> antigens [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mycology-pathogenesis-and-epidemiology-of-blastomycosis/abstract/26-28\" class=\"abstract_t\">26-28</a>].</p><p>In contrast with cellular immunity, specific antibody against <em>B. dermatitidis</em> does not appear to confer resistance to or hasten recovery from clinical infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mycology-pathogenesis-and-epidemiology-of-blastomycosis/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h1\">EPIDEMIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Our knowledge of the epidemiology of blastomycosis remains incomplete because of the lack of well-characterized antigens for skin testing or for seroepidemiologic studies. Current information on the epidemiology of blastomycosis is based upon clinical reports of sporadic cases in humans and dogs and the study of point source outbreaks of disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mycology-pathogenesis-and-epidemiology-of-blastomycosis/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>].</p><p>Most cases of blastomycosis have been reported in North America. Endemic areas include the southeastern and south-central states bordering the Mississippi and Ohio River basins, the midwestern states and Canadian provinces bordering the Great Lakes, and a small area in New York and Canada along the St. Lawrence River and the Nelson River. There have been more reports of sporadic blastomycosis in Ontario, Manitoba, and Wisconsin in recent years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mycology-pathogenesis-and-epidemiology-of-blastomycosis/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. Outside of North America, blastomycosis has been reported most frequently in Africa, with occasional cases identified in Mexico, Central and South America, India, and the Middle East.</p><p>The expression of clinical disease differs between African strains and others. One report of two different serotypes of <em>B. dermatitidis</em> from Africa showed that serotype 2 strains lacked the coding sequence for the surface protein adhesin WI-1 in their genome, which may contribute to the observed differences in strain behavior [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mycology-pathogenesis-and-epidemiology-of-blastomycosis/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>].</p><p>Outbreaks or epidemics of blastomycosis have been reported and have often been associated with waterways [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mycology-pathogenesis-and-epidemiology-of-blastomycosis/abstract/29,30\" class=\"abstract_t\">29,30</a>]. An outbreak of blastomycosis occurred in Indianapolis, Indiana, between 2005 and 2008; 34 cases were diagnosed during this time and coincided with major highway projects in the same region [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mycology-pathogenesis-and-epidemiology-of-blastomycosis/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>]. The peak incidence was 1.15 cases per 100,000 population in 2006, compared with 0.12 per 100,000 population in 2003.</p><p>A large outbreak of 55 cases of blastomycosis occurred in Marathon County in North Central Wisconsin in 2009 and 2010 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mycology-pathogenesis-and-epidemiology-of-blastomycosis/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>]. Among patients in the outbreak, 65 percent were male and 45 percent were of Hmong ethnicity, the predominant Asian group in the affected county. The overall incidence of blastomycosis increased significantly since 2005 (average 11 percent increase per year), and the incidence was significantly higher among Asians than non-Asians (2010 incidence: 168 versus 13 per 100,000 population). Since 2005, the incidence of blastomycosis increased more than 500 percent among the Hmong population in this region. When cases that were clustered in households and neighborhoods were compared with controls from the same households and neighborhoods that did not have blastomycosis, Hmong ethnicity and having a chronic medical condition were independently associated with development of blastomycosis. Exposures usually associated with increased risk for blastomycosis were not seen in the Asian cases. These observations raise the question as to whether there is a genetic predisposition leading to infection with <em>B. dermatitidis</em> among the Hmong.</p><p>Despite early studies of endemic cases, which indicated that middle-aged men with outdoor occupations were at greatest risk for blastomycosis, review of most reported outbreaks indicates no sex, age, occupation, or seasonal predilection for blastomycosis. Exposure to soil, whether related to work or recreation, appears to be the common factor associated with both endemic and epidemic disease.</p><p>Two reports of reviews of records from hospitalized patients with a diagnosis of blastomycosis have been published [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mycology-pathogenesis-and-epidemiology-of-blastomycosis/abstract/34,35\" class=\"abstract_t\">34,35</a>]. The first was performed using the State Inpatient Database from the United States Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) from 46 states [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mycology-pathogenesis-and-epidemiology-of-blastomycosis/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>]. Men accounted for 64 percent of cases, and the median age was 53. The incidence of hospitalization due to infection with this fungus was similar to previous reports from endemic areas in states within the Mississippi and Ohio River valleys. Illinois and Kentucky had the highest increase in incidence between 2001 and 2011, whereas Wisconsin had the highest age-adjusted hospitalization incidence of 2.9 hospitalizations per 100,000 patient-years. Not all patients diagnosed with blastomycosis are hospitalized, so this report represents only a subset of infected patients since not all patients require hospitalization.</p><p>The ecology of blastomycosis has not been completely defined because of the difficulty in isolating the organism in nature. However, the environmental isolation of <em>B. dermatitidis</em> in association with two outbreaks of disease has been instrumental in clarifying the ecologic niche of the organism [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mycology-pathogenesis-and-epidemiology-of-blastomycosis/abstract/35,36\" class=\"abstract_t\">35,36</a>]. In both studies, <em>Blastomyces </em>was isolated from soil containing decaying vegetation or from decomposed wood. The recent rainfall and the proximity to water noted in both outbreaks support the concept that humidity is important in promoting growth of the organism. A variety of wood by-products and animal waste substrates, in combination, support the growth of <em>B. dermatitidis </em>[<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mycology-pathogenesis-and-epidemiology-of-blastomycosis/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>].</p><p>Thus, <em>B. dermatitidis</em> probably grows as microfoci in the warm, moist soil of wooded areas rich in organic debris. The conditions that support growth of <em>Blastomyces</em> in these microfoci probably exist for only a short time. When a sporadic case or outbreak is identified, a possible explanation for the inability to isolate the organism in the environment is that the conditions that promote growth may no longer exist at the site of exposure.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H376964238\"><span class=\"h1\">SUMMARY</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Blastomycosis is a systemic pyogranulomatous infection, primarily involving the lungs, that arises after inhalation of the conidia of <em>Blastomyces dermatitidis</em>.
