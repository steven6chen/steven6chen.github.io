However, other observations have shown that ACD can be seen in a variety of conditions, including chronic kidney disease, severe trauma, diabetes mellitus, anemia of older adults, and in those with acute or chronic immune activation. The anemia is typically normochromic, normocytic, hypoproliferative, and mild in degree.</p><p>The pathogenesis, laboratory findings, and treatment of ACD will be reviewed here. An overview of the approach to the adult patient with anemia is presented separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=approach-to-the-adult-with-anemia\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Approach to the adult with anemia&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">PATHOGENESIS</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Overview</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>ACD is thought to primarily reflect a reduction in red blood cell (RBC) production by the bone marrow, with a component due to mild shortening of RBC survival [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anemia-of-chronic-disease-inflammation/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>]. A number of factors are thought to contribute to this hypoproliferative state [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anemia-of-chronic-disease-inflammation/abstract/3,4\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,4</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Hepcidin-induced alterations in iron metabolism, including reduced absorption of iron from the gastrointestinal tract and trapping of iron in macrophages. This results in reduced plasma iron levels (hypoferremia), making iron unavailable for new hemoglobin synthesis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anemia-of-chronic-disease-inflammation/abstract/5-7\" class=\"abstract_t\">5-7</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Hepcidin'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Inability to increase erythropoiesis in response to anemia. Serum erythropoietin (EPO) levels are somewhat elevated in ACD, but there is virtually no increase in erythropoiesis, perhaps due to increased apoptotic death of red cell precursors within the bone marrow [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anemia-of-chronic-disease-inflammation/abstract/3,8,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,8,9</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A relative decrease in EPO production. The inverse relationship between hematocrit levels and serum EPO seen in most anemic conditions (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F53916\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef53916 \">figure 1</a>) is not maintained in ACD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anemia-of-chronic-disease-inflammation/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. As an example, patients with ACD have lower levels of EPO than do patients with iron deficiency and a similar degree of anemia.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A minor component of ACD is due to decreased red cell survival. Shortening of red cell life span may occur in cases of acute inflammation characterized by increased macrophage activity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anemia-of-chronic-disease-inflammation/abstract/10,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,11</a>].</p><p/><p>A large number of conditions have been associated with ACD, including infections, inflammatory disorders, malignancy, trauma, diabetes mellitus, aging, and acute or chronic immune activation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anemia-of-chronic-disease-inflammation/abstract/10,12-16\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,12-16</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">The role of cytokines</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Why the above-noted changes occur is becoming increasingly understood. It has been suggested that the underlying inflammatory medical condition causes the release of cytokines such as the interleukins (eg, IL-1 and IL-6) and tumor necrosis factor (TNF-alpha) by activated monocytes; these cytokines unleash a cascade including the secretion of interferon (IFN)-beta and IFN-gamma by T lymphocytes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anemia-of-chronic-disease-inflammation/abstract/17,18\" class=\"abstract_t\">17,18</a>]. As an example, IFN-gamma, when given to experimental animals, or when its formation is stimulated in vivo, can produce the picture of ACD with most of the abnormalities noted above [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anemia-of-chronic-disease-inflammation/abstract/3,19-22\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,19-22</a>].</p><p>The decreased bone marrow responsiveness to erythropoietin is mediated by inflammatory cytokines, especially IL-1 beta and TNF-alpha [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anemia-of-chronic-disease-inflammation/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>], which may induce apoptosis of red cells precursors as well as downregulation of erythropoietin receptors on progenitor cells. Cytokines may also decrease erythropoietin expression by renal cells [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anemia-of-chronic-disease-inflammation/abstract/13,23,24\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,23,24</a>]. In vitro treatment of cultured cells with proinflammatory cytokines can also alter ferritin and transferrin receptor expression and iron-responsive protein activity, inducing iron retention in macrophages [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anemia-of-chronic-disease-inflammation/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. However, iron metabolism in ACD is mainly altered via overproduction of hepcidin [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anemia-of-chronic-disease-inflammation/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>].</p><p>In support of these mechanisms are three clinical observations:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Treatment of patients with rheumatoid arthritis using an anti-TNF-alpha antibody led to a reduction in IL-6 levels, a decrease in the proportion of apoptotic red cell precursors, and an improvement in anemia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anemia-of-chronic-disease-inflammation/abstract/9,26,27\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,26,27</a>].

Evidence from transgenic mouse models and human genetic disorders indicates that hepcidin is the predominant negative regulator of iron absorption in the small intestine, iron transport across the placenta, as well as iron release from macrophages [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anemia-of-chronic-disease-inflammation/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>], secondary to its effect on internalization and degradation of the iron export protein ferroportin (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=regulation-of-iron-balance#H16\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Regulation of iron balance&quot;, section on 'Hepcidin'</a>). The complex relationships between hepcidin and different types of infections have been reviewed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anemia-of-chronic-disease-inflammation/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>].</p><p>One effect of hepcidin is to remove non-transferrin-bound iron (NTBI; a form of extracellular iron) from the circulation.
