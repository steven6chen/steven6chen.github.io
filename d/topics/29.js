Abdominal hysterectomy refers to removal of the uterus via a laparotomy. Either total hysterectomy (uterus including cervix) or subtotal (supracervical) hysterectomy may be performed. The ovaries may or may not be removed at the time of hysterectomy. The choice of surgical approach depends upon clinical circumstances, the surgeon's technical expertise, and patient preference. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=choosing-a-route-of-hysterectomy-for-benign-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Choosing a route of hysterectomy for benign disease&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Issues related to abdominal hysterectomy will be reviewed here. Other approaches to hysterectomy are discussed separately.

If a woman has a previous vertical abdominal surgical scar, most surgeons prefer to use this incision. However, if the planned procedure can be accomplished via a transverse incision, it is also an option to ask a patient if she would prefer a transverse incision (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F63560\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef63560 \">figure 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F68150\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef68150 \">figure 2</a>).

If a prior incision exists, most surgeons prefer to use this incision. If the prior scar is cosmetically unacceptable, it may be excised at the beginning or end of the procedure. This is easily accomplished by elevating the old scar with Allis clamps and making an elliptical incision around the old scar. (See <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Choice of incision'</a> above and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=incisions-for-open-abdominal-surgery\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Incisions for open abdominal surgery&quot;</a>.) </p><p>The peritoneal cavity is entered and the upper abdomen and pelvis explored for unexpected pathology and to confirm preoperative findings. Peritoneal washings may be collected for cytologic analysis if a malignancy is suspected.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15\"><span class=\"h2\">Exposure</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Most surgeons prefer to use a self-retaining retractor for an abdominal hysterectomy, although use of hand held retractors is an option. The type of self-retaining retractor used depends on surgeon preference. With very large masses, it is often impossible to place a retractor until the mass has been mobilized and freed from adhesions. </p><p>When positioning retractors, it is important to avoid placing the lateral blades over a femoral nerve as it emerges lateral to the psoas muscle, since this can lead to a peripheral neuropathy. Surgical personnel should not lean on the retractors for the same reason. Safe placement is assured by lifting the abdominal wall as the retractor is placed, and then checking to be sure no bowel has been trapped beneath a blade and that the blade is not pressing on the side wall of the pelvis. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nerve-injury-associated-with-pelvic-surgery\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Nerve injury associated with pelvic surgery&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H16\"><span class=\"h2\">Adhesiolysis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>If pelvic or intraabdominal adhesions are present, it is important to mobilize the pelvic organs by dividing omental, intestinal, or abdominal wall adhesions. Restoring normal anatomy allows for visualization of important pelvic structures (eg, ureter, blood vessels).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H17\"><span class=\"h2\">Round ligament ligation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Traditionally, a large Kelly clamp is placed across each uterine cornu (fallopian tube and round ligament are included in the clamp). This allows uterine elevation and prevents back bleeding when the round ligaments are divided (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F80308\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef80308 \">figure 3</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F52575\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef52575 \">figure 4</a>). An alternative technique, which is essentially identical to the technique used at laparoscopic procedures, may be more time efficient. Using this approach, the round ligament is clamped and divided using electrosurgery. The electrosurgical device can then be used to open the anterior peritoneum and mobilize the bladder, and to incise the lateral peritoneum without adding extra time to change instruments. </p><p>A common error is to divide the round ligament too close to the uterus, which limits exposure in the broad ligament and makes incision of the peritoneum over the broad ligament more difficult. The round ligament is best divided at its mid portion, or more laterally, and then the ligament can be easily lifted to facilitate peritoneal dissection and division.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H18\"><span class=\"h2\">Broad ligament dissection</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The incision in the round ligament is then carried inferiorly through the peritoneum of the broad ligament to the level of the uterine artery, and then medially along the vesicouterine fold, separating the bladder peritoneum from the lower uterine segment (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F77443\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef77443 \">figure 5</a>).</p><p>The retroperitoneum is entered by extending the incision on the posterior leaf of the broad ligament superiolaterally, remaining lateral to both the infundibulopelvic ligament and iliac vessels. Blunt or sharp dissection clears the loose connective tissue overlying the external iliac artery. The perivesical space and perirectal space can be created at this time.</p><p>The perivesical space is lateral to the bladder, and medial to the external iliac vessels. It is an avascular space created by sharp or blunt dissection that extends down to the levator ani muscles. The superior vesicle artery is at medial border.</p><p>The perirectal space is between the ureter and iliac vessels, is also avascular, and extends down to levator ani muscles. If you create both spaces, placing an index finger into the perivesical space and the middle finger into the perirectal space will give you the parametrium between your fingers. These spaces delineate the pelvic vasculature and ureter well.</p><p>By following the external iliac artery superiorly to its bifurcation, the ureter can be identified as it crosses the common iliac artery. The ureter is left attached to the medial or posterior leaf of the broad ligament so as not to disrupt its blood supply (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F76515\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef76515 \">figure 6</a>). The left ureter is always more medial than the right and deeper in the pelvis along the posterior peritoneum.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H19\"><span class=\"h3\">Avoiding ureteral injury</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>For most women undergoing gynecologic surgery, we recommend not using prophylactic ureteral stents. We find ureteral identification and dissection, if necessary, is adequate for ureteral protection. There are those who suggest use of prophylactic stents for women with severe endometriosis or a history pelvic irradiation, but we have not found this helpful in our practice. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=urinary-tract-injury-in-gynecologic-surgery-epidemiology-and-prevention#H22\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Urinary tract injury in gynecologic surgery: Epidemiology and prevention&quot;, section on 'Prophylactic ureteral catheters'</a>.)</p><p>We prefer to open the retroperitoneum and visualize the ureter on the posterior leaf of the broad ligament peritoneum to prevent ureteral injury. If palpation alone is used, the internal iliac artery, ovarian vessels, and vessels of the broad ligament are easily confused with the ureter. The visualization of ureteral peristalsis confirms its identity. Additionally, when the vesicouterine space is developed, the bladder is displaced inferiorly to laterally displace the ureters. In some women, the ureter is as little as 5 mm from the uterine artery, and reflecting the bladder downward prior to dividing the uterine artery will slide the ureter laterally, providing more space for placement of clamps.</p><p>There is no space between the infundibulopelvic ligaments where they cross the ureter, and clamping down to get these vessels can risk damage to the ureter. Elevating the infundibulopelvic ligaments prior to division creates a space between the ureter and ovarian vessels and ensures that the ureter is not included in the clamp.</p><p>Ureteral identification is particularly important if the patient has had prior pelvic surgery. If the patient has extensive pelvic disease, we dissect the ureter down toward the bladder until optimal visualization is achieved.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H20\"><span class=\"h2\">Adnexal conservation or removal</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H21\"><span class=\"h3\">Conserving ovaries and tubes</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>If the ovaries are to be conserved, with the ureter under direct vision, an opening is created in the posterior leaf of the broad ligament under the utero-ovarian ligament and fallopian tube (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F57421\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef57421 \">figure 7</a>). The utero-ovarian ligament is clamped, cut, and ligated with a free tie followed by a suture ligature (placed just medial to the free tie). The medial large Kelly clamp at the uterine cornu will control back bleeding.</p><p>It is our practice to use measures to prevent the ovaries and fallopian tubes from adhering to the vaginal apex (a possible cause of dyspareunia). Some surgeons place a suture through the stump of the utero-ovarian ligament and then sew the stump to the psoas muscle or to the round ligament stump using an absorbable suture [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/abdominal-hysterectomy/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. Alternatively, the bilateral utero-ovarian stumps may be sutured together in the midline. There is no evidence that this decreases the risks of dyspareunia following hysterectomy.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H22\"><span class=\"h3\">Salpingo-oophorectomy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>If the ovaries are to be removed, the broad ligament opening is extended superiorly to the infundibulopelvic ligament. A curved clamp is placed lateral to the ovary, making certain that the entire ovary is included in the surgical specimen (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F65769\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef65769 \">figure 8</a>). This is facilitated by elevating the infundibulopelvic ligament and creating a generous space in the posterior pelvic peritoneum between the ureters and vessels. Each infundibulopelvic ligament is cut and ligated with a free tie followed by a suture ligature (placed just medial to the free tie) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F77097\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef77097 \">figure 9</a>). Tying the pedicle before suturing it prevents formation of an expanding hematoma through inadvertent puncture of the ovarian vessels. Sutures on vascular pedicles should not be used to elevate the pedicle, as this may compromise knot strength and hemostasis.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H23\"><span class=\"h2\">Perivesical and perirectal dissection</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>It is beneficial to dissect the perivesical and perirectal spaces to separate the bladder and rectum from the uterus, thereby avoiding injury of these organs. Developing these spaces is particularly important if there is distortion of anatomy by pelvic pathology (eg, endometriosis, pelvic inflammatory disease, prior surgery). Identification and mobilization of the structures which surround the uterus allow prompt identification and control of any problems encountered intraoperatively. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=complications-of-gynecologic-surgery\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Complications of gynecologic surgery&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=urinary-tract-injury-in-gynecologic-surgery-epidemiology-and-prevention\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Urinary tract injury in gynecologic surgery: Epidemiology and prevention&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The bladder is dissected off the lower uterine segment and cervix (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F61320\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef61320 \">figure 10</a>). An avascular plane exists between the lower uterine segment and bladder, which allows for its mobilization. We prefer sharp dissection, as the use of a blunt dissection with a sponge stick may lead to a cystostomy, particularly if there has been prior surgery (eg, cesarean delivery). In addition, an incision into the bladder is more easily repaired than a tear from blunt dissection. After this dissection, a lap sponge can be placed beneath the bladder retractor to tamponade any small bleeding vessels.</p><p>If the rectum requires mobilization from the posterior cervix, the posterior peritoneum between the uterosacral ligaments just beneath the cervix and rectum is incised. A relatively avascular tissue plane exists in this area, which allows mobilization of the rectum inferiorly out of the operative field (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F60278\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef60278 \">figure 11</a>).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H24\"><span class=\"h2\">Uterine vessel ligation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Sharp dissection is used to skeletonize the uterine vessels, removing any loose overlying connective tissue. This allows visualization of the uterine vessels, thereby ensuring that clamps are placed on these vessels and not on the ureter (as it passes below the uterine vessels). As noted previously, the bladder is reflected inferiorly with sharp dissection prior to dividing the uterine arteries.</p><p>A curved clamp is placed perpendicular to the uterine artery at the junction of the cervix and lower uterine segment. Care is taken to place the tip of the clamp adjacent to the uterus at this site of anatomic narrowing (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F56070\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef56070 \">figure 12</a>). The uterine artery is cut and ligated. Some surgeons place two curved clamps and ligate the uterine artery twice. Given the proximity of the ureter to the uterine artery, we prefer single clamping. The same procedure is then carried out on the opposite side.</p><p>To control back bleeding and aid visualization, a large Kelly can be placed immediately adjacent to the uterus on each side, incorporating the attachments of the tube, ovarian ligament and round ligament, extending down to the level of the uterine artery. Once placed, the clamp is not removed until the uterus is amputated.</p><p>The cardinal ligament and any remaining broad ligament are divided by placing a straight clamp medial to the uterine vascular pedicle and parallel to the cervix for a distance of 2 to 3 cm. The pedicle is cut and ligated with a suture ligature (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F69100\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef69100 \">figure 13</a>). The number of bites needed to reach the vagina can vary depending on the length of the cervix.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H25\"><span class=\"h3\">Use of electrosurgery</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>An alternative to suture ligation of vascular pedicles is use of electrocautery coagulation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/abdominal-hysterectomy/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. Use of this approach for hysterectomy requires a device that can achieve hemostasis in large vessels. As an example, the Ligasure&trade; bipolar sealing device can be used in vessels up to 7 mm in diameter.</p><p>However, there are no data that show that use of this device for abdominal hysterectomy improves surgical outcomes. Two small randomized trials (n = 30 and 57) that compared the use of Ligasure in abdominal hysterectomy with traditional suture ligature found no benefits regarding operative time, blood loss, or complication rate [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/abdominal-hysterectomy/abstract/8,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,9</a>]; however, they were underpowered to detect clinically significant differences. Postoperatively, one study found that pain scores during the first three days after surgery were reduced by more than 20 percent with use of Ligasure&trade; [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/abdominal-hysterectomy/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]; postoperative outcomes were not assessed in the other study.

The cervicovaginal junction at the level of the external cervical os is palpated, and an incision is made, entering the vaginal apex.

Transverse incisions are made on the anterior and posterior surfaces of the cervix, below the level of the uterine vasculature. The pubovesicocervical fascia is then dissected off the lower uterine segment and cervix with the handle of the scalpel or with gauze-covered index finger. Care is taken to avoid incising too deeply into the cervix, as the loose fascial plane would be missed, causing the dissection to be difficult and bloody. A curved Heaney clamp is placed inside the fascia on each side of the uterus to incorporate the uterosacral ligaments and upper vagina just below the cervix (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F75541\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef75541 \">figure 14</a>).

Three methods are described below:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Kocher clamps are placed bilaterally at the cuff angles. A figure-of-eight suture of 0 or 2-0 gauge synthetic absorbable suture is placed in the midline. This suture is used for both traction and hemostasis. Sutures are then placed at the tip of each clamp and the angle pedicle is transfixed with the suture ligature. This suture incorporates the uterosacral and cardinal ligament at the angle of the vagina (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F65421\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef65421 \">figure 16</a>). Additional figure-of-eight sutures are placed along the cuff to close gaps and ensure hemostasis.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>An alternative approach minimizes blood loss and avoids spillage of vaginal content into the peritoneal cavity; however, the vaginal length is somewhat shortened [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/abdominal-hysterectomy/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. Two Munion or curved Heaney clamps are placed from lateral to medial at the level of the external cervical os; care is taken to avoid incorporating bladder tissue in the clamps. The cervix is amputated with a scalpel or scissors. (Note that this is a variation from the procedure for removing the cervix described above) (see <a href=\"#H28\" class=\"local\">'Total hysterectomy'</a> above). Using a size 0 absorbable suture, a running stitch is placed from medial to lateral on each side, oversewing the clamp (the suture ends are left untied and long). The clamps are then removed and the sutures pulled tight. Continuing with the same needle, a running, locked stitch is placed from lateral to medial on each side, and then tied in the midline.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Some surgeons prefer to leave the cuff open to heal secondarily. If this method is used, a running suture is used for hemostasis along the cuff edge and the peritoneal defect superior to the cuff is sutured closed.

It is generally possible to remove a uterus that is &le;16 gestational week-size (fundus midway between the pubic symphysis and the umbilicus) through a transverse incision (Pfannenstiel, Cherney, or Maylard). While some surgeons will remove a large uterus through a transverse incision [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/abdominal-hysterectomy/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>], many prefer to use a midline vertical incision. In addition, the incision may need to be extended above the umbilicus if a uterus is 20 gestational weeks-size (fundus at the umbilicus) or larger [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/abdominal-hysterectomy/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. Removal of a very large uterus is associated with concealed blood loss (ie, volume of blood contained within the uterus).

In such cases, it may not be possible to complete a full preoperative evaluation and consent process. Discussion with, and notification of, a family member or friend may be appropriate, depending upon patient consent for disclosure of medical information to this person.

Communication with members of the surgical team (eg, anesthesiologist, nurses, scrub technicians) regarding anticipated need for blood products, surgical equipment, and postsurgical care (eg, intensive care) is of critical importance. It is optimal to have an experienced first assistant.</p><p>A midline vertical abdominal incision provides the best exposure and can be easily extended superiorly. This may be useful, particularly in cases where preoperative examination and imaging are limited. Hemostasis should by achieved quickly by ligating the ovarian and uterine vessels as soon as it is safely possible to do so [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/abdominal-hysterectomy/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H38\"><span class=\"h2\">Obesity</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Incision placement in the overlapping fold of a panniculus should be avoided.

A surgeon who usually uses a smaller self-retaining retractor may choose to use a larger retractor in obese patients (eg, Bookwalter retractor). Oversized laparotomy pads exist and are ideal in obese patients. They are easier to place and allow the use of fewer pads. The combination of obesity and a deep pelvis is particularly challenging. Long instruments will be required, most ties will require use of a pass, and exposure of the cardinal ligaments can be challenged. </p><p>Exposure can be aided by placing one or more wet lap pads high in the vagina prior to beginning surgery. This elevates the uterus and makes the surgical procedure much easier. The pads are tagged with a long clamp and removed by an assistant prior to closing the vaginal cuff.</p><p>Mass fascial closure (incorporating the fascia along with a small amount of subcutaneous fat, rectus muscle, rectus sheaths, and peritoneum) may reduce the risk of wound dehiscence in obese patients. Also, closure of the subcutaneous layer in obese patients reduces the risk of superficial wound disruption according to randomized trials. Similarly, the use of a subcutaneous drain may decrease wound disruption risk, however, this has not been confirmed. If drains are used, they are closed suction systems and not placed through the incision.

(See <a href=\"#H19\" class=\"local\">'Avoiding ureteral injury'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Dissecting the perivesical and perirectal spaces helps to avoid injury of these organs. We prefer sharp perivesical dissection, as the use of a blunt dissection with a sponge stick may lead to a cystostomy, particularly if a patient has had prior pelvic surgery. In addition, an incision into the bladder is more easily repaired than a tear from blunt dissection. (See <a href=\"#H23\" class=\"local\">'Perivesical and perirectal dissection'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Numerous techniques have been described for management of the vaginal cuff closure. High quality studies have found no difference in postoperative infectious morbidity with an open or closed cuff technique. (See <a href=\"#H29\" class=\"local\">'Treatment of the vaginal cuff'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In patients undergoing laparotomy who have a 2 cm or greater subcutaneous fat layer, we recommend closure of the subcutaneous layer (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=1\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1A</a>). (See <a href=\"#H38\" class=\"local\">'Obesity'</a> above and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cesarean-delivery-surgical-technique#H6\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Cesarean delivery: Surgical technique&quot;, section on 'Subcutaneous tissue layer'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In obese patients undergoing a midline laparotomy, we suggest a mass fascial closure (incorporating the fascia along with a small amount of subcutaneous fat, rectus muscle, rectus sheath, and, possibly, peritoneum) rather than a fascia-only closure (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=5\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2B</a>). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=principles-of-abdominal-wall-closure#H18\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Principles of abdominal wall closure&quot;, section on 'Mass closure'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=principles-of-abdominal-wall-closure#H19\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Principles of abdominal wall closure&quot;, section on 'Subcutaneous'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In women with a large leiomyomatous uterus (&ge;16 weeks' size), we suggest prevention of excessive blood loss with intramyometrial (IMM) <a href=\"topic.htm?path=vasopressin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">vasopressin</a>&nbsp;(<a href=\"grade.htm?i=5\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2B</a>). (See <a href=\"#H34\" class=\"local\">'Large uterus'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H67\"><span class=\"h2\">Postoperative care</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In women undergoing AH, the bladder catheter is typically removed 24 hours or less postoperatively. (See <a href=\"#H39\" class=\"local\">'Inpatient postoperative care'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Increase in intraabdominal pressure is dependent on the amount of weight lifted, as well as the position of the person relative to the object. We ask that patients avoid heavy lifting (&gt;13 pounds of weight from the floor) for four to six weeks to minimize stress on the healing fascia. (See <a href=\"#H40\" class=\"local\">'Follow-up'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H68\"><span class=\"h2\">Complications</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The most common major complications of AH are hemorrhage, urinary tract injury, and bowel injury. (See <a href=\"#H1745544\" class=\"local\">'Complications'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Careful inspection of all pedicles before abdominal closure is the best method to prevent intraoperative and postoperative hemorrhage. Depending on the site of hemorrhage, hemostasis may be reestablished by local treatment (eg, vaginal cuff bleeding, wound hematoma) or by surgical exploration. (See <a href=\"#H1745608\" class=\"local\">'Hemorrhage'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>If a ureteral injury is suspected intraoperatively, the bladder is evaluated for evidence of ureteral efflux. Confirmation of ureteral patency can be performed with cystourethroscopy or by opening the bladder dome. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=urinary-tract-injury-in-gynecologic-surgery-identification-and-management#H3\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Urinary tract injury in gynecologic surgery: Identification and management&quot;, section on 'Screening for injury with routine cystoscopy'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Postoperatively, ureteral injury may be asymptomatic or may present as flank or groin pain, fever, prolonged ileus, and abdominal mass. Postoperative serum creatinine concentration rises &ge;0.3 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> above preoperative values support this diagnosis. (See <a href=\"#H1745656\" class=\"local\">'Ureteral injury'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Small bladder injuries in the bladder dome can be repaired with a running closure with a small caliber absorbable suture (eg, 3-0). When dealing with an injury which is extensive, in the trigone, or occurs in a patient with previous bladder injury (eg, trauma, surgery, irradiation), intraoperative consultation with an experienced surgeon is warranted. (See <a href=\"#H1745683\" class=\"local\">'Bladder injury'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Bowel injuries occur primarily during lysis of adhesions involving bowel and dissection of the posterior cul-de-sac. Serosal abrasions do not need repair, but injuries involving the muscularis <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> mucosa are to be repaired. (See <a href=\"#H1745725\" class=\"local\">'Bowel injury'</a> above.)</p><p/></div><div id=\"topicAgreement\">Use of UpToDate is subject to the <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/legal/license\" class=\"licenseLink\" id=\"sla_in_page\">Subscription and License Agreement</a>.</div><div id=\"references\" class=\"headingAnchor\"><h1>REFERENCES</h1><ol id=\"reference\"><li><a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/abdominal-hysterectomy/abstract/1\" class=\"nounderline abstract_t\">Committee on Practice Bulletins--Gynecology, American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists.
