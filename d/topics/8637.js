It damages the air sacs in your lungs that send oxygen to the blood. This damage causes scars in the lungs. This makes people with IPF cough and get short of breath.</p><p>People who get IPF are usually older than 40. It is a very serious illness that cannot be cured and gets worse over time.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10324928\"><span class=\"h1\">Why did I get idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Doctors do not know exactly how IPF starts. The risk of IPF is greater for people who:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Smoke or used to smoke</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Have breathed in a lot of toxic chemicals or pollution</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Have breathed in certain types of dust at work, over a long time</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Have family members with pulmonary fibrosis</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10324945\"><span class=\"h1\">What are the symptoms of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>IPF can start very slowly, so it might not cause any symptoms at first. When it does, symptoms can include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Shortness of breath during exercise</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Dry cough</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10324960\"><span class=\"h1\">Are there tests for idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Yes. Doctors can do:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Blood tests to make sure you don't have a different type of lung disease &ndash; There is no blood test for IPF.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Breathing tests to see how well your lungs are working &ndash; Breathing tests can show if your shortness of breath is caused by IPF or another disease such as emphysema.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>An imaging test called a &quot;CT scan&quot; &ndash; This test uses a special X-ray to create pictures of the inside of the body. It can show lung damage caused by IPF.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>If the doctor is not sure you have IPF after the CT scan, he or she might do a lung biopsy. In this test, a doctor does surgery to take a small sample of tissue from your lung. Another doctor looks at the sample under a microscope for signs of IPF.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10324975\"><span class=\"h1\">How is idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis treated?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There is no treatment to cure IPF. It usually gets worse slowly. But doctors can treat some of the symptoms. These treatments can include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Quitting smoking &ndash; If you smoke cigarettes, the most important thing you can do is <strong>stop smoking</strong>.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Flu and pneumonia vaccines &ndash; You should get the flu shot every fall and the pneumonia vaccine at least once. Infections like the flu and pneumonia can hurt your lungs. It's important to try to prevent them.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Oxygen &ndash; As IPF gets worse, some people need to breathe oxygen from a tank they carry with them.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pulmonary rehab &ndash; In pulmonary rehab, people learn exercises and ways to breathe that can help with IPF symptoms.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Treatment for acid reflux &ndash; Acid reflux is when the acid that is normally in your stomach backs up into your esophagus. The esophagus is the tube that carries food from your mouth to your stomach. Acid reflux from the esophagus can add to the lung scarring from IPF. People who have acid reflux might need medicine to stop the acid reflux from making IPF worse.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Medicine &ndash; Two medicines have been shown to slow lung damage. But they do not cure IPF.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Clinical trials &ndash; Research studies of new treatments, such as medicines, that might help people with IPF.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Lung transplant &ndash; This is surgery to replace 1 or both diseased lungs with healthy lungs. It is done only if a person with IPF meets certain conditions.</p><p/><p>IPF sometimes gets worse very quickly. If this happens, doctors can try giving antibiotics and steroid medicines. (These are <strong>not</strong> the same as the steroids some athletes take illegally.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10324990\"><span class=\"h1\">More on this topic</span></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=shortness-of-breath-dyspnea-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Shortness of breath (dyspnea) (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=what-are-clinical-trials-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: What are clinical trials?
