It can be painful and itchy, and look different from a normal scar. A person can have just one keloid or many.</p><p>Keloids are more common in people with dark skin. They can also run in families. If someone in your family gets keloids, you might be more likely to get them.</p><p>Keloids can form after any injury or procedure that breaks the skin. This can include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Piercing &ndash; This can be of the ears or another body part.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A cut that gets infected or leaves a scar</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Acne, after the pimples heal</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Surgery &ndash; A keloid can form in the scar.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H98769116\"><span class=\"h1\">What are the symptoms of a keloid?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A keloid can look like a lumpy growth (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F83338\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef83338 \">picture 1</a>). It can:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Itch</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Hurt when you press on it</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Cause sharp, shooting pain</p><p/><p>Keloids are most common on certain body parts. These include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Ears</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Neck &ndash; One type of keloid happens after a pimple heals on the back of the neck.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Jaw</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Chest, shoulders, and upper back</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H98769131\"><span class=\"h1\">Should I see a doctor or nurse?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Yes. If you have a new growth on your skin, see your doctor or nurse. Keloids are not cancer. But some skin growths are cancer. Ask your doctor or nurse to check.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H98769146\"><span class=\"h1\">Is there a test for keloids?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>No. There is no test. But your doctor or nurse should be able to tell if you have a keloid by looking at it and learning about your symptoms.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H98769161\"><span class=\"h1\">How are keloids treated?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Doctors have several different treatments for keloids. Possible treatments include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Giving an injection (shot) of medicine in the keloid &ndash; This can make it flatten out. Doctors can try different medicines to see which one works best.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Doing surgery to take the keloid off &ndash; After surgery, the doctor usually gives a shot of medicine in the area. This can help keep the keloid from coming back.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Putting a sheet of sticky material over the keloid &ndash; This might make the keloid hurt or itch less.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Cryosurgery &ndash; In this procedure, the doctor uses a very cold liquid to freeze the keloid.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pressure earrings &ndash; These are special earrings that press on the holes after you get your ears pierced. They could help stop keloids from forming when the holes heal.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Radiation &ndash; This treatment uses high doses of X-rays to destroy keloids.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Laser treatment &ndash; This treatment uses strong light to destroy keloids.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Putting a prescription cream on the area &ndash; The doctor might prescribe this to use after surgery.</p><p/><p>Keloids can be hard to treat. They often come back after treatment. Giving more than one treatment at a time, such as a shot of medicine after surgery, can work better than just one treatment. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H98769176\"><span class=\"h1\">Can keloids be prevented?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Yes. You can lower your chances of getting keloids by:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Not having surgery or procedures that break the skin, if possible. For example, you can:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Avoid getting your ears or other body parts pierced </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Avoid having surgery to take off a mole (unless your doctor or nurse says you need surgery)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Treating acne or a cut right away.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>NOT shaving your neck &ndash; This can irritate pimples and make them form keloids after they heal.</p><p/><p>If you have a cut or scar, you can:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Keep the cut or wound moist while it heals &ndash; You can put a thin layer of petroleum jelly on it. Cover it with a bandage or gauze. Keep the bandage clean and dry.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Cover scars when you are in the sun &ndash; Do this for 3 months after the scar forms. You can also use sunscreen on the scar.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H98769191\"><span class=\"h1\">More on this topic</span></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=acne-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Acne (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=taking-care-of-cuts-and-scrapes-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Taking care of cuts and scrapes (The Basics)</a></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=acne-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Acne (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=sunburn-prevention-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Sunburn prevention (Beyond the Basics)</a></p></div><div id=\"reviewProcess\"><span>All topics are updated as new evidence becomes available and our <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/home/editorial-policy\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"policy policy_editorialpolicy\">peer review process</a> is complete.</span></div><div id=\"topicRetrievedDate\"><span class=\"emphasis\">This topic retrieved from UpToDate on: </span>Apr 02, 2018.</div><div id=\"disclaimer\">The content on the UpToDate website is not intended nor recommended as a substitute for medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.
