Infectious, allergic, and dermatologic disease may all lead to external otitis. Acute bacterial infection is the most common cause of external otitis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/external-otitis-pathogenesis-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p>This topic will focus on the pathogenesis, clinical features, and diagnosis of external otitis. The treatment of external otitis is discussed in detail elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=external-otitis-treatment\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;External otitis: Treatment&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H915662417\"><span class=\"h1\">EPIDEMIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>External otitis can occur in all age groups [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/external-otitis-pathogenesis-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. An estimated 10 percent of people develop external otitis during their lifetime. Annual rates of ambulatory care visits in the United States for external otitis are highest during childhood and decrease with age [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/external-otitis-pathogenesis-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>7 percent ages 0 to 4 years</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>19 percent ages 5 to 9 years </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>16 percent ages 10 to 14 years</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>9 percent ages 15 to 19 years</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>5 percent ages &ge;20 years </p><p/><p>External otitis is more likely to occur in the summer, compared to winter months [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/external-otitis-pathogenesis-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. This may be related to increased ambient humidity and participation in outdoor water activities.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">ANATOMY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The external auditory canal is a cylinder measuring approximately 2.5 cm in length and 7.0 to 9.0 mm in width, extending from the conchal cartilage of the auricle to the tympanic membrane (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F57082\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef57082 \">figure 1</a>). It is divided into a lateral (outer) cartilaginous portion that occupies approximately one-third of the canal and a medial (inner) bony portion that occupies the remaining two-thirds. Their junction is termed the isthmus and is the narrowest region of the ear canal. The outer cartilaginous portion is lined by thicker skin with numerous adnexal structures including cerumen glands, sebaceous glands, and hair follicles. The inner bony portion of the canal contains thin skin without subcutaneous tissue. The dermis in this area is in direct contact with the underlying periosteum. Thus, minimal inflammation or instrumentation of the bony canal causes significant pain <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> injury. </p><p>The inferior tympanic recess is a small depression in the inferior medial aspect of the ear canal, adjacent to the tympanic membrane. Debris can collect in this area and cause or perpetuate infection.</p><p>The lining of the ear canal is a keratinizing squamous epithelium that undergoes continual sloughing. Epithelial migration is a naturally occurring cleaning process for the ear canal that allows egress of keratin debris and cerumen. Epithelial migration begins in the center of the tympanic membrane and continues out to the medial, then lateral aspects of the ear canal.</p><p>The ear canal is bound superiorly by the middle cranial fossa, anteriorly by the temporomandibular joint and parotid region, medially by the tympanic membrane, posteriorly by the mastoid cavity, and inferiorly by the skull base and soft tissues of the neck. These boundaries have particular importance when considering the potential complications of external otitis.</p><p>The fissures of Santorini are a series of embryologic fissures in the anterior aspect of the cartilaginous portion of the canal through which neurovascular tissues pass. These fissures also allow potential spread of ear canal disease to the parotid region, temporomandibular joint, and soft tissue of the upper neck.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">PATHOGENESIS AND RISK FACTORS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Several factors may contribute to the development of external otitis, despite the defense mechanisms of the auditory canal.</p><p>The inherent defense mechanisms of the ear canal include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The tragus and conchal cartilage partially cover the opening of the ear canal and help to prevent foreign body entrance.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Hair follicles and the isthmus narrowing inhibit entry of contaminants into the ear canal.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Cerumen helps create an acidic ear canal environment, which inhibits bacterial and fungal growth. It is also hydrophobic, repelling water that might otherwise create an ideal culture medium. In addition, the sticky quality of cerumen helps to trap fine debris.</p><p/><p>Breakdown of the skin-cerumen barrier is the first step in the pathogenesis of external otitis. Inflammation and edema of the skin then leads to pruritus and obstruction. The pruritus prompts scratching that may create further injury. This sequence of events alters the quality and amount of cerumen produced, impairs epithelial migration, and increases the pH of the ear canal. The resulting dark, warm, alkaline, moist ear canal becomes an ideal breeding ground for numerous organisms.</p><p>Specific factors increase the risk of external otitis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/external-otitis-pathogenesis-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/4-7\" class=\"abstract_t\">4-7</a>]: </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Swimming or other water exposure is a well-documented risk factor for external otitis. Excess moisture leads to skin maceration and breakdown of the skin-cerumen barrier, changing the microflora of the ear canal to predominantly gram-negative bacteria. (See <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Microbiology'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Any trauma such as from excessive cleaning or aggressive scratching of the ear canal not only removes cerumen, but can also create abrasions along the thin layer of skin in the ear canal, allowing organisms to gain access to deeper tissue. In addition, part of a cotton swab may become detached or a small piece of tissue paper may be left behind in the ear canal; these remnants can partially disintegrate and fester, causing a severe skin reaction and infection.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Devices that occlude the ear canal such as hearing aids, earphones, or diving caps can predispose to external otitis.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Allergic contact dermatitis can lead to external otitis (eg, from earrings or chemicals in cosmetics or shampoos).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Dermatologic conditions can also predispose to external otitis (eg, psoriasis, atopic dermatitis).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Prior radiation therapy can cause ischemic ear canal changes, alter cerumen production and epithelial migration, and predispose to external otitis.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h1\">MICROBIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The ear canal is normally colonized with a number of aerobic and anaerobic bacteria, with more than 90 percent gram positive organisms (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F69985\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef69985 \">table 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/external-otitis-pathogenesis-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. Staphylococci are the most common bacteria (63 percent) to inhabit the external ear, with S. auricularis (22 percent) and S. epidermidis (15 percent) being the most common species. </p><p>The most common pathogenic organisms responsible for external otitis are P. aeruginosa (38 percent), S. epidermidis (9 percent), and S. aureus (8 percent) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F64716%7EPC%2F78637\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef64716 graphicRef78637 \">table 2A-B</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/external-otitis-pathogenesis-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. However, there are several other gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria that can also cause external otitis. Anaerobic pathogens are present in 4 to 25 percent of patients; bacteroides and peptostreptococci are the most frequently encountered anaerobic organisms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/external-otitis-pathogenesis-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/5,9-11\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,9-11</a>]. Some patients may have mixed aerobic and anaerobic infection.</p><p>Fungal infection accounts for two to ten percent of cases of external otitis, and most frequently occurs after treatment of bacterial infection. Candidal infection occurs more commonly in patients who use hearing aids [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/external-otitis-pathogenesis-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. Polymicrobial disease occurs in up to one-third of cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/external-otitis-pathogenesis-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/10,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,11</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H21\" class=\"local\">'Otomycosis'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H277540\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL FEATURES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The most common symptoms of external otitis are ear pain, pruritus, discharge, and hearing loss [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/external-otitis-pathogenesis-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. In addition to symptoms, patients should be asked about any known tympanic membrane perforation, previous ear infections, any prior ear surgery, recent ear instrumentation, and water exposure. </p><p>On physical examination, the auricle and tragus should be examined for erythema or signs of trauma (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F57082\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef57082 \">figure 1</a>). Tenderness with tragal pressure or when the auricle is manipulated or pulled are indicative findings of external otitis. However, these signs may be absent in mild cases.</p><p>Otoscopy is critical for distinguishing between external otitis, otitis media, and other ear pathology. The ear canal usually appears edematous and erythematous in external otitis. Debris or cerumen is typically yellow, brown, white, or gray. Otomycosis, a fungal infection of the external canal, may take on different appearances (eg, fine, dark coating with Aspergillus; white, sebaceous-like material with Candida). (See <a href=\"#H21\" class=\"local\">'Otomycosis'</a> below.) The tympanic membrane may be erythematous in external otitis and only partially visible due to canal edema. The presence of an air-fluid level along the tympanic membrane is indicative of a middle ear effusion and underlying otitis media (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F67379\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef67379 \">picture 1</a>). </p><p>The examination is aided with a pneumatic otoscope that allows for insufflation (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F93798\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef93798 \">picture 2</a>). The tympanic membrane in patients with external otitis should be mobile with pneumatic insufflation. With gentle application of positive then negative pressure by the pneumatic otoscope, the normal tympanic membrane moves inwards then outwards, respectively (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F55117\" class=\"graphic graphic_movie graphicRef55117 \">movie 1</a>). The movement of the tympanic membrane is most evident posterosuperiorly. A fluid-filled middle ear will minimize any tympanic membrane excursions with insufflation (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F67928\" class=\"graphic graphic_movie graphicRef67928 \">movie 2</a>). There should be no evidence of middle ear fluid in isolated external otitis. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acute-otitis-media-in-children-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Acute otitis media in children: Diagnosis&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acute-otitis-media-in-adults#H16\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Acute otitis media in adults&quot;, section on 'Diagnosis'</a>.)</p><p>The diagnosis of external otitis should also be questioned when the patient has a perforated tympanic membrane. It is likely that the primary focus of disease in these patients is the middle ear, with secondary inflammation of the ear canal. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-and-management-of-middle-ear-trauma\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation and management of middle ear trauma&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-of-earache-in-children#H22\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation of earache in children&quot;, section on 'Traumatic tympanic membrane (TM) perforation'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acute-otitis-media-in-adults#H21\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Acute otitis media in adults&quot;, section on 'Ruptured tympanic membrane'</a>.) </p><p>The patient should be evaluated for findings that might indicate malignant external otitis. Granulation tissue at the bony cartilaginous junction of the ear canal floor is a classic finding. Frank necrosis of ear canal skin may be evident. (See <a href=\"#H277656\" class=\"local\">'Malignant external otitis'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H277602\"><span class=\"h2\">Severity</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The spectrum of external otitis ranges from mild to severe, based upon the presenting symptoms and physical examination [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/external-otitis-pathogenesis-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Mild disease is characterized by minor discomfort and pruritus (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F83227\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef83227 \">picture 3</a>).

There is usually periauricular erythema, lymphadenopathy, and fever (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F55712\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef55712 \">picture 5</a>). </p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H191116177\"><span class=\"h1\">DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The diagnosis of external otitis is clinical, based upon a characteristic history and physical examination. (See <a href=\"#H277540\" class=\"local\">'Clinical features'</a> above.)</p><p>Guidelines from the American Academy of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery define diffuse acute otitis externa as occurring with rapid onset (generally within 48 hours) in the previous three weeks with signs and symptoms of ear canal inflammation (tender tragus <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> pinna), or diffuse edema or erythema of the ear canal, with or without otorrhea, regional adenopathy, erythema of the tympanic membrane, or cellulitis of the pinna and adjacent skin [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/external-otitis-pathogenesis-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H658697211\"><span class=\"h2\">Cultures</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Cultures are generally reserved for patients with severe cases of external otitis. Performing culture is usually more costly than simply starting empiric treatment, which is usually very effective. Thus, patients with mild and moderate external otitis do not need culture of the ear canal prior to starting therapy. However, cultures should be performed in those with severe external otitis, recurrent external otitis, chronic otitis, immunosuppressed patients (eg, post-transplant, HIV, receiving chemotherapy or radiation therapy), infections in patients after aural surgery, and patients who do not respond to initial therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/external-otitis-pathogenesis-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. Culture is performed using a small cotton swab within the external canal. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H20\"><span class=\"h1\">DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A number of disorders can mimic acute bacterial external otitis.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H21\"><span class=\"h2\">Otomycosis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Otomycosis is a fungal infection of the external auditory canal. Otomycosis can occur as the primary infection or can develop along with bacterial external otitis, usually as a result of antibiotic therapy. Fungal infections are responsible for approximately 9 percent of outer ear infections [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/external-otitis-pathogenesis-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. Aspergillus niger and Candida are the most common organisms, although the dominant organism varies according to geographic location. The incidence of otomycosis is higher in tropical and subtropical locations, probably because of the humidity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/external-otitis-pathogenesis-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. Swimming and ear canal scratching or cleaning also predispose to otomycosis. Concern has been raised that excessive use of antibiotic ear drops might allow fungal proliferation. However, the incidence and types of fungal infections have not changed significantly despite several decades of topical antibiotic use.</p><p>Patients with otomycosis most commonly report ear itching, discomfort, discharge, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> a feeling that something is in the ear canal [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/external-otitis-pathogenesis-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. Deep seated itching is the most troublesome symptom; pain is less intense than with bacterial external otitis.</p><p>Fungal infections are often located in the medial aspect of the ear canal. This may be due in part to the location of the inferior tympanic recess (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F57082\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef57082 \">figure 1</a>), which facilitates accumulation of debris in this area. In addition, the medial aspect of the ear canal is darker and warmer, features that promote fungal growth.</p><p>Edema of the ear canal is less severe than with bacterial external otitis. Fungal organisms have a very characteristic appearance in the ear canal, especially under magnified vision (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F83226\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef83226 \">picture 6</a>). Fine fungal filaments and spores may be seen that resemble mold growing on spoiled food. Aspergillus niger spores look like a fine coal dust sprinkled in the ear canal. Aspergillus may also resemble wet newspaper or blotting paper. Candidal infections typically are associated with soft, white, sebaceous-like material that may fill the ear canal in severe cases. A pseudomembrane often lines the ear canal that, when removed, reveals an underlying friable granular membrane.</p><p>The treatment of otomycosis is discussed elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=external-otitis-treatment#H569884918\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;External otitis: Treatment&quot;, section on 'Otomycosis'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H24\"><span class=\"h2\">Contact dermatitis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients with persistent edema and erythema of the ear canal and auricle despite appropriate external otitis treatment may be experiencing an allergic reaction. Contact dermatitis can be commonly caused by ototopical medication, cosmetics, or shampoos. These are Gell and Coombs type IV delayed hypersensitivity reactions; secondary exposure to the allergen initiates an inflammatory response.</p><p>Contact dermatitis should be considered if there has been a lack of response to external otitis treatment over a one week period. Pruritus is the dominant symptom. Erythema intensifies and classically extends to the inferior aspect of the conchal cartilage where drops often collect after application (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F70837\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef70837 \">picture 7</a>). Vesicles may be seen, and there are often extensive secondary changes from rubbing and itching.</p><p>Common ototopical agents causing allergic reactions are <a href=\"topic.htm?path=neomycin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">neomycin</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=benzocaine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">benzocaine</a>, and propylene glycol [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/external-otitis-pathogenesis-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/18,19\" class=\"abstract_t\">18,19</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><a href=\"topic.htm?path=neomycin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Neomycin</a> allergy occurs in 35 percent of chronically treated patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/external-otitis-pathogenesis-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>].

CSOM is usually associated with a long history of ear disease. Symptoms of CSOM include otorrhea and possibly otalgia, hearing loss, tinnitus, or vertigo. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=chronic-suppurative-otitis-media-csom-clinical-features-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Chronic suppurative otitis media (CSOM): Clinical features and diagnosis&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=chronic-otitis-media-cholesteatoma-and-mastoiditis-in-adults#H98017535\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Chronic otitis media, cholesteatoma, and mastoiditis in adults&quot;, section on 'Chronic suppurative otitis media'</a>.)</p><p>Ear canal symptoms and signs are usually mild compared with acute bacterial external otitis. Swelling typically does not completely occlude the canal. Ear canal findings are focused medially near the tympanic membrane where polyps or granulation tissue may be seen. The tympanic membrane is usually at least partly visible and frequently not mobile on insufflation. A tympanic membrane perforation or retraction pocket may be evident. The pocket can be filled with white, cheesy-looking, keratin debris consistent with a cholesteatoma (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F55060\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef55060 \">picture 8</a>).

Periauricular cellulitis presents with erythema, edema, and warmth of the skin around the auricle. Pain is generally mild and systemic manifestations are usually absent, which help distinguish cellulitis from malignant external otitis. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H277656\"><span class=\"h2\">Malignant external otitis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Malignant external otitis (also termed necrotizing external otitis) is a severe, potentially fatal complication of acute bacterial external otitis. Most common in elderly diabetic patients or other immunocompromised individuals, it occurs when the infection spreads from the skin to bone and marrow spaces of the skull base (also involving soft tissue and cartilage of the temporal region).</p><p>Patients typically have severe otalgia and otorrhea with pain that appears out of proportion to examination findings. Granulation tissue at the bony cartilaginous junction of the ear canal floor is a classic finding. Edema, erythema, and frank necrosis of ear canal skin may be evident. Cranial nerve palsies are a poor prognostic sign. Patients generally have a markedly elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR). Diagnosis is aided with an abnormal MRI or CT scan showing extension of infection into bony structures. Patients who may have malignant external otitis should be promptly referred to an otolaryngologist. </p><p>Malignant external otitis is discussed in detail elsewhere.

These articles are best for patients who want a general overview and who prefer short, easy-to-read materials. Beyond the Basics patient education pieces are longer, more sophisticated, and more detailed. These articles are written at the 10<sup>th</sup> to 12<sup>th</sup> grade reading level and are best for patients who want in-depth information and are comfortable with some medical jargon.</p><p>Here are the patient education articles that are relevant to this topic. We encourage you to print or e-mail these topics to your patients.

(See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Pathogenesis and risk factors'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>External otitis usually presents with ear pain, pruritus, and discharge. Examination findings of external otitis include tenderness when the tragus is pushed or the auricle is pulled, as well as erythema and swelling of the external auditory canal. The otoscopic examination should also assess for otitis media, tympanic membrane perforation, and signs of other disease. (See <a href=\"#H277540\" class=\"local\">'Clinical features'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>External otitis is categorized by severity as mild, moderate, or severe (see <a href=\"#H277602\" class=\"local\">'Severity'</a> above):</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Mild disease is characterized by pruritus, minor discomfort, and minimal canal edema (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F83227\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef83227 \">picture 3</a>). </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Moderate disease is characterized by pruritus, an intermediate degree of pain, and a partially-occluded canal (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F83228\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef83228 \">picture 4</a>).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Severe disease is characterized by complete canal obstruction, intense pain, periauricular erythema, adenopathy, and fever (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F55712\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef55712 \">picture 5</a>).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The diagnosis of external otitis is clinical, based upon a characteristic history and physical examination.

Carcinoma of the ear canal is a rare, aggressive disease that is suggested by blood otorrhea, a friable ear canal, and failure to respond to treatment for external otitis.
