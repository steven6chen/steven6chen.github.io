The ectocervix (surface of the cervix that is visualized on vaginal speculum examination) is covered in squamous epithelium, and the endocervix, including the cervical canal, is covered with glandular epithelium. CIN refers to squamous abnormalities. Glandular cervical neoplasia includes adenocarcinoma in situ and adenocarcinoma.

In 1988, a new terminology system was introduced, the Bethesda system, which was then revised in 1991 and 2001. In this system, different terminology was used for cytologic (on Pap test) and histologic (on biopsy) findings [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cervical-intraepithelial-neoplasia-terminology-incidence-pathogenesis-and-prevention/abstract/3-5\" class=\"abstract_t\">3-5</a>]. Cytologic findings were described with the term &quot;squamous intraepithelial lesion (SIL)&quot; and histologic changes were described with the term &quot;cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN).&quot; The term CIN has three degrees of severity (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F60116\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef60116 \">figure 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F63660\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef63660 \">picture 1</a>):</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>CIN 1 is a low-grade lesion.

As noted below, there is considerable variability in this category.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>CIN 3 is a high-grade lesion. It refers to severely atypical cellular changes encompassing greater than two-thirds of the epithelial thickness and includes full-thickness lesions (previous terms were severe dysplasia or carcinoma in situ).</p><p/><p>Due to the poor reproducibility of CIN 2, CIN 2 and 3 are often classified together as an entity known as CIN 2,3.

When HPV remains in an episomal nonintegrated state, the result is a low-grade lesion. When the virus becomes integrated into the human genome, high-grade lesions and cancer may develop [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cervical-intraepithelial-neoplasia-terminology-incidence-pathogenesis-and-prevention/abstract/60\" class=\"abstract_t\">60</a>].</p><p>An important factor in the early stages following infection is the individual's susceptibility to oncogenic HPV types, which is determined by the host's immune system [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cervical-intraepithelial-neoplasia-terminology-incidence-pathogenesis-and-prevention/abstract/61\" class=\"abstract_t\">61</a>]. Viral integration into the host genome results in the disruption of the E1 and E2 open reading frames and therefore, it also results in loss of the transcriptional regulation of E6 and E7, with resultant overexpression of these oncoproteins [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cervical-intraepithelial-neoplasia-terminology-incidence-pathogenesis-and-prevention/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. The HPV E6 protein binds to p53 and induces the cellular degradation of p53, while E7 interacts with the retinoblastoma protein (Rb), which leads to dissociation of the transcription factor E2F and promotion of cell cycle progression [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cervical-intraepithelial-neoplasia-terminology-incidence-pathogenesis-and-prevention/abstract/62,63\" class=\"abstract_t\">62,63</a>]. The disabling of these two major tumor suppressor genes, p53 and Rb, is thought to be central to host cell transformation induced by HPV and immortalization of infected cell lines. The presence of extracellular E7 also activates cervical endothelial cells, resulting in overproduction of interleukins 6 and 8, two cytokines that are associated with progression of CIN 2,3 to overt malignancy in more than 80 percent of cancers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cervical-intraepithelial-neoplasia-terminology-incidence-pathogenesis-and-prevention/abstract/64,65\" class=\"abstract_t\">64,65</a>].
