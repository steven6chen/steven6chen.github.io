The pathophysiology is incompletely understood, and it is often difficult to eradicate, although symptoms can usually be mitigated.</p><p>Uremic pruritus is discussed in this topic review. A general discussion of pruritus is presented separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pruritus-overview-of-management\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pruritus: Overview of management&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H98332764\"><span class=\"h1\">EPIDEMIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The reported prevalence of uremic pruritus in adult hemodialysis patients has varied over the years, and some studies suggest the prevalence may be decreasing with more effective dialysis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/uremic-pruritus/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Whereas the reported prevalence between 1980 and 1993 was 50 to 90 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/uremic-pruritus/abstract/2-4\" class=\"abstract_t\">2-4</a>], subsequent surveys note a lower rate (22 to 57 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/uremic-pruritus/abstract/5-8\" class=\"abstract_t\">5-8</a>]. In one of the largest trials (the Dialysis Outcomes and Practice Patterns Study [DOPPS]), pruritus was experienced by 42 percent of hemodialysis patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/uremic-pruritus/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. The prevalence has not been as well studied in peritoneal dialysis patients and in children. Historically, small series suggested that the prevalence is lower in children (approximately 9 percent) and similar between hemodialysis and peritoneal dialysis patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/uremic-pruritus/abstract/9-11\" class=\"abstract_t\">9-11</a>]. However, two studies from Korea and Taiwan compared the prevalence of pruritus between hemodialysis and peritoneal dialysis patients and showed conflicting results. The Korean study showed a significantly higher rate of pruritus in peritoneal dialysis patients compared with hemodialysis patients (68.2 versus 48.3 percent, respectively), whereas the Taiwanese cohort showed no significant difference between hemodialysis and peritoneal dialysis patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/uremic-pruritus/abstract/12,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,13</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14965810\"><span class=\"h1\">PATHOPHYSIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The pathophysiology of uremic pruritus is poorly understood.

Immunomodulating therapies such as ultraviolet B (UVB) phototherapy, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=thalidomide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">thalidomide</a>, and calcineurin inhibitors have been shown to decrease uremic pruritus in some studies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/uremic-pruritus/abstract/17-19\" class=\"abstract_t\">17-19</a>].</p><p>A direct role for proinflammatory T cells and cytokines is suggested by studies that showed higher levels of proinflammatory T helper-1 (TH1) cells, C-reactive protein, interleukin-6, and interleukin-2 levels among hemodialysis patients with versus those without pruritus [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/uremic-pruritus/abstract/16,20\" class=\"abstract_t\">16,20</a>]. Other markers of inflammation including increased white blood cell count, low albumin, and high ferritin have also been associated with uremic pruritus in various studies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/uremic-pruritus/abstract/7,21\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,21</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1729277\"><span class=\"h2\">Opioid hypothesis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The opioid hypothesis proposes that imbalances in the expression of mu and kappa opioid receptors cause pruritus [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/uremic-pruritus/abstract/22,23\" class=\"abstract_t\">22,23</a>]. Thus, pruritus is increased by mu-receptor activation and kappa-receptor blockade and decreased by kappa-receptor activation and mu-receptor blockade [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/uremic-pruritus/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. This hypothesis is supported by the observation that the ratio of the mu-receptor agonist (beta-endorphin) to the kappa-receptor agonist (dynorphin-A) is increased in hemodialysis patients compared with healthy controls, and this ratio increased with severity of pruritus [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/uremic-pruritus/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H22425983\"><span class=\"h2\">Other contributing factors</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Mast cell release of histamine and other pruritogens and xerosis may all contribute to the pathogenesis of uremic pruritus [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/uremic-pruritus/abstract/22,26,27\" class=\"abstract_t\">22,26,27</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H30440035\"><span class=\"h1\">RISK FACTORS AND ASSOCIATIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>No single cause underlying uremic pruritus has been identified.

A 12-month prospective study from 1995 included 59 hemodialysis patients without significant disorders of bone metabolism who were stratified according to the degree of pruritus observed over three months [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/uremic-pruritus/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. In the first phase of the study, during which the dialysis dose was not changed, dialysis adequacy was inversely associated with the severity of pruritus; patients who never had pruritus (n = 16), those who had a reduction in pruritus over three months (n = 16), and those who had prolonged severe pruritus (n = 22) had mean <span class=\"nowrap\">Kt/V</span> values of 1.31, 1.28, and 1.09, respectively.</p><p>In a second phase of this study, patients who had severe, prolonged pruritus were assigned to receive either increased dialysis (n = 9) or the same dialysis dose (n = 13) for an additional three months, with mean follow-up <span class=\"nowrap\">Kt/V</span> values of 1.19 and 1.07, respectively. The percentage of patients who reported a decrease in pruritus was greater in patients assigned to receive more dialysis compared with those whose dialysis dose did not change (77 versus 8 percent, respectively) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/uremic-pruritus/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>].</p><p>Importantly, the highest <span class=\"nowrap\">Kt/V</span> values reported in this study from 1995 were still lower than the dose that is generally recommended today (which is a single-pool <span class=\"nowrap\">Kt/V</span> for hemodialysis treatments of 1.4 to 1.6).</p><p>Two more recent observational studies have yielded conflicting results. In one five-year prospective study that included 111 patients, those with <span class=\"nowrap\">Kt/V</span> &lt;1.5 were more likely to have pruritus, and no <span class=\"nowrap\">Kt/V</span> &gt;1.5 was associated with the development of pruritus [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/uremic-pruritus/abstract/48\" class=\"abstract_t\">48</a>].

A posited explanation for this observation is that patients with the higher <span class=\"nowrap\">Kt/V</span> had more prolonged contact with dialyzer membranes or silicone tubing, which caused pruritus. Alternatively, treatment times and <span class=\"nowrap\">Kt/V</span> may have been higher among patients with lower residual kidney function or worse metabolic parameters, which could have accounted for the pruritus rather than the longer treatment time, per se.</p><p>We suggest using the generally accepted <span class=\"nowrap\">Kt/V</span> targets for hemodialysis and peritoneal dialysis patients because of overall benefit conferred rather than a specific demonstrated effect on pruritus.

The etiology is not known. Pruritus has been associated with inadequate dialysis and abnormal bone and mineral metabolism as well as xerosis (dry skin caused by sweat gland atrophy). (See <a href=\"#H22781493\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above and <a href=\"#H30440035\" class=\"local\">'Risk factors and associations'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Treatment involves a stepwise approach that depends upon the severity of symptoms and the response to initial therapies. Our suggested treatment approach is as follows:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>All patients with uremic pruritus should be optimally dialyzed using the generally accepted <span class=\"nowrap\">Kt/V</span> targets. For patients who have severe pruritus despite achieving optimal <span class=\"nowrap\">Kt/V</span> targets and who are highly motivated and able to comply, we suggest increasing the dialysis dose as a trial (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prescribing-and-assessing-adequate-peritoneal-dialysis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Prescribing and assessing adequate peritoneal dialysis&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prescribing-and-assessing-adequate-hemodialysis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Prescribing and assessing adequate hemodialysis&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>All patients with uremic pruritus should be treated for hyperparathyroidism, hyperphosphatemia, and hypermagnesemia to generally accepted target values.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>For all patients with uremic pruritus, we recommend treatment with emollients <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> topical analgesics, especially if xerosis or dry skin is present. (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=2\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1B</a>). (See <a href=\"#H452115\" class=\"local\">'Emollients and/or topical analgesic agents'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Oral antihistamines and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=gabapentin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">gabapentin</a> are occasionally effective for the treatment of pruritus that is resistant to topical therapies. For patients with resistant pruritus despite the use of topical emollients <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> topical analgesics, we suggest an oral antihistamine (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). (See <a href=\"#H655794690\" class=\"local\">'Resistant pruritus'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Either <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hydroxyzine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">hydroxyzine</a> (25 mg orally three to four times daily) or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diphenhydramine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">diphenhydramine</a> (25 mg orally three to four times daily) may be used. Patients who find these agents overly sedating may try a less sedating agent, such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=loratadine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">loratadine</a>, during the day, with the continued use of the sedating antihistamines at night.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><a href=\"topic.htm?path=gabapentin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Gabapentin</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pregabalin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">pregabalin</a> have been shown to be effective in uremic pruritus. For patients who have resistant pruritus despite oral antihistamines and other therapies, we suggest gabapentin or pregabalin rather than other oral therapies (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). We generally try gabapentin first since it is less expensive. The preferred initiating dose of gabapentin is 100 mg after each hemodialysis session, and the dose may gradually be increased up to 350 mg given after each hemodialysis session. If gabapentin is used, the patient should be closely monitored for signs of neurotoxicity. If gabapentin does not work, pregabalin may be effective. (See <a href=\"#H655794690\" class=\"local\">'Resistant pruritus'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Therapeutic options for refractory uremic pruritus include ultraviolet B (UVB) phototherapy and kidney transplantation. For patients with refractory pruritus who are not candidates for or do not wish to undergo kidney transplantation, we suggest UVB phototherapy (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). UVB therapy is associated with an increased risk of carcinogenesis and should not be used in patients who are on immunosuppressive therapy. The carcinogenic potential should be discussed with all patients for whom such therapy is considered. UVB therapy should not be used in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus, because of their known photosensitivity. (See <a href=\"#H80902408\" class=\"local\">'Phototherapy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H176099932\"><span class=\"h1\">ACKNOWLEDGMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The authors and the editorial staff at UpToDate would like to acknowledge Theodore Tzeremas, MD, who contributed to earlier versions of this topic review.</p></div><div id=\"topicAgreement\">Use of UpToDate is subject to the <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/legal/license\" class=\"licenseLink\" id=\"sla_in_page\">Subscription and License Agreement</a>.</div><div id=\"references\" class=\"headingAnchor\"><h1>REFERENCES</h1><ol id=\"reference\"><li><a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/uremic-pruritus/abstract/1\" class=\"nounderline abstract_t\">Patel TS, Freedman BI, Yosipovitch G.
