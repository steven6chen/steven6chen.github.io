Some, but not all, drugs are removed by CRRT. For patients treated with CRRT, it is important to understand the factors that determine drug removal to permit optimal drug dosing [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/drug-removal-in-continuous-renal-replacement-therapy/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. This is particularly true for antibiotics since subtherapeutic levels are commonly observed in patients on CRRT [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/drug-removal-in-continuous-renal-replacement-therapy/abstract/3-6\" class=\"abstract_t\">3-6</a>] and associated with antibiotic failure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/drug-removal-in-continuous-renal-replacement-therapy/abstract/3,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,7</a>].</p><p>This topic reviews drug clearance and an approach to drug dosing in patients on CRRT. The general mechanisms underlying solute clearance by RRTs are discussed elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=mechanisms-of-solute-clearance-and-ultrafiltration-in-peritoneal-dialysis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Mechanisms of solute clearance and ultrafiltration in peritoneal dialysis&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Other issues related to CRRT, including optimal prescription, and anticoagulation are discussed elsewhere.

Drug concentration is determined by absorption, volume of distribution, and clearance, all which may be altered among critically ill patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/drug-removal-in-continuous-renal-replacement-therapy/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].</p><p>In patients on CRRT, drug clearance is the sum of metabolisms and excretion by the liver and gastrointestinal tract, removal by residual renal function that may be present, and removal by RRT. Drug clearance is difficult to estimate and may change from day to day among critically ill patients, particularly as kidney function deteriorates and CRRT is initiated, and as kidney function begins to improve and CRRT is discontinued or the patient is transitioned to other RRT modalities [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/drug-removal-in-continuous-renal-replacement-therapy/abstract/9-13\" class=\"abstract_t\">9-13</a>].</p><p>Hepatic drug metabolism may also change in patients who develop acute kidney injury (AKI). End-stage renal disease (ESRD) and AKI both reduce hepatic drug metabolism compared with healthy individuals [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/drug-removal-in-continuous-renal-replacement-therapy/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. However, AKI patients have higher hepatic clearance than ESRD patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/drug-removal-in-continuous-renal-replacement-therapy/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. This is potentially important since drug dosing guidelines have been derived from pharmacokinetic studies that were performed in ESRD patients rather than AKI patients. Adherence to such guidelines may result in underdosing of drugs among AKI patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/drug-removal-in-continuous-renal-replacement-therapy/abstract/14-16\" class=\"abstract_t\">14-16</a>]. As a result, appropriate dosing in AKI may be higher than what is used in ESRD patients to achieve therapeutic serum concentrations. This has been observed for <a href=\"topic.htm?path=imipenem-and-cilastatin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">imipenem</a> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/drug-removal-in-continuous-renal-replacement-therapy/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>], <a href=\"topic.htm?path=meropenem-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">meropenem</a> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/drug-removal-in-continuous-renal-replacement-therapy/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>], and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=vancomycin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">vancomycin</a> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/drug-removal-in-continuous-renal-replacement-therapy/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>].</p><p>Because of the potential changes in total clearance, drug doses require ongoing consideration, particularly with respect to hepatic and kidney function.</p><p>Not all drugs require dose changes to account for CRRT drug removal. Although the CRRT-mediated elimination of drugs may be the most visible drug removal mechanism, it may not be the dominant clearance mechanism. Drugs that are primarily cleared by hepatic or gastrointestinal metabolism and do not have significant pharmacologically active metabolites that are excreted by the kidney do not have to be adjusted for reduced renal function or CRRT clearance.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3969760824\"><span class=\"h1\">FACTORS THAT AFFECT CLEARANCE BY CRRT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The degree to which drugs are removed by CRRT is determined by drug characteristics and by CRRT features.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3093111057\"><span class=\"h2\">Drug characteristics</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Drug characteristics that affect clearance by all CRRT modalities include the degree of protein binding, volume of distribution, interactions of the drug with the <span class=\"nowrap\">dialyzer/hemofilter</span> membrane, and, potentially, molecular weight.</p><p>Theoretically, larger drugs have lower clearance with continuous venovenous hemodialysis (CVVHD) and continuous venovenous hemodiafiltration (CVVHDF) than with continuous venovenous hemofiltration (CVVH). In practice, most drugs are small enough to be cleared equally well by all modalities. Larger (&gt;5000 Daltons) drugs may be less well cleared by CVVHD and CVVHDF compared with CVVH. However, few drugs fall into this size category; insulin is one such drug at 5805 Daltons but is dosed to a target effect.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2173601196\"><span class=\"h3\">Protein binding</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The degree of protein binding is a major determinant of the extent to which the drug is removed by CRRT.</p><p>Only&nbsp;unbound&nbsp;drug can be removed by CRRT. The degree of protein binding is determined by pH, molar concentration of both the drug and protein, and the presence of displacing drugs as well as by circulating bilirubin, heparin, and free fatty acids. The importance of these factors varies from drug to drug. The percent protein binding can be found for all drugs in Lexicomp under <span class=\"nowrap\">Pharmacodynamics/Kinetics</span> or in the drug package insert.</p><p>However, protein binding is lower in patients with acute kidney injury (AKI) compared with healthy subjects [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/drug-removal-in-continuous-renal-replacement-therapy/abstract/4,17,18\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,17,18</a>]. Reasons for this are not entirely clear but may be related to kidney failure or hypoalbuminemia. As a result of the lower protein binding, dosing strategies that use the unbound fraction of the drug to estimate drug removal by CRRT may underestimate drug removal, possibly by a factor of two or more, although the degree to which this is clinically significant is not known [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/drug-removal-in-continuous-renal-replacement-therapy/abstract/19,20\" class=\"abstract_t\">19,20</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3124954543\"><span class=\"h3\">Volume of distribution</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The apparent volume of distribution is the theoretical volume of water the drug would occupy if the body were a single homogenous reservoir whose concentration is equal to the plasma concentration. Drugs that are lipid soluble or highly tissue bound have a large volume of distribution. Drugs with a large distribution volume are removed less efficiently by CRRT. Drugs that are limited to intravascular compartment have a small volume of distribution and are efficiently removed by CRRT.</p><p>Among critically ill patients, the volume of distribution is often increased because of severe volume overload [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/drug-removal-in-continuous-renal-replacement-therapy/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. The volume of distribution may also be increased by other factors including mechanical ventilation, hypoalbuminemia, and extracorporeal circuit volumes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/drug-removal-in-continuous-renal-replacement-therapy/abstract/5,21,22\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,21,22</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3032365436\"><span class=\"h3\">Molecular weight</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The efficiency with which solutes, including drugs, are removed by CRRT is affected by molecular weight, and, for higher molecular weight solutes, the CRRT modality.</p><p>Drugs &le;2000 Daltons readily cross the membrane and are small enough to be removed equally by all CRRT modalities.</p><p>For drugs between 2000 and 15,000 Daltons, the membrane's pore size becomes a limiting factor in CRRT clearance, with increasing hindrance as molecular weight goes up. For such agents, the degree to which molecular weight affects clearance depends upon the type of CRRT. The primary CRRT modalities include CVVH, CVVHD, and CVVHDF. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=continuous-renal-replacement-therapy-in-acute-kidney-injury\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Continuous renal replacement therapy in acute kidney injury&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The drug molecular weight affects clearance with CVVHD but less so than in CVVH, unless the drug is too big to fit through the pores of the CVVH membrane. With CVVHD, higher-molecular-weight drugs are removed more slowly compared with lower-molecular-weight drugs. This is because CVVHD relies on diffusion, and higher-molecular-weight molecules diffuse more slowly than smaller molecules. CVVH and, in part, CVVHDF rely on convection. With convection, most drugs are removed at the same rate, as long as the unbound drug molecule is small enough to cross the <span class=\"nowrap\">hemofilter/hemodialyzer</span> membrane.</p><p>The influence of molecular weight on CVVHDF clearance falls in between CVVHD and CVVH depending on the ratio of dialysate inflow to total effluent flow. (See <a href=\"#H2268293923\" class=\"local\">'CRRT features'</a> below.)</p><p>Drugs &gt;15,000 Daltons are not removed by any CRRT modality, as they do not cross the membrane.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2268293923\"><span class=\"h2\">CRRT features</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Important CRRT features that affect drug clearance include characteristics of <span class=\"nowrap\">dialyzer/hemofilter</span> membrane and operating conditions (ie, flow rate settings).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1123654467\"><span class=\"h3\">Characteristics of membrane</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Characteristics of the dialysis <span class=\"nowrap\">membrane/hemofilter</span> that affect clearance include permeability (molecular weight cut-off) and factors such as charge that may influence binding to the drug [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/drug-removal-in-continuous-renal-replacement-therapy/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>].</p><p>Membrane permeability is an important determinant of drug removal. All membranes used for CRRT today are high flux [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/drug-removal-in-continuous-renal-replacement-therapy/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. High-flux membranes have greater permeability for larger molecules compared with conventional membranes that may be used for intermittent hemodialysis. Whereas a drug like <a href=\"topic.htm?path=vancomycin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">vancomycin</a> at 1450 Daltons is poorly dialyzed by intermittent hemodialysis using conventional, less permeable membranes, it is appreciably removed when high-flux membranes are used [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/drug-removal-in-continuous-renal-replacement-therapy/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>].</p><p>Drug clearance may be increased by binding of the drug to the membrane, although this is rarely of sufficient magnitude to affect dosing of the drug [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/drug-removal-in-continuous-renal-replacement-therapy/abstract/25-27\" class=\"abstract_t\">25-27</a>]. <a href=\"topic.htm?path=colistin-colistimethate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Colistin</a> is the only drug that has demonstrated sufficient binding to CRRT membranes to necessitate dosing adjustments. In one study, 40 to 60 percent of total colistin clearance occurred via CRRT [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/drug-removal-in-continuous-renal-replacement-therapy/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. Only a small fraction of the cleared drug was recovered in the effluent, suggesting that adsorption to the membrane contributed to extracorporeal clearance.</p><p>The mechanisms underlying the drug-membrane interaction are poorly characterized, although drug and membrane charge are commonly proposed to contribute. Charged membranes (which would be more likely to interact with charged solutes), such as the negatively charged AN69 membrane filter, are less commonly used for CRRT [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/drug-removal-in-continuous-renal-replacement-therapy/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. Clinically significant CRRT drug clearance changes due to membrane charge have not been demonstrated with AN69 versus uncharged membranes. The more commonly used polysulfone membranes are not charged.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1988441629\"><span class=\"h3\">Modality and operating conditions (flow rate settings)</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The specific CRRT modality and flow rate setting may affect clearance.</p><p>As noted above, convective therapies (CVVH) may clear large solutes better than diffusive therapies (CVVHD and CVVHDF). However, for most drugs that are used in the intensive care unit (ICU), the differences in clearance provided by different modalities are negligible [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/drug-removal-in-continuous-renal-replacement-therapy/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H3032365436\" class=\"local\">'Molecular weight'</a> above.)</p><p>Depending on the specific CRRT modality, drug clearance increases with the ultrafiltration, dialysate, or effluent rate.</p><p>Variables that affect clearance and estimates of clearance that are specific to each modality are discussed here.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H28080484\"><span class=\"h4\">Continuous venovenous hemofiltration (CVVH)</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In CVVH, plasma is filtered through a dialyzer but not exposed to dialysate flowing on the other side of the membrane. As a result, solute removal occurs entirely by convection (or solvent drag), with no solute loss by diffusion. In convection, the frictional forces between water and solutes result in the movement of small- and middle-molecular-weight solutes (&lt;5000 Daltons) in the same direction as plasma water.</p><p>In addition to factors defined above (ie, volume of distribution, protein binding, and drug-membrane interactions), drug removal by CVVH is determined by the ultrafiltration rate and the method of administering replacement fluid but generally not by drug molecular weight.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Molecular weight </strong>&ndash; As noted above, for most drugs, the molecular weight is not an important determinant of drug removal by CVVH, since most drugs are smaller than the maximum size that is freely removed by convection. (See <a href=\"#H3032365436\" class=\"local\">'Molecular weight'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">The degree to which drug passage is hindered depends on size. Although middle-molecular-weight substances (such as beta-2 microglobulin, which is 11,000 Daltons) can be cleared convectively, larger proteins like albumin (approximately 67,000 Daltons) do not pass through membrane.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Method of fluid replacement </strong>&ndash; CVVH requires an ultrafiltration rate &gt;20 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/kg</span> per hour to provide sufficient solute clearance. As a result, an almost equally large volume of replacement fluid is required to prevent fluid depletion.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Replacement fluid may be administered before (prefilter replacement (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEPH%2F76626\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef76626 \">figure 1</a>)) or after the hemofilter (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEPH%2F64868\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef64868 \">figure 2</a>). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=alternative-renal-replacement-therapies-in-end-stage-renal-disease#H8\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Alternative renal replacement therapies in end-stage renal disease&quot;, section on 'Substitution fluid infusion methods'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">The method of fluid replacement (ie, pre- or postfilter) affects both the efficiency of solute clearance and estimates of solute clearance. CVVH drug clearance with prefilter fluid replacement is slightly lower than postfilter systems for any given ultrafiltration rate.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Prefilter fluid replacement reduces the CVVH drug clearance by decreasing the concentration of the drug just prior to convection across the hemofilter membrane; some of the ultrafiltrate is simply prefilter fluid replacement solution that has no drug in it. The degree of reduction in clearance is a function of the ratio between the rate of prefilter replacement fluid administration and blood flow rate.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Ultrafiltration rate &ndash;</strong> The ultrafiltration rate is set by the clinician (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prescription-of-continuous-renal-replacement-therapy-in-acute-kidney-injury-in-adults#H1992826777\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Prescription of continuous renal replacement therapy in acute kidney injury in adults&quot;, section on 'CRRT dose'</a>). The higher the ultrafiltration rate, the greater the drug clearance. The degree to which the ultrafiltration increases drug clearance is demonstrated in the section below.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Calculation of clearance &#9472;</strong> The clearance of specific drugs by CVVH may be calculated from the ultrafiltration rate and the solute-specific sieving coefficient (SC), providing the SC is known or the drug concentration can be measured in plasma and ultrafiltrate.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">The SC is the mathematical expression of the ability of a specific solute to convectively cross a specific membrane. The SC is determined from the ratio of the solute concentration in the ultrafiltrate to the solute concentration in the plasma. The plasma solute concentration is estimated from the average of the arterial (A) and venous (V) drug concentrations.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Thus:</p><p/><div class=\"formulaContainer\"><div class=\"formula\"><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">SC &#160; = &#160; [UF] &#160;&divide; &#160;([A] &#160;+ &#160;[V] &#160;&divide; &#160;2)</p></div></div><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">UF is the solute concentration in the ultrafiltrate [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/drug-removal-in-continuous-renal-replacement-therapy/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. An SC of 1 means that the solute freely crosses the membrane and is removed in the same concentration as in the plasma. An SC of 0 means that there is no solute in the ultrafiltrate and thus no drug removal by CRRT. This is generally due either to large molecular size or to extensive protein binding of the drug.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">The arterial concentration is the plasma drug concentration before the <span class=\"nowrap\">dialyzer/hemofilter</span>. The venous concentration is the plasma drug concentration after the <span class=\"nowrap\">dialyzer/hemofilter</span>. The venous concentration is equal to arterial if the SC is 1 and slightly greater than arterial if the SC is less than 1 because more water than solute is removed. This difference is not clinically significant for most drugs, and it can be assumed that the arterial and venous concentrations are the same. There is therefore no need for a venous sample, and the above equation can be simplified to [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/drug-removal-in-continuous-renal-replacement-therapy/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]:</p><p/><div class=\"formulaContainer\"><div class=\"formula\"><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">SC &#160; = &#160; [UF] &#160;&divide; &#160;[A]</p></div></div><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Although the physiologically important concentration is plasma water rather than measured plasma, the difference between the measured plasma and plasma water concentrations can be ignored since plasma water makes up approximately 93 percent of the plasma (which is deemed sufficiently close to unity).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">The SC is approximately constant during CVVH.

Drug removal during CVVHD occurs primarily by diffusion into the drug-free dialysate. The removal of a solute by dialysis is dependent on the degree to which the solute diffuses across a particular membrane. Convection is less important (though can occur) since the ultrafiltration rate is held at a much lower level than with hemofiltration alone.</p><p>In addition to the volume of distribution, protein binding, and drug-membrane interactions, drug removal by CVVHD is influenced by drug molecular weight and the dialysate flow rate [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/drug-removal-in-continuous-renal-replacement-therapy/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>].</p><p>Diffusion rates for any solute are indirectly related to solute molecular mass. Thus, the rate of solute transfer by diffusion decreases as the molecular size increases. This is by contrast to solute transfer by convection, which, for most solutes, is not affected by solute molecular size. As a result, CVVH may theoretically be more effective than CVVHD in removing cytokines and solutes with relatively higher molecular weights.</p><p>In practice, however, CVVH does not appear to provide significantly better middle-molecule clearance compared with CVVHD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/drug-removal-in-continuous-renal-replacement-therapy/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>]. It is possible that the passage of higher-molecular-weight solutes across membranes is lower than expected in CVVH because of the accumulation of plasma protein at the membrane that creates an additional barrier for solute to cross (a process referred to as protein concentration polarization) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/drug-removal-in-continuous-renal-replacement-therapy/abstract/35,36\" class=\"abstract_t\">35,36</a>].</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Calculation of clearance </strong>&ndash; The clearance by CVVHD is the product of the ratio of the dialysate-specific solute concentration to the plasma-specific solute concentration <span class=\"nowrap\">(D/P)</span> times the dialysate effluent flow rate.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">This assumes no clearance from the plasma by adsorption to the dialysis membrane.

Such drugs are likely to be affected by fluid overload. Underdosing may result if volume of distribution is underestimated. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-and-management-of-suspected-sepsis-and-septic-shock-in-adults#H4063271367\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation and management of suspected sepsis and septic shock in adults&quot;, section on 'Dosing'</a>.)</p><p>We calculate the loading doses based on the ideal body weight plus added weight from volume overload (which may be estimated from the change in weight from the baseline weight determined on admission). Doses estimated from the actual weight (rather than ideal body weight) are more likely to be large enough to &quot;fill&quot; the volume with sufficient drug to achieve therapeutic drug levels. The volume of distribution (in <span class=\"nowrap\">L/kg)</span> may be found in Lexicomp, in the section on <span class=\"nowrap\">Pharmacodynamics/Kinetics,</span> and in many other electronic references, package inserts, and published books.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2417820277\"><span class=\"h2\">Estimate of maintenance dose</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Many drugs that are not titrated to clinical response do not have to be dose adjusted for reduced renal function or CRRT. Drugs that are primarily cleared by hepatic or gastrointestinal metabolism and do not have significant pharmacologically active metabolites that are excreted by the kidney do not have to be adjusted for reduced renal function or CRRT clearance.</p><p>Our approach to maintenance drug dosing for drugs that require dose adjustment for CRRT depends on the specific drug (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEPH%2F115298\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef115298 \">algorithm 1</a>).</p><p>For many medications (pain medications, sedatives, vasopressors), we titrate the maintenance dose based on the clinical response. The dose of such drugs is usually not altered by initiation of CRRT.</p><p>Ideally, for medications for which there is not an observable clinical response to follow and which require dose adjustment for reduced renal function, we titrate the dose based on plasma concentrations. Therapeutic drug monitoring is the best method to provide accurate dosing among critically ill patients who have alterations in changes in the volume of distribution, protein binding, and total clearance.</p><p>For many drugs (eg, aminoglycosides, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=vancomycin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">vancomycin</a>, calcineurin inhibitors, and antiseizure medications), the clinical laboratory can provide drug plasma concentration within a few hours of phlebotomy. Plasma drug concentrations can be used in standard, first-order equations in patients receiving CRRT because the CRRT runs continually and at a constant rate, providing there are no unanticipated interruptions of treatment. Interruptions in CRRT decrease clearance. The appropriate timing to obtain the plasma measurement may vary according to individual pharmacy and hospital guidelines but is generally 30 to 60 minutes after the drug infusion has ended; this allows for optimal distribution of the drug.</p><p>However, monitoring plasma concentrations may not be possible. Many drugs can be measured only in specialized laboratories, requiring a &quot;send-out&quot; test that may take days or weeks to be reported back.</p><p>For medications that cannot be titrated to clinical response nor easily measured, we estimate the dose based on CRRT clearance and residual renal function. CRRT clearance must be modified based on the degree of protein binding for the specific drug. The degree of protein binding is described in Lexicomp under <span class=\"nowrap\">Pharmacodynamics/Kinetics</span> but is also described in multiple other references including drug package inserts.</p><p>For patients with significant urine output (ie, &gt;20 mL per hour), we add clearance provided by renal function. Thus we obtain a 24-hour urine collection for determination of creatinine and urea clearance in all CRRT patients who have a urine output &ge;20 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/hour</span>. Significant residual renal function is unlikely in patients with urine output &lt;20 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/hour</span>. We use the mean of creatinine and urea clearances to determine residual renal function since use of creatinine alone significantly overestimates true glomerular filtration rate (GFR) among patients with markedly reduced kidney function [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/drug-removal-in-continuous-renal-replacement-therapy/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>]. If the patient has been on CRRT for a few days, the serum creatinine and urea are at steady state (ie, stable over several days) and can be used in the calculation of clearance. If CRRT is recently initiated and the serum creatinine and blood urea nitrogen (BUN) are still decreasing, the means of the serum creatinine and BUN during the timing interval may be used to calculate clearance, or a single midpoint value may be used.</p><p>We calculate clearance as follows:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Drugs that are not protein bound</strong> &ndash; For drugs that have no protein binding, drug clearance is equal to the CRRT effluent rate since CRRT waste fluid is generally well equilibrated with small molecules with low protein binding [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/drug-removal-in-continuous-renal-replacement-therapy/abstract/19,29,43\" class=\"abstract_t\">19,29,43</a>].</p><p/><div class=\"formulaContainer\"><div class=\"formula\"><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">CRRT drug clearance <span class=\"nowrap\">(mL/min)</span> = Effluent rate <span class=\"nowrap\">(L/hour)</span> x <span class=\"nowrap\">1000/60</span> </p></div></div><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">For patients with urine output &ge;20 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/hour,</span> we add residual renal function:</p><p/><div class=\"formulaContainer\"><div class=\"formula\"><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">GFR <span class=\"nowrap\">(mL/day)</span> = (urine creatinine <span class=\"nowrap\">[mg/dL]</span> <span class=\"nowrap\">/plasma</span> creatinine <span class=\"nowrap\">[mg/dL]</span> + urine urea nitrogen<sub> </sub><span class=\"nowrap\">[mg/dL]</span> <span class=\"nowrap\">/</span> plasma urea <span class=\"nowrap\">[mg/dL])</span> x urine volume <span class=\"nowrap\">(mL/day)</span> <span class=\"nowrap\">/</span> 2 &#160;</p></div></div><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">The GFR is converted to <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/min</span> by multiplying by 1000 (to convert to mL) and then dividing by 1440 (to convert to <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/min)</span> (or by multiplying by <span class=\"nowrap\">1000/1440,</span> which is equal to 0.694).

This dose can be found in Lexicomp under the section on &quot;Dosing: Renal impairment&quot; and in several other references including package inserts.</p><p>This approach can only be used for drugs &le;2000 Daltons. For larger drugs, the membrane's pore size becomes a limiting factor in CRRT clearance, with increasing hindrance as molecular weight goes up. A precise estimate of clearance is difficult for drugs between 2000 and 15,000 Daltons. However, very few drugs fall into this size range. As noted above, insulin is one such drug at 5808 Daltons, but insulin is dosed to target effects. (See <a href=\"#H1778521940\" class=\"local\">'Pharmacokinetics overview'</a> above.)</p><p>There is very little, if any, CRRT clearance of drugs larger than 15,000 Daltons [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/drug-removal-in-continuous-renal-replacement-therapy/abstract/44\" class=\"abstract_t\">44</a>]. Most drugs this size are biological agents (such as monoclonal antibodies and soluble receptor antagonists) that are titrated to a specific clinical response or given as a single dose.</p><p>We generally do not use published references for dosing. Several studies of beta lactam antibiotics have shown that up to a quarter of patients receiving doses guided by published standards fail to attain therapeutic targets [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/drug-removal-in-continuous-renal-replacement-therapy/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h1\">SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The effectiveness and toxicity of drugs are related to their concentration.
