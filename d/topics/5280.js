Each pituitary hormone must be tested separately, since there is a variable pattern of hormone deficiency among patients with hypopituitarism. Diagnostic testing for hypopituitarism will be discussed here. The causes, clinical manifestations, and treatment of hypopituitarism are reviewed separately. (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=causes-of-hypopituitarism\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Causes of hypopituitarism&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-of-hypopituitarism\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations of hypopituitarism&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-hypopituitarism\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of hypopituitarism&quot;</a>)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1984197343\"><span class=\"h1\">INDICATIONS FOR TESTING</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The impetus to measure pituitary hormones is the suspicion that the secretion of one or more may be subnormal [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnostic-testing-for-hypopituitarism/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. This suspicion can be based upon the knowledge that the patient has either a lesion known to cause hypopituitarism or a symptom known to be caused by hypopituitarism. The knowledge that the patient has a lesion that can cause hypopituitarism, eg, <strong>a sellar mass</strong>, is by itself sufficient reason to test for hypopituitarism because some patients with hypopituitarism have no symptoms.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">CORTICOTROPIN</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>For normal health, the basal secretion of corticotropin (ACTH) must be sufficient to maintain the serum cortisol concentration within the normal range. For survival, it must increase to raise serum cortisol concentrations in times of physical stress.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Basal ACTH secretion</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>To test basal ACTH secretion, serum cortisol should be measured at 8 to 9 AM, and the results should be interpreted as follows:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A serum cortisol value of &le;3 <span class=\"nowrap\">mcg/dL</span> (83 <span class=\"nowrap\">nmol/L;</span> normal range 5 to 25 <span class=\"nowrap\">mcg/dL</span> [138 to 690 <span class=\"nowrap\">nmol/L]),</span> confirmed by a second determination, is strong evidence of cortisol deficiency, which in a patient with a disorder known to cause hypopituitarism is usually the result of that disorder. Such a finding in the absence of any known cause of hypopituitarism mandates measurement of serum ACTH. A serum ACTH value not higher than normal is inappropriately low and establishes the diagnosis of secondary adrenal deficiency (ie, pituitary or hypothalamic disease). A value higher than normal documents primary adrenal insufficiency (ie, adrenal disease). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diagnosis-of-adrenal-insufficiency-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Diagnosis of adrenal insufficiency in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A serum cortisol value of &ge;18 <span class=\"nowrap\">mcg/dL</span> (497 <span class=\"nowrap\">nmol/L)</span> indicates that basal ACTH secretion is sufficient and also that it is probably sufficient for times of physical stress.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A serum cortisol value &gt;3 <span class=\"nowrap\">mcg/dL</span> (83 <span class=\"nowrap\">nmol/L)</span> but &lt;18 <span class=\"nowrap\">mcg/dL</span> (497 <span class=\"nowrap\">nmol/L)</span> that is persistent on repeat determination is an indication to evaluate ACTH reserve.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">ACTH reserve</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>ACTH reserve should be measured in patients with intermediate serum cortisol values. Several tests of ACTH reserve are available; each has advantages and disadvantages.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h3\">Metyrapone test</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>We suggest <a href=\"topic.htm?path=metyrapone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">metyrapone</a> testing when a test of ACTH reserve is required. The rationale for the administration of metyrapone is that it blocks 11-beta-hydroxylase (CYP11B1), the enzyme that catalyzes the conversion of 11-deoxycortisol to cortisol, resulting in a reduction in cortisol secretion (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F56413\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef56413 \">figure 1</a>). The ensuing fall in serum cortisol should, if the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis is normal, cause an increase in ACTH secretion and therefore an increase in adrenal steroidogenesis up to and including 11-deoxycortisol.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In normal subjects, administration of 750 mg of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=metyrapone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">metyrapone</a> orally every four hours for 24 hours results in a decline in 8 AM serum cortisol to less than 7 <span class=\"nowrap\">mcg/dL</span> (172 <span class=\"nowrap\">nmol/L)</span> and an elevation in 8 AM serum 11-deoxycortisol to &ge;10 <span class=\"nowrap\">mcg/dL</span> (289 <span class=\"nowrap\">nmol/L)</span> at the end of the 24 hours (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F81918\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef81918 \">figure 2</a>). Patients taking <a href=\"topic.htm?path=phenytoin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">phenytoin</a> metabolize metyrapone more rapidly than normal; as a result, each metyrapone dose should be 1500 mg. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">After the 8 AM blood sample is taken at the end of the 24 hours, <strong>100 mg of </strong><a href=\"topic.htm?path=hydrocortisone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">hydrocortisone</a> should be administered intravenously to reverse the cortisol deficiency caused by the <a href=\"topic.htm?path=metyrapone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">metyrapone</a>.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In patients who have decreased ACTH reserve due to hypothalamic or pituitary disease, the serum 11-deoxycortisol concentration will be less than 10 <span class=\"nowrap\">mcg/dL</span> (289 <span class=\"nowrap\">nmol/L)</span> and the serum cortisol &lt;7 <span class=\"nowrap\">mcg/dL</span> (172 <span class=\"nowrap\">nmol/L)</span> at the end of 24 hours (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F69011\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef69011 \">figure 3</a>)&nbsp;[<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnostic-testing-for-hypopituitarism/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. </p><p/><p>Interpretation of the <a href=\"topic.htm?path=metyrapone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">metyrapone</a> test requires adequate inhibition of cortisol production. If the serum 11-deoxycortisol concentration at the end of 24 hours is &lt;10 <span class=\"nowrap\">mcg/dL</span> (289 <span class=\"nowrap\">nmol/L)</span> but the serum cortisol concentration is &ge;7 <span class=\"nowrap\">mcg/dL</span> (193 <span class=\"nowrap\">nmol/L),</span> the reason for the insufficient rise in 11-deoxycortisol may be insufficient inhibition by metyrapone. In this case, reasons for insufficient inhibition should be sought, such as failure to take all of the metyrapone, rapid metabolism, and malabsorption. The test should be then be repeated using a double dose of metyrapone. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=metyrapone-stimulation-tests\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Metyrapone stimulation tests&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The advantages of the <a href=\"topic.htm?path=metyrapone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">metyrapone</a> test are that it can be administered to adults of any age and the results correlate reasonably well with the serum cortisol response to surgical stress. The principal disadvantage is that the patient must be observed in an inpatient setting so that blood pressure and pulse can be measured lying and standing before each four-hourly dose for 24 hours. If postural hypotension occurs, the test should be terminated by administration of 100 mg of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hydrocortisone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">hydrocortisone</a> intravenously. In the author's experience, managed care organizations approve this 24-hour admission.</p><p>A shorter version of this test involves the administration of a single 750 mg dose of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=metyrapone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">metyrapone</a> at midnight and measurements of serum 11-deoxycortisol and cortisol at 8 AM [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnostic-testing-for-hypopituitarism/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. It may not, however, separate normal from abnormal as well as the longer test.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h3\">Insulin-induced hypoglycemia test</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The rationale for this test is that hypoglycemia induced by insulin administration is a sufficient stress to stimulate ACTH and therefore cortisol secretion. The test is performed by administering 0.1 unit of insulin per kg of body weight and measuring serum glucose and cortisol before and 15, 30, 60, 90, and 120 minutes after the injection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnostic-testing-for-hypopituitarism/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. In normal subjects, serum cortisol increases to &ge;18 <span class=\"nowrap\">mcg/dL</span> (498 <span class=\"nowrap\">nmol/L)</span> if the serum glucose falls to &lt;50 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> (2.8 <span class=\"nowrap\">mmol/L)</span>. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=insulin-induced-hypoglycemia-test\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Insulin-induced hypoglycemia test&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The advantage of this test is that the results also correlate relatively well with the serum cortisol response to surgical stress. The disadvantages are that hypoglycemia can be dangerous in elderly patients and those with cardiovascular or cerebrovascular disease or a seizure disorder, and that constant monitoring is required during the first hour after the administration of insulin. The monitoring is necessary to detect neuroglycopenic symptoms, which should be treated with intravenous glucose (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=insulin-induced-hypoglycemia-test\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Insulin-induced hypoglycemia test&quot;</a>). For these reasons, we prefer the <a href=\"topic.htm?path=metyrapone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">metyrapone</a> test.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h3\">Cosyntropin stimulation test</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The rationale for the administration of cosyntropin (ACTH) is that the adrenal glands atrophy when they have not been stimulated for a prolonged period; as a result, they do not secrete cortisol normally in response to a bolus dose of ACTH. The test is usually performed by administering 0.25 mg (25 units) of cosyntropin (synthetic ACTH 1-24) intramuscularly or intravenously and measuring serum cortisol 60 minutes later. A serum cortisol concentration of &ge;18 <span class=\"nowrap\">mcg/dL</span> (497 <span class=\"nowrap\">nmol/L)</span> is considered a normal response.</p><p>In practice, this test is not often useful because a patient who has such severe ACTH deficiency that the adrenal glands do not respond normally to cosyntropin will also probably have an 8 to 9 AM basal serum cortisol value that is &le;3 <span class=\"nowrap\">mcg/dL</span> (83 <span class=\"nowrap\">nmol/L)</span> and therefore will not need a test of ACTH reserve. On the other hand, a patient who has partial ACTH deficiency may respond normally to cosyntropin and requires a test of ACTH reserve [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnostic-testing-for-hypopituitarism/abstract/5,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,6</a>].</p><p>A low-dose cosyntropin stimulation test has been proposed as yielding fewer falsely normal results [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnostic-testing-for-hypopituitarism/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>], but several studies show that this test has the same pitfalls as the standard dose test [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnostic-testing-for-hypopituitarism/abstract/8-12\" class=\"abstract_t\">8-12</a>]. We do <strong>not</strong> recommend either the standard or low-dose test.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h1\">THYROTROPIN</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Hypothyroidism in patients who have pituitary or hypothalamic disease is the result of thyrotropin (TSH) deficiency and, therefore, unlike in patients who have thyroid disease, an elevated serum TSH concentration cannot be used to make the diagnosis of hypothyroidism. The serum TSH concentration is usually not low either, except when the hypothyroidism is treated. Screening for hypothyroidism in patients with pituitary or hypothalamic disease is therefore performed by measuring thyroxine, either total thyroxine (T4) and triiodothyronine (T3) uptake or free T4. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diagnosis-of-and-screening-for-hypothyroidism-in-nonpregnant-adults#H6\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Diagnosis of and screening for hypothyroidism in nonpregnant adults&quot;, section on 'Secondary and tertiary (central) hypothyroidism'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h1\">GONADOTROPINS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The approach to the diagnosis of gonadotropin deficiency in a patient with known hypothalamic or pituitary disease varies with the gender of the patient.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2179303158\"><span class=\"h2\">Men</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In a man with hypopituitarism, luteinizing hormone (LH) deficiency can best be detected by measurement of the serum testosterone concentration. If it is repeatedly low at 8 to 10 AM and the LH concentration is not elevated, the patient has secondary hypogonadism. When the serum testosterone concentration is low, the serum LH concentration is usually within the normal range, but low compared with elevated values in primary hypogonadism. If fertility is an issue, the sperm count should be determined. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-male-hypogonadism\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical features and diagnosis of male hypogonadism&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3769476255\"><span class=\"h2\">Women</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In a woman of premenopausal age who has pituitary or hypothalamic disease but normal menses, no tests of LH or follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) secretion are needed because a normal menstrual cycle is a more sensitive indicator of intact pituitary-gonadal function than any biochemical test. If the woman has oligomenorrhea or amenorrhea, serum LH or FSH should be measured to be sure it is not high due to ovarian disease. In addition, the following two tests should be obtained:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Measurement of serum estradiol.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Administration of medroxyprogesterone, 10 mg daily for 10 days, to determine if vaginal bleeding occurs after the 10-day course.</p><p/><p>A low serum estradiol concentration <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> absence of vaginal bleeding indicate estradiol deficiency as a consequence of gonadotropin deficiency, and warrant consideration of estrogen treatment. Normal results, in association with oligomenorrhea or amenorrhea, could indicate sufficient gonadotropin secretion to maintain normal basal estradiol secretion but insufficient to cause ovulation and normal progesterone secretion. This situation should prompt consideration of intermittent progestin treatment.</p><p>The serum LH response to a single bolus dose of gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) is not helpful in distinguishing secondary hypogonadism due to pituitary disease from that due to hypothalamic disease because patients who have hypogonadism due to pituitary disease may have normal or subnormal serum LH responses to GnRH, as may those who have hypothalamic disease.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h1\">GROWTH HORMONE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The availability of growth hormone for treatment of abnormal body composition in adults who have growth hormone deficiency increases the interest in testing growth hormone secretion in patients who have hypothalamic or pituitary disease.</p><p>Measurement of basal serum growth hormone concentration does <strong>not</strong> distinguish reliably between normal and subnormal growth hormone secretion in adults. Three other criteria, however, are useful:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Deficiencies of multiple other pituitary hormones &ndash; The likelihood that the growth hormone response to all provocative stimuli will be subnormal in patients who have organic pituitary disease, eg, a macroadenoma, and deficiencies of corticotropin (ACTH), thyrotropin (TSH), and gonadotropins is about 95 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnostic-testing-for-hypopituitarism/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Serum insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) &ndash; A serum IGF-1 concentration lower than the age-specific lower limit of normal in a patient who has organic pituitary disease confirms the diagnosis of growth hormone deficiency [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnostic-testing-for-hypopituitarism/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Provocative tests of growth hormone secretion &ndash; Either insulin-induced hypoglycemia or the combination of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=arginine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">arginine</a> and growth hormone-releasing hormone (GHRH) is a potent stimulus of growth hormone release. Subnormal increases in the serum growth hormone concentration (&lt;5.1 <span class=\"nowrap\">ng/mL</span> for the former and &lt;4.1 <span class=\"nowrap\">ng/mL</span> for the latter) in a patient who has organic pituitary disease confirms the diagnosis of growth hormone deficiency (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F58987\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef58987 \">figure 4</a>)&nbsp;[<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnostic-testing-for-hypopituitarism/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>].</p><p/><p>If a provocative test is necessary, we prefer the arginine-GHRH test, because it carries minimal risk, whereas the insulin tolerance test carries the risk of seizures and angina, especially in the elderly, and neuroglycopenic symptoms in patients of all ages. However, GHRH is no longer available in the United States. Other stimuli, such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=arginine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">arginine</a> alone, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clonidine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">clonidine</a>, L-DOPA, and the combination of arginine and L-DOPA are much weaker and therefore more likely to give false positive results [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnostic-testing-for-hypopituitarism/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. All tests of growth hormone secretion are more likely to give false positive results in obesity. The provocative tests are reviewed in more detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=growth-hormone-deficiency-in-adults#H12\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Growth hormone deficiency in adults&quot;, section on 'Provocative tests'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h1\">PROLACTIN</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The main physiologic role of prolactin is for lactation. Women who have severe hypopituitarism due to hypothalamic or pituitary disease may, in the postpartum period, have a serum prolactin concentration that is inappropriately low and not be able to nurse. No commercially available prolactin preparation is available for these women. (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-hypopituitarism#H8\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of hypopituitarism&quot;, section on 'Prolactin deficiency'</a>). No data are available about serum prolactin concentrations in women without known pituitary disease who are unable to lactate. </p><p>Routine testing for prolactin deficiency is not currently performed, as it is difficult to distinguish low from normal serum prolactin concentrations, and there is no standardized test of prolactin reserve. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h1\">SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Pituitary function should be tested when a patient is found to have a disease that affects the hypothalamus or pituitary (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=causes-of-hypopituitarism\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Causes of hypopituitarism&quot;</a>). Each pituitary hormone that the clinician thinks is clinically important to a patient needs to be tested separately.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Corticotropin (ACTH) secretion is tested by measuring serum cortisol at 8 to 9 AM on two or more occasions; if the value is &lt;3 <span class=\"nowrap\">mcg/dL,</span> the patient has cortisol deficiency, and if &gt;18 <span class=\"nowrap\">mcg/dL,</span> the patient has cortisol sufficiency. If the value is persistently intermediate, a test of ACTH reserve, such as a <a href=\"topic.htm?path=metyrapone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">metyrapone</a> test, should be performed.

Gonadotropin secretion in a woman of premenopausal age who has amenorrhea is tested by measuring estradiol.
