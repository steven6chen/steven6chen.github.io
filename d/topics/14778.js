It uses high doses of X-rays, called radiation, to kill cancer cells. There are 2 types of radiation therapy, depending on where the source of the radiation is.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In &quot;external-beam radiation therapy,&quot; the radiation comes from a machine that is outside the body. This article discusses external-beam radiation therapy.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In &quot;internal radiation therapy&quot; (also called &quot;brachytherapy&quot;), the radiation comes from a source that is put inside the body.</p><p/><p>Doctors can use radiation to treat many different types of cancers. Some people are treated only with radiation therapy. Other people have radiation therapy along with other cancer treatments.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H28823017\"><span class=\"h1\">What happens before I start radiation therapy?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Before you start treatment, you will meet with a team of doctors and nurses to plan your radiation therapy. They will probably do an exam and tests. They will put a small dot of ink on your body to mark the area that will be treated. They might also make a mold or mask of a part of your body for you to wear during treatment. This is to help keep your body still while you are getting radiation therapy.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H28823024\"><span class=\"h1\">What happens during radiation therapy?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>People get radiation therapy in the hospital, but they can go home after each treatment. They do not usually need to stay in the hospital. The number of treatments a person needs depends on the type of cancer. Some people get radiation only one time. Other people get radiation 1 time a day, 5 days a week, for up to 7 weeks.</p><p>For each treatment, you will wear your mold or mask (if you have one) and sit or lie down in front of the machine. You will need to stay still. Your doctor will line up the machine with your dot of ink. That way, the X-rays will travel only through the part of your body with the cancer. The X-rays will not travel through other parts of your body.</p><p>It doesn't hurt to get radiation. The machine sends radiation through the cancer and the area right around it for about 1 to 5 minutes.</p><p>Your doctor or nurse will give you instructions about what to wear and what you can or can't have on your body. For example, most people should not have bandages, jewelry, or other items on the skin in the area being treated.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H28823031\"><span class=\"h1\">What are the side effects of radiation?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>People can have different side effects from radiation. The side effects will depend on:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The part of the body being treated &ndash; As the X-rays travel through the body, they can damage the skin and the organs or tissues next to the cancer.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The dose of radiation</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The number of treatments and the treatment schedule</p><p/><p>People can have side effects hours or days after treatment. Common ones include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Feeling tired, weak, or having no energy &ndash; These symptoms can get worse over the course of treatment.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Skin changes &ndash; The skin in the area being treated can peel, blister, itch, or turn red.</p><p/><p>Other side effects can happen hours or days after treatment. Depending on your treatment, your doctor will tell you the ones that you are likely to get.</p><p>People can also have side effects from radiation months or years after their treatment. These can include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Trouble getting pregnant</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Other types of cancers, although these are rare</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H28823038\"><span class=\"h1\">How are the side effects treated?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Your doctor can treat the side effects in different ways, depending on your symptoms. He or she will also suggest things that you can do on your own. For example, to ease your skin symptoms, you can:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Use creams that your doctor or nurse recommends</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Use sun block and wear a hat or long sleeves to protect your skin</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Not put anything too hot or cold on your skin</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Try not to scratch your skin</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H28823045\"><span class=\"h1\">What else should I do?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>When you have radiation therapy, it's important to:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Follow all of your doctor's instructions about treatment and visits</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Let your doctor or nurse know about any side effects or problems you have during treatment or if your health changes. You should also let him or her know if your dot of ink wears off.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Take care of yourself by eating well, getting enough sleep, and exercising. To keep your energy up, try to eat foods and drinks with a lot of protein and calories.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H28823052\"><span class=\"h1\">More on this topic</span></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=brachytherapy-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Brachytherapy (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=managing-loss-of-appetite-and-weight-loss-with-cancer-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Managing loss of appetite and weight loss with cancer (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=hair-loss-from-cancer-treatment-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Hair loss from cancer treatment (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=nausea-and-vomiting-with-cancer-treatment-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Nausea and vomiting with cancer treatment (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=when-your-cancer-treatment-makes-you-tired-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: When your cancer treatment makes you tired (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=managing-pain-when-you-have-cancer-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Managing pain when you have cancer (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=preserving-fertility-after-cancer-treatment-in-children-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Preserving fertility after cancer treatment in children (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=preserving-fertility-after-cancer-treatment-in-men-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Preserving fertility after cancer treatment in men (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=preserving-fertility-after-cancer-treatment-in-women-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Preserving fertility after cancer treatment in women (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=mouth-sores-from-cancer-treatment-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Mouth sores from cancer treatment (The Basics)</a></p></div><div id=\"reviewProcess\"><span>All topics are updated as new evidence becomes available and our <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/home/editorial-policy\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"policy policy_editorialpolicy\">peer review process</a> is complete.</span></div><div id=\"topicRetrievedDate\"><span class=\"emphasis\">This topic retrieved from UpToDate on: </span>Apr 03, 2018.</div><div id=\"disclaimer\">The content on the UpToDate website is not intended nor recommended as a substitute for medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.
