Typically, the inadequate cerebral nutrient flow is of relatively brief duration (8 to 10 seconds) and, in syncope, is by definition spontaneously self-limited. </p><p>Loss of postural tone is inevitable with loss of consciousness, and consequently syncope usually is associated with collapse, which may cause injury due to a fall (such as may occur if the person is standing) or other type of accident (eg, if syncope occurs while driving). Recovery from true syncope is usually complete and rapid, with episodes rarely lasting more than a minute or two. Longer periods of real or apparent loss of consciousness suggest that the event is not syncope or is not syncope alone (eg, syncope resulting in a head injury, thereby prolonging the event).</p><p>Syncope is only one of the many potential causes of TLOC. Examples of nonsyncopal causes of TLOC, or apparent TLOC, include seizure disorders, traumatic brain injury (ie, concussion), intoxications, metabolic disturbances, and conversion disorders (ie, psychogenic &quot;pseudosyncope&quot; or &quot;pseudoseizures&quot;). Distinguishing these conditions from true syncope may be challenging, but it is crucial in order to determine appropriate management.</p><p>True syncope itself has many possible causes (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F66884\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef66884 \">table 1</a>). Consequently, after the syncopal event has resolved and the patient is hemodynamically stable, the essential next step is establishing the etiology in order to initiate an appropriate diagnostic and treatment strategy to prevent future events as well as to determine prognosis.</p><p>Issues relating to the management of syncope in adults will be reviewed here. The pathogenesis and etiology of syncope, and the clinical manifestations and diagnostic evaluation of patients with syncope, are discussed elsewhere.

Do not try to raise the patient up until the patient indicates readiness to do so. </p><p/><p>For patients who are identified with hypotension without bradycardia, fluid resuscitation is the first approach to treatment. Orthostatic hypotension associated with evidence of volume depletion should improve following volume expansion. Orthostatic hypotension due to an autonomic neuropathy may not significantly improve with fluids, but in most cases a trial of fluid resuscitation is appropriate.

If carotid sinus hypersensitivity is found to cause syncope, then the condition is deemed to be a particular subtype of reflex syncope and is also known as carotid sinus syndrome (CSS). As with reflex syncope in general, initial treatment measures include reassurance and education regarding the nature, risks, and prognosis of the condition. The patient should be advised to avoid accidental mechanical manipulation of the carotid sinuses. Medications that may induce hypotension (such as vasodilator therapy) should be discontinued or reduced when feasible. Pacemakers are helpful in many patients with CSS and cardioinhibitory responses but not as beneficial in those with a vasodepressor response. </p><p>The treatment of CSS is discussed in detail separately.

Orthostatic hypotension associated with evidence of volume depletion should be treated with volume expansion and avoidance of precipitating factors (such as diuretic use). Orthostatic hypotension in the absence of volume depletion is most often due to an autonomic neuropathy or the administration of vasodilator or negative chronotropic drugs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/syncope-in-adults-management/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Long-term management of orthostatic hypotension is discussed in detail separately.

As with all patients who experience syncope, a thorough history and physical examination are critical in determining the etiology and subsequent management. For patients with severe aortic stenosis in whom no other etiology of syncope is identified, and the syncope is suspected to be due to the severe aortic stenosis, aortic valve replacement is indicated. The approach to symptomatic severe aortic stenosis is discussed in detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-aortic-stenosis-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of aortic stenosis in adults&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=indications-for-valve-replacement-in-aortic-stenosis-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Indications for valve replacement in aortic stenosis in adults&quot;</a>.) </p><p>Syncope may also occur in patients with dynamic outflow obstruction resulting from hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM). Again, a thorough history and physical examination are critical in attempting to determine the etiology of syncope and guiding subsequent management. Unexplained syncope (ie, not related to <span class=\"nowrap\">neurocardiogenic/vasovagal</span> causes) is considered a marker for increased risk of sudden death. The approach to patients with HCM and syncope is discussed in detail separately.

Patients with syncope and documented ventricular arrhythmias are at high risk for recurrent VT <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> SCD. Therapy with an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) is indicated in most such patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/syncope-in-adults-management/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Additionally, ICD therapy is an option for some patients who have syncope due to an unknown cause but have underlying structural heart disease that places them at risk of SCD. A full discussion of the secondary prevention of SCD due to VT is presented separately.

Exceptions arise in patients with severe underlying cardiac disease (eg, decompensated heart failure, etc) in whom there is insufficient cardiac reserve to tolerate the increase in heart rate, or when the ventricular rate approaches 250 to 300 beats per minute (eg, atrial flutter with 1:1 A:V conduction, atrial fibrillation [or any SVT] with A:V conduction via an accessory pathway, etc). When possible, patients with syncope due to SVT and an accessory pathway should be treated with catheter ablation. A full discussion of the treatment of SVT in patients with an accessory pathway is presented separately.

However, bradyarrhythmias resulting in syncope are often transient and can be difficult to document, sometimes requiring extending periods of monitoring to capture. In general, if no reversible causes are present, definitive treatment of high-grade AV block (ie, Mobitz type II second degree AV block or third degree [complete] AV block) or prolonged pauses in a patient with documented correlation between symptoms and bradycardia involves permanent pacemaker placement [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/syncope-in-adults-management/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].

However, it is unusual for EPS to be particularly useful in this setting.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pacemaker therapy is reasonable in patients with syncope and bifascicular or trifascicular disease on the baseline ECG if other causes have been excluded, specifically VT.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H16\"><span class=\"h1\">DRIVING RESTRICTIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Driving restrictions are indicated for some patients at risk for recurrent syncope for the safety of themselves and others. In general, patients with untreated syncope should not drive until appropriate preventive treatment has been instituted (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F113080\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef113080 \">table 5</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/syncope-in-adults-management/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Following the institution of therapy for syncope, the duration of time patients should avoid driving varies significantly depending upon the underlying condition as well as the legal restrictions of the local, state, or national government. Because of the significant variability in legal restrictions worldwide, providers should be familiar with their local driving laws and restrictions and advise patients accordingly.</p><p>The likelihood of a motor vehicle crash has been estimated to be between twofold and fourfold higher for patients with a history of syncope [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/syncope-in-adults-management/abstract/4-6\" class=\"abstract_t\">4-6</a>]. In a Danish cohort of 41,039 patients with first episodes of syncope between 2008 and 2012 with a median follow-up of two years, 1791 patients (4.4 percent) experienced a motor vehicle crash at a rate that was significantly higher than the general population (20.6 compared with 12.1 per 1000 patient-years in the general population; rate ratio 1.83, 95% CI 1.74-1.91) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/syncope-in-adults-management/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H17\"><span class=\"h1\">PROGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The prognosis of the patient with syncope is in most cases directly related to the underlying etiology of the syncope and the underlying comorbidities, not the syncope itself [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/syncope-in-adults-management/abstract/7-12\" class=\"abstract_t\">7-12</a>]. As a result, patients can be categorized into different risk categories based upon cause (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F53302\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef53302 \">figure 1</a>). Those with an underlying cardiovascular cause have higher sudden death and all-cause total mortality rates than those with a noncardiovascular cause. Overall mortality in the cardiovascular group after five years of follow-up has been reported to approach 50 percent, with a 30 percent incidence of death in the first year [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/syncope-in-adults-management/abstract/8,13,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,13,14</a>].</p><p>However, a major problem in determining the true mortality rate in patients with syncope is that most individuals with transient loss of consciousness do not seek medical advice. It is suspected that most individuals have a low recurrence rate of syncope and an excellent long-term survival in the absence of underlying cardiac disease. Underlying cardiac disease substantially increases mortality risk. Outpatients never admitted for their episodes may be at lesser risk for recurrence and have a more benign long-term prognosis than those requiring hospitalization [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/syncope-in-adults-management/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3435931473\"><span class=\"h1\">SOCIETY GUIDELINE LINKS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Links to society and government-sponsored guidelines from selected countries and regions around the world are provided separately.

(See <a href=\"#H1261102822\" class=\"local\">'Reflex syncope'</a> above and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=reflex-syncope-in-adults-treatment\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Reflex syncope in adults: Treatment&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients with syncope and documented ventricular tachyarrhythmias are often candidates for drug or device therapy aimed at preventing sudden cardiac death (SCD). Patients with syncope and high-grade atrioventricular (AV) block (ie, Mobitz type II second degree AV block or third degree [complete] AV block) or prolonged pauses are treated with permanent pacemaker placement. (See <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'Arrhythmias'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients with severe aortic stenosis in whom no other etiology of syncope is identified, and the syncope is suspected to be due to the severe aortic stenosis, aortic valve replacement is indicated. Similarly, unexplained syncope (ie, not related to <span class=\"nowrap\">neurocardiogenic/vasovagal</span> causes) in patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy is considered a marker for increased risk of sudden death. (See <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'Obstruction to left ventricular outflow'</a> above and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=indications-for-valve-replacement-in-aortic-stenosis-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Indications for valve replacement in aortic stenosis in adults&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hypertrophic-cardiomyopathy-assessment-and-management-of-ventricular-arrhythmias-and-sudden-cardiac-death-risk\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy: Assessment and management of ventricular arrhythmias and sudden cardiac death risk&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Driving restrictions are indicated for some patients at risk for recurrent syncope for the safety of themselves and others. In general, patients with untreated syncope should not drive until appropriate preventive treatment has been instituted. Following the institution of therapy for syncope, the duration of time patients should avoid driving varies significantly depending upon the underlying condition as well as the legal restrictions of the local, state, or national government (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F113080\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef113080 \">table 5</a>).
