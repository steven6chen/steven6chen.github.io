Initial results of a third self-expandable valve for right ventricular outflow tract (RVOT)-dysfunction are available [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/percutaneous-pulmonic-valve-implantation/abstract/11,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,12</a>].</p><p>The implantation technique for the two valves for PPVI is similar [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/percutaneous-pulmonic-valve-implantation/abstract/1,7,10,13-16\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,7,10,13-16</a>]. PPVI is usually performed using general endotracheal anesthesia or conscious sedation. Venous access is generally obtained through the femoral vein, although a jugular venous approach is also feasible. After a complete hemodynamic and angiographic study, a guidewire is positioned distally into a pulmonary artery. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10923124\"><span class=\"h2\">Balloon test</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Because coronary compression is a serious complication of PPVI, a balloon test to exclude potential coronary artery compression should always be performed. This involves inflation of a high-pressure balloon in the RVOT conduit. During balloon inflation, an aortogram is obtained to display the coronary arteries (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F89248\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef89248 \">image 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/percutaneous-pulmonic-valve-implantation/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. If coronary artery flow is impaired during this test, PPVI should not be performed. For this test, an aortogram may be preferable to selective coronary artery angiogram because intubation of the coronary artery by the catheter may lead to a false negative test. Initially, the balloon test is done with a low pressure balloon to prevent the risk of conduit rupture. The balloon diameter equals the intended external diameter of the landing zone for the pulmonic valve. In case of close proximity of the coronary arteries, a balloon test with a high pressure balloon (ie, Atlas Kevlar balloons) may be indicated as well as selective coronary angiograms in multiple planes.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10923131\"><span class=\"h2\">Pre-stenting</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Observational studies have found that pre-stenting of the conduit before PPVI is associated with a lower risk of developing PPVI stent fractures [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/percutaneous-pulmonic-valve-implantation/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. Therefore, pre-stenting of the conduit before PPVI is now standard practice in most centers. Usually, a covered stent is preferred to avoid bleeding out of the ruptured conduit during deployment of the stent, because high-pressure balloons are needed to dilate the conduit to the previously tested diameter. In some cases (eg, long stenosis or significant recoil during balloon deflation), additional stents are needed for pre-stenting to support the landing zone. A non-covered stent is usually used if obstruction of the origin of one of the pulmonary branch arteries (&ldquo;jailing&rdquo;) is expected after deployment of the pre-stent.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10923138\"><span class=\"h2\">Valve types</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Depending on the final diameter of the treated right ventricular outflow tract, either a Melody valve (balloon diameter 18, 20, or 22 mm and external valve diameter 20 to 24 mm) or a SAPIEN valve (23, 26, or 29 mm) is chosen.</p><p>The Medtronic Melody Transcatheter Pulmonary Valve (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F89249\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef89249 \">image 2</a>) is available in two sizes (20 and 22). The 20 mm valve can be implanted with a diameter of 18 or 20 mm balloon and the 22 mm valve with an 18, 20, or 22 mm delivery system or 22. The Melody valve consists of a 34 mm bare metal Cheatham platinum stent (NuMED CP Stent CP8Z34) into which a Medtronic Contegra bovine jugular venous valve is hand-sewn. The valve is crimped onto a designated double balloon delivery system requiring a 22 F sheath.</p><p>The Edwards SAPIEN Pulmonic Transcatheter Heart Valve (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F89250\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef89250 \">image 3</a>) is available in three sizes, 23, 26, and 29 mm. The SAPIEN valve is made of a trileaflet bovine pericardial valve hand-sewn into a stainless-steel stent. There is a fabric-sealing cuff covering the proximal part of the stent designed to prevent paravalvular leaking. The valve is crimped onto a designated balloon delivery system requiring a 22 F or 24 F sheath for the 23 or 26 mm valve, respectively.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H354444715\"><span class=\"h2\">Valve-in-valve</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>PPVI can also be performed as a repeat intervention after failure of the primary device in the RVOT [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/percutaneous-pulmonic-valve-implantation/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. The indications and the implantation technique are the same for repeat PPVI as for primary PPVI. Valve-in-valve technology has also been used in other prosthetic valve sites [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/percutaneous-pulmonic-valve-implantation/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H354444722\"><span class=\"h1\">OUTCOMES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Short- and medium-term results of percutaneous pulmonic valve implantation (PPVI) with the Melody and SAPIEN valves are similar, though more data are available for the Melody valve.

Pullback peak-to-peak systolic gradient across the conduit decreased from 27 to 12 mmHg. At six months follow-up, the number of patients in NYHA functional class I increased from 5 at baseline to 27.

Therefore, a balloon test to exclude potential coronary artery compression should always be performed prior to deployment of the valve [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/percutaneous-pulmonic-valve-implantation/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. A balloon test positive for coronary artery compression occurs in about 1 percent of all cases referred to PPVI [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/percutaneous-pulmonic-valve-implantation/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H10923124\" class=\"local\">'Balloon test'</a> above.)</p><p>Rarely, hematoma formation from conduit laceration may cause acute extrinsic coronary artery compression [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/percutaneous-pulmonic-valve-implantation/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H354444759\"><span class=\"h2\">Conduit rupture</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Some degree of conduit rupture is always needed to relieve conduit stenosis.

In the majority of cases, stent fractures have no significant hemodynamic effect [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/percutaneous-pulmonic-valve-implantation/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. However, stent fractures may ultimately lead to stent embolization or restenosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/percutaneous-pulmonic-valve-implantation/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. Observational data suggest that pre-stenting reduces the risk of stent fractures [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/percutaneous-pulmonic-valve-implantation/abstract/17,27\" class=\"abstract_t\">17,27</a>]. Therefore, pre-stenting of the conduit with a bare metal stent before PPVI is now standard practice in most centers. (See <a href=\"#H10923131\" class=\"local\">'Pre-stenting'</a> above.) </p><p>Other risk factors associated with stent fractures are severely obstructed conduits, PPVI into a native outflow tract, and presence of PPV recoil during balloon deflation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/percutaneous-pulmonic-valve-implantation/abstract/26,27\" class=\"abstract_t\">26,27</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H354444773\"><span class=\"h2\">Endocarditis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Infective endocarditis (IE) after PPVI has been observed in approximately 1 to 3 percent of patients during one- to four-year follow-up [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/percutaneous-pulmonic-valve-implantation/abstract/7,8,21,22,28-31\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,8,21,22,28-31</a>]. As an example, in the largest investigation of IE following PPVI, which included 311 patients pooled from three prospectively identified cohorts and followed for a median of 2.5 years, the incidence of IE involving the pulmonic valve prosthesis was 0.9 percent per year [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/percutaneous-pulmonic-valve-implantation/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>].</p><p>The rate of IE after PPVI is similar to the generally observed rate of endocarditis after surgical right ventricular outflow tract reconstruction, which ranges from approximately 0 to 5 percent of patients during one- to four-year follow-up [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/percutaneous-pulmonic-valve-implantation/abstract/32-39\" class=\"abstract_t\">32-39</a>]. However, the rate of IE after PPVI may be higher than that seen after right ventricular outflow tract reconstruction with a homograft. A retrospective study included 677 patients with 738 right ventricular outflow conduits implanted between 1989 and 2013 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/percutaneous-pulmonic-valve-implantation/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>]. Kaplan-Meier survival free of IE for patients with surgically implanted homografts was 98.7 percent at five years and 97.3 percent at 10 years; for surgically implanted Contegra conduits, it was 87.8 percent at five years and 77.3 percent at 10 years; and for transcatheter Melody valves, it was 84.9 percent at five years. Thus, the Contegra conduit and Melody valved stents (both produced from bovine jugular vein) were associated with significantly higher incidence of IE than homografts. However, it should be noted that a Melody valve is usually implanted in a stenotic homograft. Therefore, it may be that a relevant number of Melody valves were implanted in a homograft that already suffered from clinically silent IE. Thus, further studies are needed to clarify these important observations. &#160;</p><p>A single-center series reported a significantly higher rate of IE after PPVI with the Melody valve compared with the Sapien valve. At a median of 1.8-year follow-up, there were eight cases of IE among 32 (5.7 percent) patients who received a Melody valve and no cases of IE among 47 patients with a Sapien valve [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/percutaneous-pulmonic-valve-implantation/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>]. Additional data are needed to confirm whether IE rates differ among valve types.</p><p>Vegetations on a transcatheter pulmonic valve or conduit can be difficult to visualize by echocardiography [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/percutaneous-pulmonic-valve-implantation/abstract/29,42\" class=\"abstract_t\">29,42</a>]. A report suggested that intracardiac echocardiography can be helpful when transthoracic and transesophageal echocardiography fail to show vegetations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/percutaneous-pulmonic-valve-implantation/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. </p><p>All patients with prosthetic valves, including those who have undergone PPVI are considered among those at highest risk for endocarditis and therefore prophylaxis for bacterial endocarditis is suggested for high risk procedures such as all dental procedures that involve manipulation of gingival tissue, the periapical region of teeth, or perforation of the oral mucosa.
