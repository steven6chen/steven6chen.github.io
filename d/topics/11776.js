Well-recognized neurohumoral adaptations, such as activation of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone and sympathetic nervous systems and antidiuretic hormone (vasopressin) by the low output state, can contribute to maintenance of perfusion of vital organs in two ways:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Maintenance of systemic pressure by vasoconstriction, resulting in redistribution of blood flow to vital organs.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Restoration of cardiac output by increasing myocardial contractility and heart rate and by expansion of the extracellular fluid volume.</p><p/><p>(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pathophysiology-of-heart-failure-neurohumoral-adaptations\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pathophysiology of heart failure: Neurohumoral adaptations&quot;</a>.)</p><p>As discussed below, HF is also associated with alterations in a host of cellular, autocrine, and paracrine signaling systems that are involved in mediating inflammation and oxidative stress, and may manifest as alterations in the levels of nitric oxide, inflammatory cytokines, and other chemokines that can be measured as biomarkers. The physiologic and clinical significance of these changes is not well understood.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">NITRIC OXIDE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Nitric oxide (NO) is enzymatically formed from L-arginine by three isoforms of nitric oxide synthetase (NOS): neuronal-type (nNOS, NOS1), cytokine-inducible NOS (iNOS, NOS2), and the endothelial-type (eNOS, NOS3) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nitric-oxide-other-hormones-cytokines-and-chemokines-in-heart-failure/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. These enzymes differ markedly in their localization and function. Many cell types, most notably endothelial cells, constitutively express eNOS, generating relatively low levels of NO that are under tight control by regulatory factors. In contrast, iNOS is normally not expressed, but when induced by inflammatory cytokines can generate large amounts of NO far in excess of those made by eNOS. There may be alterations in all three isoforms of NOS in HF.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">NOS in the endothelium</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Chronic HF is associated with arterial endothelial dysfunction and impaired endothelium-dependent, flow-mediated dilation; the mechanism is probably a reduction in NO synthesis via eNOS [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nitric-oxide-other-hormones-cytokines-and-chemokines-in-heart-failure/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>] as well as a decrease in endothelial release of and response to NO [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nitric-oxide-other-hormones-cytokines-and-chemokines-in-heart-failure/abstract/3,4\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,4</a>].

Increased levels of activity of eNOS [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nitric-oxide-other-hormones-cytokines-and-chemokines-in-heart-failure/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>] and nNOS [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nitric-oxide-other-hormones-cytokines-and-chemokines-in-heart-failure/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>], and increased NO production, have been observed within myocytes from patients with HF due to either an ischemic or nonischemic dilated cardiomyopathy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nitric-oxide-other-hormones-cytokines-and-chemokines-in-heart-failure/abstract/7-10\" class=\"abstract_t\">7-10</a>]. The expression of iNOS, in particular, appears to correlate with the level of tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFa) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nitric-oxide-other-hormones-cytokines-and-chemokines-in-heart-failure/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>].</p><p>Nitric oxide may exert either beneficial or detrimental effects in the myocardium:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In an animal model of myocardial infarction, the presence of eNOS limits left ventricular dysfunction and remodeling, in part by decreasing myocyte hypertrophy in the noninfarcted myocardium [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nitric-oxide-other-hormones-cytokines-and-chemokines-in-heart-failure/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>].

While this effect may limit energy availability, it may also reduce the generation of reactive oxygen radicals in the mitochondria.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>NO can also affect basal myocardial function and can impair the inotropic response to beta-adrenergic receptor stimulation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nitric-oxide-other-hormones-cytokines-and-chemokines-in-heart-failure/abstract/10,14-17\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,14-17</a>].</p><p/><p>The localization of NOS within the myocyte may also be disrupted in HF. In a study of nNOS expression in human hearts explanted at transplantation, there was a significant increase in sarcolemmal nNOS and a concomitant decrease in nNOS associated with the sarcoplasmic reticulum [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nitric-oxide-other-hormones-cytokines-and-chemokines-in-heart-failure/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. This translocation of nNOS within failing heart muscle cells could contribute to the pathogenesis of HF by reducing calcium stores in the sarcoplasmic reticulum and increasing inhibition of the cell membrane L-type calcium channel, both effects that would reduce the availability of calcium to the contractile apparatus [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nitric-oxide-other-hormones-cytokines-and-chemokines-in-heart-failure/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>].</p><p>Inducible NO synthase gene expression and local NO production may also be increased within skeletal muscle of patients with HF [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nitric-oxide-other-hormones-cytokines-and-chemokines-in-heart-failure/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>].

In addition, increased production of proinflammatory cytokines and other inflammatory markers may identify patients at increased risk of developing HF in the future [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nitric-oxide-other-hormones-cytokines-and-chemokines-in-heart-failure/abstract/26,27\" class=\"abstract_t\">26,27</a>].</p><p>The clinical significance of elevated cytokine levels in HF remains uncertain [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nitric-oxide-other-hormones-cytokines-and-chemokines-in-heart-failure/abstract/27,28\" class=\"abstract_t\">27,28</a>]. A cause-and-effect relationship may contribute since, as will be described below, excess TNFa and IL-6 may have deleterious effects on cardiac function.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Tumor necrosis factor-alpha</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Plasma TNFa concentrations are often elevated in patients with HF [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nitric-oxide-other-hormones-cytokines-and-chemokines-in-heart-failure/abstract/20-22,29\" class=\"abstract_t\">20-22,29</a>].

Although the nonfailing heart does not express TNFa, significant amounts are expressed by the failing human heart [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nitric-oxide-other-hormones-cytokines-and-chemokines-in-heart-failure/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]. The stimuli for cardiac TNFa expression are not well understood. Passive stretch alone can increase expression in cardiac myocytes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nitric-oxide-other-hormones-cytokines-and-chemokines-in-heart-failure/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>], and, in humans, pressure and volume overload due to aortic stenosis or mitral regurgitation are associated with increased plasma TNFa and other cytokine concentrations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nitric-oxide-other-hormones-cytokines-and-chemokines-in-heart-failure/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. However, inflammation is also likely to be important since increased TNFa production by peripheral blood mononuclear cells is also predictive of risk [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nitric-oxide-other-hormones-cytokines-and-chemokines-in-heart-failure/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. Cytokine activation may be a marker for chronic inflammation. One possible mechanism is increased exposure to endotoxin due to altered gut permeability in patients with edema [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nitric-oxide-other-hormones-cytokines-and-chemokines-in-heart-failure/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>].</p><p>Experimental studies suggest that local production of TNFa may have toxic effects on the myocardium, which could explain the association of TNFa with an adverse prognosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nitric-oxide-other-hormones-cytokines-and-chemokines-in-heart-failure/abstract/34-38\" class=\"abstract_t\">34-38</a>]. The following observations illustrate the range of findings:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Transgenic mice with myocardial expression of TNFa developed severe cardiac disease including transmural myocarditis and ultimately biventricular fibrosis, chamber dilatation, and left ventricular dysfunction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nitric-oxide-other-hormones-cytokines-and-chemokines-in-heart-failure/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>].

Levels are especially increased in those with evidence of diastolic dysfunction and a restrictive left ventricular filling pattern [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nitric-oxide-other-hormones-cytokines-and-chemokines-in-heart-failure/abstract/56\" class=\"abstract_t\">56</a>]. An infusion of adrenomedullin causes rapid and long-lasting arterial vasodilation in normal subjects; these actions, which are mediated by a nitric oxide-dependent mechanism, are attenuated in patients with HF [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nitric-oxide-other-hormones-cytokines-and-chemokines-in-heart-failure/abstract/57\" class=\"abstract_t\">57</a>]. However, even this lesser degree of arterial vasodilation is sufficient to increase the cardiac index and reduce the pulmonary capillary wedge pressure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nitric-oxide-other-hormones-cytokines-and-chemokines-in-heart-failure/abstract/58\" class=\"abstract_t\">58</a>].</p><p>An elevated plasma adrenomedullin concentration is an independent predictor of a poor outcome in patients with ischemic cardiomyopathy. As an example, the Australia-New Zealand Heart Failure study of 297 patients found that patients with supramedian baseline serum adrenomedullin concentrations had, compared to those with inframedian levels, an increased risk of all-cause mortality (risk ratio 3.92), HF mortality (risk ratio 4.87), and hospital admission for HF (risk ratio 2.4) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nitric-oxide-other-hormones-cytokines-and-chemokines-in-heart-failure/abstract/59\" class=\"abstract_t\">59</a>]. <a href=\"topic.htm?path=carvedilol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Carvedilol</a> reduced the risk of death or HF only in those with supramedian levels of serum adrenomedullin to rates comparable to those with inframedian values.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13275185\"><span class=\"h1\">SUMMARY</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Heart failure (HF) is associated with alterations in a host of cellular, autocrine, and paracrine signaling systems, many of which are involved in mediating inflammation and oxidative stress, including nitric oxide (NO), inflammatory cytokines, chemokines, and cyclooxygenase. (See <a href=\"#H1\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>NO is enzymatically formed from L-arginine by three isoforms of NO synthetase (NOS): neuronal-type (nNOS, NOS1), cytokine-inducible NOS (iNOS, NOS2), and the endothelial-type (eNOS, NOS3). There may be alterations in all three isoforms of NOS in HF. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Nitric oxide'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Chronic HF is associated with arterial endothelial dysfunction and impaired endothelium-dependent, flow-mediated dilation; the mechanism is probably a reduction in NO synthesis via eNOS as well as a decrease in endothelial release of and response to NO. (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'NOS in the endothelium'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>HF is often characterized by increases in circulating proinflammatory cytokines (TNFa, interleukin [IL]-6, IL-1-beta, and IL-2) and their soluble receptor or receptor antagonists that become more pronounced as myocardial function deteriorates. In addition, increased production of proinflammatory cytokines and other inflammatory markers may identify patients at increased risk of developing HF in the future.
