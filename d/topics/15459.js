Numerous inherited risk factors for thrombosis have been identified, improving our understanding of the pathogenesis of venous thrombosis. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-the-causes-of-venous-thrombosis#H4\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of the causes of venous thrombosis&quot;, section on 'Inherited thrombophilia'</a>.) </p><p>Within most cases of pediatric VTE there are multiple risk factors. The most common risk factor is the presence of an indwelling central venous catheter (CVC). Other risk factors include prematurity, cardiac disease, inflammation, infection, nephrotic syndrome, cancer, surgery, trauma, use of oral contraceptives, immobilization, and structural venous abnormalities (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F59759\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef59759 \">table 1</a>).

The clinical utility of performing such tests varies depending on the situation, and it is important to understand the potential benefits and limitations of testing.

Numerous inherited risk factors can be identified through laboratory testing (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F88804\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef88804 \">table 2</a>). The inherited thrombophilias (IT) in which the pathogenic link is widely accepted are:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Factor V Leiden mutation</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Prothrombin 20210 mutation</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Antithrombin deficiency</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Protein C deficiency</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Protein S deficiency</p><p/><p>There are several additional laboratory-based risk factors that are often included on a &quot;thrombophilia panel.&quot; These included hyperhomocysteinemia, antiphospholipid antibodies, and elevated factor VIII. These thrombophilias are not necessarily genetically determined, but testing may help identify patients with multiple prothrombotic risk factors or antiphospholipid syndrome (APS). These tests should be considered only when performing IT testing in children who have had a venous thromboembolism (VTE), and not when performing IT testing in children with a family history of VTE. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-of-antiphospholipid-syndrome\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations of antiphospholipid syndrome&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-the-causes-of-venous-thrombosis#H85744917\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of the causes of venous thrombosis&quot;, section on 'Factor VIII'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-the-causes-of-venous-thrombosis#H85739682\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of the causes of venous thrombosis&quot;, section on 'Hyperhomocysteinemia'</a>.)</p><p>The strength of the association between each IT and the development of VTE varies, and they are often classified into &quot;weak&quot; or &quot;strong&quot; risk factors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/screening-for-inherited-thrombophilia-in-children/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Although there are numerous other inherited defects that have been described, none have gained widespread acceptance. Testing for polymorphisms in the methylene tetrahydrofolate reductase (<em>MTHFR</em>) gene is <strong>not indicated</strong>, because these extremely common polymorphisms do not frequently cause hyperhomocysteinemia, and they are not, by themselves, associated with VTE [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/screening-for-inherited-thrombophilia-in-children/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12891109\"><span class=\"h1\">CHALLENGES IN INTERPRETATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>While interpretation of genetic studies (factor V Leiden and prothrombin gene mutations) are fairly straightforward, there are several issues regarding testing that are unique to pediatric patients.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Developmental hemostasis &ndash; Familiarity with this concept is essential for the interpretation of thrombophilia studies in children, especially in those under the age of six months. While the basic pathways for coagulation, anticoagulation and fibrinolysis are maintained, the concentrations of many of the factors vary widely during fetal and postnatal development [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/screening-for-inherited-thrombophilia-in-children/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. Therefore, when interpreting levels of protein C, S, and antithrombin, particularly in infants in whom physiological values are changing rapidly over time, there are rarely &quot;absolute cutoffs&quot; that are useful. Often the normal range overlaps with values found in adults with heterozygous defects and retesting is required as the child matures [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/screening-for-inherited-thrombophilia-in-children/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. Pediatric reference ranges are often not available for tests that are performed in most laboratories. While published, age-related normal values exist, it is important to be aware that direct comparison of test results from different laboratories is often not appropriate because of the use of different reagents and measuring instruments.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Acquired conditions &ndash; There are numerous nongenetic factors that may influence the results of inherited thrombophilia (IT) testing, including acute thrombosis, infection, inflammation, and nephrotic syndrome. Many of these are listed in the table (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F88805\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef88805 \">table 3</a>).</p><p/><p>In all cases, any abnormal, non-DNA-based assay result should be confirmed with repeat testing. DNA-based tests for factor V Leiden mutation and prothrombin 20210 mutation are not affected by acquired conditions or the patient's age, and need not be repeated. When repeat testing is not possible, the hereditary nature of IT may be confirmed by testing the parents.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12891146\"><span class=\"h1\">IT TESTING IN CHILDREN WHO HAVE HAD A VENOUS THROMBOTIC EVENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Prior to testing children who have had a venous thromboembolism (VTE) for inherited thrombophilias (IT), the following should be considered:</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H21290772\"><span class=\"h2\">What is the association between VTE and IT?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The majority of pediatric VTEs occur in hospitalized children with underlying medical conditions, such as prematurity, cancer, congenital heart disease, and infection. Most have multiple risk factors, the single most common being the presence of a central venous catheter (CVC) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/screening-for-inherited-thrombophilia-in-children/abstract/6-8\" class=\"abstract_t\">6-8</a>]. There is a second &quot;peak&quot; in the incidence of VTE in adolescent patients, many of whom present with VTE in the setting of using oral contraceptives or with unprovoked VTE. The reported prevalence of IT in pediatric VTE varies greatly across studies, largely due to differences in patient populations and the tests used. The contribution of IT to the pathogenesis of VTE in a patient with a CVC and other medical conditions is considerably less than in a patient with an unprovoked VTE. The most common ITs identified in pediatric VTE include factor V Leiden, prothrombin G20210A mutation, antithrombin deficiency, and protein S and protein C deficiencies. The relative frequencies of these disorders are described separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=venous-thrombosis-and-thromboembolism-in-children-risk-factors-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis#H5\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Venous thrombosis and thromboembolism in children: Risk factors, clinical manifestations, and diagnosis&quot;, section on 'Inherited thrombophilia'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H21290866\"><span class=\"h2\">Will the results of IT testing affect the acute management of VTE?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Identification of a thrombophilic defect rarely influences the acute management of a patient with VTE, in whom the mainstay of therapy is therapeutic anticoagulation. The exception would be a neonate with severe (homozygous or compound heterozygous) deficiency of protein C or S who presents with purpura fulminans, which can be life-threatening and requires special interventions. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-thrombosis-in-the-newborn#H21\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of thrombosis in the newborn&quot;, section on 'Neonatal purpura fulminans'</a>.)</p><p>In a study of 52 children with thromboembolic events who underwent thrombophilia testing during the acute phase, there were no changes to the acute management, regardless of a positive or negative result [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/screening-for-inherited-thrombophilia-in-children/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H21291108\"><span class=\"h2\">Will the results of IT testing affect the duration of anticoagulation?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Published guidelines do not address whether the presence (or absence) of an IT should influence the duration of therapy for a child with VTE [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/screening-for-inherited-thrombophilia-in-children/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. The decision of how long to continue anticoagulation therapy for VTE in pediatric patients is based largely on the age of the child (shorter treatment courses may be used in neonates compared with older infants and children) and whether the VTE is provoked (ie, associated with a risk factor such as CVC, estrogen, infection, trauma, or immobilization) or unprovoked (unprovoked VTE is generally treated for a longer duration compared with provoked). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-thrombosis-in-the-newborn\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of thrombosis in the newborn&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=venous-thrombosis-and-thromboembolism-in-children-treatment-prevention-and-outcome#H1479721050\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Venous thrombosis and thromboembolism in children: Treatment, prevention, and outcome&quot;, section on 'Approach to treatment'</a>.)</p><p>Some patients with IT may benefit from a longer duration of anticoagulation for treatment of VTE. The decision should be assessed on an individual basis, weighing the risk of recurrence against the risk of bleeding. Factors that may influence the decision include the specific thrombophilic defect, age of the patient, whether the thrombus was unprovoked or related to a central catheter, and risk factors for bleeding [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/screening-for-inherited-thrombophilia-in-children/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=venous-thrombosis-and-thromboembolism-in-children-treatment-prevention-and-outcome#H2362077057\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Venous thrombosis and thromboembolism in children: Treatment, prevention, and outcome&quot;, section on 'Hereditary thrombotic disorders'</a>.)</p><p>In adults, consideration of long-term anticoagulation is recommended for adults with unprovoked VTE, based on risk-to-benefit assessment that includes thrombus location, and tolerability of anticoagulation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/screening-for-inherited-thrombophilia-in-children/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. Testing these patients with unprovoked thrombotic events to evaluate for the presence of &quot;strong thrombophilia&quot; or several weak thrombophilias (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F88804\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef88804 \">table 2</a>), is often performed as it may influence the decision to continue long-term anticoagulation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/screening-for-inherited-thrombophilia-in-children/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. One can extrapolate this rationale to support testing children with unprovoked, unusual, or recurrent thrombotic events because of the likelihood that the most severe cases of IT may present earlier in life [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/screening-for-inherited-thrombophilia-in-children/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=rationale-and-indications-for-indefinite-anticoagulation-in-patients-with-venous-thromboembolism\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Rationale and indications for indefinite anticoagulation in patients with venous thromboembolism&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H21291129\"><span class=\"h2\">Are there other benefits of identifying an IT?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Identification of IT may help provide insight as to why the child developed thrombosis, particularly if the event was unprovoked. This information may help to inform decisions about thromboprophylaxis during future high-risk situations. Appropriate prophylaxis is underutilized in hospitalized patients, and knowledge of an IT may improve adherence with guidelines [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/screening-for-inherited-thrombophilia-in-children/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. In addition, patients and families often appreciate information about an underlying thrombophilia as an explanation for why a thrombosis occurred. Lastly, discovery of an inherited defect will allow other family members to be counseled on their potential risk, allowing them to make an informed decision on whether or not to be tested. Testing of asymptomatic family members is discussed further below. (See <a href=\"#H12891192\" class=\"local\">'IT testing in children who have a family history of thrombosis or thrombophilia'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12891213\"><span class=\"h2\">Screening recommendations</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Based on the considerations outlined above, we suggest the following approach for thrombophilia testing in children with VTE (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F91835\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef91835 \">table 4</a>).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H53347224\"><span class=\"h3\">First episode of CVC-related VTE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>We suggest <strong>not</strong> performing IT testing in this group of patients. The presence of CVC is the strongest risk factor and treatment decisions do not depend upon test results. A 2016 systematic review and meta-analysis found that inherited thrombophilia is associated with an increased likelihood of CVC-associated VTE (odds ratio [OR] 3.2 [95% CI 1.6-6.5]) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/screening-for-inherited-thrombophilia-in-children/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. However, the meta-analysis was limited by significant heterogeneity among studies and a relatively high prevalence of elevated factor VIII, which may represent an inherited disorder or may be acquired. In addition, the prevalence of most other IT traits in the meta-analysis was low and the association with CVC-related VTE was relatively weak. The authors concluded that there is insufficient evidence to support routinely performing IT testing to inform management decisions in children with CVC-related VTE. Exceptions to this recommendation may include children with a strong family history of VTE (VTE in first-degree relative &lt;40 years of age) who develop CVC-related VTE.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H53347242\"><span class=\"h3\">Non-CVC-related VTE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>We suggest performing IT testing in this group of patients, which includes all patients whose VTE is not felt to be related to a CVC, regardless of other risk factors. The prevalence of IT is higher in this group as compared with those with CVC-related VTE, and identification of strong or combined thrombophilias may impact counseling or treatment duration [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/screening-for-inherited-thrombophilia-in-children/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H53347259\"><span class=\"h3\">Recurrent VTE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>We suggest performing IT testing in this group of patients, including those with recurrent CVC-related VTE. Underlying IT is more likely in the setting of recurrent VTE compared with a first episode [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/screening-for-inherited-thrombophilia-in-children/abstract/7,14,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,14,15</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H519826802\"><span class=\"h3\">Which tests should be performed</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>When IT testing is undertaken in patients with VTE, we suggest a panel of tests screening for factor V Leiden mutation, prothrombin 20210 mutation, deficiencies of antithrombin, protein C, and protein S, elevated homocysteine, elevated factor VIII, and antiphospholipid antibodies (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F88804\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef88804 \">table 2</a>). Although elevated levels of homocysteine and factor VIII and antiphospholipid antibodies are not necessarily genetically determined, identification of these abnormalities may influence treatment duration.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H53347521\"><span class=\"h3\">Timing of screening</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>When testing for IT is undertaken, it is best performed after recovery from the acute VTE, to avoid an incorrect diagnosis of inherited conditions. Levels of antithrombin, protein C, and protein<strong> </strong>S may transiently decrease during acute thrombosis.<strong> </strong>Similarly, factor VIII can be elevated in<strong> </strong>inflammatory conditions (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F88805\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef88805 \">table 3</a>) (see <a href=\"#H12891109\" class=\"local\">'Challenges in interpretation'</a> above). Therefore, any non-DNA-based test that is abnormal<strong> </strong>during the acute setting should be repeated later, ideally off anticoagulation. Levels of antithrombin may be decreased in patients who are on heparin, and vitamin K antagonists result in low levels of protein C and protein S. For these diagnostic assays, low levels must be confirmed when the infant or child is well, and testing both parents should also be considered before committing to a diagnosis of an inherited deficiency. The diagnostic accuracy of molecular mutation testing will not be affected, and so these tests can be sent even during an acute episode.</p><p>In a study of 52 children with thromboembolic events who underwent thrombophilia testing during the acute phase, 50 percent had a positive result initially; however, only 12 percent were eventually confirmed to have thrombophilia on follow-up testing [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/screening-for-inherited-thrombophilia-in-children/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12891192\"><span class=\"h1\">IT TESTING IN CHILDREN WHO HAVE A FAMILY HISTORY OF THROMBOSIS OR THROMBOPHILIA</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Testing children who have a family member with a known inherited thrombophilia (IT) or venous thromboembolism (VTE) has become increasingly common. The decision regarding whether or not to test is likely to vary depending upon the clinical situation. The potential benefits and limitations of such testing are described below.

For subjects who are heterozygous for the factor V Leiden mutation and on OCPs, this baseline annual risk is increased 35-fold (relative risk) to approximately 1 per 350 women [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/screening-for-inherited-thrombophilia-in-children/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>].

The young woman will be better informed regarding her choices and may choose lower-risk alternatives, such as progesterone-only preparations.

(See <a href=\"#H12891074\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The most common risk factor for VTE is the presence of an indwelling central venous catheter (CVC). Other risk factors include prematurity, cardiac disease, inflammation, infection, nephrotic syndrome, cancer, surgery, trauma, use of oral contraceptives, immobilization, and structural venous abnormalities (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F59759\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef59759 \">table 1</a>).

This is because the prevalence of IT is relatively low in this group and identification of a thrombophilic defect does not influence the acute management or duration of anticoagulation therapy in such patients. (See <a href=\"#H53347224\" class=\"local\">'First episode of CVC-related VTE'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>In patients presenting with a first episode of VTE that is <strong>not CVC-related</strong>, we suggest performing IT testing. This is because the prevalence of IT is higher in this group as compared with those with CVC-related VTE, and identification of strong or combined thrombophilias may impact counseling or treatment duration.

Any abnormal, non-DNA-based assay result should be confirmed with repeat testing. This is because many of the non-DNA-based tests are affected by acute thrombosis, infection, or antithrombotic therapy, and also vary with the child's age (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F88805\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef88805 \">table 3</a>).
