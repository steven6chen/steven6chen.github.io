In fact, almost all dermatitis is the result of skin surface injury from epicutaneous exposures. Contact dermatitis is divided into two broad categories: irritant contact dermatitis and allergic contact dermatitis. Irritants cause immediate inflammation of the skin; allergens cause an inflammatory response that is delayed by days.</p><p>This topic will discuss irritant and allergic contact dermatitis in children. Contact dermatitis in adults is discussed separately.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=irritant-contact-dermatitis-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Irritant contact dermatitis in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=basic-mechanisms-and-pathophysiology-of-allergic-contact-dermatitis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Basic mechanisms and pathophysiology of allergic contact dermatitis&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-allergic-contact-dermatitis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical features and diagnosis of allergic contact dermatitis&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-allergic-contact-dermatitis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of allergic contact dermatitis&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">IRRITANT CONTACT DERMATITIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Irritant contact dermatitis results from exposure to substances that cause physical, mechanical, or chemical irritation of the skin. Diaper dermatitis and dry skin dermatitis are two common forms of irritant contact dermatitis in children.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Diaper dermatitis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Diaper dermatitis is the prototype for irritant contact dermatitis in children. Diaper dermatitis is discussed in detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diaper-dermatitis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Diaper dermatitis&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Dry skin dermatitis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In dry skin dermatitis, also called xerosis, the surface of the skin appears dry and cracked; erythematous areas often appear within the surface cracks. Common causes of dry skin dermatitis in children include frequent soaping of the skin, and frequent wet-to-dry episodes (eg, lip licking, thumb-sucking, and playing in water).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h3\">Pathogenesis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The cells on the surface of the skin, called corneocytes, have the ability to bind three times their weight in water. Water binding involves corneocyte surface lipids, such as ceramides, and the proteins of the outer corneocyte envelope, such as involucrin and filaggrin [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/contact-dermatitis-in-children/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. In a case-control study, loss-of-function mutations in the filaggrin gene were associated with susceptibility to chronic irritant contact dermatitis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/contact-dermatitis-in-children/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. The bound water provides almost all of the skin surface moisture. It is unrelated to the state of internal hydration. Air humidity of 60 percent is ideal for the skin.</p><p>Corneocyte disruption occurs when air humidity falls below 15 percent <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> corneocyte surface lipids are removed from the surface of the skin by soap or chemicals that cause the corneocytes to shrink from one another [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/contact-dermatitis-in-children/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Disruption of corneocytes causes release of the inflammatory cytokines, tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNFa), and interleukin-1 (IL-1), which are stored in corneocytes.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h3\">Clinical features</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In children with dry skin dermatitis, a history of excessive soaping of the skin, frequent water exposure, or excessive sweating may be obtained. On examination, the skin surface appears dry, cracked, and chapped with a macular erythema. Involvement may be limited to the hands in compulsive hand-washers, to the feet in children who have excessive sweating or water exposure of the feet (juvenile plantar dermatosis) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F62551%7EDERM%2F76443\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef62551 graphicRef76443 \">picture 1A-B</a>), or to the lips and perioral area (lip-licking dermatitis) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F54887\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef54887 \">picture 2</a>). Symptoms include burning, stinging, or discomfort. In contrast to allergic contact dermatitis, itching is usually modest or absent. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H55930776\"><span class=\"h3\">Diagnosis and differential diagnosis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The diagnosis of dry skin dermatitis is usually straightforward, based upon the clinical finding of localized areas of dry, cracked, and erythematous skin in children with a history of excessive exposure to water and detergents, or excessive sweating. Patch testing is not routinely performed in children with irritant contact dermatitis.</p><p>The differential diagnosis includes allergic contact dermatitis, atopic dermatitis, and the ichthyoses. Patch tests to relevant environmental allergens are typically positive in children with allergic contact dermatitis. In contrast to dry skin dermatitis, which typically affects a localized area, the entire surface of the skin may be affected in atopic dermatitis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/contact-dermatitis-in-children/abstract/4,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,5</a>]. Atopic dermatitis and the ichthyoses are discussed in detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=atopic-dermatitis-eczema-pathogenesis-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Atopic dermatitis (eczema): Pathogenesis, clinical manifestations, and diagnosis&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-and-classification-of-the-inherited-ichthyoses\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview and classification of the inherited ichthyoses&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h3\">Treatment</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Restoration of water and lipid to the skin surface and prevention of transepidermal water loss are essential to the treatment of dry skin dermatitis. This is best accomplished with application of moisturizers at least twice per day (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F72872\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef72872 \">table 1</a>)&nbsp;[<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/contact-dermatitis-in-children/abstract/4,6,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,6,7</a>]. In one randomized trial, the use of moisturizing cream reduced transepidermal water loss, normalized skin Corneometer values, and decreased irritant reactions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/contact-dermatitis-in-children/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. The use of nanoemulsions of lipids improves skin hydration, elasticity, and erythema [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/contact-dermatitis-in-children/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. Overall, preparations that restore moisture to the skin surface also enhance delivery of steroids and other active topical medications into the skin [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/contact-dermatitis-in-children/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>].</p><p>In addition, elimination of factors that may predispose to dryness, such as excessive washing of the skin with soap, is critical to the success of therapy. Moisturizers that are accidentally ingested cause no problem other than greasy stools.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h1\">ALLERGIC CONTACT DERMATITIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Allergic contact dermatitis (ACD) is an acquired, inflammatory reaction of the skin that requires absorption of antigen from the skin surface and recruitment of previously sensitized, antigen-specific T lymphocytes into the skin. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=basic-mechanisms-and-pathophysiology-of-allergic-contact-dermatitis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Basic mechanisms and pathophysiology of allergic contact dermatitis&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h2\">Epidemiology</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The exact incidence and prevalence of ACD in children are not known [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/contact-dermatitis-in-children/abstract/5,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,9</a>]. Incidence and prevalence of ACD depend upon exposure to contact allergens, which varies according to geography (eg, poison ivy) and cultural practices (eg, jewelry wearing, use of fragrances) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/contact-dermatitis-in-children/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. It has been estimated that ACD accounts for at least 20 percent of all cases of childhood dermatitis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/contact-dermatitis-in-children/abstract/12,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,13</a>]. </p><p>Although as many as 25 percent of randomly selected asymptomatic children who undergo epicutaneous patch testing react to one or more antigens, the true prevalence of ACD is not known [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/contact-dermatitis-in-children/abstract/11,12,14-16\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,12,14-16</a>]. A positive patch test reaction that is not found to be clinically relevant is termed &quot;contact allergy&quot; rather than ACD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/contact-dermatitis-in-children/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. One specific example of an allergen that induces contact sensitization that is rarely clinically relevant is thimerosal.</p><p>The North American Contact Dermatitis Group reported that of 883 children tested from 2005 to 2012, 62 percent had &ge;1 positive patch test and 57 percent had &ge;1 relevant positive patch test [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/contact-dermatitis-in-children/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. In a single institution study of 2614 children under 10 years of age who underwent patch testing for suspected allergic contact dermatitis, 1220 (47 percent) developed at least one positive reaction, which was deemed to be relevant in approximately 50 percent of cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/contact-dermatitis-in-children/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. The frequency of positive reaction was similar among children with or without a history of atopic dermatitis. The most common allergens were nickel sulfate (23 percent), cobalt chloride (11 percent), and potassium dichromate (10 percent). </p><p>ACD has been reported in one-week-old infants [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/contact-dermatitis-in-children/abstract/20,21\" class=\"abstract_t\">20,21</a>], and sensitization often begins as early as six months of age [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/contact-dermatitis-in-children/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. By two years of age, many children are already sensitized to at least one common allergen (eg, nickel) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/contact-dermatitis-in-children/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h2\">Pathogenesis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>An intact immune system is required for the development of ACD, which occurs in two phases: the sensitization phase and the elicitation phase [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/contact-dermatitis-in-children/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=basic-mechanisms-and-pathophysiology-of-allergic-contact-dermatitis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Basic mechanisms and pathophysiology of allergic contact dermatitis&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The sensitization phase begins with initial exposure to the antigen and may begin in infancy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/contact-dermatitis-in-children/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. Contact antigens are usually low-molecular-weight substances that penetrate the outer layer of the skin and are taken up by Langerhans cells (LC). Sweating may enhance this process [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/contact-dermatitis-in-children/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. After processing the antigen and migrating to regional lymph nodes, LC present the antigen to T lymphocytes. These antigen-specific T lymphocytes undergo clonal expansion, creating a pool of cells with immune memory that can generate an immune response upon re-exposure to the allergen (the elicitation phase). Preliminary studies indicate that macrophages and neutrophils are also important in the pathophysiology of contact allergy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/contact-dermatitis-in-children/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. Antigen-presenting cells and the cellular immune response are discussed in detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=antigen-presenting-cells\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Antigen-presenting cells&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=the-adaptive-cellular-immune-response\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;The adaptive cellular immune response&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In the elicitation phase, the sensitized T lymphocytes proliferate and release inflammatory mediators, producing a localized dermatitis. The resulting dermatitis begins 12 to 24 hours after allergen exposure, peaks in three to five days, and may last three to four weeks if untreated [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/contact-dermatitis-in-children/abstract/22,24,25\" class=\"abstract_t\">22,24,25</a>]. The potency of the allergen determines the number of exposures necessary for this process to occur. A strong antigen, such as poison ivy, requires only one exposure, while weaker antigens require numerous exposures over weeks to years. Once sensitization occurs, however, it is thought to be long-lived [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/contact-dermatitis-in-children/abstract/9,22,24,25\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,22,24,25</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h2\">Allergens</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Contact allergens are found in both the natural and man-made environment (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F58364\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef58364 \">table 2</a>)&nbsp;[<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/contact-dermatitis-in-children/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. The most common contact allergen is urushiol, a pentadecylcatechol found in plants of the <em>Toxicodendron</em> species, such as poison ivy, poison oak, and poison sumac (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F72155\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef72155 \">figure 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F81397%7EDERM%2F54814%7EDERM%2F81173\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef81397 graphicRef54814 graphicRef81173 \">picture 3A-C</a>). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=poison-ivy-toxicodendron-dermatitis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Poison ivy (Toxicodendron) dermatitis&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Other common childhood contact allergens in the United States and Europe include metals such as nickel, cobalt, and potassium dichromate (also tanning agent in leather); topical antimicrobials such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=neomycin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">neomycin</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=bacitracin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">bacitracin</a>; fragrances (fragrance mix and <em>Myroxylon</em> <em>pereirae</em> [balsam of Peru]), preservatives (formaldehyde and formaldehyde-releasing preservatives, methylchloroisothiazolinone [MCI] and methylisothiazolinone [MI]), colophony (rosin from wood), wool alcohol (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=lanolin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">lanolin</a>), and several others [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/contact-dermatitis-in-children/abstract/14,17,27-29\" class=\"abstract_t\">14,17,27-29</a>].

The active ingredients of chemical sunscreens (eg, oxybenzone, octocrylene), although uncommon causes of childhood ACD, are increasingly reported causes of ACD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/contact-dermatitis-in-children/abstract/31-33\" class=\"abstract_t\">31-33</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h2\">Clinical findings</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>ACD presents as pruritic dermatitis most commonly localized to the site of allergen contact with the skin, but can also present as a generalized dermatitis (see <a href=\"#H14\" class=\"local\">'Autoeczematization (&quot;id&quot; reaction)'</a> below). The configuration and location of the dermatitis often is a clue to the offending allergen (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F58364\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef58364 \">table 2</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F81478%7EPEDS%2F70989\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef81478 graphicRef70989 \">picture 4A-B</a>)&nbsp;[<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/contact-dermatitis-in-children/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>].

This secondary dermatitis is also called autosensitization dermatitis or an &quot;id&quot; reaction. Autoeczematization is particularly common among children with nickel dermatitis who have subacute dermatitis at the initial site for several weeks before appearance of a more widespread dermatitis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/contact-dermatitis-in-children/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>]. Autoeczematization is treated in the same manner as widespread ACD.

Patterns of dermatitis that are suggestive of ACD include persistent, localized dermatitis that has not responded as expected to therapy, and dermatitis in an unusual pattern or distribution (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F81478%7EPEDS%2F70989\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef81478 graphicRef70989 \">picture 4A-B</a>)&nbsp;[<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/contact-dermatitis-in-children/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>]. In contrast with ACD, which often has a bizarre or asymmetrical distribution, atopic dermatitis is typically symmetric. ACD also should be considered in any child who has a persistent dermatitis regardless of the pattern, as well as facial, eyelid, or palmo-plantar dermatitis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/contact-dermatitis-in-children/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>].</p><p>Considering the child's hobbies, activities, occupation, and other exposures is important in assessing and diagnosing allergic contact dermatitis.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H16\"><span class=\"h3\">Patch testing</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Although the offending allergen may be suspected through history, epicutaneous patch testing may be necessary to identify specific antigens or, in some cases, to make the diagnosis of ACD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/contact-dermatitis-in-children/abstract/17,26,28,31,34-38\" class=\"abstract_t\">17,26,28,31,34-38</a>].
