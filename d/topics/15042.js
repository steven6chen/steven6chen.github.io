In the northern hemisphere, these usually occur from November to April, with a peak in January or February [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/respiratory-syncytial-virus-infection-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>]. In the southern hemisphere, wintertime epidemics occur from May to September, with a peak in May, June, or July. In tropical and semitropical climates, the seasonal outbreaks usually are associated with the rainy season. The epidemic peaks are not as sharp as in temperate climates, and in some settings RSV can be isolated in as many as eight months of the year [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/respiratory-syncytial-virus-infection-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/3-6\" class=\"abstract_t\">3-6</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Morbidity</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>RSV causes acute respiratory tract illness in persons of all ages. Almost all children are infected by two years of age, and reinfection is common [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/respiratory-syncytial-virus-infection-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h3\">In children</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>RSV is the most common cause of lower respiratory tract infection (LRTI) in children younger than one year [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/respiratory-syncytial-virus-infection-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. In a systematic review and meta-analysis, the global annual rate of RSV hospitalization among children &lt;5 years was 4.4 per 1000 (95% CI 3.0-6.4) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/respiratory-syncytial-virus-infection-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. RSV hospitalization rates were highest among children &lt;6 months (20.0 per 1000, 95% CI 0.7-41.3) and premature infants &lt;1 year (63.9 per 1000, 95% CI 37.5-109.7).</p><p>In the United States between 1997 and 2006, the annual average rate of RSV hospitalization among children &lt;5 years of age was 6.7 per 1000 (95% CI 5.3-8.1) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/respiratory-syncytial-virus-infection-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. Although the RSV hospitalization rate was greatest among infants &lt;3 months (48.9 per 1000), 42 percent of total hospitalization occurred in children &gt;6 months.</p><p>Hospitalization for RSV infection also may occur in children &gt;5 years, but these children typically have underlying medical problems (eg, neurologic disease, immunodeficiency, etc).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h3\">In adults</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>RSV is also a significant and often unrecognized cause of LRTI in both older adults and immunosuppressed patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/respiratory-syncytial-virus-infection-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/10-15\" class=\"abstract_t\">10-15</a>]. It is estimated that RSV may be responsible for as much as 25 percent of excess wintertime mortality, previously attributed solely to influenza [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/respiratory-syncytial-virus-infection-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. The epidemiology and clinical impact of RSV was compared with influenza in a large prospective cohort study of respiratory illnesses in 608 healthy older adult patients, 540 high-risk adults, and 1388 hospitalized patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/respiratory-syncytial-virus-infection-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. Diagnostic testing for RSV and influenza infection included culture, reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), and serology. The study results were significant for the following:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The annual incidence of RSV infection in the prospective cohorts averaged 5.5 percent and was relatively constant during the four years and nearly twice that of influenza A.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>RSV infection developed annually in 3 to 7 percent of the healthy older adults group and in 4 to 10 percent in the high-risk group.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In the hospitalized cohort, RSV infection and influenza A resulted in comparable lengths of stay, need for intensive care monitoring, and mortality (8 and 7 percent, respectively).</p><p/><p>Acute respiratory disease caused by RSV is not restricted to pediatric and high-risk adult populations. Healthy adults are infected repeatedly throughout their lives and typically have symptoms restricted to the upper respiratory tract. In a study of 256 military trainees with respiratory symptoms, RSV infection was identified in 11 percent of patients through serologic testing and real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/respiratory-syncytial-virus-infection-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. Other identified viral pathogens included adenovirus (48 percent), influenza (11 percent), parainfluenza (3 percent), and enterovirus (&lt;1 percent).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Mortality</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>RSV is an important cause of death in infants, young children, and adults older than 65 years.</p><p>Globally, RSV is estimated to cause as many as 2.3 percent of deaths among neonates 0 to 27 days of age, 6.7 percent of deaths among infants 28 to 364 days of age, and 1.6 percent of deaths among children one through four years of age [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/respiratory-syncytial-virus-infection-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. Among infants 28 to 364 days of age, RSV is estimated to cause more deaths than any other single infectious agent with the exception of malaria. In resource-limited settings, RSV mortality occurs primarily in term infants [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/respiratory-syncytial-virus-infection-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>].</p><p>In the United States, RSV pneumonia causes approximately 2700 deaths per year, predominantly in adults &ge;65 years of age [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/respiratory-syncytial-virus-infection-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. The estimated annual RSV-associated pneumonia mortality rate is 7.2 per 100,000 person years in adults &ge;65 years, 3.1 per 100,000 person years in children &lt;1 year, and &lt;1 per 100,000 person years in other age groups. In the United States and other resource-rich countries, most pediatric RSV deaths occur in children born prematurely and those with underlying cardiopulmonary disease or other chronic conditions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/respiratory-syncytial-virus-infection-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/20,21\" class=\"abstract_t\">20,21</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Risk factors</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients at risk for lower respiratory tract disease include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Infants younger than six months of age [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/respiratory-syncytial-virus-infection-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>], particularly those who are born during the first half of the RSV season, those attending daycare [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/respiratory-syncytial-virus-infection-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/23,24\" class=\"abstract_t\">23,24</a>], and those with older siblings (who may have asymptomatic RSV infection) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/respiratory-syncytial-virus-infection-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/25,26\" class=\"abstract_t\">25,26</a>] (see <a href=\"#H11\" class=\"local\">'Transmission'</a> below)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Infants and children with underlying lung disease, such as chronic lung disease (bronchopulmonary dysplasia) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/respiratory-syncytial-virus-infection-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/2,22,27\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,22,27</a>]</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Infants born before 35 weeks gestation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/respiratory-syncytial-virus-infection-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/22,26-28\" class=\"abstract_t\">22,26-28</a>]</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Infants and children with congenital heart disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/respiratory-syncytial-virus-infection-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/22,29,30\" class=\"abstract_t\">22,29,30</a>]</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Infants exposed to secondhand smoke [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/respiratory-syncytial-virus-infection-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/31,32\" class=\"abstract_t\">31,32</a>]</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients with Down syndrome [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/respiratory-syncytial-virus-infection-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>]</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Immunocompromised patients (eg, severe combined immunodeficiency, leukemia, or hematopoietic cell or lung transplant) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/respiratory-syncytial-virus-infection-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/29,34-38\" class=\"abstract_t\">29,34-38</a>]</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients of any age group with significant asthma</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Adults with cardiopulmonary disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/respiratory-syncytial-virus-infection-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/38,39\" class=\"abstract_t\">38,39</a>]</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Residence at altitude &gt;2500 m [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/respiratory-syncytial-virus-infection-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>]</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Institutionalized older adults [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/respiratory-syncytial-virus-infection-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Older adult patients with chronic pulmonary disease or functional disability [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/respiratory-syncytial-virus-infection-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>]</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h2\">Genetic predisposition</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Children with Down syndrome are at increased risk for severe RSV disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/respiratory-syncytial-virus-infection-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>]. In addition, studies evaluating potential genetic predisposition to severe RSV disease have revealed associations with polymorphisms in cytokine- and chemokine-related genes including interleukin (IL)-4 and its receptor, IL-8, IL-10, IL-13, and chemokine receptor (CCR)5 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/respiratory-syncytial-virus-infection-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/42-47\" class=\"abstract_t\">42-47</a>]. Genetic polymorphisms in genes related to potential virus-cell surface interactions or cell signaling such as toll-like receptor (TL)-4, chemokine receptor 1 (CX3CR1), surfactant protein (SP)-A, and SP-D also have been associated with severe RSV disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/respiratory-syncytial-virus-infection-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/48-52\" class=\"abstract_t\">48-52</a>]. These types of analyses will continue to expand understanding of disease pathogenesis and one day may improve the ability to predict which infants are predisposed to severe illness from RSV.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h1\">MICROBIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>RSV is a single-stranded, negative-sense ribonucleic acid (RNA) virus and a member of the <em>Paramyxoviridae </em>family. Two subtypes, A and B, are simultaneously present in most outbreaks, with A subtypes typically causing more severe disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/respiratory-syncytial-virus-infection-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/53-57\" class=\"abstract_t\">53-57</a>]. Several distinct genotypes within these subtypes predominate within a community; the dominant strains shift yearly, perhaps accounting for frequent reinfections [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/respiratory-syncytial-virus-infection-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/53,58\" class=\"abstract_t\">53,58</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h2\">Transmission</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Transmission of RSV is primarily by inoculation of nasopharyngeal or ocular mucous membranes after contact with virus-containing secretions or fomites [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/respiratory-syncytial-virus-infection-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/59,60\" class=\"abstract_t\">59,60</a>]. Direct contact is the most common route of transmission, but aerosol droplets also have been implicated [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/respiratory-syncytial-virus-infection-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/61-63\" class=\"abstract_t\">61-63</a>]. RSV can survive for several hours on hands and fomites [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/respiratory-syncytial-virus-infection-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/53\" class=\"abstract_t\">53</a>]. Hand washing and contact precautions are therefore important measures to prevent health care-associated spread. Studies of transmission dynamics suggest that infection of infants most often follows infection of older siblings [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/respiratory-syncytial-virus-infection-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/64\" class=\"abstract_t\">64</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=respiratory-syncytial-virus-infection-prevention#H104278849\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Respiratory syncytial virus infection: Prevention&quot;, section on 'Health care-associated infection'</a>.)</p><p>A prospective study evaluated nasopharyngeal swab specimens from a cohort of 47 households (493 individuals) during a seasonal outbreak of RSV [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/respiratory-syncytial-virus-infection-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/25,64,65\" class=\"abstract_t\">25,64,65</a>]. Among 205 RSV infection episodes in 179 individuals from 40 households, 42 percent were asymptomatic [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/respiratory-syncytial-virus-infection-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>].

The duration of shedding varied with age and other factors, and was increased in primary infection. When detected with viral culture or immunofluorescence, the period of viral shedding is usually shorter &ndash; three to eight days [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/respiratory-syncytial-virus-infection-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/66,67\" class=\"abstract_t\">66,67</a>] &ndash; but it may last up to four weeks in young infants and several months in children with human immunodeficiency virus infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/respiratory-syncytial-virus-infection-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h2\">Incubation period</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The incubation period is usually four to six days (range two to eight days) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/respiratory-syncytial-virus-infection-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h2\">Immunity</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Although virtually all individuals have been infected with RSV by age two years, previous infection with RSV does not appear to convey complete protection against reinfection, even when significant specific antibody titers are present [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/respiratory-syncytial-virus-infection-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/68\" class=\"abstract_t\">68</a>]. Humoral immunity may be more important in ameliorating the severity of RSV infection than in preventing disease entirely, based upon the following observations:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Individuals can be infected more than once in the same RSV season; however, subsequent infections are usually milder whether they occur in the same season or in different years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/respiratory-syncytial-virus-infection-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/69\" class=\"abstract_t\">69</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Transplacentally acquired antibody against RSV does not protect infants against infection. However, infants with high antibody titers usually have milder symptoms restricted to the upper respiratory tract [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/respiratory-syncytial-virus-infection-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/70\" class=\"abstract_t\">70</a>]. In a population-based study, mean cord blood RSV antibody titer was inversely correlated with RSV hospitalizations among infants younger than six months of age [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/respiratory-syncytial-virus-infection-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/71\" class=\"abstract_t\">71</a>]. As mean cord blood RSV antibody titers decreased, hospitalizations increased.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Older adults with lower immunoglobulin G (IgG) anti-RSV titers are significantly more likely to develop symptomatic RSV infection than are similar patients with higher titers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/respiratory-syncytial-virus-infection-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>].</p><p/><p>The role of cellular immunity against RSV in humans is not well defined, although there are many observations in animal models that have informed our understanding [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/respiratory-syncytial-virus-infection-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/72-74\" class=\"abstract_t\">72-74</a>]. Patients with severe combined immunodeficiency syndrome and those following allogenic hematopoietic cell transplantation often have fatal RSV disease and difficulty clearing virus, suggesting the importance of cluster of differentiation 8 (CD8) T cells for controlling virus spread [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/respiratory-syncytial-virus-infection-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/75\" class=\"abstract_t\">75</a>]. This may also be an important mechanism of immunity in older adults [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/respiratory-syncytial-virus-infection-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/76\" class=\"abstract_t\">76</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14\"><span class=\"h1\">PATHOGENESIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>After replicating in the nasopharynx, RSV infects the small bronchiolar epithelium, sparing the basal cells, then extends to the type 1 and 2 alveolar pneumocytes in the lung, presumably by cell-to-cell spread or aspiration of secretions; lower respiratory tract infection occurs one to three days later [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/respiratory-syncytial-virus-infection-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/77,78\" class=\"abstract_t\">77,78</a>]. Pathologic findings of RSV include necrosis of epithelial cells, occasional proliferation of the bronchiolar epithelium, infiltration of monocytes and T cells centered on bronchial and pulmonary arterioles, and infiltration of neutrophils between the vascular structures and small airways [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/respiratory-syncytial-virus-infection-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/77,79\" class=\"abstract_t\">77,79</a>]. This leads to airway obstruction, air trapping, and increased airway resistance, and also is associated with a finding of neutrophilia in bronchoalveolar lavage [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/respiratory-syncytial-virus-infection-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/80\" class=\"abstract_t\">80</a>].</p><p>RSV is highly restricted to the respiratory epithelium and is shed apically into the lumen of the airways. In very rare cases, RSV may be recovered from extrapulmonary tissues, such as liver [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/respiratory-syncytial-virus-infection-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/81\" class=\"abstract_t\">81</a>], cerebrospinal fluid [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/respiratory-syncytial-virus-infection-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/82\" class=\"abstract_t\">82</a>], or pericardial fluid [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/respiratory-syncytial-virus-infection-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/83\" class=\"abstract_t\">83</a>]. RSV has never been isolated from blood, although two reports have identified evidence of RSV genome by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) in blood [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/respiratory-syncytial-virus-infection-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/84,85\" class=\"abstract_t\">84,85</a>]. Since there is evidence that viable virus is rarely present in extrapulmonary tissue, the PCR findings may represent phagocytized virus present in circulating monocytes.</p><p>The immune response to RSV, especially cytokine and chemokine release, appears to play a role in the pathogenesis and severity of bronchiolitis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/respiratory-syncytial-virus-infection-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/86-91\" class=\"abstract_t\">86-91</a>]. The cytokines interleukin (IL)-8, IL-6, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha, and IL-1 beta can be detected in airway secretions of infected children [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/respiratory-syncytial-virus-infection-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/92-94\" class=\"abstract_t\">92-94</a>], and IL-6 levels correlate with severe disease. Chemokines identified in respiratory tract secretions of children include chemokine ligand (CCL)3 (macrophage inflammatory protein-1 [MIP-1 alpha]), CCL2 (monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 [MCP-1]), CCL11 (eotaxin), and CCL5 (RANTES [regulated on activation, normal T cell expressed and secreted]) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/respiratory-syncytial-virus-infection-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/87,95\" class=\"abstract_t\">87,95</a>], but only the beta-chemokines, particularly MIP-1 alpha, are associated with severe disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/respiratory-syncytial-virus-infection-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/87,95,96\" class=\"abstract_t\">87,95,96</a>]. RSV infection of explanted polarized, differentiated respiratory epithelium in tissue culture elicits IL-8 and CCL5 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/respiratory-syncytial-virus-infection-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/97\" class=\"abstract_t\">97</a>], suggesting these epithelium-derived factors may be important for attracting inflammatory cells to the infected lung.
