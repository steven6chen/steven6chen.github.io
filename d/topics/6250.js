Leprosy is an important global health concern; early diagnosis and a full course of treatment are critical for preventing lifelong neuropathy and disability [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-microbiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-leprosy/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p>Leprosy remains poorly understood and often feared by the general public and even by some in the healthcare professions, although (contrary to popular folklore) it is not highly contagious, and very effective treatment is available [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-microbiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-leprosy/abstract/2,3\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,3</a>]. Although the infection is highly responsive to treatment, disabilities of the eyes, hands, and feet due to neuropathy are often not reversible and may require lifelong care and rehabilitation. Therefore, early diagnosis and management are necessary to minimize the likelihood of these disabilities [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-microbiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-leprosy/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].</p><p>The epidemiology, microbiology, clinical manifestations, and diagnosis of leprosy are reviewed here. Issues related to treatment are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-and-prevention-of-leprosy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment and prevention of leprosy&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H554463610\"><span class=\"h1\">EPIDEMIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In the 1990s, the World Health Organization (WHO) established a goal of eliminating leprosy as a public health problem by the year 2000; &quot;elimination&quot; was defined as a reduction in prevalence to &lt;1 case per 10,000 population in all endemic countries. Between 1985 and 2011, the number of registered cases fell from 5.4 million to 219,075; the prevalence rate per 10,000 fell from 21.1 to 0.37; these figures exclude Europe [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-microbiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-leprosy/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].</p><p>The prevalence of leprosy is variable; the overwhelming majority of cases are found in developing countries. Of the 16 countries reporting more than 1000 new cases annually in 2009, the greatest numbers of new cases were seen in India, Brazil, Indonesia, Bangladesh, and Nigeria [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-microbiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-leprosy/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. With increasing international travel, however, patients with leprosy may present anywhere.</p><p>Epidemiologic data for leprosy are highly sensitive to operational factors; nearly all data are based on passive case finding. A study using active case finding by house-to-house surveys in Bangladesh recorded nearly fivefold more cases than were believed to exist in the area by passive case finding alone [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-microbiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-leprosy/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].</p><p>According to the Registry of the National Hansen's Disease Programs (NHDP), 205 new cases were detected in the United States in 2010 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-microbiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-leprosy/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. Approximately 75 percent of new cases detected annually in the United States are among immigrants. Among native-born United States citizens developing the disease, exposure to leprosy overseas accounts for some cases. Contact with a known case in the United States can sometimes be established; some cases are attributable to exposure to infected armadillos [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-microbiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-leprosy/abstract/8-10\" class=\"abstract_t\">8-10</a>]. However, in many patients, no history of exposure can be established.</p><p>In general, leprosy is more common among males with a ratio of approximately 1.5 to 1. In 2009, lepromatous (multibacillary) cases accounted of 61 percent of new patients in the United States [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-microbiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-leprosy/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]; the figure ranged from 33 to 94 percent globally [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-microbiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-leprosy/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Transmission</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The means of transmission is not fully understood. The disease is probably spread by the respiratory route; nasal discharge from untreated patients with lepromatous (multibacillary) disease frequently contains large numbers of bacilli [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-microbiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-leprosy/abstract/11,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,12</a>]. Once the upper respiratory tract of the new host is infected, widespread dissemination within the host may occur. Occasionally, the organisms may enter through broken skin [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-microbiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-leprosy/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. Contact with armadillos (handling, killing, or eating) has been reported in some cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-microbiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-leprosy/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].</p><p>In general, most individuals do NOT develop the disease following exposure. Development of disease depends on a variety of factors, including immune status and genetic influences, as discussed below.

Close physical distance to the index case was associated with an increased risk of leprosy in one study [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-microbiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-leprosy/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Type of leprosy in index patient &ndash; Some studies have suggested that contacts of patients with lepromatous (multibacillary) leprosy have a higher risk than contacts of patients with tuberculoid (paucibacillary) leprosy or single-lesion leprosy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-microbiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-leprosy/abstract/13,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,15</a>].

Using molecular strain-typing techniques, one study identified the same strain of <em>M. leprae</em> in wild armadillos and in patients from the region who did not have foreign exposure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-microbiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-leprosy/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Age &ndash; Older individuals appear to be at increased risk for leprosy. In one study, the effect of age was bimodal, with an increased risk between age 5 and 15 years; the risk increased again after age 30 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-microbiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-leprosy/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Genetic influences &ndash; The immunologic response to <em>M. leprae</em> consists of two components: innate and acquired immunity. Innate immunity is determined by genetic factors, including alleles of the <em>PARK2</em><span class=\"nowrap\">/<em>PACRG</span> </em>gene [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-microbiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-leprosy/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>] as well as other genes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-microbiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-leprosy/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. In a genome-wide association study of patients in China, variants of genes in the NOD2-mediated signaling pathway (which regulates the innate immune response) were found to be associated with susceptibility to leprosy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-microbiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-leprosy/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. Such immunity is understood to be mediated through cells of <span class=\"nowrap\">monocyte/dendritic</span> cell origin; the mechanisms of this immunity are under investigation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-microbiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-leprosy/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Individuals susceptible to <em>M. leprae</em> with sufficient exposure to become infected can develop a broad range of clinical manifestations that vary depending upon the host's ability to mount an acquired immune response to infection. This cellular immune response appears to be controlled by a number of non-human leukocyte antigen (HLA) genes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-microbiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-leprosy/abstract/14,20,21\" class=\"abstract_t\">14,20,21</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">It is difficult to discern the relative contribution of genetic factors following exposure. A prospective cohort study including 1037 patients newly diagnosed with leprosy, along with their 21,870 contacts, demonstrated that genetic relationship was a relevant risk factor, independent of physical distance for exposure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-microbiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-leprosy/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Immunosuppression &ndash; Immunosuppression increases susceptibility to this infection, as evidenced by the development of leprosy following solid organ transplantation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-microbiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-leprosy/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>], chemotherapy, HIV infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-microbiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-leprosy/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>], or use of biologic agents for management of rheumatologic conditions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-microbiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-leprosy/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1710007\"><span class=\"h1\">MICROBIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Leprosy is caused by the acid-fast bacillus <em>M. leprae</em>. The bacillus multiplies very slowly (generation time approximately 12.5 days) and is an obligate intracellular organism; it cannot be cultured in artificial media.</p><p>Studies in animal models indicate that <em>M. leprae</em> grows best at 27 to 33&ordm;C, correlating with its predilection to affect cooler areas of the body (the skin, nerve segments close to the skin, and the mucous membranes of the upper respiratory tract) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-microbiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-leprosy/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. <em>M. leprae</em> grows extensively in the nine-banded armadillo (<em>Dasypus novemcinctus</em>), which has a core body temperature of 34&ordm;C. Leprosy is found in wild armadillos in the south central United States [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-microbiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-leprosy/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>] and has been found in a chimpanzee, sooty mangabey monkeys, and a cynomolgus macaque [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-microbiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-leprosy/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>].</p><p>The genome of <em>M. leprae</em> has been fully sequenced [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-microbiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-leprosy/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. <em>M. leprae</em> has less than half of the functional genes of <em>M. tuberculosis</em>. It contains an extraordinary number of pseudogenes, and genes for key enzymes of many essential metabolic pathways are missing [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-microbiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-leprosy/abstract/15,27\" class=\"abstract_t\">15,27</a>].

The leprosy disease spectrum ranges from a form with a robust immune response and very few organisms (tuberculoid or pauci-bacillary) to a form with a weaker immune response and a higher burden of organisms (lepromatous or multi-bacillary). The classification is based on the cutaneous, neurologic, and biopsy findings, all of which correlate with immunological capability of the individual (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F67611\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef67611 \">figure 1</a>). The categories also correlate with the number of acid-fast bacilli present in the dermis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-microbiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-leprosy/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Tuberculoid (TT)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Borderline tuberculoid (BT)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Mid-borderline (BB)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Borderline lepromatous (BL)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Lepromatous (LL)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Indeterminate (I)</p><p/><p>Patients with a high degree of cell-mediated immunity and delayed hypersensitivity to <em>M. leprae</em> present with one to three well-demarcated lesions with central hypopigmentation and hypoesthesia. Histologically, these demonstrate well-developed granulomatous inflammation and rare acid-fast bacilli in the tissues; this is termed polar tuberculoid (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F67611\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef67611 \">figure 1</a>).</p><p>At the other extreme, patients with no apparent resistance to M. leprae present with numerous, poorly demarcated, raised or nodular lesions on all parts of the body. Histologically, these reveal sheets of foamy macrophages in the dermis containing very large numbers of bacilli. This form of infection with a high burden of disease is termed polar lepromatous. Notably, these patients are not immunosuppressed but have a selective inability to mount cellular immunity to <em>M. leprae</em>.</p><p>The majority of patients fall into a broad borderline category between TT and LL. This is subdivided into borderline lepromatous, mid-borderline, and borderline tuberculoid.</p><p>Very early lesions may present as relatively nonspecific perineural infiltrates in which rare acid-fast bacilli can be demonstrated. In the absence of sufficient criteria for classification, these are called indeterminate. Indeterminate lesions are usually observed in the setting of contact investigation, often in children, and may heal spontaneously [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-microbiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-leprosy/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>]. The indeterminate classification should be used only when the biopsy sample shows definite diagnostic evidence of leprosy (both nerve involvement and acid-fast bacilli) but is not advanced enough to identify the patient&rsquo;s position in the leprosy spectrum. &quot;Indeterminate&quot; should not be used if the diagnosis of leprosy is not clearly established, since a diagnosis of leprosy may often have significant impact on a patient's family, employment, and psychological and social status.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H21480424\"><span class=\"h2\">WHO classification</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The World Health Organization (WHO) classification system was designed for use in situations in which there is little or no clinical expertise or laboratory support; it is based upon the number of skin lesions present [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-microbiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-leprosy/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>]. Paucibacillary (PB) leprosy is defined as five or fewer skin lesions without detectable bacilli on skin smears. Patients with only a single skin lesion are classified separately as single-lesion PB. Multibacillary (MB) leprosy is defined as six or more lesions and may be skin smear positive. Counting skin lesions alone may lead to misclassification of many patients with PB leprosy rather than MB leprosy, leading to undertreatment in some cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-microbiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-leprosy/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL MANIFESTATIONS AND DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Leprosy should be considered in the setting of skin lesions that are chronic and not responding to standard treatment for more common conditions or when sensory loss is observed within lesions or in extremities. Additional clues include presentation of cuts or burns in the absence of pain and travel history including residence in endemic countries (foreign birth, military experience, etc).</p><p>Frequently, the diagnosis is established largely on the basis of clinical manifestations, although laboratory tools can be useful for diagnostic confirmation. The diagnosis is definitively established when at least one of the physical findings below is present and a skin biopsy obtained from the leading edge of the skin lesion confirms the presence of acid-fast bacilli in a cutaneous nerve. In areas where leprosy is endemic and frequently recognized clinically, a diagnosis based on clinical manifestations alone may be sufficient.

The inflammation associated with reactions can lead to severe nerve injury with subsequent paralysis and deformity. The reaction may simulate drug allergy, worsening of disease, new-onset neuropathy, or, in severe cases, septic shock. It is important for the clinician and patient to understand that immunologic reactions are NOT drug reactions and that drug treatment should be continued, although modification in <a href=\"topic.htm?path=rifampin-rifampicin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">rifampin</a> usage may be needed when <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prednisone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">prednisone</a> is used for management of the reaction.

These can form pustules and may ulcerate, discharging yellow pus that contains polymorphs and degenerating acid-fast bacilli but is sterile on culture. Lesions are commonly found on the extensor surfaces of the limbs and on the face. They may last for a few days and may be succeeded by crops of new ones. As lesions fade, they may appear as brawny induration on the forearms and thighs.

The diagnosis is established when at least one of these physical findings is present and a skin biopsy obtained from the leading edge of the skin lesion confirms the presence of acid-fast bacilli in a cutaneous nerve.

There are two types of leprosy reactions: type 1 (typically occurs in patients with borderline disease) and type 2 (occurs in patients with lepromatous disease), but distinguishing between the types can be difficult.
