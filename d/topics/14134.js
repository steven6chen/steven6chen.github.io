This information is invaluable because most diagnostic and management decisions during pregnancy are strongly influenced by consideration of fetal development, which closely correlates with fetal age.</p><p>Fetal biometric measurements used to calculate gestational age and estimated date of delivery (&quot;due date&quot; or EDD) will be reviewed here. The value of routine prenatal sonography is reviewed separately.

The terms postconception and embryonic age are not used clinically when discussing pregnancy, but are used by embryologists and dysmorphologists to describe early developmental events.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Estimated date of delivery (EDD)</strong> &ndash; The EDD is 280 days from the onset of the last menstrual period (LMP) and 266 days from date of conception. Only 4 percent of women deliver on their EDD, in part because of the limitations of methods used to estimate gestational age, but also because of natural biologic variation in the pace of fetal maturation and the timing of natural delivery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prenatal-assessment-of-gestational-age-date-of-delivery-and-fetal-weight/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1583796378\"><span class=\"h1\">BEST ESTIMATE OF DELIVERY DATE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>For most pregnancies, the best estimate of the delivery date is based on sonography if sonography was performed before 22+0<sup> </sup>weeks of gestation and this EDD differs from that calculated (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=calculator-estimated-date-of-delivery-edd\" class=\"calc calc_professional\">calculator 1</a>) from menstrual dating by more than expected, as described in the table (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F97246\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef97246 \">table 1</a>). If no ultrasound examination is performed by 22+0<sup> </sup>weeks, the pregnancy is suboptimally dated. (See <a href=\"#H2340876163\" class=\"local\">'Suboptimally dated pregnancies'</a> below.)</p><p>Crown-rump length (CRL) measured in the first trimester, if available, is the most accurate sonographic method of determining the EDD. First trimester CRL is more accurate than any second trimester (14+0 to 27+6<sup> </sup>weeks) biometric parameter used for gestational age assessment because there is less biological variation in fetal measurements in the first trimester than later in gestation. It is also more accurate than mean sac diameter.</p><p>The EDD derived from the earliest sonographic assessment of gestational age (first trimester CRL or fetal biometry before 22 weeks) becomes the patient's EDD, and this EDD is not changed by subsequent ultrasound examinations. (See <a href=\"#H8\" class=\"local\">'First-trimester gestational age assessment'</a> below and <a href=\"#H3739340614\" class=\"local\">'Crown-rump length'</a> below.)</p><p>For pregnancies conceived in vitro, the EDD may be based on factors other than sonography and LMP.

The EDD is calculated by counting back three months from the LMP and adding seven days. As an example, if the LMP is February 20, then the EDD will be November 27.

The size-gestational age correlation is learned by experience and is often described in terms of fruit (eg, for singleton pregnancies: 6- to 8-week size = plum, 8- to 10-week size = orange, 10- to 12-week size = grapefruit), despite the imprecision of this terminology.</p><p>The uterus remains a pelvic organ until approximately 12 weeks of gestation, when it becomes sufficiently large to palpate abdominally just above the symphysis pubis. At approximately 16 weeks, the uterine fundus is palpable midway between the symphysis pubis and umbilicus, and at approximately 20 weeks it is palpable at the umbilicus. After 20 weeks, the symphysis-to-fundal height in centimeters should correlate with the week of gestation.</p><p>In the absence of other dating information, uterine enlargement two fingerbreadths above the umbilicus suggests the fetus is at a gestational age at the limit of viability, if neonatal intensive care is available. This crude estimate of gestational age can be clinically useful for decision-making in an emergency, such as maternal cardiac arrest.</p><p>Leiomyoma, obesity, multiple gestation, and other factors affecting uterine size or the ability to palpate the uterus (eg, retroverted position) reduce the diagnostic performance of physical examination-based gestational age assessment.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h1\">SONOGRAPHIC ASSESSMENT OF GESTATIONAL AGE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Ultrasound estimates of gestational age are based on the assumption that gestational sac size, embryo size (eg, crown-rump length [CRL]), and the size of fetal parts (eg, cranium, long bones, abdomen) correlate with age. When there is a reason that a biometric parameter might incorrectly correlate with age, then that value is excluded from gestational age estimates. For example, femur length would be excluded from gestational age estimates in a fetus with skeletal dysplasia, while biparietal diameter would be excluded in a fetus with massive hydrocephalus.

Therefore, TVS is recommended for evaluation of the gestational sac and other early embryonic structures (eg, yolk sac, earliest identification of cardiac activity). Measurement of CRL in the first trimester is easier with TVS than with TAS, but not more accurate for determining gestational age [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prenatal-assessment-of-gestational-age-date-of-delivery-and-fetal-weight/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].</p><p>TAS is used for second- and third-trimester biometry since the uterus enlarges into the mid and upper abdomen and the fetus is larger.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4012305213\"><span class=\"h2\">Limitations of sonographic assessment of gestational age</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Factors that can reduce the diagnostic performance of sonographic gestational age assessment include poor quality images, multiple gestation, fetal position, fetal anomalies, and biologic variation.</p><p>Sonographic dating results in a small downward estimation of gestational age more often than an upward estimation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prenatal-assessment-of-gestational-age-date-of-delivery-and-fetal-weight/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>] since delayed ovulation (after day 14) appears to occur more often than early ovulation. As a result, ultrasound examination tends to move the EDD to a later date than that calculated from menstrual dating. Thus, populations assigned an EDD by routine sonographic examination have a lower rate of induction for postterm birth than those assigned an EDD by menstrual dating (18 versus 31 per 1000); however, they also have a trend toward more low birthweight (&lt;2500 g) deliveries (3.3 versus 2.8 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prenatal-assessment-of-gestational-age-date-of-delivery-and-fetal-weight/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">First-trimester gestational age assessment</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>First-trimester (up to 13+6<sup> </sup>weeks) sonographic assessment of CRL is the most accurate method of estimating gestational age [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prenatal-assessment-of-gestational-age-date-of-delivery-and-fetal-weight/abstract/10-18\" class=\"abstract_t\">10-18</a>]. Although the gestational sac size is the earliest parameter that can be measured for assessment of gestational age (see <a href=\"#H2581016212\" class=\"local\">'Gestational sac'</a> below), the CRL is a more accurate indicator of gestational age. Therefore, when the embryonic pole is evident in the gestational sac, CRL is measured to determine the EDD, the EDD derived from the earliest measurement of CRL becomes the patient's EDD, and this EDD is not changed based on subsequent biometry.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3739340614\"><span class=\"h3\">Crown-rump length</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Key points of gestational age assessment by measurement of the CRL include the following:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>When the embryo is evident, CRL &le;8+6<sup> </sup>weeks of gestation is the most accurate biometric parameter for pregnancy dating (&plusmn;5 days).

A length of at least 5 mm routinely allows visualization of the embryo (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F71198\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef71198 \">image 2</a>), but some embryos as small as 2 to 3 mm can be seen [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prenatal-assessment-of-gestational-age-date-of-delivery-and-fetal-weight/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>].</p><p>Standard practice is to take the mean of three CRL measurements [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prenatal-assessment-of-gestational-age-date-of-delivery-and-fetal-weight/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>].

It appears as a small, fluid-filled, sac-like structure eccentrically located within the endometrium. This structure and its echogenic rim represent the chorionic cavity, implanting chorionic villi, and associated decidual tissue [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prenatal-assessment-of-gestational-age-date-of-delivery-and-fetal-weight/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>].</p><p>The sonologist should be cautious when making the presumptive diagnosis of a gestational sac in the absence of a definite embryo or yolk sac. Without these findings, an intrauterine fluid collection could represent a pseudogestational sac related to an ectopic pregnancy. In the absence of an embryo or yolk sac, findings that increase the likelihood of an intrauterine gestational sac are an echogenic rim, eccentric position in the endometrium, and a &quot;double decidual sac sign.&quot;&nbsp;The double sac sign refers to an intrauterine fluid collection surrounded by two concentric echogenic rings (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RADIOL%2F95553\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef95553 \">image 3</a>), and the &quot;intradecidual sign&quot; refers to a fluid collection with an echogenic rim located within a markedly thickened decidua on one side of the uterine cavity, with deviation of the central endometrial echo; both are related to intrauterine pregnancy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prenatal-assessment-of-gestational-age-date-of-delivery-and-fetal-weight/abstract/38,39\" class=\"abstract_t\">38,39</a>]. These two signs are primarily used to help determine whether intrauterine fluid in a woman with a positive pregnancy test represents an intrauterine gestational sac (ie, positive double sac or intradecidual sign) or bleeding related to extrauterine pregnancy (intrauterine fluid centrally located within the endometrial cavity without a double sac or intradecidual sign). They are not used for calculating EDD, and their absence does not exclude intrauterine pregnancy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prenatal-assessment-of-gestational-age-date-of-delivery-and-fetal-weight/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>].</p><p>As the gestation progresses, the sac (chorionic cavity) enlarges.

The decidua capsularis becomes stretched and ultimately merges with the decidua parietalis.</p><p>The shape of the sac may change from a circular to an irregular appearance on serial examinations.

One standardized formula that is frequently used is the mean sac diameter (MSD), which is derived by calculating the mean of the three perpendicular sac diameter measurements [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prenatal-assessment-of-gestational-age-date-of-delivery-and-fetal-weight/abstract/42-45\" class=\"abstract_t\">42-45</a>]. The gestational age can then be determined by consulting the table showing gestational age according to MSD (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F94449\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef94449 \">table 2</a>). The table should not be used when CRL is measurable.</p><p>A simplified method of estimating gestational age is to calculate the sum of 30 plus the sac diameter in millimeters. This number is equivalent to the gestational age in days. As an example, if the sac diameter is 5 mm, the calculated age would be estimated at 35 days (30+5) or five weeks [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prenatal-assessment-of-gestational-age-date-of-delivery-and-fetal-weight/abstract/26,42,46,47\" class=\"abstract_t\">26,42,46,47</a>].</p><p>A gestational sac size of 2 to 3 mm is the smallest diameter that can be clearly visualized within the uterine cavity and correlates with a gestational age of approximately four weeks and one to three days [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prenatal-assessment-of-gestational-age-date-of-delivery-and-fetal-weight/abstract/46,48,49\" class=\"abstract_t\">46,48,49</a>]. The early gestational sac grows by approximately 1 mm per day, or 7 mm per week.

The ideal biometric assessment incorporates the least number of images with the highest potential for accuracy. When multiple biometric parameters were compared, the best test performance with the least variability was obtained with the four standard biometric measures (BPD, HC, FL, and AC) described below [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prenatal-assessment-of-gestational-age-date-of-delivery-and-fetal-weight/abstract/67,69\" class=\"abstract_t\">67,69</a>].

If the four routine parameters do not correlate, choosing which measurements are most accurate for dating purposes can be a difficult task. Therefore, incorporating extra parameters to assist in making an educated estimate may be useful in this setting.

If the first ultrasound examination is performed at &ge;22+0 weeks of gestation and discordant with menstrual dates, it is inappropriate to rely solely on a single set of the usual biometric parameters for assessment of gestational age. A single late examination cannot reliably distinguish between a pregnancy that is misdated and younger than expected and a pregnancy that is complicated by fetal symmetric growth restriction.</p><p>In these cases, serial measurements three to four weeks apart can be helpful. Normal interval growth supports the sonographic estimate of gestational age, while suboptimal interval growth suggests a growth-restricted fetus who may be further along in gestation than predicted by biometry. Accelerated fetal growth suggests a large for gestational age fetus who may be less far along than predicted by biometry. Thus, serial examinations in this setting allow the clinician to make a more reliable clinical assessment of the EDD. </p><p>In some cases, very early fetal growth restriction rather than inaccurate menstrual dating may be the reason for a discrepancy between an early ultrasound and menstrual dating (or dating based on conception using assisted reproductive technologies) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prenatal-assessment-of-gestational-age-date-of-delivery-and-fetal-weight/abstract/70\" class=\"abstract_t\">70</a>], although this is uncommon [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prenatal-assessment-of-gestational-age-date-of-delivery-and-fetal-weight/abstract/122-124\" class=\"abstract_t\">122-124</a>].

These formulas are included in most ultrasound equipment packages.

There is no strong evidence that formulas that use additional biometric parameters (eg, thigh circumference) are more accurate than those using three parameters, while formulas that use only one or two biometric parameters are less accurate. Use of three-dimensional ultrasound may improve estimation of fetal weight, but data are limited and inconsistent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prenatal-assessment-of-gestational-age-date-of-delivery-and-fetal-weight/abstract/131,132\" class=\"abstract_t\">131,132</a>].</p><p>In a systematic review of studies that compared birthweight with ultrasound EFW by 11 formulas, no formula was consistently superior and the random error in fetal weight estimation exceeded 14 percent of birthweight in 5 percent of fetuses [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prenatal-assessment-of-gestational-age-date-of-delivery-and-fetal-weight/abstract/133\" class=\"abstract_t\">133</a>].
