A theoretical goal is to prevent the putative long-term consequences of airway inflammation, particularly airway remodeling and chronic persistent airway obstruction.

NAEPP and GINA definitions of severity apply best to patients in the untreated state.

Adherence to guideline-based therapy has been shown in a randomized controlled trial to result in well-controlled or completely-controlled asthma in the majority of patients, regardless of initial asthma severity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-moderate-persistent-asthma-in-adolescents-and-adults/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. This approach is presented here, with some additional suggestions based on the authors' experience.</p><p>An estimate of severity is used to determine the initial treatment in patients who are not receiving treatment at the time of evaluation (see <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'Initiating controller therapy'</a> below). The 2007 NAEPP guidelines prefer one of two long-term controller regimens for patients with moderate persistent asthma initially (Step 3 therapy): either medium-dose inhaled glucocorticoids alone, or the combination of low-dose inhaled glucocorticoids, plus a long-acting beta agonist (LABA) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F56729\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef56729 \">figure 1</a>). Several alternative agents are suggested.</p><p>Once the patient is receiving treatment, the focus shifts to assessing the patient's asthma control and adjusting medications based upon the patients current level of symptoms. (See <a href=\"#H16\" class=\"local\">'Assessing control'</a> below.)</p><p>The NAEPP guidelines consider patients whose asthma is controlled with either Step 3 or Step 4 therapy over time, to have moderate persistent asthma, although Step 3 is the recommended initial treatment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-moderate-persistent-asthma-in-adolescents-and-adults/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Patient education</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>All patients should be provided with a personalized &quot;asthma action plan,&quot; which describes how and when their medications should be used, as well as how to recognize an exacerbation and make appropriate adjustments in medications (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F55900\" class=\"graphic graphic_form graphicRef55900 \">form 1</a>).

Allergy is believed to play a greater pathogenic role in pediatric asthma, compared to asthma in adults. The use of immunotherapy in asthma treatment is reviewed in detail separately.

Evidence for an association between overuse of short-acting beta agonists and increased asthma mortality, beta agonist tolerance, or worsened airways hyperreactivity has been conflicting and difficult to interpret. However, scheduled use of these agents has not been shown to confer additional benefit beyond as needed dosing, and we therefore suggest that these agents be used on an as-needed basis only [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-moderate-persistent-asthma-in-adolescents-and-adults/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].

Several randomized, prospective studies demonstrate that inhaled GCs improve lung function, diminish symptoms, decrease need for SABAs, and improve airway responsiveness to <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methacholine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">methacholine</a> in patients with all levels of asthma severity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-moderate-persistent-asthma-in-adolescents-and-adults/abstract/5-9\" class=\"abstract_t\">5-9</a>]. Observational data also suggest that inhaled GCs diminish hospitalizations and mortality from asthma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-moderate-persistent-asthma-in-adolescents-and-adults/abstract/10-12\" class=\"abstract_t\">10-12</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Preferred options</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>When starting therapy for patients with moderate persistent asthma, either of two approaches (ie, low-dose ICS plus a long-acting beta agonist [LABA] or medium-dose inhaled GC) is recommended by national and international guidelines, corresponding to Step 3 therapy (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F56729\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef56729 \">figure 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-moderate-persistent-asthma-in-adolescents-and-adults/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>], with some preference given to the combination ICS-LABA, although therapy can be individualized. </p><p>The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has removed the previous &ldquo;boxed warning&rdquo; on inhaled GC-LABA combinations after reviewing four safety trials and concluding that LABA-inhaled glucocorticoid combination inhalers do NOT significantly increase the risk of serious asthma-related side effects compared with inhaled glucocorticoids alone [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-moderate-persistent-asthma-in-adolescents-and-adults/abstract/13-15\" class=\"abstract_t\">13-15</a>].

The use of these combination inhalers eliminates the possibility of using the LABA as monotherapy and therefore improves patient safety, although precise titration of the glucocorticoid dose is somewhat limited with these devices.

Although both treatments resulted in improvement over baseline, the addition of salmeterol yielded a greater decrease in symptoms and beta-agonist use, improvement in morning peak flow, and reduction in peak flow variability.

Although the beneficial effects of inhaled glucocorticoids (GCs) can be observed after a single dose, optimal therapeutic effects are achieved with chronic administration. Most of the improvement in lung function observed during inhaled GC therapy occurs within the first several weeks of treatment, although airway responsiveness may continue to improve (although not necessarily normalize) for over one year [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-moderate-persistent-asthma-in-adolescents-and-adults/abstract/6,8,9,39\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,8,9,39</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H16\"><span class=\"h2\">Assessing control</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Assessment of &quot;control,&quot; rather than severity, is used to adjust therapy in returning patients, or to alter therapy in patients evaluated for the first time while already taking a long-term controller medication.
