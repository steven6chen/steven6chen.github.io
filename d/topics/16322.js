Cerebral amyloid angiopathy is the most common cause of nontraumatic lobar ICH in the elderly, while vascular malformations are the most common cause of ICH in children [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/spontaneous-intracerebral-hemorrhage-pathogenesis-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. These disorders are discussed elsewhere in appropriate topic reviews.

These small penetrating arteries may be particularly susceptible to the effects of hypertension, as they are directly exposed to the pressure of the much larger parent vessel, without the protection of a preceding gradual decrease in vessel caliber [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/spontaneous-intracerebral-hemorrhage-pathogenesis-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>].</p><p>The blood vessels that give rise to hypertensive hemorrhage generally are the same as those affected by hypertensive occlusive disease and diabetic vasculopathy, which cause lacunar strokes. These vessels supply the pons and midbrain (penetrators off the basilar artery), thalamus (thalamostriate penetrators off the P1 and P2 segments of the posterior cerebral arteries), and putamen and caudate (lenticulostriate penetrators off the M1 segment of the middle cerebral artery). One exception is hypertensive cerebellar hemorrhage; lacunar infarctions are uncommon in the deep cerebellar nuclei, while hypertensive cerebellar hemorrhages occur more frequently. Hypertensive vasculopathy is also believed to play a role in the development of white matter disease, which may explain the finding of an association between white matter disease and risk of ICH [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/spontaneous-intracerebral-hemorrhage-pathogenesis-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>].</p><p>Pathologic examination of the blood vessels in patients with chronic hypertension and in those with intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) has led to a theory of how hypertensive hemorrhage occurs. The penetrator vessels in patients with chronic hypertension develop intimal hyperplasia with hyalinosis in the vessel wall; this predisposes to focal necrosis, causing breaks in the wall of the vessel. These &quot;pseudoaneurysms&quot; have been associated with small amounts of blood outside their walls. Pseudoaneurysm formation with subclinical leaks of blood may be relatively common; massive hemorrhage can occur when the clotting system is unable to compensate for the disruption in the vessel wall.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Cerebral microbleeds</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Neuroimaging data suggest that pseudoaneurysm formation with subclinical leaks of blood is relatively common in patients with spontaneous ICH. Gradient echo, susceptibility weighted and T2*-weighted MRI can detect small regions of focal or multifocal hemosiderin deposition in these patients that represent remnants of clinically silent cerebral microbleeds [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/spontaneous-intracerebral-hemorrhage-pathogenesis-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/14,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">14,15</a>]. These microbleeds or microhemorrhages may be a marker of bleeding-prone microangiopathy due to hyalinosis (chronic hypertension) or amyloid deposition [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/spontaneous-intracerebral-hemorrhage-pathogenesis-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. These have also been described in patients with infective endocarditis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/spontaneous-intracerebral-hemorrhage-pathogenesis-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>], and appear to be more common in patients who are on antithrombotic therapy (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=warfarin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">warfarin</a> or antiplatelet agents) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/spontaneous-intracerebral-hemorrhage-pathogenesis-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. </p><p>In population-based studies, cerebral microhemorrhages are detected in 5 to 23 percent of older individuals [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/spontaneous-intracerebral-hemorrhage-pathogenesis-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/19-23\" class=\"abstract_t\">19-23</a>]. Baseline characteristics of the population studied and the sensitivity of the MRI techniques used probably account for some of the variability in the observed prevalences. In a systematic review, the prevalence of microbleeds visible on MRI was 5 percent in healthy adults, 34 percent in patients with ischemic stroke, and 60 percent in patients with nontraumatic ICH [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/spontaneous-intracerebral-hemorrhage-pathogenesis-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. Population-based studies have shown that microbleeds are more prevalent in those with advanced age and male sex [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/spontaneous-intracerebral-hemorrhage-pathogenesis-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/20,21\" class=\"abstract_t\">20,21</a>]. Pathologic examination may show a somewhat higher prevalence of microbleeds; in one cohort of elderly patients (ages 71 to 105 years), these were found in 22 of 33 individuals and appeared to arise at the capillary level in many cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/spontaneous-intracerebral-hemorrhage-pathogenesis-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>].</p><p>Increasing evidence suggests that the anatomic distribution of microbleeds varies with their etiology, with hypertensive microbleeds arising in the deep subcortical and infratentorial regions and amyloid microbleeds in more superficial lobar regions of the cerebral hemispheres. This regional distribution is consistent with the usual location of ICH in these conditions. In one study, deep microbleeds were associated with cardiovascular mortality, while lobar microbleeds were not [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/spontaneous-intracerebral-hemorrhage-pathogenesis-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. In another study, blood pressure variability was associated with progression of microbleeds in the deep subcortical and infratentorial regions but not of those in the cortex [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/spontaneous-intracerebral-hemorrhage-pathogenesis-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. Other studies have found that microbleeds with a lobar distribution are associated with the APOE genotype, cognitive impairment and regional amyloid deposition on PET studies, features that are associated with cerebral amyloid angiopathy. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cerebral-amyloid-angiopathy#H9\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Cerebral amyloid angiopathy&quot;, section on 'Microhemorrhages'</a>.) </p><p>In different populations, microbleeds have been associated with hypertension (odds ratio [OR] 3.9), diabetes mellitus (OR 2.2), and cigarette smoking [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/spontaneous-intracerebral-hemorrhage-pathogenesis-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/19,24,28-30\" class=\"abstract_t\">19,24,28-30</a>]. In the Framingham study, blood pressure was associated with the presence of microbleeds in the crude analysis, but the relationship was not significant after adjustment for age and sex [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/spontaneous-intracerebral-hemorrhage-pathogenesis-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. One explanation for this result is that a higher percentage (73 percent) of cerebral microbleeds were found in <span class=\"nowrap\">cortical/subcortical</span> regions in the Framingham study population than in other studies (55 to 57 percent) of healthy volunteers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/spontaneous-intracerebral-hemorrhage-pathogenesis-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/31,32\" class=\"abstract_t\">31,32</a>], and lesions in the <span class=\"nowrap\">cortical/subcortical</span> region are more likely to be related to cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA) than to hypertensive microangiopathy. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cerebral-amyloid-angiopathy#H9\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Cerebral amyloid angiopathy&quot;, section on 'Microhemorrhages'</a>.)</p><p>Associations between the incidence of microbleeds and lacunar stroke and white matter hyperintensities have also been reported [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/spontaneous-intracerebral-hemorrhage-pathogenesis-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/19,29\" class=\"abstract_t\">19,29</a>]. In one study, a lobar distribution of microbleeds consistent with CAA was predictive of subsequent stroke-related death, while nonlobar microbleeds were associated with cardiovascular mortality [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/spontaneous-intracerebral-hemorrhage-pathogenesis-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. Other studies have found that the presence of microbleeds predicts subsequent ischemic stroke as well as intracerebral hemorrhage [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/spontaneous-intracerebral-hemorrhage-pathogenesis-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/33,34\" class=\"abstract_t\">33,34</a>]. Hemorrhages that occur in deep brain locations are associated with microbleeds in that region as well.</p><p>Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease appeared to be a risk factor for both prevalent and incidental microbleeds (OR 3.3 and 7.1 respectively) in the Rotterdam study, an association that was independent of smoking status, age, and other comorbidities that might expect to be potential confounding factors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/spontaneous-intracerebral-hemorrhage-pathogenesis-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Mechanisms of brain injury</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There are several mechanisms of brain injury in ICH, including primary direct mechanical injury to brain parenchyma by the expanding clot and cytotoxic perilesional edema. Both clot volume and perilesional edema contribute to the mass effect and increased intracranial pressure (ICP), which in turn can cause reduced cerebral perfusion and ischemic injury, and in very large ICH, cerebral herniation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/spontaneous-intracerebral-hemorrhage-pathogenesis-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>].</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Secondary brain injury after the initial hemorrhage is an important contributing process; however, the exact mechanism(s) underlying this remain uncertain. Neuroimaging and pathologic studies have yielded some insights. One study using 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (FDG-PET) demonstrated a perihematomal region of increased glucose metabolism two to four days after ICH [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/spontaneous-intracerebral-hemorrhage-pathogenesis-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>]. Postcontrast enhancement may be noted in the perihematomal area on CT and MRI, representing blood-brain barrier disruption [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/spontaneous-intracerebral-hemorrhage-pathogenesis-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/38,39\" class=\"abstract_t\">38,39</a>]. One MRI study described a pattern of punctate areas of contrast enhancement in the sulcal areas both contiguous and remote from the hemorrhage in patients with acute primary ICH suggesting that ICH may be associated with more diffuse breakdown of the blood-cerebrospinal fluid barrier as well [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/spontaneous-intracerebral-hemorrhage-pathogenesis-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>].<br/><br/>Perihematomal edema is present on CT or MRI in at least half of patients when the patient is first imaged and progresses, reaching maximum volume 7 to 12 days after onset; the most rapid expansion occurs in the first 48 hours [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/spontaneous-intracerebral-hemorrhage-pathogenesis-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/41-43\" class=\"abstract_t\">41-43</a>]. Hemorrhage volume and a higher admission hematocrit and PTT appear to correlate with peak edema volume. The perihematomal region exhibits delayed perfusion and increased diffusivity, mixed with areas of reduced diffusion suggesting the presence of both vasogenic and cytotoxic edema [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/spontaneous-intracerebral-hemorrhage-pathogenesis-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/44\" class=\"abstract_t\">44</a>]. The latter may be related to ICH mass effect, local neuronal ischemia or the accumulation of cytotoxic factors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/spontaneous-intracerebral-hemorrhage-pathogenesis-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/45\" class=\"abstract_t\">45</a>]:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Decreased blood flow to the area surrounding the clot causes local neuronal ischemia, which leads to further cytotoxic edema and the toxic release of excitatory amino acids and inflammatory mediators [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/spontaneous-intracerebral-hemorrhage-pathogenesis-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/46\" class=\"abstract_t\">46</a>]. This sequence of events is supported by studies in a rat model, which showed that the ischemic zone surrounding an ICH can be decreased by various neuroprotective treatments, including N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonism (which blunts excitatory amino acid-mediated neuronal cell death) and immunosuppression (which diminishes microglia-mediated neuronal injury) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/spontaneous-intracerebral-hemorrhage-pathogenesis-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/47\" class=\"abstract_t\">47</a>]. These studies have also found that edema and ischemia persist after removal of the hematoma, emphasizing the major contribution of secondary ischemic injury in ICH and explaining in part why surgical evacuation of the hematoma often produces disappointing results. Disruption in cerebral autoregulation may contribute to perihematomal ischemic injury [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/spontaneous-intracerebral-hemorrhage-pathogenesis-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/48\" class=\"abstract_t\">48</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=spontaneous-intracerebral-hemorrhage-treatment-and-prognosis#H21\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Spontaneous intracerebral hemorrhage: Treatment and prognosis&quot;, section on 'Surgery'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Thrombin-induced activation of the inflammatory cascade and overexpression of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) is an additional mechanism that contributes to breakdown of the blood brain barrier and edema formation in ICH [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/spontaneous-intracerebral-hemorrhage-pathogenesis-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/49-51\" class=\"abstract_t\">49-51</a>]. MMPs appear to promote extracellular matrix proteolysis, attack the basal lamina, and degrade cellular fibronectin (c-Fn), a glycoprotein that is important for hemostasis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/spontaneous-intracerebral-hemorrhage-pathogenesis-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/52\" class=\"abstract_t\">52</a>]. Elevated serum levels of MMP-9 have been associated with an increased volume of peripheral edema surrounding ICH [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/spontaneous-intracerebral-hemorrhage-pathogenesis-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/53,54\" class=\"abstract_t\">53,54</a>].</p><p/><p>A number of studies have found that a significant number of patients with ICH have acute ischemic lesions on diffusion-weighted MRI imaging that are not contiguous to the hematoma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/spontaneous-intracerebral-hemorrhage-pathogenesis-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/55-58\" class=\"abstract_t\">55-58</a>]. The mechanism underlying this phenomenon and the implication of these findings for clinical brain injury and prognosis are as yet undefined [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/spontaneous-intracerebral-hemorrhage-pathogenesis-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/59\" class=\"abstract_t\">59</a>]. Increased intracranial pressure and resulting reduction in cerebral perfusion pressure may play a role; this phenomenon may be exacerbated by blood pressure lowering. An underlying angiopathy from hypertension or other cause may also contribute to ischemic injury; in one study these lesions were more common in patients with baseline microbleeds and white matter leukoaraiosis and also predicted future cerebrovascular events and vascular death [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/spontaneous-intracerebral-hemorrhage-pathogenesis-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/57\" class=\"abstract_t\">57</a>]. Another study with follow-up imaging found that these lesions continue to appear beyond the acute ICH period [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/spontaneous-intracerebral-hemorrhage-pathogenesis-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/58\" class=\"abstract_t\">58</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Hemorrhage enlargement</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Serial CT scans in patients with hypertensive hemorrhage have shown that the hemorrhage enlarges in the first six hours after presentation in a subset of patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/spontaneous-intracerebral-hemorrhage-pathogenesis-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/45,60,61\" class=\"abstract_t\">45,60,61</a>]. In a prospective series of 103 patients with ICH, significant hematoma growth (a &gt;33 percent volume increase) occurred in 38 percent of patients over the first 24 hours [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/spontaneous-intracerebral-hemorrhage-pathogenesis-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/61\" class=\"abstract_t\">61</a>]. </p><p>Pathologic studies prior to CT scanning found that bleeding points occurred in the rim of the hemorrhage and postulated that this new recruitment of bleeding sites would lead to enlargement of the clot. As the clot expands, surrounding vessels are stretched, causing new sites of vessel rupture. Although the precise mechanism of hemorrhage enlargement is not yet defined and may be heterogeneous, blood brain barrier breakdown and dysregulation of hemostasis via inflammatory cascade activation and MMP overexpression, as discussed above, is probably one important pathway [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/spontaneous-intracerebral-hemorrhage-pathogenesis-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/45\" class=\"abstract_t\">45</a>]. Elevated plasma concentrations of c-Fn and the inflammatory mediator interleukin-6 (IL-6) in the early acute phase of ICH have been associated with ICH enlargement [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/spontaneous-intracerebral-hemorrhage-pathogenesis-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/62\" class=\"abstract_t\">62</a>]. However, the clinical utility of MMP, c-Fn, or IL-6 blood levels in early ICH is not yet clear.</p><p>Risk factors for hematoma expansion include antithrombotic therapy, sustained elevated blood pressure, large hematoma size, and evidence of contrast extravasation on initial CT imaging [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/spontaneous-intracerebral-hemorrhage-pathogenesis-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/45,63\" class=\"abstract_t\">45,63</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The relationship of systemic blood pressure to hematoma enlargement is not clear [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/spontaneous-intracerebral-hemorrhage-pathogenesis-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/60,64,65\" class=\"abstract_t\">60,64,65</a>].

Hematoma enlargement occurred in 16 patients (21 percent) and was significantly and independently associated with the maximum SBP recorded between the first and second head CT scan. In addition, hematoma enlargement was significantly associated with treatment target SBPs of 160 mmHg or greater compared with target SBPs of 150 or 140 mmHg.

However, most cases take place during routine activity. The neurologic symptoms usually increase gradually over minutes or a few hours (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F61491\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef61491 \">figure 1</a>). In contrast to brain embolism and subarachnoid hemorrhage, the neurologic symptoms do not begin abruptly and are not maximal at onset.</p><p>Headache, vomiting, and a decreased level of consciousness develop if the hematoma becomes sufficiently large. Headache and vomiting occur in approximately one-half of patients with intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F60831\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef60831 \">figure 2</a>). Headache may be due to traction on meningeal pain fibers, increased intracranial pressure (ICP), or blood in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF); it is most common with cerebellar and lobar hemorrhages. These symptoms are absent with small hemorrhages; the clinical presentation in this setting is that of a gradually progressing stroke. Patients may complain of a stiff neck and have meningismus on physical examination, if there is intraventricular blood.</p><p>Seizures in the first days after ICH occur in 4 to 29 percent of patients; they are more common in lobar hemorrhages (affecting cortical tissue) than in deep or cerebellar ICHs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/spontaneous-intracerebral-hemorrhage-pathogenesis-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/89,152-155\" class=\"abstract_t\">89,152-155</a>].

In addition, the presence of seizures was independently associated with midline brain shift and neurologic deterioration.</p><p>Stupor or coma in ICH is an ominous sign. The only exception is patients with thalamic hemorrhage, in whom involvement of the reticular activating system is the cause of stupor rather than diffuse brain injury; these patients may recover after blood is reabsorbed.</p><p>Some patients have abnormalities on the electrocardiogram (ECG), including a prolonged QT interval, depressed ST segment, flat or inverted T waves, U waves, and tall peaked T waves. These changes are predominately reflective of ischemia in the subendocardium of the left ventricle, which is most likely due to a centrally mediated release of catecholamines induced by hypoperfusion of the posterior hypothalamus. Mild elevations in serum myocardial enzymes often accompany the ECG changes, and ventricular arrhythmias may occur with brainstem compression [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/spontaneous-intracerebral-hemorrhage-pathogenesis-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/156\" class=\"abstract_t\">156</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h2\">Neurologic signs</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Neurologic signs vary depending upon the location of the hemorrhage.

These bleeds cause an inability to walk due to imbalance, vomiting, headache (which may be referred to the neck or shoulder, usually occipital), neck stiffness, gaze palsy, and facial weakness. There is notably no hemiparesis. The patient may become stuporous due to brainstem compression if the hemorrhage is unrecognized or untreated.

Symptoms include hemiparesis, hemisensory loss, and occasionally transient homonymous hemianopsia. There may also be an upgaze palsy with miotic pupils that are unreactive, peering at the tip of the nose, skewed, or &quot;wrong way eyes&quot; toward the weak side (in contrast to hemispheric cortical injury in which the eyes are deviated away from the hemiparesis).

They most often affect the parietal and occipital lobes. These bleeds are associated with a higher incidence of seizures. Occipital hemorrhages frequently present with a very dense contralateral homonymous hemianopsia.

These often lead to deep coma over the first few minutes following the hemorrhage, probably due to disruption of the reticular activating system. The motor examination is marked by total paralysis.

Hyperacute blood will appear hyperdense unless the patient is severely anemic, in which case it might appear isodense. Over weeks, the blood will become isodense and may have a ring enhancement appearance. Chronically, the blood is hypodense.</p><p>Primary ICH needs to be distinguished from hemorrhagic transformation of a cerebral infarction. While there are no defined radiologic criteria for this distinction, a patchy appearance of the hyperdensity within a larger area of low attenuation is an important feature, as is a wedge-shaped abnormality that extends to the cortex. A delay from stroke onset to CT examination, however, can be problematic in CT interpretation and has been shown to reduce inter-observer reliability [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/spontaneous-intracerebral-hemorrhage-pathogenesis-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/159\" class=\"abstract_t\">159</a>]. When an ICH clot retracts and surrounding edema develops, the appearance of a primary ICH can resemble that of a hemorrhagic cerebral infarction.</p><p>An estimate of ICH volume is useful to communicate hemorrhage severity and make early assessments of prognosis.

An individual hemorrhage slice is counted as one full slice for determining C if the hemorrhage area is &gt;75 percent of the area on the slice with the largest hemorrhage.

These sequences are highly sensitive to the nonuniform static magnetic fields produced by paramagnetic molecules such as deoxyhemoglobin. This property of paramagnetic molecules is termed the magnetic susceptibility effect; it results in rapid dephasing of proton spins causing signal loss (darkening or hypointensity) that is best seen in T2*-weighted images.</p><p>Acute ICH can be diagnosed by MRI with up to 100 percent sensitivity and accuracy by experienced readers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/spontaneous-intracerebral-hemorrhage-pathogenesis-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/168\" class=\"abstract_t\">168</a>].

All patients had MRI with gradient echo (GRE) and diffusion-weighted (DWI) sequences within six hours of symptom onset followed by CT. The study was stopped early because MRI was detecting cases of hemorrhagic transformation that CT did not reveal. MRI and CT were equivalent for the detection of acute ICH, and MRI was significantly more accurate than CT for the detection of chronic ICH.</p><p>The appearance of blood on MRI images depends upon the paramagnetic properties of the various stages of hemoglobin and on the mode of imaging acquisition:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Hyperacute hematoma.
