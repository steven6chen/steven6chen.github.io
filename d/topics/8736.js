The ability of the organism to efficiently establish latent infection has enabled it to spread to nearly one-third of the world's population [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/immunology-of-tuberculosis/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. According to the 2017 World Health Organization report, in 2016, an estimated 6.3 million new cases of tuberculosis and 1.3 million deaths among HIV-uninfected people were reported worldwide [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/immunology-of-tuberculosis/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. The progression from latent tuberculosis infection to active disease remains poorly understood. Given the magnitude of the health problem and the emergence of drug-resistant strains of the organism, a better understanding of the immunology of this disease and the development of an effective vaccine are highly desirable. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epidemiology-of-tuberculosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Epidemiology of tuberculosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The immunology of <em>M. tuberculosis</em> will be reviewed here. The microbiology and pathogenesis of this infection, including virulence factors, tropism for the lungs, and latency factors, are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tuberculosis-natural-history-microbiology-and-pathogenesis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Tuberculosis: Natural history, microbiology, and pathogenesis&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">IMMUNOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The majority of individuals in the general population who become infected with <em>M. tuberculosis</em> never develop clinical disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/immunology-of-tuberculosis/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. This demonstrates that the innate and adaptive immune response of the host in controlling tuberculosis (TB) infection is effective. Mycobacterial and host factors that adversely affect these two arms of the immune system contribute to latent tuberculosis infection (LTBI) and active disease.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5272211\"><span class=\"h2\">Host factors</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11164598\"><span class=\"h3\">Innate immunity</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The pathophysiology of innate immune response during first encounter of <em>M. tuberculosis</em> with lung cells remains poorly characterized. In the average human alveolus, there are more than 28,000 epithelial cells (pneumocytes) and about 50 macrophages [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/immunology-of-tuberculosis/abstract/4,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,5</a>]. Mouse studies have shown that after about 14 days of infection, the predominant cell type infected with <em>M. tuberculosis</em> is the myeloid dendritic cell rather than the alveolar macrophage [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/immunology-of-tuberculosis/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. Thus, during the very early phase of lung infection, the interaction of <em>M. tuberculosis</em> with lung epithelial cells may affect later dendritic cell and alveolar macrophage migration and ultimately clinical outcome. Little is known about what happens during this early phase.</p><p>Once <em>M. tuberculosis</em> comes into contact with dendritic or alveolar macrophages, the interaction of these cells with <em>M. tuberculosis</em> first involves recognition by these cells of microbe-associated molecular patterns (MAMPs) by pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) located on the cell surface or in the cytosol [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/immunology-of-tuberculosis/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. Distinct sets of macrophage PRRs recognize distinct sets of MAMPs of <em>M. tuberculosis. </em>These PRRs serve to trigger innate immune response against molecules recognized to be foreign to the host cell. The recognition of <em>M. tuberculosis</em> by a group of PRRs called toll-like receptors (TLRs) triggers cell signal transduction that induces a proinflammatory response that is supposed to control the infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/immunology-of-tuberculosis/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. However, <em>M. tuberculosis</em> has evolved to subvert these host responses for its own survival in the host.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5803972\"><span class=\"h4\">Toll-like receptors</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>TLR is a mammalian homologue of the toll receptor in the insect <em>Drosophila</em> that plays a role in conferring immunity of the insect against yeast infections [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/immunology-of-tuberculosis/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. TLRs exhibit pattern recognition of organism group characteristic molecules, such as the lipopolysaccharide of gram-negative organisms, peptidoglycan of gram-positive organisms, double-stranded RNA of viruses, and lipoteichoic acids of yeasts [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/immunology-of-tuberculosis/abstract/10-12\" class=\"abstract_t\">10-12</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=toll-like-receptors-roles-in-disease-and-therapy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Toll-like receptors: Roles in disease and therapy&quot;</a>.)</p><p>TLR2 and TLR4 are important for the recognition of <em>M. tuberculosis</em> MAMPs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/immunology-of-tuberculosis/abstract/10,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,13</a>]. <em>M. tuberculosis</em> is killed by activation of the TLR2 by the bacterial lipoprotein (19-kD) in both mouse and human macrophages [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/immunology-of-tuberculosis/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. However, the killing in the mouse macrophage was dependent on the intracellular nitric oxide pathway, while in the human macrophage, it was independent of this pathway [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/immunology-of-tuberculosis/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. That is, the human TLR2 activation by the 19-kD lipoprotein killed <em>M. tuberculosis</em>, but no nitric oxide production could be demonstrated.</p><p>Further characterization of the mechanism of killing of <em>M. tuberculosis</em> in human macrophages has identified that <span class=\"nowrap\">TLR1/2</span> activation up-regulates expression of the vitamin D receptor as well as vitamin D-1-hydroxylase [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/immunology-of-tuberculosis/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. The expression of vitamin D receptor&ndash;related genes leads to an increased expression of cathelicidin, an antimicrobial peptide, which is then responsible for inhibition of growth of <em>M. tuberculosis</em>.</p><p>TLR2 and TLR4 require MyD88, an intracellular adapter protein required for inducing early innate immune response to pathogens [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/immunology-of-tuberculosis/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. However, in murine macrophages, <em>M. tuberculosis</em> can activate macrophages via an MyD88-independent pathway [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/immunology-of-tuberculosis/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. Furthermore, <em>M. tuberculosis</em> infection of MyD88-deficient <span class=\"nowrap\">C57BL/6</span> mouse is fatal despite an intact adaptive immune response [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/immunology-of-tuberculosis/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. When the mice were vaccinated with <em>M. bovis</em>&ndash;Bacillus Calmette-Gu&eacute;rin (BCG), they were protected from <em>M tuberculosis</em> infection, indicating that the adaptive immune response functioned normally in this MyD88-deficient mouse. The adaptive immune response was not sufficient to compensate for the innate immune defect in unvaccinated mice, suggesting that the innate immune response plays a substantive role in protection against tuberculosis, at least in the mouse model [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/immunology-of-tuberculosis/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>].</p><p>Genetic polymorphism found in <span class=\"nowrap\">TLR2/4</span> has been shown to affect infection outcomes in some populations. TLR4 polymorphism among Asian Indian population has been reported to be associated with increased severity of tuberculosis, while, in other populations, no such association has been found [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/immunology-of-tuberculosis/abstract/19,20\" class=\"abstract_t\">19,20</a>]. Such differential host response may also be affected by <em>M. tuberculosis</em> strain differences. Human studies have shown that some <em>M. tuberculosis</em> strains preferentially activate TLR2, whereas others activate TLR4 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/immunology-of-tuberculosis/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5803978\"><span class=\"h4\">Evasion mechanisms</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>After the tubercle bacterium gets taken up by macrophages, it uses several strategies to evade early intracellular killing mechanisms inside these target cells. Some of the mechanisms previously thought to contribute to these strategies include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Resistance to reactive oxygen intermediates (ROIs)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Inhibition of phagosome-lysosome fusion</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Inhibition of phagosome acidification</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Escape from the phagosomal compartment into the cytoplasmic space</p><p/><p>During the initial stages of infection, tubercle bacilli stimulate the migration of neutrophils and mononuclear phagocytes to the site of infection. <em>M. tuberculosis</em> possesses a variety of products that enable it to constitutively resist ROIs produced by these cells, which are usually toxic to other pathogens. Lipoarabinomannan (LAM) serves as a scavenger for oxygen intermediates [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/immunology-of-tuberculosis/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. Entry of the organism into macrophages via complement receptors (CR1 and CR3) does not stimulate ROI production [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/immunology-of-tuberculosis/abstract/23,24\" class=\"abstract_t\">23,24</a>]. Cyclopropanated mycolic acids of the cell wall may help the organism resist hydrogen peroxide [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/immunology-of-tuberculosis/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. Furthermore, mycolic acids can inhibit the expression of interleukin (IL)-12, monocyte chemotactic protein 1 (MCP-1), tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha in a toll-like receptor 2 (TLR-2)&ndash;dependent manner in macrophages [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/immunology-of-tuberculosis/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. Thus, drugs targeted against mycolic acid biosynthesis can exert an antibacterial effect early in the phase of <em>M. tuberculosis</em> infection or during transition from latent infection to active disease, when mycolic acid synthesis is most active.</p><p>In <em>Escherichia coli</em> and <em>Salmonella</em>, the <em>oxyR</em> gene serves as a regulatory element in response to oxidative stress. In contrast, the <em>oxyR</em> homologue in <em>M. tuberculosis</em> contains numerous deletions and is believed to be nonfunctional [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/immunology-of-tuberculosis/abstract/27,28\" class=\"abstract_t\">27,28</a>]. The constitutive anti-ROI products of <em>M. tuberculosis</em> described above may obviate the need for such a gene in this organism.</p><p><em>M. tuberculosis</em> taken up by macrophages can interfere with phagosome maturation. Phagosome maturation requires the conversion of Rab5 into GTP-bound Rab7 and the production of phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate (PI3P) in the phagosomal membrane [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/immunology-of-tuberculosis/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. Two secreted bacterial products PtpA (a tyrosine phosphatase) and NdkA (a GTPase) are believed to be involved in Rab7 inactivation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/immunology-of-tuberculosis/abstract/30,31\" class=\"abstract_t\">30,31</a>].</p><p>Fusion of lysosomes with phagosomes leads to the release of microbicidal lysosomal contents. However, <em>M. tuberculosis</em> can inhibit phagosome-lysosome fusion inside murine peritoneal macrophages more than one week after infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/immunology-of-tuberculosis/abstract/32,33\" class=\"abstract_t\">32,33</a>]. When the macrophages were observed only two hours after infection in another study, 85 percent of the phagosomes containing <em>M. tuberculosis</em> or BCG strains were fused, but the number of such phagosomes declined over time in cells infected with live H37Rv or Ra strains of <em>M. tuberculosis</em> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/immunology-of-tuberculosis/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>]. <em>M. tuberculosis</em> strains incubated with an antibody raised against BCG did not inhibit fusion, but they remained viable inside macrophages [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/immunology-of-tuberculosis/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>]. Thus, while there is evidence that <em>M. tuberculosis</em> can inhibit phagosome-lysosome fusion, the relevance of this mechanism in ensuring intracellular survival is not clear.</p><p>Both <em>M. avium</em> and <em>M. tuberculosis</em> can inhibit vacuolar acidification [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/immunology-of-tuberculosis/abstract/35,36\" class=\"abstract_t\">35,36</a>]. They do this by selectively excluding the proton-ATPase from the phagosome. While this inhibitory mechanism may be important during the initial encounter of the organism with macrophages, it is not clear how much of a role this plays in the ultimate intracellular fate of the pathogen. Macrophages activated by cytokines can acidify phagosomes, but the acidification itself may not contribute to significant killing of mycobacteria inside such cells [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/immunology-of-tuberculosis/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>].</p><p><em>M. tuberculosis</em> is also known to interfere with antigen presentation by major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II molecules, which is important for priming CD4 T cells [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/immunology-of-tuberculosis/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>]. Such interference could lead to resistance of <em>M. tuberculosis</em> to acquired immunity in the host and, hence, may contribute to bacterial persistence, a characteristic feature of this organism. <em>M. tuberculosis</em> products suggested to inhibit macrophage presentation of MHC class II molecules include lipoarabinomannan, 25 kDa glycoprotein, and a 19 kDa lipoprotein [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/immunology-of-tuberculosis/abstract/22,39,40\" class=\"abstract_t\">22,39,40</a>].</p><p>The traditional view is that when <em>M. tuberculosis</em> is engulfed by macrophages or dendritic cells, it resides inside the phagosomal compartment and that it does not escape into the cytosol. However, data suggest that the organism can enter the cytosol and that this is dependent on two major secreted <em>M. tuberculosis</em> proteins, early secretory antigenic target 6 (ESAT-6) and culture filtrate protein (CFP)-10, encoded by the Esx-1 locus [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/immunology-of-tuberculosis/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>]. ESAT-6 has been shown to have a membranolytic effect in vitro [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/immunology-of-tuberculosis/abstract/42,43\" class=\"abstract_t\">42,43</a>]. In the cytosol, mycobacterial cell wall component N-glycolyl muramyl dipeptide is believed to induce the production of type I interferons by binding to the intracellular pattern recognition receptor called nucleotide oligomerization domain 2 (NOD2) and that the induction of type I interferons is dependent on intact Esx-1 system [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/immunology-of-tuberculosis/abstract/44,45\" class=\"abstract_t\">44,45</a>]. ESAT-6 may promote access to the cytosol of other <em>M. tuberculosis</em> immunostimulatory products that activate the NLRP3 inflammasome complex that promotes caspase-I-dependent secretion of type I interferons [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/immunology-of-tuberculosis/abstract/46\" class=\"abstract_t\">46</a>]. The effect of type I interferon production on outcome <em>M. tuberculosis</em> infection outcome is not clear.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h4\">Reactive nitrogen intermediates</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Several studies have focused on the role of reactive nitrogen intermediates (RNI) in clearing infection before acquired immunity develops. In mice, RNIs are the only macrophage effector molecules associated with killing of <em>M. tuberculosis</em>. A murine macrophage cell line expressing RNI but defective in ROI expression was able to kill a virulent strain of <em>M. tuberculosis</em> after stimulation with interferon (IFN)-gamma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/immunology-of-tuberculosis/abstract/47\" class=\"abstract_t\">47</a>].</p><p>Additional evidence for the importance of RNI in controlling <em>M. tuberculosis</em> infection in mice is illustrated by the following observations:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Mortality in mice infected with <em>M. tuberculosis</em> is increased when inducible nitric oxide synthase (<em>NOS2</em> or <em>iNOS</em>), which leads to RNI expression, is blocked by nitric oxide synthase inhibitors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/immunology-of-tuberculosis/abstract/48\" class=\"abstract_t\">48</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>IFN-gamma is a potent stimulus of <em>NOS2</em> expression in mice. Mice with disrupted IFN-gamma or <em>NOS2</em> genes become highly susceptible to <em>M. tuberculosis</em> infections [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/immunology-of-tuberculosis/abstract/49,50\" class=\"abstract_t\">49,50</a>].</p><p/><p>Human macrophages do not express <em>NOS2</em> when exposed to IFN-gamma, and <em>NOS2</em> expression in peripheral blood-derived macrophages is difficult to demonstrate. However, several studies have provided evidence for <em>NOS2</em> expression by alveolar macrophages obtained from bronchial alveolar lavage (BAL) fluid of patients with TB [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/immunology-of-tuberculosis/abstract/51-53\" class=\"abstract_t\">51-53</a>].</p><p>Thus, human <em>NOS2</em> may require factors other than those that stimulate <em>NOS2</em> expression in murine macrophages. RNIs may play an important role in the initial (innate immunity) as well as the later control (acquired immunity) of <em>M. tuberculosis</em> infection.</p><p>There is epidemiologic evidence supporting the importance of RNIs in TB control. A study in New York City found that the most common drug-susceptible strain of <em>M. tuberculosis</em> circulating in the city (C strain) during the early 1990s was resistant to RNIs generated in vitro and was associated with injection drug use [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/immunology-of-tuberculosis/abstract/54\" class=\"abstract_t\">54</a>]. This strain was used to identify a novel gene called <em>noxR1</em>. Expression of this gene in nonpathogenic strains of <em>E. coli</em> or <em>M. smegmatis</em> led to increased resistance to RNIs and ROIs in vitro [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/immunology-of-tuberculosis/abstract/55\" class=\"abstract_t\">55</a>].</p><p>Another protein, alkyl hydroperoxidase subunit protein, expressed by gene <em>ahpC</em> of <em>M. tuberculosis </em>also protects human cells from necrosis and apoptosis caused by RNIs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/immunology-of-tuberculosis/abstract/56\" class=\"abstract_t\">56</a>]. <em>AhpC</em> is believed to detoxify peroxynitrite, a potent oxidant generated from the reaction of nitric oxide and superoxide anion (O<sub>2</sub><sup>-</sup>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/immunology-of-tuberculosis/abstract/57\" class=\"abstract_t\">57</a>]. Peroxynitrite-induced damage has been suggested to be repaired by methionine sulfoxide reductase encoded by <em>msrA</em> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/immunology-of-tuberculosis/abstract/58\" class=\"abstract_t\">58</a>]. Another gene <em>noxR3</em> of <em>M. tuberculosis</em> has been reported to protect <em>Salmonella typhimurium</em> against oxidative and nitrosative stress [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/immunology-of-tuberculosis/abstract/59\" class=\"abstract_t\">59</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h4\">Interferon-gamma</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In human macrophages, the effect of IFN-gamma in killing <em>M. tuberculosis</em> has not been definitively demonstrated. In one study, for example, cells preincubated with IFN-gamma enhanced the intracellular proliferation of <em>M. tuberculosis</em>; in comparison, killing of another intracellular organism, <em>Leishmania</em>, was increased [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/immunology-of-tuberculosis/abstract/60\" class=\"abstract_t\">60</a>]. However, the coadministration of IFN-gamma with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=calcitriol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">calcitriol</a> (the most active metabolite of vitamin D), which causes monocytes to mature in vitro, leads to intracellular killing of <em>M. tuberculosis</em> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/immunology-of-tuberculosis/abstract/61\" class=\"abstract_t\">61</a>]. Calcitriol independently stimulates <em>NOS2 </em>production and suppresses growth of <em>M. tuberculosis</em> inside the human macrophage-like cell line, HL-60 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/immunology-of-tuberculosis/abstract/62\" class=\"abstract_t\">62</a>]. Transcription factor hypoxia-inducible factor-1alpha (HIF-1alpha) has been demonstrated to be an essential mediator of interferon-gamma&ndash;dependent control of <em>M. tuberculosis</em> in murine macrophages infected in vitro and in mice disrupted in HIF-1alpha [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/immunology-of-tuberculosis/abstract/63\" class=\"abstract_t\">63</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h4\">Other cytokines</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In addition to the role that IFN-gamma plays in <em>M. tuberculosis</em> control described above, other cytokines also contribute. One important cytokine is TNF-alpha. Its role in controlling latent infection with <em>M. tuberculosis</em> in humans has been dramatically demonstrated by multiple reports of reactivation TB occurring in individuals treated for rheumatoid arthritis or Crohn's disease with anti-TNF-alpha (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=infliximab-including-biosimilars-of-infliximab-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">infliximab</a>) or TNF-alpha receptor (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=etanercept-including-biosimilars-of-etanercept-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">etanercept</a>) antibodies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/immunology-of-tuberculosis/abstract/64-66\" class=\"abstract_t\">64-66</a>]. TNF-alpha is also important for proper granuloma formation (see below). Persistently infected mice treated with neutralizing anti-TNF-alpha antibody develop granuloma disorganization, which eventually kill the mice [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/immunology-of-tuberculosis/abstract/67\" class=\"abstract_t\">67</a>]. IFN-gamma and IL-12 levels in these mice are not affected. Mice deficient in this cytokine or TNF-alpha receptor are highly susceptible to <em>M. tuberculosis</em> infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/immunology-of-tuberculosis/abstract/68,69\" class=\"abstract_t\">68,69</a>].</p><p>The role of other cytokines in outcome after <em>M. tuberculosis</em> infection is less clear. IL-10 produced by macrophages has an antiinflammatory effect. However, IL-10&ndash;disrupted mice are not any more resistant to <em>M. tuberculosis</em> infection than wild-type mice [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/immunology-of-tuberculosis/abstract/70\" class=\"abstract_t\">70</a>]. The role of another suppressive cytokine transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta in infection outcome in mice or humans remains unresolved [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/immunology-of-tuberculosis/abstract/71\" class=\"abstract_t\">71</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H867782591\"><span class=\"h4\">Nutrient deprivation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Nutrient limitation by macrophages is another innate immunity-related tool for control of <em>M. tuberculosis</em>. <em>M. tuberculosis</em> engulfed into a phagosomal compartment must access nutrients and carbon source for its persistence. Macrophages limit access of glucose and lipids to <em>M. tuberculosis</em> residing inside phagosomal compartments, but <em>M. tuberculosis</em> has developed a strategy to utilize lipids derived from host cell's triacylglycerol and cholesterol, which accumulate in the phagosome as lipid droplets [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/immunology-of-tuberculosis/abstract/72\" class=\"abstract_t\">72</a>]. Cells containing such lipid droplets are often referred to as foamy macrophages. Vitamin D, however, can prevent <em>M. tuberculosis</em>&ndash;induced lipid droplet accumulation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/immunology-of-tuberculosis/abstract/73\" class=\"abstract_t\">73</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11165131\"><span class=\"h3\">Adaptive immunity</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Macrophages as well as other phagocytic cells such as dendritic cells carry phagocytized <em>M. tuberculosis</em> to draining lymph nodes where they present <em>M. tuberculosis</em> antigens to T cells. The presentation of antigens to T cells induces cellular immune response.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h4\">Cellular immunity</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Two to six weeks after infection with <em>M. tuberculosis</em>, T cells that specifically recognize <em>M. tuberculosis</em> antigens appear; this response can be demonstrated clinically by the development of a delayed-type hypersensitivity (DTH) response to intradermally injected tuberculin or purified protein derivative (PPD). One study of T cell responses in persistently anergic patients with documented pulmonary TB demonstrated that T cells produced IL-10 but not IFN-gamma and failed to proliferate in vitro following stimulation with PPD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/immunology-of-tuberculosis/abstract/74\" class=\"abstract_t\">74</a>]. By contrast, T cells from PPD-positive patients produced both IL-10 and IFN-gamma and displayed a dramatic proliferative response to PPD stimulation.</p><p>The DTH response per se does not correlate with protection against TB, since numerous BCG vaccination trials have demonstrated that disease can occur in those who mount a DTH response [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/immunology-of-tuberculosis/abstract/75\" class=\"abstract_t\">75</a>]. As a result, the protective T cell response must be distinguished from the T cell response associated with DTH.</p><p>Interferon-gamma release assays have been developed; these are in vitro, whole blood-based tests to measure T cell activation. The assays are an alternative to the <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tuberculin-skin-test-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">tuberculin skin test</a> (TST) for detection of latent <em>M. tuberculosis</em> infection in human hosts [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/immunology-of-tuberculosis/abstract/76-80\" class=\"abstract_t\">76-80</a>]. The test measures interferon-gamma released into blood from T cells when they are activated by <em>M. tuberculosis</em> antigens in vitro.

These proteins are encoded by genes located within the region of difference 1 (RD1) of the <em>M. tuberculosis</em> genome and are absent in vaccine strain BCG or <em>M. bovis</em>. This enables the test to differentiate those latently infected with <em>M. tuberculosis</em> from those vaccinated with BCG.

Other animal studies showed that this protective response was mediated by CD4-bearing T cells [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/immunology-of-tuberculosis/abstract/83,84\" class=\"abstract_t\">83,84</a>]. If it is assumed that the DTH response is mediated by CD4+ Th1 cells, the wide range of protection (0 to 80 percent) demonstrated by numerous BCG trials suggest that CD4+ T cells are not sufficient for protection and that other cells must be involved [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/immunology-of-tuberculosis/abstract/75\" class=\"abstract_t\">75</a>]. However, the greatly increased risk of TB with HIV infection, in which CD4+ T cells become depleted, suggests that these cells are important for protection against TB in humans. CD4+ T cells exert their effector function by producing IFN-gamma, which activates macrophages. This response is important, particularly during early phase of an infection. In one study, in CD4-disrupted mice, levels of IFN-gamma in the lungs, while diminished early in infection, reached levels found in wild-type mice after about three weeks, suggesting that other cell types (CD8+ cells) can compensate for the decreased cytokine expression by CD4 T cells [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/immunology-of-tuberculosis/abstract/85\" class=\"abstract_t\">85</a>]. Finally, in addition to the role of cytokines produced by CD4+ cells, apoptosis of infected cells by CD4+ T cells may contribute to controlling infection. However, published reports on the role of apoptosis in <em>M. tuberculosis </em>infection control remain equivocal [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/immunology-of-tuberculosis/abstract/86,87\" class=\"abstract_t\">86,87</a>].</p><p>Cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) have been implicated in protection against <em>M. tuberculosis</em>, and active investigation into the details of this mechanism is ongoing.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Mice with disruption of the beta-2 microglobulin gene fail to control infection with a virulent strain of <em>M. tuberculosis</em> (Erdman) despite having intact CD4+ and cytolytic gamma-delta T cells [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/immunology-of-tuberculosis/abstract/88\" class=\"abstract_t\">88</a>].

Coculturing DN and CD8+ T cell lines with CD1 cells infected with <em>M. tuberculosis</em> revealed that DN CD1-restricted cells had no effect on the viability of the organism, while CD8+ CD1-restricted T cells reduced the number of colony forming units (CFU) by 35 to 50 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/immunology-of-tuberculosis/abstract/87\" class=\"abstract_t\">87</a>].</p><p>This bacterial killing is mediated by granulysin, a protein found in the granules of human CTLs and natural killer (NK) cells, but not in murine cells [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/immunology-of-tuberculosis/abstract/81\" class=\"abstract_t\">81</a>].

In one study, for example, two human TCR alpha beta+ CD8+ T cell lines specific for <em>M. tuberculosis</em> antigens recognized lipid antigens when presented by CD1a or CD1c antigen-presenting cells and displayed both cytotoxicity and cytokine responses [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/immunology-of-tuberculosis/abstract/98\" class=\"abstract_t\">98</a>].</p><p>5'-adendomsinephosphosulfate reductase (CysH), an enzyme essential for the production of reduced sulfur-containing metabolites, has been shown to be important for <em>M. tuberculosis</em> during the chronic infection phase [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/immunology-of-tuberculosis/abstract/99\" class=\"abstract_t\">99</a>]. Resistance to nitrosative and oxidative stress (RNI and ROI) may be the mechanism of this protection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/immunology-of-tuberculosis/abstract/99\" class=\"abstract_t\">99</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5272080\"><span class=\"h4\">Granuloma formation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In addition to the specific cell-mediated protective response involved in <em>M. tuberculosis</em> elimination, granuloma formation is an important mechanism of the host to control infection. Granuloma formation requires balanced expression of cytokines and chemokines, including RANTES, M1P1-alpha, M1P1-beta, MCP-1, MCP-3, MCP-5, and IP10 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/immunology-of-tuberculosis/abstract/100,101\" class=\"abstract_t\">100,101</a>]. Chemokine receptors also determine proper formation of granulomas and, with <em>M. tuberculosis</em> infection, the expression of CCR5 (receptor for RANTES, M1P1-alpha, and M1P1-beta) increases in macrophages [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/immunology-of-tuberculosis/abstract/102\" class=\"abstract_t\">102</a>].

CCR2 is a receptor for MCP-1, -3, and -5.

This hypervirulence was associated with aberrant proinflammatory cell migration to the site of infection in the mouse lungs and poor granuloma formation. The <em>mce1</em> operon mutant was unable to stimulate MCP-1 and TNF-alpha expression by murine macrophages [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/immunology-of-tuberculosis/abstract/105\" class=\"abstract_t\">105</a>]. Disruption of the <em>mce1</em> operon may alter the cell wall architecture and thus an effect on host granulomatous response [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/immunology-of-tuberculosis/abstract/106\" class=\"abstract_t\">106</a>]. Indeed, an untargeted metabolomics analysis of the cell wall lipids of the <em>mce1</em> operon mutant showed more than 400 lipids that were significantly altered from those of wild-type <em>M. tuberculosis</em> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/immunology-of-tuberculosis/abstract/107\" class=\"abstract_t\">107</a>], indicating that changes in cell wall lipid contents affect host immune response.

These observations suggested that alteration in the cell wall lipid composition or its remodeling can greatly affect host immune response and that a certain level of proinflammatory response induced by <em>M. tuberculosis</em> itself is necessary for proper granuloma formation that is protective both to the host and the bacterium. Thus, the granuloma is not only a host protective factor but may serve as a shelter constructed by the tubercle bacterium itself for its long-term survival in the host and that bacterial cell wall lipids may play an important role in this host-pathogen homeostatic interaction.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11165213\"><span class=\"h4\">Humoral immunity</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The role of the humoral immune response in protection against <em>M. tuberculosis</em> is controversial.
