The classification, presentation, and general approach to lesions involving the pineal gland will be presented here, focusing on the management of pineal parenchymal tumors.</p><p>Germ cell tumors, the most frequent tumor type found in the pineal region, are discussed elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=intracranial-germ-cell-tumors\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Intracranial germ cell tumors&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">EPIDEMIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In Europe and North America, pineal tumors account for less than 1 percent of all primary brain tumors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pineal-gland-masses/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Pineal tumors are more common in children aged 1 to 12 years where these constitute about 3 percent of brain tumors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pineal-gland-masses/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p>Pineal tumors are more common in Asian countries than in Western countries [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pineal-gland-masses/abstract/3,4\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,4</a>]. This increased frequency is due largely to an increase in germ cell tumors, which comprise 70 to 80 percent of all pineal region tumors in Japan and Korea. In one study, there was a significantly higher incidence of intracranial germ cell tumors in <span class=\"nowrap\">Asian/Pacific</span> Islanders living in the United States compared with whites in the 10 to 29 year age group, suggesting that underlying genetic susceptibility may play a role in the etiology of these tumors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pineal-gland-masses/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].</p><p>Pineal tumors are substantially more common in males. In an analysis of 633 cases from the Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results (SEER) database over a 32 year period, pineal tumors were three times more common in males than females [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pineal-gland-masses/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. In those with germ cell tumors, the male predominance was approximately 12:1.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">CLASSIFICATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The three histologic tumors that account for most neoplasms arising within the pineal gland are germ cell tumors (GCTs), pineal parenchymal tumors, and gliomas (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F73168\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef73168 \">table 1</a>). In a series of 633 cases from the SEER database, these comprised 59, 30, and 5 percent of patients, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pineal-gland-masses/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Other pineal tumors reported included meningiomas, gangliogliomas, ependymomas, lipomas, trilateral retinoblastomas and metastases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pineal-gland-masses/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. Benign lesions arising within the pineal gland that can be confused with neoplasms include pineal cysts, vascular malformations, and vein of Galen aneurysms. There have been rare reports of choroid plexus papilloma in the pineal region, pineal epidermoid tumors, and primary malignant melanomas of the pineal region [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pineal-gland-masses/abstract/7-12\" class=\"abstract_t\">7-12</a>]. Other rare tumors of the pineal region are neuroendocrine carcinoma of the pineal parenchyma, schwannomas arising from the trochlear nerve, and gliosarcoma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pineal-gland-masses/abstract/13-15\" class=\"abstract_t\">13-15</a>].</p><p>GCTs are divided into germinomas and nongerminomatous GCTs in the World Health Organization (WHO) classification system (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F82711\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef82711 \">table 2</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pineal-gland-masses/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. The nongerminomatous GCTs include embryonal carcinoma, endodermal sinus tumor (also known as yolk sac tumor), choriocarcinoma, teratoma (immature and mature), and mixed tumors with more than one element. Germinomas comprise approximately three-quarters of all GCTs in the SEER series and approximately 45 to 50 percent of all pineal tumors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pineal-gland-masses/abstract/1,17\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,17</a>]. Germinomas and teratomas are frequently encountered as pure tumors, whereas the other types are mostly part of mixed GCTs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pineal-gland-masses/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=intracranial-germ-cell-tumors#H6\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Intracranial germ cell tumors&quot;, section on 'Histologic classification'</a>.)</p><p>The 2007 WHO classification of central nervous system tumors divides pineal gland tumors into four groups [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pineal-gland-masses/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pineocytoma (grade I)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pineal parenchymal tumors of intermediate differentiation (grade II or III)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Papillary tumor of the pineal region (grade II or III)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pineoblastoma (grade IV)</p><p/><p>Tumors that contain areas histopathologically like both pineocytoma and pineoblastoma (mixed <span class=\"nowrap\">pineocytoma/pineoblastoma)</span> are often included within the intermediate differentiation group.</p><p>The potentially aggressive behavior of pineoblastoma and the <span class=\"nowrap\">intermediate/mixed-group</span> tumors and the tendency for CSF seeding justified grouping these histologic subtypes together. This explains the absence of pineal parenchymal tumors of intermediate differentiation and of the pineal papillary tumor from the registry before 2007 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pineal-gland-masses/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>].</p><p>The relative prevalence of histologic types depends on the age of the patient population under study. As an example, among patients with a pineal GCTs, germinoma is most frequent among those between 10 and 19 years of age, and there are some patients aged &gt;30 years. Choriocarcinoma, embryonal carcinoma, and yolk sac tumor are rare in those over age 30 years. Pineoblastoma is most frequent among patients under five years of age, while pineocytoma is evenly distributed in patients between 10 and 60 years of age [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pineal-gland-masses/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. Astrocytomas tend to occur in two separate age groups: two to six-year-olds, and 12 to 18-year-olds.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h1\">PRESENTING FEATURES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Pineal gland tumors share some common clinical and radiographic features based upon their anatomic location. The initial diagnostic approach is similar, and the treatment and prognosis depend upon establishing a histologic diagnosis. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-the-clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-brain-tumors-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of the clinical features and diagnosis of brain tumors in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Clinical signs and symptoms</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Pineal tumors cause neurologic dysfunction by direct invasion, compression, or obstruction of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) flow. The rate of tumor growth determines the rapidity of symptom onset and is an important prognostic factor.</p><p>Common signs and symptoms are summarized in the following table (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F71731\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef71731 \">table 3</a>). Hydrocephalus is common, manifested by headaches, lethargy, and signs of increased intracranial pressure. Up to 75 percent of patients with pineal tumors have Parinaud's syndrome, a constellation of neuroocular symptoms that result from pressure on the pretectal region (the dorsal aspect of the rostral or upper midbrain) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F81227\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef81227 \">table 4</a>). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=supranuclear-disorders-of-gaze-in-children#H9\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Supranuclear disorders of gaze in children&quot;, section on 'Parinaud syndrome'</a>.)</p><p>Progressive local tumor growth may result in cranial neuropathies or hypothalamic dysfunction. While extracranial metastases are rare, patients may have symptoms of leptomeningeal dissemination, which is present at diagnosis in up to 19 percent of pineoblastomas and approximately 12 percent of GCTs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pineal-gland-masses/abstract/20,21\" class=\"abstract_t\">20,21</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-leptomeningeal-metastases-from-solid-tumors\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical features and diagnosis of leptomeningeal metastases from solid tumors&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Rare cases of precocious puberty caused by a pineal mass have been reported, particularly in females [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pineal-gland-masses/abstract/22,23\" class=\"abstract_t\">22,23</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=definition-etiology-and-evaluation-of-precocious-puberty#H23810924\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Definition, etiology, and evaluation of precocious puberty&quot;, section on 'CNS lesions'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Neuroimaging</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is the most useful initial study to identify the tumor and delineate its relationship to adjacent structures. As an example, obstructive hydrocephalus from aqueductal stenosis is common; in the majority of cases, this is due to the tumor extending into the third ventricle (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F74410\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef74410 \">figure 1</a>).</p><p>In some cases, the imaging findings may suggest certain tumor types. While germ cell tumors and malignant gliomas characteristically &quot;invade&quot; through the wall of the third ventricle, expansive compression is more common with pineal parenchymal tumors, low-grade astrocytomas, and meningiomas. However, imaging alone is generally not reliable enough to establish a histologic diagnosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pineal-gland-masses/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. Descriptions of typical imaging characteristics for each tumor type are provided below. </p><p>While quantitative imaging using CT, MR, and FDG-PET cannot differentiate between pineal parenchymal tumors (PPTs) and germinomas, careful attention to clinical characteristics (eg, age, gender) calcification patterns, and thalamic involvement can improve the accuracy of preoperative differential diagnosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pineal-gland-masses/abstract/25,26\" class=\"abstract_t\">25,26</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Localized calcification is seen in more than 70 percent of GCTs, while it is scattered in more than half of PPTs</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Cystic components in tumors are most frequent in nongerminomatous germ cell tumors (NGGCTs)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Multiplicity is characteristic of GCTs are rare in other tumor types</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Thick peritumoral edema is more frequent in germinoma than in NGGCT</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Bithalamic extension of tumor is seen in up to 80 percent of germinomas, while significantly rare in other groups of tumors</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h3\">Germ cell tumors</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Germ cell tumors (GCTs) typically are seen as a homogeneous hyperdense mass. In contrast, teratomas are multilocular heterogeneous masses containing lipid areas [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pineal-gland-masses/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>].</p><p>Pineal calcification on skull radiographs, uncommon in children younger than 10 years, is a useful clue to the diagnosis of a GCT because approximately 70 percent of patients with GCTs have calcifications that are seen within the mass rather than calcifications &quot;exploding&quot; to the periphery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pineal-gland-masses/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>].</p><p>Intracranial GCTs typically appear hypointense or isointense on T1-weighted imaging and hyperintense on T2-weighted imaging; their contrast enhancement pattern can be homogeneous or heterogeneous. Cystic areas are common and may be multiple. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=intracranial-germ-cell-tumors#H11\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Intracranial germ cell tumors&quot;, section on 'Neuroimaging'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h3\">Pineal parenchymal tumors</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Pineal parenchymal tumors (PPTs) include pineocytomas, pineoblastomas, PPTs of intermediate differentiation, and papillary tumor of the pineal region.</p><p>On CT, pineocytomas are typically isodense and enhance homogeneously with contrast. Cysts and calcifications are present in up to one-half of cases; peripheral calcifications are more suggestive of pineocytoma than germinoma, as PPTs classically result in preexisting pineal calcifications dispersing to the periphery of the lesions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pineal-gland-masses/abstract/24,27,28\" class=\"abstract_t\">24,27,28</a>]. Benign pineal cysts may present similarly (see <a href=\"#H40\" class=\"local\">'Pineal cysts'</a> below).</p><p>On MRI, pineocytomas are typically &le;3 cm, sharply demarcated lesions with a high degree of cytoplasm that are hypointense on T1-weighted images and hyperintense on T2-weighted images [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pineal-gland-masses/abstract/29,30\" class=\"abstract_t\">29,30</a>]. They enhance homogeneously with contrast, and only one-third have associated hydrocephalus.</p><p>Pineoblastomas are hyperdense and have no associated calcifications [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pineal-gland-masses/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. They tend to be larger than 3 cm, lobulated, and poorly demarcated on MRI, and they are essentially isointense to gray matter on T2-weighted images, possibly related to the known paucity of cytoplasm in these tumor cells and overall dense cellularity seen in these lesions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pineal-gland-masses/abstract/30-32\" class=\"abstract_t\">30-32</a>]. These tumors enhance heterogeneously with contrast and 90 percent have associated hydrocephalus. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h3\">Glial tumors</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Pineal glial tumors typically arise from the neighboring tectal plate and have a similar appearance on CT and MRI as when encountered elsewhere in the brain. Given their location of origin, pineal calcifications are displaced superiorly [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pineal-gland-masses/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. Calcifications can be identified in about two-thirds of pineal gliomas [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pineal-gland-masses/abstract/24,29\" class=\"abstract_t\">24,29</a>]. Low-grade pilocytic astrocytomas may be cystic, and unlike other low-grade gliomas, they enhance with contrast.</p><p>The typical appearance of high-grade gliomas (eg, glioblastoma multiforme) is a multilobular solid tumor with indistinct margins and heterogeneous contrast enhancement. Enhancing tumor can be distinguished from the surrounding hypointense signal of edema on T1-weighted images. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=classification-and-pathologic-diagnosis-of-gliomas\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Classification and pathologic diagnosis of gliomas&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-presentation-initial-surgical-approach-and-prognosis-of-high-grade-gliomas\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical presentation, initial surgical approach, and prognosis of high-grade gliomas&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h3\">Other tumors</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A number of other tumors may be suspected based upon neuroimaging results:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Meningiomas &mdash; Pineal meningiomas are small tumors (&lt;2 cm) that have well-defined margins. Attachments to the falx often can be identified on sagittal images. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epidemiology-pathology-clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-meningioma#H22\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Epidemiology, pathology, clinical features, and diagnosis of meningioma&quot;, section on 'Diagnostic evaluation'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Lipomas &mdash; Lipomas have low attenuation on CT, increased signal on T1-weighted images, and lack contrast enhancement.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pineal metastases &mdash; The MRI features of metastases to the pineal gland are nonspecific. As in other areas of the brain, metastases are accompanied by more edema than would be expected based upon lesion size. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-brain-metastases#H12\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Epidemiology, clinical manifestations, and diagnosis of brain metastases&quot;, section on 'Imaging studies'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h3\">Nonneoplastic lesions</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Nonneoplastic pineal lesions in the differential diagnosis of pineal masses include vascular malformations, arachnoid cysts, and pineal cysts, which must commonly be distinguished from cystic germ cell tumors, pineal parenchymal tumors, or gliomas (see <a href=\"#H40\" class=\"local\">'Pineal cysts'</a> below).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h1\">INITIAL APPROACH</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Pineal tumors are a challenge to the neurosurgeon because the pineal gland is a deep structure, surrounded by important vascular and neural structures. However, advances in microsurgery and neuroanesthesia have improved accessibility to the pineal region, and there is less hesitancy to approach this region surgically [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pineal-gland-masses/abstract/33-35\" class=\"abstract_t\">33-35</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h2\">Staging work-up</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The staging work-up for patients with suspected pineal tumors must include a contrast-enhanced MRI of the brain and the entire spine. The cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) should be examined cytologically only if the patient is considered safe for a lumbar puncture. If CSF cannot be obtained by lumbar puncture then CSF can be obtained at the time of surgery and sent for the appropriate studies.</p><p>Both serum and CSF should be assayed for alpha-fetoprotein and beta human chorionic gonadotropin (beta-hCG) to help diagnose a germ cell tumor. Once tissue is obtained, immunohistochemistry may be of additional value in detecting these markers or placental alkaline phosphatase. There are no serum markers for other pineal tumors.</p><p>Measurement of daily variation in serum melatonin levels does not have an established role but remains an area of interest for patients with tumors of the pineal region. In a series of 29 patients with a histologically well-defined pineal tumor and 24-hour melatonin profile determination before <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> after surgery, melatonin rhythm was dramatically reduced for undifferentiated or invasive tumors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pineal-gland-masses/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>]. An abnormal melatonin profile following surgery could be a reflection of either residual tumor or surgical damage to the pineal.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14\"><span class=\"h2\">Tissue diagnosis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A tissue diagnosis is generally needed prior to therapy, since treatment is histology-dependent. Empiric therapy for a nongerminomatous GCT may be considered in a patient with characteristic neuroimaging studies and elevated serum or CSF levels of the tumor markers alpha-fetoprotein <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> the beta subunit of human chorionic gonadotropin. Similarly empiric therapy for patient with germinoma can be initiated based upon the imaging presence of &ldquo;bi focal&rdquo; tumors, CSF beta-hCG &lt;50 <span class=\"nowrap\">mIU/mL,</span> and no elevation of alpha-fetoprotein. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=intracranial-germ-cell-tumors\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Intracranial germ cell tumors&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15\"><span class=\"h3\">Stereotactic biopsy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A direct, visually guided biopsy of the pineal gland mass with open or neuroendoscopic surgery has been preferred due to concerns about injury to the deep cerebral veins. An open procedure also allows CSF to be obtained for tumor marker studies, permits direct visualization of the third ventricle for staging purposes, and allows a third ventriculostomy to be performed for CSF diversion if needed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pineal-gland-masses/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>].</p><p>Despite these concerns, contemporary series suggest that stereotactic biopsy is reasonably safe and well tolerated, provided a low frontal approach is used to access the tumor below the level of the internal cerebral veins [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pineal-gland-masses/abstract/38-41\" class=\"abstract_t\">38-41</a>]. CSF sampling is possible because the biopsy trajectory often traverses the lateral ventricle.</p><p>The diagnostic yield of stereotactic biopsy ranges from 94 to 100 percent when multiple target biopsies are obtained, but sampling error may be an issue due to the heterogeneity of some pineal tumors (particularly mixed germ cell tumors) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pineal-gland-masses/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>]. Procedure-related morbidity is generally limited to transient worsening of ocular symptoms, although fatal complications have been reported [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pineal-gland-masses/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>]. A frameless stereotactic robot has been successfully used for brain biopsies over the past few years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pineal-gland-masses/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>].</p><p>If the biopsy is nondiagnostic, equivocal, or suggests a benign tumor such as mature teratoma or meningioma, surgery is recommended to establish a definitive diagnosis or to identify focal areas of malignant disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pineal-gland-masses/abstract/43,44\" class=\"abstract_t\">43,44</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H16\"><span class=\"h3\">Open surgery</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Open surgery, including an attempt at gross total resection, is favored by some as the initial approach to patients with pineal tumors, rather than stereotactic biopsy. Since approximately one-third of pineal lesions are benign, open surgery may be potentially curative as well as diagnostic [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pineal-gland-masses/abstract/34,45-47\" class=\"abstract_t\">34,45-47</a>]. Furthermore, an open procedure minimizes sampling error and tumor debulking may obviate the need for CSF diversion if obstructive hydrocephalus is present [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pineal-gland-masses/abstract/44,47\" class=\"abstract_t\">44,47</a>].</p><p>However, an attempt at gross total resection is not widely accepted for several reasons:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Except for well-encapsulated teratomas, few pineal region tumors are amenable to complete resection because of local or regional extension [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pineal-gland-masses/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Many tumors require multimodality therapy once a diagnosis is established. As an example, germ cell tumors are highly sensitive to both chemotherapy and radiation therapy, and the best results have been achieved with these modalities. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=intracranial-germ-cell-tumors#H15\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Intracranial germ cell tumors&quot;, section on 'Treatment'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>CSF seeding, as evidenced by positive cytology, requires craniospinal radiation and adjuvant chemotherapy regardless of tumor type. In this setting, the use of radiation therapy and chemotherapy may obviate the need for an extensive resection.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Any potential benefit from open resection must be balanced against procedural risks. New or worsening visual deficits may occur in up to one-third of patients, although most improve over time [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pineal-gland-masses/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>]. Depending upon surgical expertise, the risk of permanent morbidity from open pineal gland surgery is 3 to 10 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pineal-gland-masses/abstract/34,45\" class=\"abstract_t\">34,45</a>], while operative mortality rates range from 4 to 10 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pineal-gland-masses/abstract/48\" class=\"abstract_t\">48</a>].

Approximately 20 percent of pineal tumors arise from the epithelial cells and are termed pineal parenchymal tumors (PPTs). PPTs classically result in preexisting pineal calcification at the periphery of the lesion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pineal-gland-masses/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. They are classified histologically into pineocytomas (grade I), pineoblastomas (grade IV), PPT of intermediate differentiation, and papillary tumor of the pineal region (grade II-III) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pineal-gland-masses/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H19\"><span class=\"h2\">Histogenesis and histology</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Pinealocytes are specially modified neuronal cells similar to the photoreceptor cells in the retina, and phylogenetic studies have shown the evolution of the pineal from a photoreceptor organ to a secretory gland. PPTs share morphologic and immunohistochemical features of cells from both the developing human pineal gland and the retina. Clinical evidence of their shared histogenesis is the occurrence of bilateral familial retinoblastoma with pineoblastoma (the trilateral retinoblastoma syndrome) (see <a href=\"#H33\" class=\"local\">'Trilateral retinoblastoma'</a> below).</p><p>Using immunohistochemistry, parenchymal cells (pinealocytes) are positive for neuron specific enolase (NSE) and synaptophysin, supporting their neuroendocrine nature. Both pineocytomas and pineoblastomas stain for NSE, and IHC may be used to distinguish PPT from astrocytic tumors. In contrast, interstitial cells show immunoreactivity to glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), S-100 and vimentin, supporting their glial origin. CRX protein is expressed in pineal tumors and retinoblastoma but not in the glial tumors, a property that can help to discriminate pineal tumors from glial tumors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pineal-gland-masses/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>].</p><p>Pineocytomas and pineoblastomas each account for a little less than one-half of all PPTs.

Pineocytomas are well circumscribed and generally do not seed the CSF.</p><p>Microscopically, pineocytomas are composed of sheets of mature-appearing cells arranged in lobules, with rare or absent mitotic figures, and no pleomorphism, hyperchromatic nuclei, or necrosis. The cells are separated by a connective tissue stroma, giving a pseudolobular appearance reminiscent of normal pineal gland architecture. Characteristic pineocytomatous rosettes are arranged around central areas of eosinophilic fibrillar material. The absence of these rosettes (ie, lack of neuronal differentiation) is associated with a poorer prognosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pineal-gland-masses/abstract/54,55\" class=\"abstract_t\">54,55</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H21\"><span class=\"h3\">Pineoblastoma</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Pineoblastomas correspond to WHO grade IV tumors.

Necrosis is common. Pineoblastomas lack pineocytomatous rosettes, but can have Homer-Wright or Flexner-Wintersteiner rosettes, which are indicative of retinoblastic differentiation.</p><p>Pineoblastomas are considered by some to be a variant of supratentorial primitive neuroectodermal tumors (PNETs). Like supratentorial PNETs, pineoblastomas are poorly differentiated, infiltrative, and have a significant potential for leptomeningeal and extracranial dissemination [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pineal-gland-masses/abstract/21,54,55\" class=\"abstract_t\">21,54,55</a>].

The biological behavior of PTPR is variable and appears to correspond to WHO grade II or III.</p><p>Histologically, PTPRs are characterized by a papillary architecture and epithelial cytology, with immunoreactivity for cytokeratin and glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP). Precise histologic criteria have not been defined [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pineal-gland-masses/abstract/62\" class=\"abstract_t\">62</a>]. Although microscopically indistinguishable from pineocytoma, the histology is incompatible with a pineal parenchymal tumor. Ultrastructural features suggest ependymal differentiation and a possible origin from specialized ependymal cells of the subcommissural organ. Although it is difficult to speculate on the origin of PTPRs, cells from both pineal parenchymal tumor of intermediate differentiation (PPTID) and PTPR have neurosecretory features, suggesting the possibility of a common precursor. Indeed, a recent report documented for the first time a PPTID with transition to a papillary tumor of the pineal region (PTPR), highlighting the continuum with which primary pineal tumors exist [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pineal-gland-masses/abstract/61\" class=\"abstract_t\">61</a>]. Overall, histologic diagnosis of PTPRs is difficult due to similarities with the two main differential diagnoses, papillary ependymoma and choroid plexus tumors.</p><p>PTPRs frequently show loss of chromosomes 10, 3, and 22q and gains of 8p and 12 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pineal-gland-masses/abstract/63\" class=\"abstract_t\">63</a>]. Chromosome 10 harbors the phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN) gene [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pineal-gland-masses/abstract/64\" class=\"abstract_t\">64</a>]. The inactivation of PTEN by mutation or epigenetic silencing has been observed in a variety of brain tumors, including high-grade gliomas. Taken together, these findings indicate that PTEN mutations and activation of the <span class=\"nowrap\">PI3K/Akt/mTOR</span> signaling pathway may play a role in the biology of PTPR and suggest a potential therapeutic target [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pineal-gland-masses/abstract/64\" class=\"abstract_t\">64</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H24\"><span class=\"h2\">Presentation and diagnosis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The clinical presentation of PPTs is similar to that of other tumors arising in the pineal gland area.

Papillary tumors of the pineal region appear to be mildly lobulated, partially cystic, heterogeneously enhanced masses, and usually cause obstructive hydrocephalus. They are relatively large (2.5 to 4 cm), and well circumscribed, with low T1 and increased T2 signal as well as contrast enhancement on MRI [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pineal-gland-masses/abstract/70\" class=\"abstract_t\">70</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H26\"><span class=\"h2\">Prognosis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The main prognostic indicators are disease extent and histologic subtype [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pineal-gland-masses/abstract/71\" class=\"abstract_t\">71</a>].

Symptoms may be caused by aqueductal compression resulting in hydrocephalus [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pineal-gland-masses/abstract/117\" class=\"abstract_t\">117</a>], obstruction of the vein of Galen, or compression of the collicular plate, leading to Parinaud syndrome [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pineal-gland-masses/abstract/118\" class=\"abstract_t\">118</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H43\"><span class=\"h2\">Treatment</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Small, asymptomatic pineal cysts require no therapy. If cysts become symptomatic by causing hydrocephalus, several treatment options can be considered.

Open or stereotactic cyst resection is considered by some the only guarantee of permanent cure and can obviate the need for CSF shunting [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pineal-gland-masses/abstract/59,120\" class=\"abstract_t\">59,120</a>].</p><p>Stereotactic cyst aspiration relieves the mass effect while at the same time providing a histologic diagnosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pineal-gland-masses/abstract/114\" class=\"abstract_t\">114</a>]. In general, the morbidity is lower than with open procedures, although the risk of recurrence after aspiration alone is unknown. Instillation of radioactive phosphorus 32 (P32) into the cyst cavity may be considered for recurrent cysts.</p><p>Some authors advocate imaging follow-up for typical pineal cysts to document stability with time, particularly for cysts larger than 10 to 14 mm, under the assumption that they may enlarge or become symptomatic, whereas others advocate clinical follow-up only if there are no atypical features or symptoms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pineal-gland-masses/abstract/121\" class=\"abstract_t\">121</a>].

(See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Epidemiology'</a> above and <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Classification'</a> above.)</p><p>Pineal tumors can cause neurologic dysfunction by direct invasion, compression, or obstruction of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) flow. Common signs and symptoms are headaches, lethargy, and signs of increased intracranial pressure. Up to 75 percent of patients with pineal tumors have Parinaud's syndrome, a constellation of neuroocular symptoms that result from pressure on the pretectal region (the dorsal aspect of the rostral or upper midbrain). (See <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Presenting features'</a> above.)</p><p>The initial evaluation should include imaging of the entire neuraxis and cytology examination of the cerebrospinal fluid, to rule out leptomeningeal spread of the tumor. Serum and cerebrospinal fluid should also be assessed for elevated tumor markers (alpha-fetoprotein and beta human chorionic gonadotropin) to detect a possible germ cell tumor. (See <a href=\"#H13\" class=\"local\">'Staging work-up'</a> above.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Although features on neuroradiologic imaging may suggest a specific histologic diagnosis, a biopsy is necessary in most cases to establish the diagnosis and to permit appropriate treatment. Tissue may be obtained either by stereotactic biopsy or open surgery. When the patient's condition permits, we suggest an open surgical approach, rather than a stereotactic biopsy (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). Open biopsy may allow gross total resection in some cases, and this may constitute adequate therapy for low-grade lesions. (See <a href=\"#H14\" class=\"local\">'Tissue diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients with pineal parenchymal tumors, we recommend surgical resection if technically feasible without causing severe neurologic dysfunction, rather than radiation therapy alone (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=2\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1B</a>). For patients with evidence of leptomeningeal tumor spread, and for those thought to be at high risk for leptomeningeal spread based upon tumor histology, we recommend craniospinal irradiation (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=2\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1B</a>). For patients with high-grade lesions (ie, pineoblastomas), we suggest the addition of intensive chemotherapy to surgery <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> radiation therapy as part of a multimodality approach (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). (See <a href=\"#H27\" class=\"local\">'Treatment'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The management of patients with intracranial germ cell tumors, the most frequent tumor arising in the pineal gland, is discussed separately.
