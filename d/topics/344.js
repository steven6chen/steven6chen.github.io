Delirium is a confusional state with superimposed hyperactivity of the sympathetic limb of the autonomic nervous system with consequent signs including tremor, tachycardia, diaphoresis, and mydriasis. Acute toxic-metabolic encephalopathy (TME), which encompasses delirium and the acute confusional state, is an acute condition of global cerebral dysfunction in the absence of primary structural brain disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-toxic-metabolic-encephalopathy-in-adults/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. An overview of TME in hospitalized patients will be discussed here; a diagnostic approach to delirium is presented separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diagnosis-of-delirium-and-confusional-states\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Diagnosis of delirium and confusional states&quot;</a>.)</p><p>TME is common among critically ill patients. Furthermore, TME is probably under recognized and undertreated, especially when it occurs in patients who require mechanical ventilation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-toxic-metabolic-encephalopathy-in-adults/abstract/2-4\" class=\"abstract_t\">2-4</a>]. TME is usually a consequence of systemic illness, and the causes of TME are diverse. Most TME is reversible, making prompt recognition and treatment important. Certain metabolic encephalopathies, including those caused by sustained hypoglycemia and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=vitamin-b1-thiamine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">thiamine</a> deficiency (Wernicke's encephalopathy), may result in permanent structural brain damage if untreated. Alcohol withdrawal syndromes <strong>must be excluded</strong> in patients with suspected TME. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-moderate-and-severe-alcohol-withdrawal-syndromes\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of moderate and severe alcohol withdrawal syndromes&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">PATHOPHYSIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Normal neuronal activity requires a balanced environment of electrolytes, water, amino acids, excitatory and inhibitory neurotransmitters, and metabolic substrates [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-toxic-metabolic-encephalopathy-in-adults/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. In addition, normal blood flow, normal temperature, normal osmolality, and physiologic pH are required for optimal central nervous system function [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-toxic-metabolic-encephalopathy-in-adults/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. Complex systems, including those mediating arousal and awareness and those involved in higher cognitive functions, are more likely to malfunction when the local milieu is deranged [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-toxic-metabolic-encephalopathy-in-adults/abstract/5-7\" class=\"abstract_t\">5-7</a>].</p><p>All forms of acute toxic-metabolic encephalopathy (TME) interfere with the function of the ascending reticular activating system <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> its projections to the cerebral cortex, leading to impairment of arousal <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> awareness [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-toxic-metabolic-encephalopathy-in-adults/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. Ultimately, the neurophysiologic mechanisms of TME include interruption of polysynaptic pathways and altered excitatory-inhibitory amino acid balance [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-toxic-metabolic-encephalopathy-in-adults/abstract/8,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,9</a>].

Increased permeability of the blood-brain barrier is evidenced by elevated protein in the CSF, a frequent finding in TME [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-toxic-metabolic-encephalopathy-in-adults/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Recent studies suggest that large neutral amino acids such as tryptophan and tyrosine are involved in the pathogenesis of delirium in critically ill patients undergoing mechanical ventilation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-toxic-metabolic-encephalopathy-in-adults/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. Interestingly, both very low and very high levels of large neutral amino acids may be associated with delirium.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL MANIFESTATIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Most clinical features of acute toxic-metabolic encephalopathy (TME) are nonspecific, and do not reliably identify a particular etiology. The term intensive care unit (ICU) syndrome, or ICU psychosis, has been used to describe TME in patients in the ICU. However, this term can be misleading and should be avoided, since TME in any hospitalized patients results from organic stress on the central nervous system, rather than factors specific to the ICU setting [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-toxic-metabolic-encephalopathy-in-adults/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>].</p><p>TME is common among patients admitted to an intensive care unit (ICU); older patients and those with underlying dementia are at greatest risk. A single center study found that delirium was present at ICU admission in 31 percent of patients older than 65 years of age [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-toxic-metabolic-encephalopathy-in-adults/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. Furthermore, 70 percent of this population developed delirium at some point during hospitalization. Other possible risk factors for TME include nutritional deficiency, infection, temperature dysregulation, and failure of multiple organ systems [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-toxic-metabolic-encephalopathy-in-adults/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. The presence of delirium is an independent risk factor for six-month mortality and prolonged hospitalization in patients receiving mechanical ventilation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-toxic-metabolic-encephalopathy-in-adults/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Mental status examination</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The cardinal feature of confusion and delirium is impaired attention; clinical findings can range from subtle cognitive difficulties to florid delirium or coma. Impairments in attention are a relatively sensitive and specific marker of delirium. Simple bedside tasks such as serial subtraction or naming the months of the year in reverse can test attention. Marked fluctuations in mental status over time are characteristic [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-toxic-metabolic-encephalopathy-in-adults/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=the-mental-status-examination-in-adults#H28388607\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;The mental status examination in adults&quot;, section on 'Attention and concentration'</a>.)</p><p>Other common findings include a disturbed sleep-wake cycle, decreased alertness, hypervigilance, hallucinations, sensory misperceptions, impaired memory, and disorientation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-toxic-metabolic-encephalopathy-in-adults/abstract/1,5-7\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,5-7</a>]. The thought process is often disorganized, manifested by confused or rambling conversation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-toxic-metabolic-encephalopathy-in-adults/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. Paranoid ideation and excessive suspiciousness may occur. Affect is also compromised in TME; most patients tend to be apathetic and withdrawn, some seem anxious, agitated, and fearful, and others appear to be manic [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-toxic-metabolic-encephalopathy-in-adults/abstract/6,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,7</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diagnosis-of-delirium-and-confusional-states\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Diagnosis of delirium and confusional states&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The level of alertness reflects the severity of the underlying condition; severely affected patients are comatose.

Cognitive impairment is usually diffuse, but more prominent in the areas of psychomotor speed, verbal fluency, visual and working memory, and visuoconstruction abilities.

The neurophysiologic mechanisms of TME include interruption of polysynaptic pathways and altered excitatory-inhibitory amino acid balance. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Pathophysiology'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>TME manifests clinically as a delirium with either an agitated confusion or somnolence. Impaired attention is a cardinal feature. Other more variably appearing features include tremor, myoclonus, and asterixis. In severe cases, posturing may occur and brainstem reflexes may be impaired. (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Clinical manifestations'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>TME is a diagnosis of exclusion within a broad differential diagnosis. Alcohol withdrawal, meningitis, encephalitis, brain tumors, non-convulsive seizures, central venous thrombophlebitis, bacterial endocarditis, fat embolism, basilar artery thrombosis, traumatic brain injury, and right hemisphere stroke can present with an acute confusional state. Laboratory studies and brain imaging are required in most patients. Some will need electroencephalography <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> lumbar puncture.
