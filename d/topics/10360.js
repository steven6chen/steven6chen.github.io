As patients with advanced breast cancer live longer, the incidence of brain metastases appears to be increasing. In a subset of women, progression in the central nervous system (CNS) has become the major life-limiting problem.</p><p>The risk factors, prognosis, and management of brain metastases in breast cancer are presented here.

Among women presenting with early-stage breast cancer, less than 3 percent will go on to develop brain metastases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-brain-metastases-in-breast-cancer/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>]. In contrast, symptomatic brain metastases are diagnosed in 10 to 16 percent of patients with metastatic breast cancer [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-brain-metastases-in-breast-cancer/abstract/1,3\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,3</a>]. Factors associated with an increased likelihood of CNS relapse include age under 40 years, pulmonary metastases, and African American ancestry [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-brain-metastases-in-breast-cancer/abstract/1,3-7\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,3-7</a>]. </p><p>In addition, the breast cancer subtype appears to be associated with the incidence of brain metastases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-brain-metastases-in-breast-cancer/abstract/2,6,8-19\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,6,8-19</a>]. In a cohort study of 1434 women treated with breast-conserving therapy plus systemic chemotherapy, brain metastases developed in 36 (2.5 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-brain-metastases-in-breast-cancer/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. However, the risk of brain metastases at ten years differed by breast cancer subtype:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Luminal A &ndash; 0.7 percent</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Luminal B &ndash; 12 percent</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Luminal-human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) positive &ndash; 8 percent</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>HER2 &ndash; 12 percent </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Triple-negative &ndash; 7 percent</p><p/><p>The brain is increasingly reported as the first site of relapse in women with HER2-positive breast cancer treated with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=trastuzumab-including-biosimilars-of-trastuzumab-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">trastuzumab</a>, whether administered in the adjuvant [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-brain-metastases-in-breast-cancer/abstract/20,21\" class=\"abstract_t\">20,21</a>] or metastatic settings [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-brain-metastases-in-breast-cancer/abstract/8-12\" class=\"abstract_t\">8-12</a>]. Over time, up to one-half of patients with HER2-positive, metastatic breast cancer will develop brain metastases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-brain-metastases-in-breast-cancer/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. However, the relationship between CNS events and receipt of HER2-directed agents (eg, trastuzumab) for women with HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer is not clear. Although a higher rate of CNS events has been reported, it seems unlikely that the administration of HER2-directed agents &quot;increases&quot; this risk. Because trastuzumab was shown to reduce recurrence rates in the adjuvant setting, the higher rate of CNS events is probably more related to the increased survival of patients, coupled with the inability of trastuzumab to cross the blood-brain barrier [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-brain-metastases-in-breast-cancer/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. </p><p>The association between the use of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=trastuzumab-including-biosimilars-of-trastuzumab-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">trastuzumab</a> and CNS events is illustrated in these examples:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A 2011 meta-analysis of adjuvant <a href=\"topic.htm?path=trastuzumab-including-biosimilars-of-trastuzumab-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">trastuzumab</a> trials reported an increased incidence of brain metastases associated with adjuvant trastuzumab use (odds ratio 1.58, 95% CI 1.08-2.30) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-brain-metastases-in-breast-cancer/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. However, the overall risk of brain metastases was low in both of the trastuzumab and control groups in all of the trials. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A separate analysis of over 3400 patients who participated in the HERA randomized trial of adjuvant <a href=\"topic.htm?path=trastuzumab-including-biosimilars-of-trastuzumab-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">trastuzumab</a> versus observation reported that adjuvant trastuzumab did not increase the risk of a CNS event as the initial recurrence (2 percent in both arms) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-brain-metastases-in-breast-cancer/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. In addition, adjuvant trastuzumab use was associated with a lower incidence of CNS events in subsequent years compared with those who were not treated with trastuzumab (47 versus 57 percent, respectively), although this difference was not statistically significant (p = 0.06). &#160;</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The incidence of CNS metastases was 35 percent among 122 patients with HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer treated with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=trastuzumab-including-biosimilars-of-trastuzumab-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">trastuzumab</a>; CNS disease was present at the time of diagnosis or discovered during treatment in 9 patients (21 percent) and 34 (79 percent) patients, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-brain-metastases-in-breast-cancer/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. </p><p/><p>Patients with triple-negative breast cancer have an increased risk of brain metastases as the initial site of metastases or following a diagnosis of breast cancer. In one study, the five-year cumulative incidence of brain metastases as a first site of recurrence was 3, 5, and 10 percent with stage I, II, and III disease, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-brain-metastases-in-breast-cancer/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. In other studies, the incidence of brain metastases at or following the diagnosis of metastatic breast cancer ranges between 25 and 46 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-brain-metastases-in-breast-cancer/abstract/6,19\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,19</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H22654193\"><span class=\"h1\">PRIMARY MANAGEMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The approach to the primary treatment of patients with brain metastasis is standard, regardless of primary cancer type, with options based on prognosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-brain-metastases-in-breast-cancer/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>].

Postoperative stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) or whole-brain radiation therapy (WBRT) is also indicated to reduce the risk of a recurrence. The <span class=\"nowrap\">N107C/CEC</span>.3 cooperative group study randomized patients with a variety of solid tumors who had surgical resection of a brain metastasis to either WBRT or SRS to the resection cavity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-brain-metastases-in-breast-cancer/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>].

Some experts recommend WBRT after SRS to reduce the risk of recurrences, but others do not. Several randomized studies have examined the outcome of patients with brain metastases from solid tumors after SRS either with or without WBRT [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-brain-metastases-in-breast-cancer/abstract/24-28\" class=\"abstract_t\">24-28</a>]. Collectively, these have demonstrated no difference in overall survival between arms. The groups receiving WBRT had lower rates of intracranial recurrence and less need for salvage treatment; however, this was counterbalanced by decrements in quality of life and neurocognition. Thus, many experts recommend SRS only as the preferred approach in patients presenting with one to four brain metastases.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>An alternative approach for those with HER2-positive metastatic disease and limited intracranial disease is initial systemic therapy.

Careful selection of patients is critical in this setting. As with the initial evaluation, the absence of active systemic disease and a Karnofsky Performance Score of at least 70 are important (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F77561\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef77561 \">table 2</a>).

All four patients were treated with steroids, with eventual clinical resolution of symptoms. Of note, one of four continued on trastuzumab emtansine and had worsening of symptoms. Ultimately, that patient had surgery for resection of a posterior fossa metastasis, and pathology revealed severe radionecrosis without viable tumor.

In historical series, the median survival for patients with brain metastases treated with whole-brain radiation therapy (WBRT) was less than six months [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-brain-metastases-in-breast-cancer/abstract/55,56\" class=\"abstract_t\">55,56</a>]. In contrast, a retrospective study of 112 breast cancer patients diagnosed with brain metastases between 1997 and 2007 showed a median survival of 14.4 months (for the entire cohort); among patients with human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-positive breast cancer, it was 23.1 months. This markedly exceeds median survival estimates from patients treated prior to the widespread use of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=trastuzumab-including-biosimilars-of-trastuzumab-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">trastuzumab</a> for metastatic, HER2-positive breast cancer (approximately three months), and therefore likely represents the effect of improved systemic control on breast cancer mortality [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-brain-metastases-in-breast-cancer/abstract/8,57\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,57</a>].
