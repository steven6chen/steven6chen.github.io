A key point is that routine prenatal sequencing as a diagnostic test is not currently supported due to insufficient validation data and limited knowledge about its benefits and pitfalls. However, sequencing may be performed on a case-by-case basis when a genetic disorder is suspected and sequencing can provide the confirmatory genetic diagnosis quickly and accurately. Fetal diagnostic sequencing is best done as a trio analysis (fetal and both parental samples are sequenced and analyzed together). We agree with the position statement.

No studies have found an association between the frequency of prenatal ultrasound exposure and risk of ASD. In a recent retrospective case-control study, which compared prenatal ultrasound exposure in children with ASD, developmental delay, and typical development, those with ASD had fewer prenatal ultrasound examinations and shorter durations of ultrasound and Doppler exposure than children in the two control groups [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/whats-new-in-obstetrics-and-gynecology/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Mean mechanical and thermal indices were similar in the three groups. Although the ASD and developmental delay groups had greater mean ultrasonographic penetration than children with typical development, the significance of this finding is unclear.

Two recent randomized trials reported discrepant outcomes, with one reporting that pessary placement reduced the incidence of sPTB &lt;34 weeks (7 versus 15 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/whats-new-in-obstetrics-and-gynecology/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>], whereas a similar trial found no benefit [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/whats-new-in-obstetrics-and-gynecology/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. The discordance may be related to differences in the underlying populations in the two trials, including the mean cervical length at randomization. Further study is warranted to clarify whether specific subgroups of patients with a short cervix may benefit from pessary placement. We do not prescribe pessaries for women with a short cervix.

In a review of meta-analyses of largely observational studies of multiple health outcomes, coffee consumption was more often associated with benefit than with harm [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/whats-new-in-obstetrics-and-gynecology/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. Drinking three to four cups of coffee per day was associated with the greatest benefit. Harmful associations were largely absent after adjustment for smoking except in pregnancy, where high consumption was associated with an increase in risk of low birth weight, preterm delivery, and pregnancy loss. Given the limitations of observational studies, UpToDate neither promotes nor discourages coffee consumption in nonpregnant adults but discourages more than 200 to 300 mg of caffeine intake per day in women who are pregnant or attempting to conceive. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=benefits-and-risks-of-caffeine-and-caffeinated-beverages\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Benefits and risks of caffeine and caffeinated beverages&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=the-effects-of-caffeine-on-reproductive-outcomes-in-women\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;The effects of caffeine on reproductive outcomes in women&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H115579\"><span class=\"h2\">Acetaminophen use in pregnancy and risk of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (November 2017)</span></p><p>Epidemiologic studies have reported an association between in utero <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acetaminophen-paracetamol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">acetaminophen</a> exposure and subsequent development of <span class=\"nowrap\">attention-deficit/hyperactivity</span> disorder (ADHD)-like behaviors, but data are inconclusive. Now, a study from Norway that adjusted for maternal use of acetaminophen before pregnancy, familial risk of ADHD, and indications for using acetaminophen reported no association between ADHD and use &lt;8 days, but an increased risk with use &gt;29 days [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/whats-new-in-obstetrics-and-gynecology/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. Moreover, paternal and maternal use of acetaminophen were similarly associated with ADHD risk. The authors hypothesized that paternal acetaminophen use before pregnancy may have male germ-line epigenetic effects. These data may reassure pregnant women with fever or pain who are considering short-term use of acetaminophen.

Recently updated Department of Health and Human Services perinatal guidelines now state that elvitegravir-cobicistat should not be selected as part of an initial antiretroviral regimen for treatment-na&iuml;ve pregnant women because of emerging data suggesting decreased drug levels during pregnancy and an associated risk of loss of virologic suppression [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/whats-new-in-obstetrics-and-gynecology/abstract/10,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,11</a>]. Furthermore, if an HIV-infected woman is already receiving a suppressive elvitegravir-cobicistat-containing regimen when she becomes pregnant, we suggest switching to a different regimen; if elvitegravir-cobicistat is continued, the potential risks and need for close viral monitoring should be discussed.

A common protocol is to perform an initial ultrasound examination four weeks from the suspected exposure, followed by serial ultrasound examinations every four weeks, ensuring that at least one ultrasound is performed between 28 and 33 weeks of gestation. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has updated its guidance for women with laboratory evidence of infection and now states that clinicians may consider extending the time interval between follow-up ultrasound examinations in accordance with patient preferences and clinical judgment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/whats-new-in-obstetrics-and-gynecology/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. In women with possible exposure during pregnancy but no laboratory evidence of infection, ultrasound screening beyond that obtained for routine prenatal care is no longer recommended. We agree with these recommendations.

In two parallel open-label trials, 325 women (215 pregnant, 110 planning pregnancy) with type 1 diabetes receiving intensive insulin therapy were randomly assigned to either CGM plus capillary glucose monitoring or capillary glucose monitoring alone [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/whats-new-in-obstetrics-and-gynecology/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. In women planning pregnancy, glycemic control at the end of the trial was similar in both groups. In pregnant women, glycemic control and some newborn outcomes (eg, frequency of hypoglycemia, large for gestational age) were better in the CGM group. Although the improvement in neonatal hypoglycemia with CGM appears promising, the lack of blinding may have biased decisions regarding neonatal management. Also, it is unclear whether the high level of maternal compliance with CGM in this trial could be achieved in other populations.

In a prospective population-based study, when FGR was diagnosed at 21 to 25 weeks, only 34 to 51 percent of offspring were live born and survived to discharge, and only 27 to 43 percent were live born and survived to discharge without severe morbidity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/whats-new-in-obstetrics-and-gynecology/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. Over 20 percent of the deaths were due to pregnancy termination and 77 percent of the cohort had birth weight &lt;3<sup>rd</sup> percentile. These data illustrate the poor prognosis for early severe FGR and are useful for prenatal counseling.

The United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported an approximately 18 percent increase in the rate of primary and secondary syphilis (the most infectious stages of the disease) in 2016, with 8.7 cases per 100,000 population, the highest rate since 1993 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/whats-new-in-obstetrics-and-gynecology/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. More than 600 cases of congenital syphilis were also reported. Although syphilis rates increased among men and women, the rise was primarily attributable to men who have sex with men (MSM). These findings stress the importance of screening and treatment for sexually transmitted infection, especially in MSM and pregnant women.

One exception is a case-control study of a possible increase in spontaneous abortion among the subgroup of women vaccinated with two consecutive pH1N1-containing vaccines during the 2010-2011 and 2011-2012 seasons [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/whats-new-in-obstetrics-and-gynecology/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. This study had several limitations that might have influenced the findings, and further confirmation is needed. We continue to strongly recommend routine influenza vaccination with trivalent or quadrivalent <a href=\"topic.htm?path=influenza-virus-vaccine-inactivated-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">inactivated influenza vaccine</a>, as the benefits outweigh any risks.

A recent meta-analysis reported that TDF increased neonatal mortality, and an accompanying British Medical Journal clinical practice guideline thus suggested <a href=\"topic.htm?path=zidovudine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">zidovudine</a> rather than TDF for HIV-infected pregnant women [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/whats-new-in-obstetrics-and-gynecology/abstract/17,18\" class=\"abstract_t\">17,18</a>]. This conclusion was based on a single trial from Africa in which TDF-based ART resulted in higher rates of very preterm birth (&lt;34 weeks) and neonatal mortality compared with zidovudine-based ART (each given with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lopinavir-and-ritonavir-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">lopinavir-ritonavir</a>), but not compared with zidovudine alone [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/whats-new-in-obstetrics-and-gynecology/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. Given uncertainties regarding the trial results, potential interactions between TDF and lopinavir-ritonavir, and observational data suggesting safety of other TDF-containing regimens in pregnancy, we do not believe the evidence is clear enough to stop using TDF as a preferred agent (although we do not initiate TDF and lopinavir-ritonavir containing regimens during pregnancy). The British HIV Association also released a statement consistent with our position [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/whats-new-in-obstetrics-and-gynecology/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>].
