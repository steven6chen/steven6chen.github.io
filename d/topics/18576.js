Prinzmetal, et al [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vasospastic-angina/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>] initially described a clinical syndrome that manifested as rest angina associated with ST-segment elevation that promptly responded to sublingual nitrates. Since this differed to the classical angina described by Heberden (effort angina associated with ST depression) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vasospastic-angina/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>], he referred to it as &ldquo;variant angina.&rdquo; With the advent of coronary angiography, subsequent studies confirmed Prinzmetal&rsquo;s original suspicion that variant angina was attributable to coronary artery spasm but also demonstrated that episodes could be associated with ST-segment depression. Consequently, the term &quot;vasospastic angina&quot; evolved. This topic will discuss all aspects of vasospastic angina; other forms of (cardiac) angina are discussed in separate topic reviews. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=stable-ischemic-heart-disease-overview-of-care\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Stable ischemic heart disease: Overview of care&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=classification-of-unstable-angina-and-non-st-elevation-myocardial-infarction#H3\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Classification of unstable angina and non-ST elevation myocardial infarction&quot;, section on 'Classification of unstable angina'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cardiac-syndrome-x-angina-pectoris-with-normal-coronary-arteries\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Cardiac syndrome X: Angina pectoris with normal coronary arteries&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H349868495\"><span class=\"h1\">DIAGNOSTIC CRITERIA</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Within the literature, there have been a variety of definitions for vasospastic angina, leading to confusion. Consequently, the Coronary Vasomotion Disorders International Study group (COVADIS) has published diagnostic criteria for vasospastic angina (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F104888\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef104888 \">table 1</a>)<sup> </sup>[<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vasospastic-angina/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. There are three core elements establishing the diagnosis of vasospastic angina, including nitrate-responsive angina, transient ischemic electrocardiographic (ECG) changes, and angiographic evidence of coronary artery spasm. In patients with a documented spontaneous episode, the diagnosis can be made on the basis of nitrate-responsive angina with associated transient ECG changes. Occasionally, a spontaneous episode may occur during diagnostic angiography so that all three elements may be documented. However, when typical spontaneous episodes cannot often be documented, provocative testing is undertaken to make the diagnosis. During provocation testing, the diagnosis of vasospastic angina is confirmed if the provocative stimulus induced chest pain, transient ECG changes, and a &gt;90 percent constrictor response.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h1\">PATHOGENESIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Vasospastic angina is caused by focal or diffuse spasm (of the smooth muscle layer of the arterial wall) of an epicardial coronary artery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vasospastic-angina/abstract/4,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,5</a>], resulting in a high-grade obstruction. Transient myocardial ischemia causes angina in many patients; myocardial infarction may develop in some if spasm is persistent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vasospastic-angina/abstract/1,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,6</a>]. Vascular smooth muscle hyper-reactivity is thought to be central to the pathogenesis of vasospastic angina [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vasospastic-angina/abstract/1,4,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,4,5</a>].</p><p>Spasm may occur in the absence of any preceding increase in myocardial oxygen demand (eg, exercise) and in normal or diseased vessels. Original descriptions reported anatomically focal spasm sites but increasingly diffuse spasm is being described [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vasospastic-angina/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. Spasm can occur in angiographically normal coronary vessels but more commonly at the site of atherosclerotic plaques of variable severity. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H190313768\"><span class=\"h2\">Vascular smooth muscle hyper-reactivity</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Animal and clinical studies have implicated coronary vascular smooth muscle hyper-reactivity as a key factor in the pathogenesis of coronary artery spasm. Important observations include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Multiple vasoconstrictors have been used to provoke coronary spasm including acetylcholine, serotonin, histamine, noradrenaline, and dopamine, suggesting that a single receptor pathway cannot explain the phenomenon [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vasospastic-angina/abstract/4,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,5</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Receptor antagonists (eg, ketanserin and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prazosin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">prazosin</a>) do not inhibit spasm [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vasospastic-angina/abstract/8,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,9</a>].

Episodes of vasospastic angina occur more often from midnight to early morning (when vagal tone is higher). Heart rate variability studies have shown that increased vagal tone and hyperreactivity to sympathetic stimulation occur in vasospastic angina patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vasospastic-angina/abstract/14,22\" class=\"abstract_t\">14,22</a>]. These observations are supported by the observation that surgical sympathetic denervation may be an effective therapy in medically refractory patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vasospastic-angina/abstract/19,23\" class=\"abstract_t\">19,23</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Endothelial dysfunction</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Endothelial dysfunction may be a predisposing factor but is not likely the sole reason for coronary spasm, given that typical coronary spasm is an uncommon condition, whereas endothelial dysfunction is common.

In a study of 55 patients, epicardial spasm was provoked by maximal doses of intracoronary acetylcholine [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vasospastic-angina/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>]. In 14 of these patients, submaximal doses of acetylcholine provoked myocardial ischemia, documented by the development of chest pain, ischemic (electrocardiogram) ECG changes, and lactate production, in the absence of large epicardial spasm. These patients were predominantly women with a history of prolonged (&gt;30 min) chest pain.

This interesting concept requires further investigation since the current data are limited to isolated case reports. Whether Kounis Syndrome represents a distinct clinical entity or an extreme expression of conventional vasospasm, plaque rupture and thrombosis that expands our understanding of coronary pathophysiology remains to be determined.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H28463569\"><span class=\"h1\">EPIDEMIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The prevalence of vasospastic angina is not well studied. It appears to be more frequent in individuals from Japan compared to Caucasian populations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vasospastic-angina/abstract/50\" class=\"abstract_t\">50</a>]. The diagnosis is more often made in individuals less than 50 years of age than in older people.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H110738375\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL PRESENTATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients with vasospastic angina typically present with a chronic pattern of recurrent episodes of chest pain. The quality of the chest pain is indistinguishable from classical angina pectoris associated with obstructive coronary artery disease; however, the context in which it occurs differs. In particular, patients with vasospastic angina report that their episodes are predominantly at rest and that many occur from midnight to early morning, while effort tolerance is usually preserved [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vasospastic-angina/abstract/51\" class=\"abstract_t\">51</a>]. Each episode of chest pain generally lasts 5 to 15 minutes but episodes may last longer in some cases that are refractory to initial medical therapy. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=outpatient-evaluation-of-the-adult-with-chest-pain#H1220523363\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Outpatient evaluation of the adult with chest pain&quot;, section on 'Etiologies'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=angina-pectoris-chest-pain-caused-by-myocardial-ischemia#H358110160\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Angina pectoris: Chest pain caused by myocardial ischemia&quot;, section on 'History'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=outpatient-evaluation-of-the-adult-with-chest-pain#H1220523825\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Outpatient evaluation of the adult with chest pain&quot;, section on 'History'</a>.)</p><p>Episodes of chest pain due to myocardial ischemia (angina), including those with vasospastic angina, tend to be similar to each other. The following are some characteristic features, irrespective of whether the mechanism is fixed obstruction or spasm:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>&quot;Discomfort&quot; is more often given as a descriptor than &quot;pain.&quot; Other common descriptors include squeezing, tightness, pressure, constriction, strangling, burning, heart burn, fullness in the chest, a band-like sensation, knot in the center of the chest, lump in the throat, ache, and heavy weight on chest.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Each episode is typically gradual in onset and offset.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>There is no change in the quality of pain with respiration or position.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The patient may have some difficulty in describing the location of the pain, although the substernal location is common. Radiation to the neck, throat, lower jaw, teeth, upper extremity, or shoulder is common.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>During each episode, symptoms of nausea, sweating, dizziness, dyspnea, and palpitations may be present.</p><p/><p>Despite the similarities in the description of the pain between patients with vasospastic angina and those with other causes of myocardial ischemia, the history may differ and thus provide some evidence to support the diagnosis of the former [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vasospastic-angina/abstract/52\" class=\"abstract_t\">52</a>]: </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients with vasospastic angina are often younger and exhibit fewer classic cardiovascular risk factors (except for cigarette smoking) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vasospastic-angina/abstract/53\" class=\"abstract_t\">53</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Vasospastic angina may be associated with other vasospastic disorders, such as Raynaud's phenomenon and migraine headache or its treatment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vasospastic-angina/abstract/54-56\" class=\"abstract_t\">54-56</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A history of drug abuse (such as cocaine) may be present. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Hyperventilation can precipitate attacks of vasospastic angina [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vasospastic-angina/abstract/57\" class=\"abstract_t\">57</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Exercise does not usually provoke an episode of spasm [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vasospastic-angina/abstract/58,59\" class=\"abstract_t\">58,59</a>]. However, among patients who are very symptomatic during a &ldquo;hot phase&rdquo; of the condition, characterized by more frequent and intense episodes, spasm may be triggered by the elevated catecholamines associated with exercise. </p><p/><p>Although a physical examination should be performed to establish baseline information regarding the cardiovascular system, there are no findings characteristic for vasospastic angina. However, during an episode, tachycardia, hypertension, diaphoresis, and a gallop rhythm may be present. Bradycardia and hypotension can be observed if the sinus nodal, atrioventricular nodal, and right ventricular arteries are involved during proximal right coronary artery vasospasm.</p><p>A 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG) should be performed in all patients with a history of chest pain. The ECG is usually normal between episodes in patients with vasospastic angina. For patients evaluated during an acute spontaneous episode, ECG may reveal transient ST-segment elevation or depression in multiple leads. (See <a href=\"#H10492235\" class=\"local\">'12-lead ECG'</a> below.) These individuals need to have myocardial infarction ruled out with serial troponin testing. In most cases, troponin values are in the normal range in patients with vasospastic angina, due to the relatively short duration of myocardial ischemia. </p><p>As with stable angina from fixed obstructive coronary artery disease, asymptomatic episodes occur. In one study of over 1000 episodes in 240 patients, 92 percent of ischemic episodes were asymptomatic [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vasospastic-angina/abstract/60\" class=\"abstract_t\">60</a>]. The role of screening for asymptomatic episodes is discussed below. (See <a href=\"#H110740314\" class=\"local\">'Ambulatory ECG monitoring'</a> below.)</p><p>In one cohort study, there were 188 patients who presented with aborted sudden cardiac death and 1844 without, suggesting that nearly 10 percent of vasospastic angina patients present with sudden cardiac death [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vasospastic-angina/abstract/61\" class=\"abstract_t\">61</a>].

Patients with vasospastic angina may have transient ST-segment elevation or depression. In addition, a &ldquo;baseline&rdquo; ECG should be obtained at a time when the patient is not having pain. </p><p>For most patients with anginal type chest pain who do not have documented transient ischemic ST changes on 12-lead ECG, the evaluation should first focus on fixed obstructive coronary artery disease. Many of these individuals may be referred for a stress ECG test. (See <a href=\"#H28462746\" class=\"local\">'Role of stress testing'</a> below and <a href=\"#H110739513\" class=\"local\">'Differential diagnosis'</a> below.)</p><p>If this evaluation has reasonably excluded significant obstructive coronary artery disease, an ambulatory ECG should be performed. If transient ischemic ST changes are found on ambulatory monitoring, we recommend coronary arteriography to exclude significant coronary artery disease. (See <a href=\"#H11389111\" class=\"local\">'Role of coronary arteriography'</a> below.) If the ambulatory monitor does not reveal transient ischemic ST changes at the time of chest pain, the diagnosis of vasospastic angina is less likely. </p><p>We believe that vasospastic angina is underdiagnosed for two main reasons:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Some patients do not present with typical symptoms of either stable ischemic heart disease due to fixed obstruction or vasospastic angina. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Many clinicians are not sufficiently familiar with vasospastic angina to consider it as a diagnostic possibility.

Unlike most other causes of chest pain and ischemic ST changes, the ST-segment returns to baseline rapidly upon resolution of symptoms. Occasionally, a transient period of T wave inversion may be seen before return of the ECG to baseline.</p><p>Other reported electrocardiographic abnormalities include a tall and broad R wave, disappearance of the S wave, a taller T wave, and negative U waves [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vasospastic-angina/abstract/60\" class=\"abstract_t\">60</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H110740314\"><span class=\"h2\">Ambulatory ECG monitoring</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Ambulatory ECG monitoring can detect episodes of ST-segment <span class=\"nowrap\">elevation/depression</span> with or without angina and should be performed in patients in whom the diagnosis is being considered. The finding of transient ischemic ST changes on the ambulatory monitor, combined with a typical history, may confirm the diagnosis. Since episodes of vasospastic angina may be infrequent, longer-term monitoring (7 to 14 days) with an event recorder or even an implantable loop recorder may be required to make the diagnosis. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ambulatory-ecg-monitoring\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Ambulatory ECG monitoring&quot;</a>.)</p><p>In addition to helping with the diagnosis, ambulatory monitoring should be performed to assess the efficacy of therapy, given that asymptomatic episodes are common and sometimes associated with significant arrhythmias [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vasospastic-angina/abstract/62\" class=\"abstract_t\">62</a>].

These agents prevent vasoconstriction and promote vasodilation in the coronary vasculature, thereby alleviating symptoms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vasospastic-angina/abstract/76\" class=\"abstract_t\">76</a>].

Thus, we begin with a calcium channel blocker (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diltiazem-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">diltiazem</a> at a dose of 240 to 360 mg per day), as this therapy is effective in alleviating symptoms in over 90 percent of patients in an observational study of nearly 300 patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vasospastic-angina/abstract/78\" class=\"abstract_t\">78</a>]. Higher doses of calcium channel blocker (eg, diltiazem up to a dose of 960 mg per day) have been utilized in patients with refractory vasospastic angina [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vasospastic-angina/abstract/79\" class=\"abstract_t\">79</a>]. </p><p>The long-acting nitrates are also effective in alleviating symptoms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vasospastic-angina/abstract/80\" class=\"abstract_t\">80</a>], but the occurrence of nitrate tolerance makes them a less desirable first-line approach (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nitrates-in-the-management-of-stable-angina-pectoris#H6\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Nitrates in the management of stable angina pectoris&quot;, section on 'Nitrate tolerance'</a>). In addition, some research raises questions over the long-term efficacy of nitrate therapy in patients with vasospastic angina. In an observational study of 1429 individuals with vasospastic angina, of whom more than 90 percent were&nbsp;receiving treatment with a calcium channel blocker,&nbsp;a propensity score-matched analysis found that the cumulative incidence of major adverse cardiac events (cardiac death, non-fatal myocardial infarction, hospitalization due to unstable angina, and heart failure and appropriate implantable cardioverter defibrillator shocks)&nbsp;was similar in patients receiving nitrate treatment and those receiving no nitrate therapy&nbsp;(11 verus 8 percent at five years; hazard ratio [HR] 1.28, 95% CI 0.72&ndash;2.28) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vasospastic-angina/abstract/81\" class=\"abstract_t\">81</a>]. Although nicorandil, one of the nitrate-like agents used in the study,&nbsp;had a neutral&nbsp;effect on clinical events&nbsp;(HR: 0.80; 95% CI 0.28&ndash;2.27), multivariable analysis&nbsp;showed a deleterious effect of&nbsp;the&nbsp;concomitant use of&nbsp;nitrates and nicorandil (HR 2.14; 95% CI 1.02&ndash;4.47). Thus, the long-term&nbsp;administration of nitrates&nbsp;may not improve&nbsp;prognosis in&nbsp;vasospastic angina patients who receive treatment with&nbsp;calcium channel blockers.&nbsp;Moreover, the concomitant use of more than one&nbsp;nitrate&nbsp;formulation may&nbsp;increase the&nbsp;risk for cardiac events in these patients. The non-randomized nature of these analyses makes interpretation of these findings difficult since patients with more active vasospastic angina may have been selectively prescribed the incremental nitrate therapy.&nbsp;</p><p>For patients who do not have acceptable improvement in symptoms on calcium channel blocker therapy, we add a long-acting nitrate (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=isosorbide-mononitrate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">isosorbide mononitrate</a> 30 or 60 mg once daily). </p><p>Treatment with guanethidine, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clonidine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">clonidine</a>, or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cilostazol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cilostazol</a> have been reported to be of benefit in patients taking a calcium channel blocker [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vasospastic-angina/abstract/82,83\" class=\"abstract_t\">82,83</a>].

In an observational study of 23 patients with vasospastic angina in whom an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) was placed for a documented ventricular arrhythmia, all patients were alive during a median follow-up of 2.1 years (four ventricular fibrillations and one episode of pulseless electrical activity occurred in five patients) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vasospastic-angina/abstract/98\" class=\"abstract_t\">98</a>]. </p><p>For patients with sudden cardiac arrest and vasospastic angina, we often suggest placement of an ICD, since it is often difficult to prove that the coronary vasospasm predated or was the trigger for the arrest. </p><p>For patients with high risk features such as obstructive coronary artery disease, large ST-segment elevations, focal proximal epicardial coronary artery spasm, increased vasospastic and arrhythmic activity, and multivessel coronary artery spasm who are on maximal or submaximal doses of calcium channel blockers (CCB), our experts refer the patient for placement of an ICD. For patients without such high risk features who are on submaximal doses of CCB, some of our experts maximize CCB and refer the patient for an ICD, while others maximize the dose of CCB and monitor the patient carefully for ventricular arrhythmia. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H25\"><span class=\"h1\">PROGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In general, the long-term prognosis of patients with vasospastic angina is good, particularly in patients receiving medical therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vasospastic-angina/abstract/94,99\" class=\"abstract_t\">94,99</a>]. Survival at five years may be as high as 94 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vasospastic-angina/abstract/94,99-101\" class=\"abstract_t\">94,99-101</a>]. Independent predictors of infarct-free survival include (a) lack of extensive and severe of CAD, (b) absence of multi-vessel spasm, and (c) use of calcium channel blockers. Studies have also described a persistence of symptoms with a study reporting that half the patients continue to experience angina at three years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vasospastic-angina/abstract/100\" class=\"abstract_t\">100</a>].</p><p>Patients with vasospastic angina who also have obstructive coronary artery disease have a worse prognosis that is, in large part, determined by the severity of the underlying disease. In a study of vasospastic angina patients with one-vessel disease or a stenosis of 70 percent or less in any major coronary artery, one- and five-year survival rates of 99 and 95 percent were seen, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vasospastic-angina/abstract/95\" class=\"abstract_t\">95</a>]. By comparison, patients with multivessel disease had one- and five-year survival rates of 87 and 77 percent. </p><p>A 2015 retrospective study of 1760 patients with typical or atypical angina-like chest pain who underwent acetylcholine (Ach)-provocation testing found that Ach-provoked spasm at sites of significant organic stenosis was a predictor of major adverse cardiac events at five years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vasospastic-angina/abstract/102\" class=\"abstract_t\">102</a>]. Patients whose spasm was remote to a tight stenosis or in the absence of any tight stenosis had a better prognosis.</p><p>Patients who experience an arrhythmic complication, especially ventricular fibrillation and sudden cardiac arrest, during an episode of spasm have a poor prognosis. Medical therapy with a calcium channel blocker in survivors of sudden cardiac arrest due to spasm may not be sufficient, since this therapy reduces, but it does not prevent, episodes of spasm. Two small studies of such patients treated medically have provided contradictory information. One series of seven patients with ventricular tachycardia or fibrillation due to ergonovine-documented spasm found that six patients remained free of symptoms on calcium channel blockers after an average follow-up of 58 months [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vasospastic-angina/abstract/103\" class=\"abstract_t\">103</a>]. In contrast, in another series, eight patients treated with calcium channel blockers had recurrent ventricular arrhythmia after a median of 15 months. An implantable cardioverter-defibrillator was inserted in seven of these patients; four patients received an appropriate shock during follow-up [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vasospastic-angina/abstract/104\" class=\"abstract_t\">104</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H186155554\" class=\"local\">'Arrhythmias'</a> above.) </p><p>Data comparing vasospastic angina patients with and without aborted sudden cardiac arrest (ASCA) suggest a worse prognosis in those with ASCA. In this retrospective, observational cohort study, the incidence of cardiac death at 7.5 years was significantly higher in those with ASCA at presentation than those without (24.1 versus 2.7 per 1000 patients-years; hazard ratio 7.26, 95% CI 4.21-12.5) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vasospastic-angina/abstract/61\" class=\"abstract_t\">61</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-sudden-cardiac-arrest-and-sudden-cardiac-death\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of sudden cardiac arrest and sudden cardiac death&quot;</a>.)</p><p>A prognostic risk score for vasospastic angina was developed using information on 1429 patients in a Japanese registry [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vasospastic-angina/abstract/105\" class=\"abstract_t\">105</a>]. During a median follow-up of 32 months, 5.9 percent reached the primary major adverse cardiovascular event (MACE) combined end point (cardiac death, nonfatal MI, unstable angina, heart failure, or implantable cardioverter defibrillator shock). Of these, 1 percent suffered death or nonfatal MI. Seven significant predictors of MACE (smoking, angina at rest alone, history of out-of-hospital cardiac arrest, organic coronary stenosis, multivessel spasm, ST-segment elevation during angina, and beta-blocker use) were identified and from them a risk prediction score (Japanese Coronary Spasm Association clinical risk score) was created. Low-, intermediate-, and high-risk patients were defined based on the score and the incidence of MACE in these groups were 2.5, 7.0, and 13.0 percent, respectively. Findings in this study are of interest, but we do not recommend routine use of this risk score until external validation and utility have been established. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H725820446\"><span class=\"h1\">SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Vasospastic angina is characterized by spontaneous episodes of angina in association with transient ischemic ST changes on the electrocardiogram (ECG). The cause is a transient, abrupt, and marked reduction in the luminal diameter of an epicardial coronary artery due to spasm, leading to transient myocardial ischemia. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Diagnostic criteria for vasospastic angina include: (1) nitrate-responsive angina, typically occurring at rest and often at night; (2) associated transient ischemic ST changes such as transient ST-segment elevation or depression; and (3) coronary artery spasm on angiography defined as &gt;90 percent constriction.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients with vasospastic angina typically present with a chronic pattern of episodes of chest pain, with each episode having many of the characteristics of angina seen in patients with obstructive coronary artery disease. However, patients with vasospastic angina will report that their episodes are predominantly at rest and that many occur from midnight to early morning. Each episode of rest pain generally lasts 5 to 15 minutes. Patients with vasospastic angina typically have ischemic ST-segment changes on an ECG during an episode of chest discomfort, which returns to baseline on symptom resolution. This finding can be detected on a 12-lead or ambulatory ECG. (See <a href=\"#H110738375\" class=\"local\">'Clinical presentation'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For most patients presenting with anginal chest pain (including those with episodes predominantly at rest) and no transient ischemic ST changes on ECG, we recommend an evaluation for fixed obstructive coronary artery disease prior to an evaluation directed at vasospastic angina. If significant fixed obstructive disease is reasonably excluded, the diagnosis of vasospastic angina can be pursued. This usually starts with ambulatory ECG monitoring. (See <a href=\"#H8\" class=\"local\">'Diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We recommend diagnostic coronary arteriography for most patients in whom the diagnosis is likely or secured (based on a typical history and findings of ST-segment elevation on ECG). (See <a href=\"#H8\" class=\"local\">'Diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Arrhythmias and myocardial infarction are potentially life-threatening complications of vasospastic angina. (See <a href=\"#H186155540\" class=\"local\">'Complications'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients without obstructive coronary disease have a good long-term prognosis. (See <a href=\"#H25\" class=\"local\">'Prognosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Management of vasospastic angina includes cessation of smoking and pharmacologic therapy (especially the use of calcium channel blockers). For patients with vasospastic angina: </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>We suggest initiating therapy with a calcium channel blocker (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). All calcium channel blockers appear effective; we often start with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diltiazem-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">diltiazem</a> at a dose of 240 to 360 mg per day. (See <a href=\"#H17\" class=\"local\">'Management'</a> above.) <br/><br/>Higher doses can be utilized in patients with refractory spasm.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>We suggest the use of sublingual <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nitroglycerin-glyceryl-trinitrate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">nitroglycerin</a> to abort episodes of angina in an attempt to decrease the frequency of myocardial infarction and life-threatening arrhythmia associated with these episodes (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). (See <a href=\"#H186155540\" class=\"local\">'Complications'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Long-acting nitrates may be useful in controlling angina symptoms but may not protect against major adverse cardiac events.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Nonselective beta blockers, such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=propranolol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">propranolol</a> should be <strong>avoided</strong>. In addition, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aspirin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">aspirin</a> should be used with caution, since at high doses it is an inhibitor of prostacyclin production. </p></div><div id=\"topicAgreement\">Use of UpToDate is subject to the <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/legal/license\" class=\"licenseLink\" id=\"sla_in_page\">Subscription and License Agreement</a>.</div><div id=\"references\" class=\"headingAnchor\"><h1>REFERENCES</h1><ol id=\"reference\"><li><a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vasospastic-angina/abstract/1\" class=\"nounderline abstract_t\">PRINZMETAL M, KENNAMER R, MERLISS R, et al.
