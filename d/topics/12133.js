The optimal route of delivery of a fetus presenting in the cephalic position is controversial, and no prospective randomized trials have been performed to determine the risks and benefits of labor and vaginal delivery for these infants in the absence of standard indications for cesarean delivery (eg, breech presentation, previous transfundal incision, placenta previa).</p><p>One retrospective study addressed this question by comparing the outcome of 47 infants with a prenatal diagnosis of isolated myelomeningocele without severe hydrocephalus, delivered by cesarean before labor, to a historic cohort of 113 infants with myelomeningocele diagnosed after delivery (35 delivered by cesarean after a period of labor and 78 delivered vaginally) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/open-neural-tube-defects-risk-factors-prenatal-screening-and-diagnosis-and-pregnancy-management/abstract/75\" class=\"abstract_t\">75</a>].

Cesarean delivery is indicated in cases in which the head circumference is increased and vaginal delivery is thought not to be possible because of dystocia. The cut-off for determining when a cesarean delivery is indicated will vary with gestational age at delivery, the absolute and relative head circumference (HC) and the size of the maternal pelvis. Abdominal delivery to avoid cephalopelvic disproportion is reasonable when the HC &gt;40 cm or the biparietal diameter &ge;12 cm.

The risk of recurrence appears to be higher in countries such as Ireland where the occurrence (prevalence) of NTDs is high [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/open-neural-tube-defects-risk-factors-prenatal-screening-and-diagnosis-and-pregnancy-management/abstract/87\" class=\"abstract_t\">87</a>]. Recurrence is likely related to a multifactorial inheritance pattern, including genetic and environmental risk factors.</p><p>The recurrence risk for anencephaly is estimated at 2 to 5 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/open-neural-tube-defects-risk-factors-prenatal-screening-and-diagnosis-and-pregnancy-management/abstract/88\" class=\"abstract_t\">88</a>]. Isolated encephaloceles are not familial; however, encephaloceles may be part of specific genetic syndromes if there are associated anomalies; the inheritance pattern is autosomal recessive in these cases. As an example, the risk of recurrence for an encephalocele with Meckel Gruber syndrome (posterior encephalocele, cleft palate, and polydactyly) is 25 percent secondary to known autosomal recessive inheritance.</p><p>Testing for <em>MTHFR</em> polymorphisms is&nbsp;<strong>not</strong>&nbsp;recommended as routine&nbsp;<a href=\"topic.htm?path=folic-acid-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">folic acid</a>&nbsp;supplementation at 0.<span class=\"nowrap\">4&nbsp;mg/day&nbsp;will</span> adequately increase red cell and serum folate concentrations whether or not the woman has a polymorphism (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=folic-acid-supplementation-in-pregnancy#H2882965751\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Folic acid supplementation in pregnancy&quot;, section on 'Other populations (obesity, MTHFR polymorphism)'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H27\"><span class=\"h1\">PREVENTION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=folic-acid-supplementation-in-pregnancy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Folic acid supplementation in pregnancy&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1663349678\"><span class=\"h1\">SOCIETY GUIDELINE LINKS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Links to society and government-sponsored guidelines from selected countries and regions around the world are provided separately.

Open NTDs comprise 80 percent of NTDs; the most common open NTDs are myelomeningocele (spina bifida), meningocele, encephalocele, and anencephaly. (See <a href=\"#H1944028399\" class=\"local\">'Types of neural tube defects'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Most isolated open NTDs appear to be caused by folate deficiency, likely in combination with genetic or other environmental risk factors. (See <a href=\"#H1089579148\" class=\"local\">'Folate deficiency'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Open NTDs have also been associated with some fetal syndromes, amniotic band sequence, hyperthermia in early pregnancy, pregestational diabetes, and obesity. (See <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'Etiology and risk factors'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>All pregnant women should be offered screening for open NTDs. Screening and early diagnosis of affected pregnancies allows couples the option of pregnancy termination or an opportunity to prepare for the birth of an affected child. Fetal surgery may be an option in rare cases. (See <a href=\"#H606090982\" class=\"local\">'Candidates'</a> above and <a href=\"#H2115402922\" class=\"local\">'Rationale for prenatal screening'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We perform ultrasound screening for NTDs (ideally at 18 to 20 weeks) because it appears to detect more open NTDs than maternal serum alpha-fetoprotein (MSAFP) screening. If optimal images of the fetal spine or intracranial anatomy are not obtained (eg, fetal position or maternal obesity) or high quality ultrasound examination is unavailable, MSAFP screening should be offered. (See <a href=\"#H1869105300\" class=\"local\">'Choice of test'</a> above and <a href=\"#H606091073\" class=\"local\">'Ultrasound examination'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For maternal serum alpha-fetoprotein (MSAFP) screening, the American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics reports the detection rate for anencephaly is &ge;95 percent at 2.0 or 2.5 multiples of the median (MoMs). For open spina bifida, the detection rate at 2.0 MoMs is 75 to 90 percent versus 65 to 80 percent at 2.5 MoMs, with false-positive rates&nbsp;of 2 to 5 percent and 1 to 3 percent, respectively. (See <a href=\"#H4055020500\" class=\"local\">'NTD detection rate'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In women with an elevated MSAFP, an ultrasound examination is performed to further assess whether an open NTD or another anomaly associated with elevated MSAFP levels is present, as well as to confirm gestational age, fetal viability, and number of fetuses. (See <a href=\"#H1902864778\" class=\"local\">'Follow-up of screen positive MSAFP results'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a high-risk population, ultrasound examination has been reported to detect 92 to 95 percent of spina bifida and 100 percent of anencephaly. Detection of NTDs on ultrasound examination depends upon the size and location of the defect, the position of the fetus, the volume of amniotic fluid, maternal habitus (maternal obesity decreases detection rates), and the skill and equipment of the <span class=\"nowrap\">sonographer/sonologist</span>. (See <a href=\"#H606091073\" class=\"local\">'Ultrasound examination'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>When an NTD is detected on ultrasound examination, the obstetrical provider should (see <a href=\"#H25\" class=\"local\">'Fetal evaluation'</a> above and <a href=\"#H993147873\" class=\"local\">'Parental counseling and referrals'</a> above):</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Assess for associated fetal abnormalities, including magnetic resonance imaging when needed to confirm uncertain ultrasound findings or better define the level of the open NTD, and to <span class=\"nowrap\">exclude/detect</span> central nervous system abnormalities when this information will affect pregnancy management.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Offer fetal karyotype or microarray because of the increased incidence of chromosomal abnormalities.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Discuss reproductive options: pregnancy termination or continuation.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Refer parents to a spina bifida clinic to discuss postnatal management, possible interventions, and prognosis. Also facilitate a connection with other parents of affected children.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Discuss possible referral for fetal surgery for myelomeningocele, which is performed in highly selected cases in a few specialized centers. (See <a href=\"#H1669142009\" class=\"local\">'Consider fetal surgery for myelomeningocele'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Serial ultrasound examinations are performed to assess the size of the fetal head, appearance of associated Chiari malformation, the size of the ventricles, and the size of the open NTD. This information can inform delivery planning. The optimum frequency is unclear, but monthly examinations until delivery are reasonable. We also obtain nonstress tests in the third trimester. (See <a href=\"#H4248433917\" class=\"local\">'Fetal monitoring'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Delivery should occur at term at a center with a level III or above neonatal intensive care unit, pediatric neurosurgery services, and other personnel experienced in the neonatal management of these infants. Ideally, latex-free gloves and equipment are used during delivery and subsequent care of the infant. (See <a href=\"#H3309506409\" class=\"local\">'Myelomeningocele'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Because no study has definitively shown advantages of cesarean delivery for fetuses with myelomeningocele, we believe vaginal delivery is reasonable if the head is near normal size, the meningocele is unlikely to cause dystocia, and there are no obstetrical indications for cesarean. Cesarean delivery is indicated in cases in which the head circumference is increased and vaginal delivery is thought not to be possible because of dystocia. The cut-off for determining when a cesarean delivery is indicated will vary with gestational age at delivery, the absolute and relative head circumference (HC) and the size of the maternal pelvis. Abdominal delivery to avoid cephalopelvic disproportion is reasonable when the HC &gt;40 cm or the biparietal diameter &ge;12 cm. (See <a href=\"#H3309506409\" class=\"local\">'Myelomeningocele'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The risk of recurrent open NTDs according to family history is illustrated in the table (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F63266\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef63266 \">table 2</a>).
