These changes alter normal hematopoietic growth and differentiation, resulting in an accumulation of large numbers of abnormal, immature myeloid cells in the bone marrow and peripheral blood. These cells are capable of dividing and proliferating, but cannot differentiate into mature hematopoietic cells (ie, neutrophils).</p><p>Similar to other malignancies, the genetic alterations in AML include mutation of oncogenes as well as the loss of tumor suppressor genes. In contrast to most solid tumors, many hematologic malignancies are associated with a single characteristic cytogenetic abnormality (eg, the Philadelphia chromosome [t(9;22)] in chronic myeloid leukemia and t(15;17) in acute promyelocytic leukemia).</p><p>Advances in the identification of recurring chromosomal abnormalities and translocations have provided major insight into the pathobiology of AML. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tools-for-genetics-and-genomics-cytogenetics-and-molecular-genetics\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Tools for genetics and genomics: Cytogenetics and molecular genetics&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Specific cytogenetic abnormalities identified by karyotype analysis have considerable prognostic significance for patients with AML and affect treatment planning (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F80216\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef80216 \">table 1</a>). Abnormalities in certain genes (eg, mutations in <em>FLT3, nucleophosmin, KIT</em>) as well as gene expression profiles confer prognostic significance in adult patients with AML. Even those patients without obvious abnormalities detected by karyotypic analysis or gene expression profiles have acquired copy number alterations that may help to identify genes important for the pathogenesis of AML [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/molecular-genetics-of-acute-myeloid-leukemia/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prognosis-of-acute-myeloid-leukemia\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Prognosis of acute myeloid leukemia&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The focus of this topic review will be on the various molecular genetic events involved in the pathogenesis of AML. More general discussions of genetic events in hematologic malignancies are presented separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=genetic-abnormalities-in-hematologic-and-lymphoid-malignancies\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Genetic abnormalities in hematologic and lymphoid malignancies&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=general-aspects-of-cytogenetic-analysis-in-hematologic-malignancies\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;General aspects of cytogenetic analysis in hematologic malignancies&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H91419583\"><span class=\"h1\">GENE MUTATIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Gene sequencing studies have shown that, on average, de novo AML cases contain more than 10 significant gene mutations, many of which can be broadly grouped into nine categories of genes thought to participate in leukemogenesis: DNA methylation, tumor suppressors, transcription factor fusions, nucleophosmin, signaling molecules, chromatin modification, myeloid transcription factors, the cohesin complex, and the spliceosome complex [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/molecular-genetics-of-acute-myeloid-leukemia/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. The most common genes mutated are: <em>FLT3</em> (28 percent), <em>NPM1</em> (27 percent), DNMT3A (26 percent), <em>IDH1</em> or <em>IDH2</em> (20 percent), <em>NRAS</em> or <em>KRAS</em> (12 percent), <em>RUNX1</em> (10 percent), <em>TET2</em> (8 percent), <em>TP53</em> (8 percent), <em>CEBPA</em> (6 percent), and <em>WT1</em> (6 percent).</p><p>The nature of the genetic lesions that are required to establish AML is not well defined, but the combination of mutations in any given AML is not random [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/molecular-genetics-of-acute-myeloid-leukemia/abstract/4,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,5</a>]. As examples, mutations in genes that encode signaling molecules (eg, <em>FLT3, RAS</em>) often accompany chromosomal rearrangements that target hematopoietic transcription factors (eg, <em>PML-RARalpha</em>, <em>CBFbeta-MYH11</em>) or key hematopoietic transcription factors (eg, <em>CEBPA, RUNX1</em>). Conversely, mutations of genes in a single physiologic pathway are often mutually exclusive; as an example, it is uncommon to find mutations of more than one gene that regulates DNA demethylation (eg, <em>TET2, IDH</em>) in a given AML sample. </p><p>The pathogenetic effects of some of these mutations will be discussed here. The prognostic value of gene mutations in patients with AML is discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prognosis-of-acute-myeloid-leukemia#H9\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Prognosis of acute myeloid leukemia&quot;, section on 'Gene mutations'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H24780405\"><span class=\"h2\">Mutations affecting DNA methylation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Gene mutations that affect DNA methylation have been identified in patients with AML. These mutations may result in the expression of genes that are normally silenced or in the silencing of genes that are normally expressed. DNA methylation patterns may also have prognostic significance [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/molecular-genetics-of-acute-myeloid-leukemia/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].</p><p>DNA methylation involves the addition of a methyl group to cytosine or adenine residues within DNA. Hypermethylated genes are generally not expressed (ie, silenced); as such, DNA methylation provides an epigenetic method for altering gene expression. This process is an essential component of normal development and cell differentiation, and alterations in DNA methylation may impair cell differentiation, as is seen in AML [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/molecular-genetics-of-acute-myeloid-leukemia/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].</p><p>Mutations associated with AML are found in genes that encode enzymes involved in both DNA methylation (eg, <em>DNMTs</em>) and DNA demethylation (eg, <em>IDH, WT1, TET2</em>). Deregulation of the <span class=\"nowrap\">IDH/WT1/TET2</span> axis is seen in as many as one-third of patients with AML, but mutations in genes associated with DNA demethylation are usually mutually exclusive in a given AML sample. The critical downstream targets of these changes in DNA methylation have not yet been identified.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H17582181\"><span class=\"h3\">DNMT mutations</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>DNA methyltransferases (DNMTs) are enzymes responsible for initiating <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> maintaining DNA methylation in mammalian cells. Without DNMTs, cells would gradually lose methyl groups from their DNA, leading to the expression of genes that are usually silenced. In one study, <em>DNMT3A</em> mutations were found in 22 percent of 281 patients with de novo AML [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/molecular-genetics-of-acute-myeloid-leukemia/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. When compared with patients without such mutations, patients with <em>DNMT3A</em> mutations had a significantly shorter median survival (12 versus 41 months). Another DNA sequencing study suggested that the rate of <em>DNMT3A</em> mutations varies by AML subtype, with the highest rate (20 percent) seen among cases of acute monocytic leukemia (ie, FAB M5) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/molecular-genetics-of-acute-myeloid-leukemia/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H17582194\"><span class=\"h3\">TET mutations</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The <em>TET</em> (ten-eleven translocation) genes encode proteins with enzymatic activity that initiate the multistep process of DNA demethylation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/molecular-genetics-of-acute-myeloid-leukemia/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. Somatic mutations in <em>TET2</em> occur in approximately 15 percent of myeloid cancers, including AML [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/molecular-genetics-of-acute-myeloid-leukemia/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. Mutations of <em>TET2</em> result in increased methylation and silencing of genes that are normally expressed. In mice, ablation of TET2 alters the function of hematopoietic stem cells and induces myeloid leukemia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/molecular-genetics-of-acute-myeloid-leukemia/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. WT1 (Wilms tumor 1) is an interaction partner of TET2, and regulates TET2 binding to DNA, thereby providing another mechanism that can alter DNA methylation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/molecular-genetics-of-acute-myeloid-leukemia/abstract/13,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,14</a>].

Characterization of the genes involved in these translocations has led to the elucidation of many transcriptional regulatory pathways in hematopoiesis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/molecular-genetics-of-acute-myeloid-leukemia/abstract/51-54\" class=\"abstract_t\">51-54</a>]. For example, the alpha and beta subunits of core-binding factor (CBF) have been found to be required for definitive hematopoiesis; both of these subunits are involved in chromosomal translocations in AML.</p><p>The involvement in chromosomal translocations of several other classes of transcription factors has been recognized, including those that contain zinc fingers, ring fingers, leucine zippers, basic helix-loop-helix motifs, and ETS domains [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/molecular-genetics-of-acute-myeloid-leukemia/abstract/55\" class=\"abstract_t\">55</a>]. Homologues of these transcription factors have been well characterized in animal models such as <em>Drosophila</em>, including the RUNX1 (AML1) homologue &quot;runt&quot;, and the KMT2A (MLL) homologue &quot;trithorax&quot;. Several other proteins with well-defined hematopoietic functions have been recognized at chromosomal translocation breakpoints, including retinoic acid receptors and Hox genes. However, structural proteins that do not appear to be specific to myeloid cells have also been identified, including members of the nuclear pore complex and nucleolar phosphoproteins. The functions of many other genes involved in chromosomal translocations remain to be elucidated.</p><p>Many genes are capable of participating in translocations that involve multiple alternative partner genes. For example, the <em>KMT2A</em> (<em>MLL)</em> gene forms chimeric fusion genes with at least 18 known partners and an additional 10 to 15 that have not yet been cloned. These alternative fusions provide an opportunity to contrast the contributions of each component of the fusion gene and thus dissect the motifs within these genes that are critical to tumorigenesis. The fusion of nucleophosmin (<em>NPM</em>) to <em>ALK</em> is a frequent recurring abnormality in anaplastic large cell lymphoma. <em>NPM</em> also fuses to <em>RARalpha</em> in acute promyelocytic leukemia and to <em>MLF1</em> in other subtypes of AML.

Translocations involving 11q23 are the single most common cytogenetic abnormality in infants with acute leukemia, regardless of phenotype, and occur in approximately 70 to 80 percent of cases. 11q23 translocations are also observed frequently in therapy-related leukemias in patients who have previously been treated with drugs that inhibit topoisomerase II, especially the epipodophyllotoxins. This syndrome differs from the therapy-related myeloid leukemias that occur in patients exposed to alkylating agents, which are commonly associated with deletional events on chromosomes 5 and 7.

This exceeds the number of known translocations affecting the immunoglobulin loci, suggesting that the 11q23 breakpoint region may contain genomically unstable sequences leading to recombination events.</p><p>The chromosomal partners in 11q23 translocations are usually lineage specific. In AML, t(9;11)(p22;q23), t(11;19)(q23;p13.1) and t(6;11)(q27;q23) are the most common, and in ALL, t(4;11)(q21;q23) and t(11;19)(q23;p13.3) occur predominantly. Translocations at 11q23 have been observed in several FAB subtypes, but occur most commonly in the FAB-M4 myelomonocytic and FAB-M5 monoblastic leukemias [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/molecular-genetics-of-acute-myeloid-leukemia/abstract/89,93,94\" class=\"abstract_t\">89,93,94</a>]. Myeloid leukemias with 11q23 translocations often coexpress lymphoid markers, whereas 11q23 lymphoid leukemias often express myeloid or monocytoid markers in addition to B-cell markers. These observations suggest that rearrangements of <em>KMT2A</em> may affect a pluripotent stem cell or, alternatively, that disruption of <em>KMT2A</em> may affect a common differentiation pathway shared by lymphoid and myeloid progenitor cells.</p><p>In a subset of patients with AML and either trisomy 11 or a normal karyotype, a unique pattern of rearrangement of the <em>KMT2A</em> gene has been observed. As in the translocations that affect <em>KMT2A</em>, a fusion occurs involving one of the exons in its breakpoint cluster region. However, rather than fusing to a partner gene, the fusion is to 5' sequences from <em>KMT2A</em> itself [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/molecular-genetics-of-acute-myeloid-leukemia/abstract/95,96\" class=\"abstract_t\">95,96</a>]. These partial duplications of <em>KMT2A</em> appear to occur primarily in older patients, and are infrequent in childhood and therapy-related leukemias.

Previously, the involvement of <em>NPM</em> had been identified in the t(2;5)(p23;q35) in anaplastic large cell lymphoma, where it fuses to the <em>ALK</em> gene [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/molecular-genetics-of-acute-myeloid-leukemia/abstract/123\" class=\"abstract_t\">123</a>]. <em>NPM</em> is also rearranged in the t(5;17)(q35;q21) in APL, where it fuses to <em>RARalpha</em>.</p><p>The MLF1 protein normally localizes to the cytoplasm, whereas in leukemia cells with t(3;5), the <em>NPM-MLF1</em> fusion protein is observed primarily in nucleoli. The involvement of <em>NPM</em> in chromosome translocations involving three different partner genes, resulting in three discrete types of hematologic malignancies, suggests that NPM plays an important role in normal hematopoietic differentiation.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H22\"><span class=\"h3\">EVI1 in inv(3) and t(3;3)</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span><em>EVI1</em> (Ecotropic Virus Integration 1) was initially cloned as the gene at a common site of retroviral integration in murine myeloid leukemia. The <em>EVI1</em> gene is normally expressed only in kidney and ovary. In mice, the retroviral integration at the murine <em>Evi1</em> locus leads to its inappropriate expression in hematopoietic cells. A similar phenomenon occurs in human AML with inv(3)(q21q26) and t(3;3)(q21;q26) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/molecular-genetics-of-acute-myeloid-leukemia/abstract/124\" class=\"abstract_t\">124</a>]. As a result of these cytogenetic aberrations, the <em>EVI1</em> gene is juxtaposed to enhancer elements of the Ribophorin gene leading to inappropriate activation of the <em>EVI1</em> transcription unit, a component of the complex fusion transcripts that involve the <em>RUNX1</em> gene in t(3;21).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H23\"><span class=\"h3\">MOZ/CBP in t(8;16)</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The t(8;16)(p11;p13) has been recognized in the M4 and M5 subtypes of AML that exhibit a characteristic erythrophagocytosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/molecular-genetics-of-acute-myeloid-leukemia/abstract/125\" class=\"abstract_t\">125</a>]. This translocation has been observed in both de novo and therapy-related leukemias. Several variant translocations involving 8p11 have been recognized in monocytic leukemias with erythrophagocytosis, but the genes involved in these translocations have not yet been cloned. <em>CBP</em> is also involved with a fusion to <em>KMT2A</em> in t(11;16)(q23;p13) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/molecular-genetics-of-acute-myeloid-leukemia/abstract/126\" class=\"abstract_t\">126</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H24\"><span class=\"h3\">CALM/AF10 in t(10;11)</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The t(10;11)(p13;q14) has been recognized in both ALL and AML.

In BXH-2 mice, the Hoxa9 gene has been implicated in myeloid leukemia as a result of its activation via proviral insertion. <em>NUP98</em> has been found to be involved in the inv(11)(p15q22) in AML.

The <em>v-Myb</em> gene was originally identified as the transforming element in the avian myeloblastosis virus (AMV). In the E26 retrovirus, a fusion gene consisting of <em>gag, v-Myb, </em>and<em> v-Ets</em> has been identified [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/molecular-genetics-of-acute-myeloid-leukemia/abstract/130\" class=\"abstract_t\">130</a>]. The formation of a fusion gene containing sequences of two transcription factors is reminiscent of the fusions that result from chromosomal translocations in human acute leukemia. In chickens, AMV causes monoblastic leukemias and transforms only myelomonocytic cells in vitro, whereas E26 induces erythroleukemias, but is capable of transforming myeloid, erythroid, and megakaryocytic lineages in vitro [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/molecular-genetics-of-acute-myeloid-leukemia/abstract/131\" class=\"abstract_t\">131</a>].</p><p><em>C-Myb</em>, the normal cellular counterpart of <em>v-Myb</em>, is essential for definitive hematopoiesis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/molecular-genetics-of-acute-myeloid-leukemia/abstract/132\" class=\"abstract_t\">132</a>]. Promonocytic leukemias have been induced by priming mice with intraperitoneal injections of pristane, followed by infection with the Moloney murine leukemia virus [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/molecular-genetics-of-acute-myeloid-leukemia/abstract/133\" class=\"abstract_t\">133</a>].

The role of pristane is unknown, but it appears to promote leukemogenesis by mediating an inflammatory response. At this time, there is no evidence for the rearrangement of c-Myb in human leukemias.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H28\"><span class=\"h2\">Friend virus/SFFV erythroleukemia</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The erythroleukemia induced by infection with the Friend viral complex is the culmination of a three step process that has become a paradigm for multistage neoplastic transformation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/molecular-genetics-of-acute-myeloid-leukemia/abstract/135\" class=\"abstract_t\">135</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Polyclonal proliferation induced by a cytokine</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Inactivation of a tumor suppressor gene</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Oncogenic activation of a gene involved in normal hematopoiesis</p><p/><p>Infection of susceptible mice with the Friend murine leukemia <span class=\"nowrap\">virus/spleen</span> focus-forming virus (SFFV) complex induces a polyclonal proliferation of erythroid progenitors within 48 hours. This expansion of erythroid precursors is secondary to the <em>SFFV</em> envelope gene product, the gp55 glycoprotein, which has the capacity to bind and activate the erythropoietin receptor. These erythroid cells are not transformed, and retain the ability to undergo terminal differentiation.</p><p>After approximately two weeks, a clonal population of transformed erythroblasts emerges which depends on two additional independent genetic events. One of these is the inactivation of the p53 tumor suppressor gene by deletion, mutation, or proviral insertion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/molecular-genetics-of-acute-myeloid-leukemia/abstract/136,137\" class=\"abstract_t\">136,137</a>]. In addition, the activation of either the <em>PU.1</em> gene, also referred to as <em>Spi-1</em> (SFFV proviral integration 1), or the <em>Fli-1</em> gene occur as a result of proviral integration adjacent to these loci [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/molecular-genetics-of-acute-myeloid-leukemia/abstract/138,139\" class=\"abstract_t\">138,139</a>]. <em>PU.1 </em>and<em> Fli-1</em> are members of the ETS family of transcription factors; <em>PU.1 </em>is essential for both myeloid and lymphoid development [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/molecular-genetics-of-acute-myeloid-leukemia/abstract/140\" class=\"abstract_t\">140</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H29\"><span class=\"h2\">BXH-2 leukemias</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>BXH-2 mice are derived from a cross of <span class=\"nowrap\">C57BL/6J</span> and <span class=\"nowrap\">C3H/He</span> mice. Although the parental strains have a low incidence of leukemia, more than 95 percent of BXH-2 mice develop myeloid leukemia by one year of age, caused by expression of a horizontally transmitted Ecotropic murine leukemia virus [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/molecular-genetics-of-acute-myeloid-leukemia/abstract/141\" class=\"abstract_t\">141</a>]. These retroviruses induce leukemia by insertional activation or mutation of proto-oncogenes adjacent to the viral integration site. One of the most frequent viral integration sites is <em>Evi-2</em> (Ecotropic viral integration site 2), localized to a large intron within the <em>Nf1</em> tumor suppressor gene [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/molecular-genetics-of-acute-myeloid-leukemia/abstract/142\" class=\"abstract_t\">142</a>]. The consequence of this integration event is the disruption of the normal expression of <em>Nf1</em> in the affected mice.</p><p>In humans, the neurofibromatosis type I autosomal dominant disorder is caused by mutation of the <em>NF1</em> gene [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/molecular-genetics-of-acute-myeloid-leukemia/abstract/143\" class=\"abstract_t\">143</a>]. In addition to neurofibromas, patients have an increased risk of developing several types of solid tumors and malignant myeloid disorders, especially juvenile chronic myeloid leukemia (JCML) and the monosomy 7 syndrome [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/molecular-genetics-of-acute-myeloid-leukemia/abstract/144\" class=\"abstract_t\">144</a>].</p><p>Mice heterozygous for the <em>Nf1</em> allele develop myeloid leukemia with loss of the wild type allele, indicating that Nf1 acts as a tumor suppressor [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/molecular-genetics-of-acute-myeloid-leukemia/abstract/145\" class=\"abstract_t\">145</a>]. In JCML patients without neurofibromatosis, activating <em>RAS</em> mutations are frequently identified. The consequence of either the disruption of <em>NF1</em> or the activation of <em>RAS</em> has been shown to be an inability to negatively regulate GM-CSF signaling in hematopoietic cells [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/molecular-genetics-of-acute-myeloid-leukemia/abstract/146,147\" class=\"abstract_t\">146,147</a>].</p><p>Because viral integration within the <em>Nf1</em> gene has been observed in only 15 percent of BXH-2 mice, the identification of additional mutations within other genes associated with myeloid leukemias has been pursued. A proviral tagging approach has been used to identify additional viral integration sites that alter the expression of three genes, <em>Hoxa7, Hoxa9, </em>and<em> Meis-1</em> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/molecular-genetics-of-acute-myeloid-leukemia/abstract/148,149\" class=\"abstract_t\">148,149</a>]. The <em>HOXA9</em> gene is involved in t(7;11)(p15;p15) in AML, resulting in the formation of a fusion gene with NUP98. HOX gene overexpression has also been demonstrated in mice with acquired nucleophosmin mutations that result in the cytoplasmic dislocation of nucleophosmin (ie, NPM1c) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/molecular-genetics-of-acute-myeloid-leukemia/abstract/150\" class=\"abstract_t\">150</a>]. <em>PBX1</em> is involved in t(1;19) in ALL, where it fuses to the <em>E2A</em> gene.

These changes alter normal hematopoietic growth and differentiation, resulting in an accumulation of large numbers of abnormal, immature myeloid cells in the bone marrow and peripheral blood. These cells are capable of dividing and proliferating, but cannot differentiate normally into mature, fully functional hematopoietic cells. (See <a href=\"#H1\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Cases of AML demonstrate mutations in oncogenes (eg, <em>NRAS, FLT3</em>) as well as the loss of tumor suppressor genes (eg, <em>TP53, WT1</em> [Wilms tumor suppressor gene]). (See <a href=\"#H91419583\" class=\"local\">'Gene mutations'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In contrast to most solid tumors, many hematologic malignancies are associated with chromosomal translocations that result in the generation of chimeric fusion genes that are never expressed in wild type cells. Chromosomal aberrations in AML commonly involve transcription factors that regulate hematopoiesis. (See <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Chromosomal translocations'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The chromosomal aberrations t(8;21)(q22;q22) and the inv(16)(p13q22) in AML involve subunits of the core-binding factor (CBF) group of transcription factors. Members of the CBF group function as heterodimeric complexes regulating diverse target genes involved in tissue differentiation. (See <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'Involvement of core binding factor'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The mixed lineage leukemia gene, <em>KMT2A</em> (<em>MLL</em>), located at chromosome band 11q23, is frequently involved in translocations in AML with different partner chromosomes. KMT2A is a histone methyltransferase that plays a critical role in normal embryonic development and hematopoiesis, mainly regulating transcription via epigenetic mechanisms. Translocations involving <em>KMT2A</em> result in <em>KMT2A</em> fusion proteins that induce the aberrant expression of downstream mediators. (See <a href=\"#H15\" class=\"local\">'Involvement of the KMT2A (MLL) locus'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The cytogenetic hallmark of acute promyelocytic leukemia is a translocation involving the retinoic acid receptor-alpha (<em>RARA</em>) locus on chromosome 17. These translocations lead to the formation of chimeric fusion transcripts from each of the derivative chromosomes. The pathobiology of APL is discussed in detail separately.
