This topic review will provide an overview of the relevant anatomy, pathophysiology, diagnosis, and management of hallux valgus. Toe and foot injuries are discussed elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=toe-fractures-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Toe fractures in adults&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=metatarsal-shaft-fractures\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Metatarsal shaft fractures&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-and-diagnosis-of-common-causes-of-foot-pain-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation and diagnosis of common causes of foot pain in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL ANATOMY AND BIOMECHANICS</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Basic forefoot anatomy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>By convention, toes and their respective metatarsals are numbered from one (great toe) through five (little toe). The great toe has two phalanges, while the second through fifth toes typically have three (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F78924\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef78924 \">figure 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F61079\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef61079 \">figure 2</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F71857\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef71857 \">figure 3</a>). Tendons and ligaments insert at the bases of each phalanx. The digital artery and nerve pass together along each side of each toe.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Definitions</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Hallux valgus deformity &ndash; This deformity is defined as a lateral deviation of the hallux (great toe) on the first metatarsal (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SM%2F64417\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef64417 \">figure 4</a>). The deviation of the hallux occurs primarily in the transverse plane. The deformity often also involves rotation of the toe in the frontal plane causing the nail to face medially (ie, eversion). These two deviations have led to the use of different terms to describe the deformity. In orthopedic texts, it is often called &quot;hallux valgus&quot; (HV) whereas many podiatry texts prefer the term &quot;hallux abductovalgus (HAV).&quot; The public is more familiar with the expression &quot;bunion.&quot;</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Hallux abductus (or hallux valgus) angle &ndash; The angle created by the bisection of the longitudinal axis of the hallux and the longitudinal axis of the first metatarsal (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SM%2F64417\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef64417 \">figure 4</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SM%2F76005\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef76005 \">image 1</a>). Historically, a hallux abductus (HA) angle of greater than 15 degrees was considered abnormal, but such deformities are not always symptomatic, and some cases of an HA angle greater than 15 degrees occur naturally due to the shape of the articular surfaces involved [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hallux-valgus-deformity-bunion/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>]. Contemporary research suggests an HA angle of 20 degrees or greater is abnormal [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hallux-valgus-deformity-bunion/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Intermetatarsal (IM) angle &ndash; The angle determined by the bisection of the longitudinal axes of the first and second metatarsals (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SM%2F64417\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef64417 \">figure 4</a>). An IM angle less than 9 degrees is considered normal.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Ray &ndash; The forefoot consists of five longitudinal projections, called rays, which are comprised of the metatarsal and its respective phalanges, and the bones aligned with and proximal to the metatarsal, such as the cuneiforms or cuboid bones. Hallux valgus involves the first ray.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">First ray anatomy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>No muscles originate on the first metatarsal and insert into the phalanx to directly stabilize the first metatarsophalangeal (MTP) joint. The abductor and adductor hallucis muscles pass medially and laterally to the MTP joint respectively, but they are located nearer to the plantar surface (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F52955\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef52955 \">figure 5</a>). Thus, any force pushing the proximal phalanx laterally, or the metatarsal head medially, is relatively unrestrained and can create a valgus deformity.</p><p>The first metatarsal is held in alignment by a splinting action of the abductor hallucis muscle medially and by the lateral pull of the peroneus longus acting at the base of the metatarsal [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hallux-valgus-deformity-bunion/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. Movement at the first MTP joint in the transverse plane is prevented by collateral ligaments running from the metatarsal epicondyles, distally and plantarly, to the proximal phalanx.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Pathophysiology of HV deformity</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The metatarsocuneiform joint has a sinusoidal curve allowing medial-dorsal and plantar-lateral movements. Increased pressure under the head of the first metatarsal (for example, due to increased subtalar pronation or a congenital plantar-flexed first ray) will force the metatarsal to move medial-dorsally. This movement increases the HA and IM angles and places the metatarsal more medial relative to its proximal phalanx. As muscle action stabilizes the joint during gait, pressure from the proximal phalanx on the lateral aspect of the metatarsal head pushes the metatarsal more medially, further increasing the HA angle.</p><p>As the first metatarsal moves medially and the hallux moves laterally, the medial capsule and medial collateral ligament come under chronic strain and eventually rupture. The medial movement of the metatarsal forces the abductor hallucis muscle beneath the metatarsal. From this position it acts solely as a plantar-flexor of the proximal phalanx, thereby contributing to the valgus rotation seen with HV deformity. Eventually, without medial stabilizing structures, the lateral joint capsule and collateral ligaments tighten and the adductor hallucis muscle acts unopposed, exacerbating the deformity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hallux-valgus-deformity-bunion/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].</p><p>Since not all cases of HV deformity become severe, there may be a threshold up to which the forces deforming the joint can be opposed by other anatomic structures. When forces greater than the threshold occur, the joint becomes deformed. It is possible that such progression occurs rapidly rather than worsening steadily over several years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hallux-valgus-deformity-bunion/abstract/1,2,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2,6</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h1\">PREVALENCE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Many studies have tried to determine the prevalence of hallux valgus (HV) deformity. According to a systematic review of 78 studies involving 496,957 subjects, the prevalence of HV is approximately 23 percent among adults aged 18 to 65 years, 36 percent among adults over 65 years, and 30 percent among adult females [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hallux-valgus-deformity-bunion/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. The prevalence is greater among shod compared with barefoot populations, although the condition is still found twice as often in women than men in non-shod populations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hallux-valgus-deformity-bunion/abstract/8-10\" class=\"abstract_t\">8-10</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h1\">ETIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Many theories have been proposed, but the precise etiology of hallux valgus (HV) deformity is unknown [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hallux-valgus-deformity-bunion/abstract/11,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,12</a>]. Most likely, HV deformity is multifactorial in origin and includes such factors as: abnormal foot mechanics affecting the first ray [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hallux-valgus-deformity-bunion/abstract/5,13-17\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,13-17</a>], abnormal first metatarsophalangeal anatomy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hallux-valgus-deformity-bunion/abstract/18-21\" class=\"abstract_t\">18-21</a>], joint hypermobility [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hallux-valgus-deformity-bunion/abstract/22,23\" class=\"abstract_t\">22,23</a>], and genetic influences [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hallux-valgus-deformity-bunion/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. HV is also associated with conditions such as inflammatory joint disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hallux-valgus-deformity-bunion/abstract/24-26\" class=\"abstract_t\">24-26</a>].</p><p>Since HV deformity occurs primarily in shod populations, affecting women in particular, poor footwear has frequently been cited as a cause. The fact that some women wear footwear that compresses their toes significantly without detrimental effects, while some men suffer from marked HV deformity despite the use of sensible footwear, leads many to think that footwear probably exacerbates underlying bony or mechanical abnormalities rather than acting as a primary factor. Among ballet dancers, bunions have been linked to the demands of pointe position, but evidence to show that ballet dancers have more frequent bunions is inconclusive.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h1\">DIAGNOSIS AND CLINICAL FINDINGS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Although hallux valgus (HV) is easily recognized by clinical examination (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F96788\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef96788 \">picture 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F96789\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef96789 \">picture 2</a>), radiographs may be necessary to determine the presence of damage to the articular surfaces of the first metatarsophalangeal (MTP) joint. The HV deformity is a lateral deviation of the hallux (great toe) on the first metatarsal (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SM%2F64417\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef64417 \">figure 4</a>). The deviation of the hallux occurs primarily in the transverse plane. The deformity often also involves rotation of the toe in the frontal plane causing the nail to face medially (ie, eversion). Surgeons use radiographs to assess the severity of the deformity and select the appropriate procedure (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SM%2F76005\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef76005 \">image 1</a>).</p><p>HV can lead to a number of painful complications in or around the first MTP joint, including [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hallux-valgus-deformity-bunion/abstract/27-29\" class=\"abstract_t\">27-29</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Inflammation of a medial bursa protecting the joint (most common)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Degeneration of the crista on the plantar surface of the metatarsal head, caused by erosion as the metatarsal moves over the sesamoids</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Entrapment of the medial dorsal cutaneous nerve as it passes through the enlarged bunion area</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Hammertoe deformity of the second toe, caused by destabilizing pressure from the laterally deviated great toe</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Central metatarsalgia, caused by the patient's chronic shifting of weight from an unstable first ray onto the central rays</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Degeneration of the cartilage covering the metatarsal head</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Synovitis of the MTP joint</p><p/><p>Hyperkeratosis may also occur as a result of altered weightbearing forces and can cause marked discomfort. Assessment of HV to determine the factors causing patient discomfort is important, as it will help to determine the appropriate treatment.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H64182047\"><span class=\"h1\">ASSOCIATED INJURIES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>While many studies have reported that hallux valgus is associated with a change in weightbearing pressures under the hallux and in other regions across the foot, these studies have all been cross-sectional and therefore causal relationships cannot be determined. It remains unclear whether changes in loading are a result of the hallux valgus (HV) deformity itself or related to some underlying mechanical dysfunction that contributes to the development of the HV deformity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hallux-valgus-deformity-bunion/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. </p><p>It is clear that weightbearing pressures under the foot change as HV develops, since patients develop pressure lesions such as calluses, which were not present before the deformity developed and may not be present on the unaffected foot. One study has suggested that changes in weightbearing pressures might lead to further injuries within the foot or limb [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hallux-valgus-deformity-bunion/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]. However, in the main, the relationship between plantar pressures and specific injuries remains unknown. There is no evidence that general gait parameters are affected by HV, but there is some evidence suggesting that the deformity does disrupt gait and balance particularly on uneven surfaces and among the elderly, who may be put at increased risk of falling [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hallux-valgus-deformity-bunion/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h1\">TREATMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Hundreds of studies have been published assessing numerous conservative and surgical treatments for hallux valgus (HV) deformity. Overall, there is little evidence that conservative treatments are useful. Nevertheless, we agree with the American College of Foot and Ankle Surgeons and suggest that patients make use of conservative therapies before surgical referral is made [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hallux-valgus-deformity-bunion/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>]. Patients with severe pain or dysfunction and those whose symptoms do not improve under a conservative regimen should be referred to a foot surgeon.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h2\">Conservative management</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Few randomized trials looking at conservative treatments for HV in adults have been performed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hallux-valgus-deformity-bunion/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>]. Despite the dearth of evidence, we suggest the following nonoperative treatments be considered to alleviate symptoms and possibly to help prevent progression of HV deformity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hallux-valgus-deformity-bunion/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Shoe modification: wide, low-heeled shoes, or specially altered shoes with increased medial pocket for the first metatarsophalangeal (MTP) joint to minimize deforming forces</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Orthoses to improve support and alignment</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Night splinting to improve toe alignment</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Stretching <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> <span class=\"nowrap\">mobilization/manipulation</span> to maintain joint mobility</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Medial bunion pads to prevent irritation</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Ice applied after activity to reduce inflammation</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Analgesics: <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acetaminophen-paracetamol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">acetaminophen</a> or NSAIDs</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h3\">Orthoses</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In the treatment of HV deformity, orthoses are used to improve foot mechanics (eg, reducing abnormal subtalar joint pronation) and to prevent abnormal forces from acting on the first ray complex. It is hoped that orthoses might prevent deterioration of the HV angle and relieve pain by improving joint function. Orthoses need to be worn in a well-fitting, low-heeled, fastening shoe, and this type of shoe may itself influence joint position and discomfort.</p><p>In subjects with rheumatoid arthritis (RA), orthoses have been shown to prevent progression of HV deformity compared with controls with RA and placebo orthoses [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hallux-valgus-deformity-bunion/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>]. The hallux abductus (HA) angle progressed in 10 percent of the treatment group compared with 25 percent of the control group (adjusted odds ratio = 0.27) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hallux-valgus-deformity-bunion/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>]. However, in the same study measures of pain, disability, and function of the foot showed little difference between patients wearing orthoses and those wearing placebo devices. Furthermore, the majority of patients in the trial were male, and these results may not apply to women, who comprise the majority of patients with HV deformity.</p><p>When orthoses were compared with no treatment in patients with painful, mild-to-moderate HV deformity, patients wearing orthoses reported improved pain scores after six months, but these improvements were not maintained thereafter [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hallux-valgus-deformity-bunion/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>]. At one year, only the global assessment score remained better in the orthosis group (46 percent better than one year ago versus 24 percent; 11 percent worse than one year ago versus 34 percent). In the same study, surgery (chevron osteotomy) outperformed orthoses for all outcomes. The study did not evaluate HA angle progression.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14\"><span class=\"h3\">Splinting</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Splints can be used to place the toe in a corrected position in the hope of enabling soft tissue adaptation and delaying rupture of the medial joint capsule and collateral ligament, but there is little evidence that such interventions improve long-term outcomes. The most common devices used are night splints, which realign the hallux while nonweightbearing (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F57494\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef57494 \">picture 3</a>). Wedges placed between the first and second toe (toe separator) and attached with adhesive strapping are also used.</p><p>Studies of splinting for hallux valgus are limited by their small sample sizes and risk of bias. Night splints were ineffective in reducing pain associated with HV deformity in one small randomized trial [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hallux-valgus-deformity-bunion/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>]. Progression of the deformity did not occur in the treatment or the control group over the six-month trial duration. Night splints were more effective in reducing deformity and pain than a toe separator, but they were less effective than exercises, in another small study [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hallux-valgus-deformity-bunion/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>]. However, the mean decrease in HA angle was approximately 2 degrees, which was within the range of measurement error. A study of 30 patients comparing night splints to a toe separator attached to a semi-rigid insole reported a significant reduction in pain intensity at three months in the group using the toe separator insole, but changes in HA and IMA angles were not significantly different and the decrease in pain in the insole group may be attributable to the change in footwear [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hallux-valgus-deformity-bunion/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>]. A study of 30 subjects compared night splints to a slipper containing a toe separator reported improvement in the HV angle in the slipper group after one year but is the changes were not clinically meaningful [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hallux-valgus-deformity-bunion/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>]. A study of 20 female subjects comparing taping and exercises versus exercise alone reported statistically significant short-term reductions in pain and improved walking in the taping group [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hallux-valgus-deformity-bunion/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>]. This study also reported improvements for both groups in HV and IM angles, but the changes were small and within the margin of error.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1633258\"><span class=\"h3\">Mobilization and manipulation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The results of two small preliminary studies suggest that graded mobilization and manipulation may improve pain and function in the short term, but further study of the long term effects is needed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hallux-valgus-deformity-bunion/abstract/41,42\" class=\"abstract_t\">41,42</a>]. &#160;</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15\"><span class=\"h3\">Other</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Marigold ointment was reported to be effective in reducing pain, soft tissue swelling, and the HA angle when applied to the bunion area over an eight-week period [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hallux-valgus-deformity-bunion/abstract/43\" class=\"abstract_t\">43</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H16\"><span class=\"h2\">Surgery</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H775063994\"><span class=\"h3\">Indications and overview</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Referral for surgical repair is based primarily upon patient symptoms (eg, pain, difficulty with ambulation); neither clinical nor radiographic appearance plays a significant role. Patients with severe pain or dysfunction and those whose symptoms do not improve under a conservative treatment regimen should be referred to a foot surgeon. (See <a href=\"#H12\" class=\"local\">'Conservative management'</a> above.)</p><p>Approximately 150 surgical procedures for the correction of HV deformity have been described. Most procedures are undertaken using an open approach that results in a dorsal scar of 3 to 5 cm. Minimally invasive procedures using indirect imaging techniques have been developed that involve correction of the deformity through a small incision, leaving a scar of only 1 cm. &#160;All of the surgical procedures involve one of the following basic approaches:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Fusing the metatarsophalangeal (MTP) joint or the metatarsocuneiform joint in a corrected position (arthrodesis)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Removing the joint or replacing the joint with an implant (arthroplasty)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Cutting the first metatarsal and realigning the bone in a less adducted position (osteotomy)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Removing the prominent side of the metatarsal head (bunionectomy)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Reconstruction of soft tissue to pull the bones into a corrected position (tenotomy)</p><p/><p>There are many retrospective studies but very few randomized trials evaluating these procedures. A systematic review from 2003 identified 15 randomized trials involving surgical correction of the deformity but noted that trial sizes were small and the quality generally poor [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hallux-valgus-deformity-bunion/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>]. Although patient satisfaction with surgical correction ranges from 50 to 90 percent, the trend is toward greater satisfaction as surgical techniques have improved.</p><p>Both orthopedic and podiatric specialist foot surgeons, as well as nonspecialists, perform operations to repair HV deformity. No study has compared the results of surgery based on who performed the procedure. Nevertheless, we suggest patients be referred to a foot surgery specialist with experience repairing HV deformity.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H17\"><span class=\"h3\">Patient satisfaction</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patient satisfaction does not appear to correlate with surgical outcome as determined by radiographic parameters (ie, HA and IM angles) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hallux-valgus-deformity-bunion/abstract/44\" class=\"abstract_t\">44</a>]. Some patients have a misapprehension that the hallux should be straight after the operation. Others may be under the mistaken impression that they will be able to fit into narrower shoes postoperatively and can be dissatisfied if this expectation is not met.</p><p>Managing patient expectations is important. Patients should understand that 10 to 25 degrees of valgus angulation is normal at the MTP joint, and that resolution of postoperative pain and swelling may require several months [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hallux-valgus-deformity-bunion/abstract/45\" class=\"abstract_t\">45</a>]. Most will remain unable to fit into narrower shoes. One study found that only 2 of 52 patients could wear smaller shoes after their procedure, despite a postoperative reduction in foot width [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hallux-valgus-deformity-bunion/abstract/46\" class=\"abstract_t\">46</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H18\"><span class=\"h3\">Arthrodesis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Fusion of the first MTP joint is rarely performed, unless there is severe degeneration of the joint and good function is unlikely to be regained were only joint position corrected. The procedure is usually reserved for older patients. Walking on a fused MTP joint alters foot mechanics during gait and can cause secondary hyperkeratoses to develop.</p><p>A study of 81 patients treated with first MTP arthrodesis reported success in relieving joint pain, improving walking distance, and improving appearance after a minimum follow-up of 24 months [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hallux-valgus-deformity-bunion/abstract/47\" class=\"abstract_t\">47</a>].</p><p>Fusion at the metatarsocuneiform joint is called the Lapidus procedure and is used when the mobility of the first ray is excessive. A study of 87 patients found that the Lapidus procedure combined with a soft tissue correction was successful in reducing the HA and IM angles, as well as improving the American Orthopaedic Foot and Ankle Society (AOFAS) functional score [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hallux-valgus-deformity-bunion/abstract/48\" class=\"abstract_t\">48</a>]. Eighty-four percent of patients considered the surgery satisfactory.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H19\"><span class=\"h3\">Arthroplasty</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A comparison of arthrodesis with Keller's arthroplasty found that 75 percent of the arthroplasty patients were completely satisfied postoperatively, and that 88 percent experienced complete pain relief [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hallux-valgus-deformity-bunion/abstract/47\" class=\"abstract_t\">47</a>]. However, 12 percent experienced worse pain after the surgery. The authors also found that the response to surgery can be prolonged, with some patients needing up to 30 months before manifesting improvement. Overall, little difference in outcomes was found between the arthroplasty and arthrodesis groups. A small study comparing distal metatarsal osteotomy with Keller's arthroplasty found larger residual HA and IM angles in the arthroplasty group, but overall satisfaction and pain relief did not differ significantly [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hallux-valgus-deformity-bunion/abstract/49\" class=\"abstract_t\">49</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H20\"><span class=\"h3\">Osteotomy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The cut made in the bone during an osteotomy varies in shape and position, depending upon the surgical strategy. As an example, a straight cut is used in the Wilson osteotomy whereas a wedge-shaped cut is used in the chevron osteotomy. The cut may be made near the neck of the metatarsal (distal osteotomy), in the shaft (Scarf osteotomy), or near the base (proximal osteotomy). Although a greater degree of correction is possible through proximal osteotomies, these procedures require larger dissections and have higher complication rates. Generally, the surgeon tries to minimize metatarsal shortening and to maintain the metatarsal's plantar-flexed position. The chevron osteotomy has been studied most closely.</p><p>A randomized trial involving 209 patients that compared chevron osteotomy to treatment with orthosis or no treatment found that osteotomy outperformed nonoperative alternatives [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hallux-valgus-deformity-bunion/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>]. At 12-month follow-up, the HA and IM angles in the osteotomy group were at normal values, and 80 percent of patients were satisfied with their treatment. Nevertheless, 61.5 percent of the surgical patients still had &quot;moderate&quot; footwear problems, and half had experienced some pain in the previous six months. Over the 12-month follow-up period, the surgery group also had the highest costs for foot care and took the greatest number of sick days.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H21\"><span class=\"h3\">Soft tissue procedure</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>No study has evaluated soft tissue procedures to correct HV deformity independently. The McBride procedure primarily involves soft tissue surgery. &#160;</p><p>One study of 31 patients compared the effect of transposition of the adductor hallucis muscle to the lateral metatarsal head to leaving the tendon detached and reported no significant difference in HA or IM angles in the two groups [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hallux-valgus-deformity-bunion/abstract/50\" class=\"abstract_t\">50</a>]. Another small study compared chevron-Akin osteotomy to a distal soft tissue reconstruction-Akin osteotomy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hallux-valgus-deformity-bunion/abstract/51\" class=\"abstract_t\">51</a>]. Although the soft tissue reconstruction did not correct the HA and IM angles as well as the osteotomy alone, patient satisfaction did not differ significantly.</p><p>A study of 84 patients compared the chevron osteotomy with the chevron plus adductor tenotomy and found no significant difference in patient satisfaction and little difference in mechanical correction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hallux-valgus-deformity-bunion/abstract/52\" class=\"abstract_t\">52</a>]. Another study of 86 patients comparing the chevron osteotomy with and without soft tissue release also reported no significant difference in HA or IM angles at one year follow-up [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hallux-valgus-deformity-bunion/abstract/53\" class=\"abstract_t\">53</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H868883346\"><span class=\"h3\">Minimally invasive surgery</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Minimally invasive, or percutaneous, surgery is used with increasing frequency. One prospective study (n = 20) comparing minimally invasive surgery to open scarf osteotomy found no significant difference in the degree of correction of the deformity, but the minimally invasive approach resulted in a shorter scar and reduced surgical time [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hallux-valgus-deformity-bunion/abstract/54\" class=\"abstract_t\">54</a>]. These results are consistent with those of other studies included in a systemic review of minimally invasive hallux valgus surgery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hallux-valgus-deformity-bunion/abstract/55\" class=\"abstract_t\">55</a>]. Well-performed randomized trials are needed to confirm these results.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H16422990\"><span class=\"h1\">POSTOPERATIVE RECOVERY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Recovery from surgery depends upon the procedure undertaken. If a bony procedure such as an osteotomy is performed, healing corresponds to complete bony union. Observational studies suggest that bony union following such procedures consistently occurs at around six to seven weeks post operatively even when early weight-bearing is allowed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hallux-valgus-deformity-bunion/abstract/56,57\" class=\"abstract_t\">56,57</a>]. However, external factors such as smoking may impair healing and increase the time required [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hallux-valgus-deformity-bunion/abstract/58\" class=\"abstract_t\">58</a>]. </p><p>The time needed to return to work also generally coincides with the bone healing time. In a study of 89 patients who underwent osteotomy for HV, the average time to return to work was six weeks, whereas the return to sport was eight weeks [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hallux-valgus-deformity-bunion/abstract/59\" class=\"abstract_t\">59</a>]. It is likely that improvement continues after surgery for at least one year. In a separate study of 59 patients who underwent osteotomy for HV, measures of patient satisfaction after surgery showed improvement from 6 to 12 months [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hallux-valgus-deformity-bunion/abstract/60\" class=\"abstract_t\">60</a>]. &#160;</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"PATIENT_INFORMATION\"><span class=\"h1\">INFORMATION FOR PATIENTS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>UpToDate offers two types of patient education materials, &quot;The Basics&quot; and &quot;Beyond the Basics.&quot; The Basics patient education pieces are written in plain language, at the 5<sup>th</sup> to 6<sup>th</sup> grade reading level, and they answer the four or five key questions a patient might have about a given condition. These articles are best for patients who want a general overview and who prefer short, easy-to-read materials. Beyond the Basics patient education pieces are longer, more sophisticated, and more detailed.

The etiology is unknown. The deformity is more common among women and shod populations. A detailed description of the relevant anatomy, biomechanics, and pathophysiology is found above. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Clinical anatomy and biomechanics'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Although HV is easily recognized by clinical examination, radiographs may be necessary to determine the presence of articular damage (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SM%2F76005\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef76005 \">image 1</a>). Neither radiographic nor clinical appearance provides the basis for surgical referral, which is determined by patient pain and disability. (See <a href=\"#H9\" class=\"local\">'Diagnosis and clinical findings'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>There is little evidence that conservative treatments are useful in the treatment of HV. Nevertheless, we suggest patients without debilitating symptoms avail themselves of conservative therapies before being referred for surgery (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). Possible treatments include:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Shoe modification: wide, low-heeled shoes, or specially altered shoes with increased medial pocket for first metatarsophalangeal (MTP) joint to minimize deforming forces</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Orthoses to improve support and alignment</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Night splinting to improve toe alignment</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Stretching <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> <span class=\"nowrap\">mobilization/manipulation</span> to maintain joint mobility</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Medial bunion pads to prevent irritation</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Ice applied after activity to reduce inflammation</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Analgesics: <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acetaminophen-paracetamol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">acetaminophen</a> or NSAIDs (see <a href=\"#H12\" class=\"local\">'Conservative management'</a> above)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We suggest that patients with severe pain or dysfunction and those whose symptoms do not improve under a conservative treatment regimen be referred for surgical repair (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=5\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2B</a>). Approximately 150 surgical procedures for the correction of HV deformity have been described. Few prospective, randomized trials evaluating these procedures have been performed. Patients should be referred to a foot surgery specialist with experience repairing HV deformity. (See <a href=\"#H16\" class=\"local\">'Surgery'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Managing patient expectations about surgery is important. Patients should understand that 10 to 25 degrees of valgus angulation is normal at the MTP joint, and that resolution of postoperative pain and swelling may require several months. Most patients will remain unable to fit into narrower shoes.
