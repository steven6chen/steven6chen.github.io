These conditions probably result from heightened sensitivity by the mast cell to environmental conditions, although the exact pathogenesis is unknown.</p><p>An urticarial lesion is an intensely pruritic, circumscribed, raised, erythematous plaque, which can range in diameter from a few millimeters to many centimeters (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F72519\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef72519 \">picture 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F63644\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef63644 \">picture 2</a>). Urticaria may enlarge, sometimes developing central pallor, and coalesce with other adjacent lesions. They usually appear in crops and are typically short-lived, expanding and then resolving over a few hours without leaving residual marks on the skin (unless there is trauma from scratching).</p><p>Physical urticarias, except cold urticaria, will be discussed in this topic review. Other disorders of acute and chronic urticaria and cold urticaria are reviewed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=new-onset-urticaria\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;New-onset urticaria&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=chronic-urticaria-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-pathogenesis-and-natural-history\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Chronic urticaria: Clinical manifestations, diagnosis, pathogenesis, and natural history&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=chronic-urticaria-standard-management-and-patient-education\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Chronic urticaria: Standard management and patient education&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cold-urticaria\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Cold urticaria&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">GENERAL POINTS ABOUT PHYSICAL URTICARIAS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Before discussing individual syndromes, it is helpful to review some observations about the physical urticaria disorders as a group.</p><p>Physical urticarias are considered subtypes of chronic urticaria. In some patients, a specific physical stimulus is the only trigger for hives, whereas in others, a physical stimulus is an identifiable factor in a case of otherwise idiopathic chronic urticaria (also called chronic spontaneous urticaria). A minority of patients have hives triggered by multiple physical stimuli.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Prevalence</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The physical urticarias, considered as a group, are present in a subset of patients with chronic urticaria, which afflicts approximately 1 percent of adults. Physical urticarias are present in 20 to 30 percent of adults with chronic urticaria. Physical urticarias also occur in children, although there are fewer reports about this population [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/physical-urticarias/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. The overall prevalence in the general population is not well-defined, and many cases may be mild and easily managed in the primary care setting. In contrast, most published reports are based upon patient populations referred to specialty centers and so may overestimate the severity and persistence of these disorders.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Classification</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There are differences among experts concerning the best manner of classifying the physical urticarias. Guidelines for classification and diagnosis have been published by a European expert panel [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/physical-urticarias/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. The material in this topic review is similar, although not identical.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Variations in clinical presentation and severity</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Physical urticarias vary widely in severity. The symptoms of each syndrome can range from mild to disabling, with some patients experiencing potentially dangerous systemic symptoms.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Testing</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Specific testing procedures are presented in the discussions of each disorder below and summarized in the table (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F50072\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef50072 \">table 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/physical-urticarias/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. However, there are some general points to consider in performing challenge procedures for physical urticarias.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h3\">Precautions</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Physical challenges are not always needed for diagnosis, although they are sometimes invaluable in clarifying or confirming the diagnosis. These challenges are usually performed by allergy specialists with training in the management of the systemic allergic reactions that could conceivably result in anaphylaxis. Proper access to the staff and equipment necessary to treat a potentially life-threatening allergic reaction is essential. This is especially true if the patient has experienced systemic symptoms in the past (eg, bronchospasm or hypotension).</p><p>During these challenges, physical stimuli are applied to the skin for a specified amount of time (usually a few minutes) and then removed. Urticaria typically develops <strong>after</strong> removal of the stimulus. Leaving the stimulus in contact with the skin until urticaria or angioedema actually appear can result in excessive exposure and systemic symptoms. Similarly, exposure time may need to be reduced in patients who describe unusual levels of sensitivity.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">When to refer</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients suspected of having a syndrome of physical urticaria should be referred to an allergy or dermatology specialist with experience in these disorders in the following situations:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The diagnosis is not apparent</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The condition does not respond adequately to initial therapy</p><p/><p>Referral is usually appropriate if a challenge procedure is being considered. Patients with past systemic <span class=\"nowrap\">reactions/anaphylaxis</span> should be referred to allergists specifically, because there is potential risk involved in challenging such patients and because they can educate patients about how to manage possible recurrent anaphylaxis, including use of an <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epinephrine-adrenaline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">epinephrine</a> autoinjector. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=long-term-management-of-patients-with-anaphylaxis#H7657169\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Long-term management of patients with anaphylaxis&quot;, section on 'Preparing the patient to treat possible recurrences'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h1\">OVERVIEW OF TREATMENT APPROACH</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The treatment of physical urticarias should be approached in a stepwise manner. Avoidance of the physical stimuli that induce symptoms should always be considered initially, although complete avoidance may not be possible or practical.</p><p>Pharmacologic therapy is often required, but variably successful. Certain types of physical urticarias (eg, dermographism) are responsive to antihistamines, while other forms (eg, local heat urticaria) are typically resistant. However, therapy must be individualized in each case, often by trial and error. In addition, most studies of therapy in these disorders were performed with first-generation sedating H1 antihistamines, and the relative effectiveness of the newer second-generation drugs has not been evaluated.</p><p>In most patients with a physical urticaria disorder who cannot avoid the stimulus, a trial of antihistamines is warranted. The approach outlined here is opinion-based, since trials comparing different regimens are lacking.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Second-generation H1 antihistamine &ndash; We usually begin with a second-generation H1 antihistamine at standard doses, but quickly increase to double the standard dose (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cetirizine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cetirizine</a> 10 mg twice daily, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fexofenadine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">fexofenadine</a> 180 mg twice daily, or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=loratadine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">loratadine</a> 10 mg twice daily), if needed. In chronic urticaria, doses up to four times the standard have been shown to be safe and effective, and this can be applied to more difficult cases of physical urticaria also [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/physical-urticarias/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>H2 antihistamine &ndash; If symptoms are not controlled, we add an H2 antihistamine at standard dose (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ranitidine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ranitidine</a> 150 mg twice daily). If there is no detectable improvement, the H2 antihistamine can be discontinued.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><a href=\"topic.htm?path=hydroxyzine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Hydroxyzine</a> &ndash; This agent may be dosed once at bedtime or alternatively in divided doses throughout the day. Adults may be given 10 or 25 mg initially at bedtime and increased in weekly increments as tolerated, typically up to a maximum of 100 mg as a single dose before bedtime. Alternatively, total daily doses of up to 100 to 200 mg may be given, divided into three or four doses in a 24-hour period. Sedating antihistamines may be used cautiously in children. Children &ge;6 years of age may be given up to 50 to 100 mg per day in divided doses.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><a href=\"topic.htm?path=doxepin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Doxepin</a> &ndash; In adults, doxepin may be initiated at 10 or 25 mg and increased in weekly increments up to 100 to 150 mg, given once at bedtime or alternatively in divided doses throughout the day. Doxepin is generally avoided in children &lt;12 years of age due to limited clinical experience. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=chronic-urticaria-standard-management-and-patient-education#H9\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Chronic urticaria: Standard management and patient education&quot;, section on 'H1 antihistamines'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H163443492\"><span class=\"h2\">Symptoms refractory to antihistamines</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>When symptoms of physical urticarias cannot be controlled with combinations of antihistamines, oral glucocorticoids may be used for short-term treatment and are usually very effective. This is most commonly appropriate for the persistent symptoms of delayed-pressure urticaria, as the urticarial lesions of many of the other types of physical urticarias are short-lived. We typically continue antihistamines and begin glucocorticoid therapy with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prednisone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">prednisone</a>, 0.5 to 1.0 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> daily. Symptoms usually improve within days. The dose can then be tapered gradually over two to four weeks to discontinuation or at least to &lt;10 mg per day. If the prednisone cannot be reduced to &lt;10 mg per day after two to four weeks or stopped entirely within two to three months, then an alternate, steroid-sparing agent should be considered, as the long-term side effects of glucocorticoids make chronic therapy undesirable. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=major-side-effects-of-systemic-glucocorticoids\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Major side effects of systemic glucocorticoids&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval of the monoclonal antibody, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=omalizumab-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">omalizumab</a>, in 2014 for patients with chronic idiopathic urticaria has opened up a new avenue in the treatment of patients with these difficult conditions. Individual case reports for each type of physical urticaria are discussed in the appropriate sections below. It is the practice of the authors to use omalizumab for physical urticaria in patients who have failed to respond adequately to a trial of avoidance of the offending trigger combined with a safe and practical dose of a second-generation antihistamine (ie, typically four times the standard dose).</p><p>Agents that have been found to be useful for particular physical urticaria syndromes are discussed in the sections below, as are alternate therapies for refractory disease. The treatment of chronic idiopathic urticaria is reviewed in detail separately.

Dermographism is the most common of the physical urticarias and is often an incidental finding in the evaluation of other skin conditions, most commonly atopic dermatitis, chronic idiopathic urticaria, and the other physical urticarias discussed in this topic.</p><p>There are several forms of dermographism (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F50823\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef50823 \">picture 3</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F61550\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef61550 \">picture 4</a>):</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Simple dermographism is the more common disorder, in which raised urticarial welts form on the skin with scratching or other stroking, but the skin is not pruritic.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Symptomatic dermographism is less common. In this disorder, the affected skin shows urticarial welts and is pruritic.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H277005042\"><span class=\"h2\">Epidemiology</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Simple dermographism is thought to occur in approximately 2 to 5 percent of the general population [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/physical-urticarias/abstract/4,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,5</a>]. The symptomatic forms of dermographism are much less common and usually occur sporadically, although there is a single case report of familial dermographism [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/physical-urticarias/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H277005048\"><span class=\"h2\">Clinical features</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In simple dermographism, a wheal is provoked by stroking, scratching, or rubbing the skin. The wheal typically appears within 6 to 7 minutes and begins to fade 15 to 30 minutes later [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/physical-urticarias/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. Symptomatic dermographism is only slightly different, with lesions appearing in less than 5 minutes and lasting 30 minutes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/physical-urticarias/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. In addition to classic wheals, variants of symptomatic dermographism have been described in which the reactions are follicular [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/physical-urticarias/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>] or inflamed and swollen (red dermographism) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/physical-urticarias/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].</p><p>Although a purposeful stroking of the skin is the most common way to elicit symptoms, patients often are unaware of the inciting action. Occasionally, idiopathic pruritus or pruritus caused by dry skin can be the event that elicits scratching and subsequent dermographism. In this setting, the wheals are typically linear. Simple actions, such as scratching, leaning against a solid object, or irritation from clothes or bed sheets, may provoke whealing. In one case series, dermographism could be exacerbated by hot water, emotion, exercise, or cold exposure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/physical-urticarias/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>].</p><p>Dermographism is typically idiopathic and begins without a clear inciting event. However, inflammatory perturbations may occasionally precede onset, as cases have been described in which symptomatic dermographism appeared to be triggered by infections with bacteria, fungi, and scabies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/physical-urticarias/abstract/11,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,12</a>] or after receiving penicillin [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/physical-urticarias/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>] or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=famotidine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">famotidine</a> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/physical-urticarias/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H277005054\"><span class=\"h2\">Pathogenesis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The cause of dermographism is unknown. The release of vasoactive mediators from cutaneous mast cells is assumed to be involved, and elevated levels of serum histamine have been demonstrated after a whealing episode [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/physical-urticarias/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. Experiments in which serum from a dermatographic patient injected intradermally into a monkey transferred dermographism suggest that the reaction may be immunoglobulin E (IgE)-mediated, although no allergen has been identified [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/physical-urticarias/abstract/15,16\" class=\"abstract_t\">15,16</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14\"><span class=\"h2\">Diagnostic testing</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In simple dermographism, a wheal is provoked by stroking the skin with a clean, firm object (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F50072\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef50072 \">table 1</a>). The wheal typically appears within 6 to 7 minutes and begins to fade 15 to 30 minutes later [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/physical-urticarias/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. Special testing devices are available [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/physical-urticarias/abstract/2,17\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,17</a>].

This involves first performing an exercise challenge (treadmill or stationary bicycle) to the point of sweating and for 15 minutes beyond. Wearing warm clothing <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> keeping the room warm facilitates the elicitation of symptoms. A positive test consists of the appearance of suggestive skin changes. If the exercise challenge is positive, then the next step is to perform a passive heat challenge. This should take place no earlier than 24 hours later. For this step, the patient's torso and limbs are submerged in a 42&deg;C bath for up to 15 minutes while recording body temperature to ensure a rise of &ge;1&deg;C.

Water may interact with sebum (the oily substance produced by sebaceous glands in the skin) to form a substance capable of acting as a direct mast cell degranulator, resulting in histamine release [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/physical-urticarias/abstract/77\" class=\"abstract_t\">77</a>]. One study demonstrated that patch testing with a patient's sweat produced only erythema, whereas testing with sweat and sebum produced marked urticaria [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/physical-urticarias/abstract/81\" class=\"abstract_t\">81</a>]. Others have proposed that the causative antigen(s) normally resides at the epidermal layer of the skin, and solubilization in water allows this antigen to diffuse more deeply into the skin [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/physical-urticarias/abstract/80\" class=\"abstract_t\">80</a>]. It is possible that different antigens in different skin layers are involved.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">In another study, removal of the stratum corneum layer of the skin enhanced reactivity upon contact with water [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/physical-urticarias/abstract/85\" class=\"abstract_t\">85</a>]. Similarly, pretreatment of the skin with organic solvents enhanced wheal formation to water. These investigators concluded that enhancing the ability of water to penetrate the stratum corneum layer of the skin increases the wheal-provoking effects of water in these patients.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Another theory suggested that activation of the cholinergic pathway was essential for the formation of aquagenic urticaria based upon the ability of the acetylcholine antagonist, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=scopolamine-hyoscine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">scopolamine</a>, to suppress wheal formation when applied to the skin before water exposure in two patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/physical-urticarias/abstract/85\" class=\"abstract_t\">85</a>]. However, other studies did not find evidence for a cholinergic mechanism, as pretreatment with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=atropine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">atropine</a> did not suppress subsequent wheal formation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/physical-urticarias/abstract/80\" class=\"abstract_t\">80</a>].

Limited exposures provoke only itching or burning erythema, while more prolonged exposures lead to typical wheals.

Areas of skin that frequently are exposed to sunlight are less sensitive than areas that are usually covered [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/physical-urticarias/abstract/107\" class=\"abstract_t\">107</a>]. The exact mechanism of this &quot;hardening&quot; phenomenon remains unknown [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/physical-urticarias/abstract/108\" class=\"abstract_t\">108</a>]. A more severe reaction may be provoked by purposeful sunbathing rather than by normal daily sunlight exposure.

This antigen can be activated in vivo or in vitro by irradiating a sample of the patient's serum [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/physical-urticarias/abstract/102\" class=\"abstract_t\">102</a>]. The origin of the precursor molecule has not been determined. The fact that passive transfer is not always successful could indicate that there are different photoallergens at work in different patients. Different classification systems have been proposed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/physical-urticarias/abstract/109\" class=\"abstract_t\">109</a>]. One group has suggested that the disorder be divided into two subtypes: type I solar urticaria, due to immunoglobulin E (IgE) antibodies directed against an abnormal photoallergen present only in affected patients, and type II solar urticaria, due to circulating IgE antibodies against a normal photoallergen present in most people [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/physical-urticarias/abstract/110\" class=\"abstract_t\">110</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H40\"><span class=\"h2\">Diagnosis and testing</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Clinical history may be sufficient to differentiate solar urticaria from other conditions. If there is clinical uncertainty, the diagnosis can be established using phototesting (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F50072\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef50072 \">table 1</a>). The patient should refrain from taking antihistamines for several days before the test.</p><p>A simple form of testing may be performed by exposing a small area of the patient's skin to natural sunlight, which induces erythema or urticaria. The reaction generally fades quickly after the test is halted. However, patients with cholinergic or local heat urticaria might react to this type of testing as well.</p><p>More formal evaluation is performed with light sources that emit specific wavelengths of light. Ultraviolet A (UVA) and ultraviolet B (UVB) light sources are available for this purpose. In certain instances, it may be necessary to evaluate visible light sources as well [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/physical-urticarias/abstract/111\" class=\"abstract_t\">111</a>]. Most patients demonstrate a threshold wavelength at which symptoms develop, which is referred to as the action spectrum. In some patients, testing with monochromatic light failed to provoke urticaria, although exposure to other light sources, such as natural sunlight, high-intensity ultraviolet light, or slide-projector light, did cause symptoms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/physical-urticarias/abstract/103\" class=\"abstract_t\">103</a>]. These methods are unlikely to be practical for most clinicians, but are mentioned for academic and research interest.</p><p>Some patients exhibit an inhibition spectrum, which when applied to the skin during or immediately after the action spectrum, inhibits the development of the wheal reaction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/physical-urticarias/abstract/112\" class=\"abstract_t\">112</a>]. However, application of the inhibition spectrum before the action spectrum does not prevent symptoms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/physical-urticarias/abstract/102\" class=\"abstract_t\">102</a>], so this phenomenon has no immediate clinical utility.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H277005012\"><span class=\"h2\">Differential diagnosis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A variety of photosensitive disorders has been described. The symptoms of solar urticaria could initially be mistaken for common sunburn; however, the lesions of solar urticaria develop within minutes of sun exposure. Two other disorders that can present with symptoms similar to solar urticaria are polymorphous light eruption and erythropoietic protoporphyria (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=approach-to-the-patient-with-macular-skin-lesions#H3\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Approach to the patient with macular skin lesions&quot;, section on 'Photodistributed macular eruptions'</a>):</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Polymorphous light eruption</strong> &ndash; In this idiopathic condition, which is far more common than solar urticaria, papular and papular-vesicular lesions appear on sun-exposed areas, although there is less of a predilection for the face (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F55477\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef55477 \">picture 7</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F67216\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef67216 \">picture 8</a>). In northern climates, patients may develop symptoms with the first full sun exposure of the season. The lesions of polymorphous light eruption tend to last two to six days, which usually allows differentiation from solar urticaria, in which lesions resolve within 24 hours. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=polymorphous-light-eruption\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Polymorphous light eruption&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Erythropoietic protoporphyria</strong> &ndash; Erythropoietic protoporphyria can demonstrate urticaria on sun-exposed areas, although the lesions are typically painful rather than pruritic. It usually presents in early childhood, and there is a family history of the disorder. The cutaneous lesions of erythropoietic protoporphyria can develop within minutes of sun exposure, and diffuse edema of the skin in sun-exposed areas may resemble angioedema. Petechiae and purpuric lesions may be seen. With time, the skin may become lichenified and leathery, with labial grooving and nail changes (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F68503\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef68503 \">picture 9</a>). This disorder is reviewed separately.

The reaction is not immune-mediated and can occur in any individual in whom the threshold concentration of the chemical or drug has been reached. Common culprits include tetracyclines and thiazides. Phototoxic reactions appear as exaggerated sunburn (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F69140%7EDERM%2F86479%7EDERM%2F90426\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef69140 graphicRef86479 graphicRef90426 \">picture 10A-C</a>). In severe cases, vesicles or bullae may form. The reaction usually evolves within minutes to hours of sun exposure and is restricted to exposed skin. Drug-induced toxicity can usually be distinguished from solar urticaria, as patients with the former are taking a photosensitizing medication and complain of burning rather than pruritus. In some situations, phototesting may be necessary to differentiate between the two disorders. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=photosensitivity-disorders-photodermatoses-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-treatment#H22\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Photosensitivity disorders (photodermatoses): Clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and treatment&quot;, section on 'Phototoxicity'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Photoallergic reactions</strong> &ndash; Photoallergic reactions are a form of contact dermatitis caused by an antigen that has become allergenic as a result of exposure to ultraviolet radiation. Photoallergic reactions are typically pruritic, eczematous eruptions in sun-exposed areas of skin. The responsible mechanism is delayed-type hypersensitivity, with symptoms developing 24 to 48 hours after sun exposure, which is significantly more delayed than solar urticaria. Photoallergic reactions are most common with topical agents (eg, sunscreen, antimicrobials), although systemic agents (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=quinidine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">quinidine</a>) can also cause these reactions (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F63557\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef63557 \">picture 11</a>).

Cutaneous SLE most commonly presents with a characteristic facial eruption (butterfly rash) or, less commonly, as a generalized eruption. Biopsy of affected skin can distinguish this from solar urticaria. In addition, lesions of cutaneous lupus are more persistent than solar urticaria. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-cutaneous-lupus-erythematosus\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of cutaneous lupus erythematosus&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Brachioradial pruritus</strong> &ndash; Brachioradial pruritus presents as localized pruritus involving the proximal dorsolateral forearm. The pathogenesis is unclear, although it is often thought to be a localized neuropathic pruritus of the arms and forearms that can also involve the shoulders and neck. Symptoms may be intermittent, unilateral, or bilateral. Sun exposure may be a contributing factor, as affected individuals often state that sun exposure provokes the disease. People with brachioradial pruritus complain of burning and stinging rather than pruritus, and do not have any cutaneous lesions, only the discomfort. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pruritus-etiology-and-patient-evaluation#H690928\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pruritus: Etiology and patient evaluation&quot;, section on 'Brachioradial pruritus'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H42\"><span class=\"h2\">Treatment</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>H1 antihistamines provide symptomatic treatment and can be used orally or topically. These medications are effective in reducing pruritus and wheal formation, but may not eliminate the erythema. In most of the initial studies, terfenadine was used, and higher than standard doses often were required to achieve symptom relief [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/physical-urticarias/abstract/111,113\" class=\"abstract_t\">111,113</a>]. Whether this finding is true for all antihistamines, including some of the newer agents remains to be determined. Topical and systemic glucocorticoids can be used if antihistamines are insufficient.

Other case reports of patients with vibratory angioedema are not familial and generally related to the subject's occupation.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H277005030\"><span class=\"h2\">Clinical features</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Common triggers for vibratory angioedema include mowing the lawn, riding a motorcycle, horseback riding, or mountain biking. At risk occupations include jackhammer operator, machinist [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/physical-urticarias/abstract/129\" class=\"abstract_t\">129</a>], carpenter [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/physical-urticarias/abstract/129\" class=\"abstract_t\">129</a>], and metal grinder [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/physical-urticarias/abstract/130\" class=\"abstract_t\">130</a>].</p><p>Patients generally complain of local pruritus, erythema, and swelling arising within a few minutes after exposure to vibration and affecting the area that was most exposed to the stimulus (often the hands). There are rare cases of delayed-onset symptoms beginning one to two hours after exposure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/physical-urticarias/abstract/131\" class=\"abstract_t\">131</a>]. Symptoms peak in severity at 4 to 6 hours and typically resolve by 24 hours. In some episodes, the symptoms may persist for several days. The severity and duration of the symptoms may vary and seem to be proportional to the intensity and duration of the applied vibratory stimulus and to the area of exposed body surface. An early report described systemic symptoms of headache and generalized erythema [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/physical-urticarias/abstract/127\" class=\"abstract_t\">127</a>]. Another report described a severe case with accompanying dizziness, tachycardia, and hypotension [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/physical-urticarias/abstract/132\" class=\"abstract_t\">132</a>]. One patient developed carpal tunnel syndrome and slowed median nerve conduction that was documented only during episodes of edema [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/physical-urticarias/abstract/130\" class=\"abstract_t\">130</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H277005036\"><span class=\"h2\">Pathogenesis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In autosomal dominant vibratory urticaria, a gain-of-function mutation in the gene <em>ADGRE2</em> (adhesion G protein-coupled receptor E2, also called <em>EMR2</em>) has been implicated [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/physical-urticarias/abstract/133\" class=\"abstract_t\">133</a>]. <em>ADGRE2</em> encodes a cell surface receptor that is normally inhibitory on mast cells, but the mutated form renders the cell susceptible to degranulation following exposure to vibration. This receptor may be a component of an innate immune response to noxious physical stimuli.</p><p>The pathogenesis of sporadic vibratory angioedema has not been satisfactorily elucidated yet. Elevated levels of serum histamine and mast cell degranulation have been documented during symptomatic episodes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/physical-urticarias/abstract/129,131,134\" class=\"abstract_t\">129,131,134</a>]. Most investigators favor a nonimmunologic reaction (eg, direct mast cell stimulation from the vibration causes degranulation and local release of histamine), and passive transfer experiments have been negative [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/physical-urticarias/abstract/127,134\" class=\"abstract_t\">127,134</a>]. In a study of vibration exercise in 37 healthy subjects, approximately one-half developed a pruritic erythematous eruption [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/physical-urticarias/abstract/135\" class=\"abstract_t\">135</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H47\"><span class=\"h2\">Diagnostic testing</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Several methods for reproducing the vibratory stimulus and classifying the reaction have been used in the literature [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/physical-urticarias/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. The patient should refrain from taking antihistamines for several days before the test. The subject's arm is held on a level plane and a vortex mixer is placed in contact with the skin (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F50072\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef50072 \">table 1</a>). The vibratory stimulus is applied for 10 minutes, although this may need to be reduced for very sensitive patients, and the site is observed for five to six hours. The test is considered positive if the area becomes erythematous, pruritic, and edematous around the full circumference of the arm, although one study found that this test also induced a positive response in 7 of 20 normal volunteers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/physical-urticarias/abstract/136\" class=\"abstract_t\">136</a>], suggesting that this response may not be entirely abnormal. Dermographism and pressure urticaria should be excluded using the appropriate tests.

These syndromes often occur in children and adults with chronic idiopathic urticaria. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'General points about physical urticarias'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The more common physical urticaria syndromes include dermographism, cholinergic urticaria, and delayed-pressure <span class=\"nowrap\">urticaria/angioedema</span>. (See <a href=\"#H10\" class=\"local\">'Dermographism'</a> above and <a href=\"#H16\" class=\"local\">'Delayed-pressure urticaria/angioedema'</a> above and <a href=\"#H20\" class=\"local\">'Cholinergic urticaria'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Rare disorders include <span class=\"nowrap\">urticaria/angioedema</span> following exposure to heat, exercise, water, sunlight, or vibration. (See <a href=\"#H2199347901\" class=\"local\">'Local heat urticaria'</a> above and <a href=\"#H28\" class=\"local\">'Exercise-induced urticaria/anaphylaxis'</a> above and <a href=\"#H29\" class=\"local\">'Aquagenic urticaria'</a> above and <a href=\"#H36\" class=\"local\">'Solar urticaria'</a> above and <a href=\"#H43\" class=\"local\">'Vibratory angioedema'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Physical urticarias can often be diagnosed based upon history and physical examination. In some cases, physical challenge procedures are needed to clarify or confirm the responsible trigger (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F50072\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef50072 \">table 1</a>). (See <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'Testing'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The management of physical urticaria begins with accurate identification and avoidance of the triggering stimulus. (See <a href=\"#H9\" class=\"local\">'Overview of treatment approach'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For initial pharmacotherapy for the majority of patients with a physical urticaria, we suggest a less sedating, second-generation antihistamine (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). Options include <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cetirizine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cetirizine</a> (10 mg daily), <a href=\"topic.htm?path=loratadine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">loratadine</a> (10 mg daily), or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fexofenadine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">fexofenadine</a> (180 mg daily). Many patients will require a doubling of the standard dose to impact symptoms significantly (eg, cetirizine, 10 mg twice daily). (See <a href=\"#H9\" class=\"local\">'Overview of treatment approach'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>If symptoms do not respond adequately to antihistamines, management proceeds in a stepwise manner and includes H2 antihistamines, first-generation H1 antihistamines, and in some cases, limited courses of systemic glucocorticoids. (See <a href=\"#H9\" class=\"local\">'Overview of treatment approach'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients who fail to respond to avoidance of the triggering stimulus combined with safe and practical doses of a second-generation antihistamine should be considered candidates for chronic therapy with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=omalizumab-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">omalizumab</a>. Other therapies for refractory disease, depending upon the specific disorder, include phototherapy, physical desensitization protocols, and immunomodulatory agents.
