The complement system provides immediate defense against infection and has proinflammatory effects.</p><p>MBL deficiency has been variously defined as a serum levels either &lt;100 or &lt;500 <span class=\"nowrap\">ng/mL</span>. It is a laboratory finding that does not necessarily equate to a clinical disorder. Numerous case-control studies with widely varying methodologies have reported that MBL deficiency is associated with a large and heterogeneous group of disease processes. However, subnormal levels are also found in healthy people. To date, there is no consensus on the clinical relevance of MBL deficiency or its treatment.</p><p>This topic reviews the genetics, epidemiology, diagnosis, and management of MBL deficiency and also reviews diseases associated with both low and high levels of MBL. Genetic defects and polymorphisms of the <em>MBL2</em> gene, the function of the MBL protein, and other disorders of the complement system are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=mannose-binding-lectin\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Mannose-binding lectin&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=inherited-disorders-of-the-complement-system\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Inherited disorders of the complement system&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acquired-deficiencies-of-the-complement-system\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Acquired deficiencies of the complement system&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">EPIDEMIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Genetic variants within the mannose-binding lectin 2 (<em>MBL2</em>) gene are extremely common [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mannose-binding-lectin-deficiency/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>]. Heterozygosity, or the presence of a DNA variant in one <em>MBL2</em> allele, is found in more than 30 percent of the population in most ethnic groups evaluated. Thus, up to 40 percent of most populations may have single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in one or both <em>MBL2</em> alleles [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mannose-binding-lectin-deficiency/abstract/3,4\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,4</a>].

However, the MBL serum phenotype is gene-dose dependent, so inheritance cannot be defined as dominant or recessive. The level of functional MBL is decreased by as much as 90 percent, even in heterozygotes. The effect of the D allele in heterozygotes is less dramatic than that of the B or C alleles. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=mannose-binding-lectin#H2\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Mannose-binding lectin&quot;, section on 'The MBL gene'</a>.)</p><p>The B variant mutation occurs at an allele frequency of approximately 25 percent in Eurasian populations but is virtually absent in sub-Saharan West Africa [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mannose-binding-lectin-deficiency/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. The C variant is absent among Asians and American Indians, is rare among Caucasians, but is commonly seen in sub-Saharan African populations, with a frequency of 50 to 60 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mannose-binding-lectin-deficiency/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. The D allele occurs with lower frequency than the B or C alleles and appears to be confined to Caucasians and northern East African populations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mannose-binding-lectin-deficiency/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].</p><p>In addition to the three variants in exon 1, there are several other single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) located in the <em>MBL2</em> promoter region that are associated with decreased MBL serum concentration (variants <span class=\"nowrap\">H/L,</span> <span class=\"nowrap\">Y/X,</span> and <span class=\"nowrap\">P/Q)</span>. There are many possible combinations of exon 1 variants and promoter SNPs. However, only seven common haplotypes are found in humans:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Promoter haplotypes associated with a normal (&quot;wild-type&quot;) exon 1 haplotype include HYPA, LYPA, LYQA, and LXPA, which have high, high-intermediate, intermediate, and low promoter activity, respectively.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The genotype O variant haplotypes include HYPD, LYPB, and LYQC.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The LXPA haplotype, with its low promoter activity, is present in 24 percent of Caucasians and, as such, is the most common cause of MBL deficiency in this group (either LXPA homozygous or LXPA plus a variant haplotype).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>LYPB is the most common variant haplotype in Asians and Caucasians (22 and 12 percent, respectively) but is rare in Africans [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mannose-binding-lectin-deficiency/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>LYQC is the haplotype most often found in Africans (24 percent) but is uncommon in Caucasians and Asians.</p><p/><p>Normal homozygotes (genotype <span class=\"nowrap\">A/A</span> other than <span class=\"nowrap\">LXPA/LXPA)</span> generally have MBL levels above 1000 <span class=\"nowrap\">ng/mL,</span> with levels up to 10,000 <span class=\"nowrap\">ng/mL</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mannose-binding-lectin-deficiency/abstract/8,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,9</a>]. Heterozygous individuals (HYPA, LYPA, <span class=\"nowrap\">LYQA/O</span> genotypes) have approximately one-sixth to one-eighth the normal functional level of MBL, with levels generally ranging from 500 to 1000 <span class=\"nowrap\">ng/mL</span>. Individuals homozygous for variant <em>MBL2</em> alleles (genotype <span class=\"nowrap\">O/O)</span> usually have levels &lt;50 <span class=\"nowrap\">ng/mL</span>. Similar levels are seen in patients with the promoter variants LXPA haplotype on either two genes or on one gene with the B, C, or D allele on the other. One patient was reported with undetectable MBL (&lt;20 <span class=\"nowrap\">ng/mL)</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mannose-binding-lectin-deficiency/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. The combination of mutations in exon 1 and the promoter region results in a dramatic variation in MBL concentrations of up to 1000-fold in apparently healthy individuals.</p><p>The high worldwide prevalence of MBL deficiency or low protein-producing alleles appears to be caused exclusively by human migration and genetic drift, indicating that <em>MBL2</em> variation does not have a strong effect on population fitness [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mannose-binding-lectin-deficiency/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. However, other data suggest that MBL deficiency may have an evolutionary advantage. The diverse role of MBL in innate immunity, particularly its effects on infectious disease susceptibility, may have led to selection for the heterozygous states of <em>MBL2</em>. There are several processes by which MBL heterozygosity may be advantageous in an evolutionary sense, including protection against adverse effects of various infectious diseases and lethal manifestations of atherosclerosis, a disease which now seems to have a more ancient history than previously assumed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mannose-binding-lectin-deficiency/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. In addition, high MBL production (normal genotype A) is associated with preterm birth compared with intermediate MBL production (variant genotype B) and low MBL production (variant genotype C) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mannose-binding-lectin-deficiency/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Physiology</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Circulating MBL in the newborn, measured in umbilical cord blood, is of fetal, not maternal, origin [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mannose-binding-lectin-deficiency/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. Levels in term infants are two-thirds that of their mothers and reach adult levels in approximately one month.</p><p>Plasma levels of MBL are stable over time in individuals [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mannose-binding-lectin-deficiency/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. No circadian variation is described. Physical exercise does not affect levels [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mannose-binding-lectin-deficiency/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. MBL is reported to behave like an acute-phase reactant, although levels increase only approximately 1.5-fold one to two weeks after the inciting event and show variation between individuals [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mannose-binding-lectin-deficiency/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. Persons with low levels of MBL do not reach serum levels of wild-type individuals during an acute-phase response.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL MANIFESTATIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Many individuals suffer no sequelae from low MBL levels, since there is marked redundancy in the immune system [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mannose-binding-lectin-deficiency/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. If there is an increased susceptibility to infection, it is most likely to be apparent in patients with MBL deficiency when additional factors that severely compromise the immune system are present [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mannose-binding-lectin-deficiency/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. The role of MBL in autoimmune disorders is also not obvious.</p><p>Overall, individuals appear to benefit from normal levels of MBL. However, in some cases, low levels appear to be advantageous [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mannose-binding-lectin-deficiency/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. This dual effect is called heterosis.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h2\">Infection</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The innate immune system constitutes the principal defense against infection when the adaptive immune response is either immature or compromised. In certain individuals, deficiency of MBL is associated with an increased frequency of pyogenic infections, especially encapsulated bacteria, due to defective opsonization. Low levels of MBL are associated with increased susceptibility to and severity of certain infections. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=an-overview-of-the-innate-immune-system#H9421023\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;An overview of the innate immune system&quot;, section on 'Collectins'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h3\">Immunocompromised hosts</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>An increased incidence of infectious disease is seen in immunocompromised individuals and immunologically immature neonates and infants who are also MBL deficient. Patients may be immunocompromised for a number of reasons, including immunologic immaturity, acute critical illness, chronic disease, chemotherapy, transplantation, major surgery, and other immunodeficiencies.</p><p>An opsonization defect was the first recognition of MBL deficiency in infants and young children that presented with recurrent upper respiratory tract infections (URIs), chronic diarrhea, and failure to thrive [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mannose-binding-lectin-deficiency/abstract/20-25\" class=\"abstract_t\">20-25</a>]. Subsequent studies found an increased risk of acute URIs in older infants with MBL insufficiency [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mannose-binding-lectin-deficiency/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. However, the data in children are contradictory regarding the possible association of MBL levels with sepsis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mannose-binding-lectin-deficiency/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>] and lower respiratory symptoms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mannose-binding-lectin-deficiency/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. Concomitant specific antibody deficiency is common in children with MBL deficiency [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mannose-binding-lectin-deficiency/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. These patients have more frequent episodes of otitis media, pneumonia, and sepsis and are more likely to receive prophylactic antibiotics <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> <a href=\"topic.htm?path=immune-globulin-intravenous-subcutaneous-and-intramsucular-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">immune globulin</a> replacement therapy than children with MBL deficiency alone. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=specific-antibody-deficiency\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Specific antibody deficiency&quot;</a>.)</p><p>MBL levels are inversely correlated with the frequency of lower respiratory tract infections and bronchiectasis in patients with common variable immunodeficiency. MBL deficiency may also be found in combination with immunoglobulin G2 (IgG2) deficiency in infants and young children who present with recurrent infections. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=igg-subclass-deficiency\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;IgG subclass deficiency&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=common-variable-immunodeficiency-in-children\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Common variable immunodeficiency in children&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-epidemiology-and-diagnosis-of-common-variable-immunodeficiency-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations, epidemiology, and diagnosis of common variable immunodeficiency in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p>MBL deficiency is associated with an increased rate of infections in patients who have undergone solid organ transplantation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mannose-binding-lectin-deficiency/abstract/30-34\" class=\"abstract_t\">30-34</a>], hematopoietic cell transplantation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mannose-binding-lectin-deficiency/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>], or major gastrointestinal surgery for malignant disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mannose-binding-lectin-deficiency/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>]. In patients with cystic fibrosis, MBL deficiency is associated with earlier colonization with <em>Pseudomonas</em>, more rapid decline in lung function, and earlier death secondary to end-stage lung disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mannose-binding-lectin-deficiency/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cystic-fibrosis-genetics-and-pathogenesis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Cystic fibrosis: Genetics and pathogenesis&quot;</a>.)</p><p>It is clear that MBL deficiency does not increase the risk of infection in critically ill patients. A European study of 1839 patients admitted to critical care units with sepsis caused by community-acquired pneumonia or peritonitis and 477 controls found no increased risk of sepsis-related mortality at 28 days or six months [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mannose-binding-lectin-deficiency/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>]. In most studies of patients receiving chemotherapy, MBL deficiency was associated with more prolonged episodes of febrile neutropenia and serious infections, such as bacteremia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mannose-binding-lectin-deficiency/abstract/8,39,40\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,39,40</a>]. However, this association was not seen in patients who were severely neutropenic or who had acute myeloid leukemia, most likely because the significant impairment in phagocytosis in these patients blunted any effect of MBL deficiency [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mannose-binding-lectin-deficiency/abstract/8,41,42\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,41,42</a>].</p><p>The role of MBL in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection and progression has been debated for several years. MBL is able to bind to the envelope protein of the HIV-1 virus (gp120) because it is highly glycosylated with N-linked carbohydrates [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mannose-binding-lectin-deficiency/abstract/43,44\" class=\"abstract_t\">43,44</a>]. Thus, it is conceivable that MBL-mediated complement activation could facilitate the immune response directed against HIV infection. However, reports on the effects of MBL on HIV infection and progression are contradictory. Results on the effect of MBL on HIV disease progression have ranged from finding no effect [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mannose-binding-lectin-deficiency/abstract/45-47\" class=\"abstract_t\">45-47</a>] to a negative effect of high MBL and a beneficial effect of low MBL [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mannose-binding-lectin-deficiency/abstract/48,49\" class=\"abstract_t\">48,49</a>]. However, subsequent literature seems to point towards a beneficial effect of high MBL levels and a negative effect of low MBL [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mannose-binding-lectin-deficiency/abstract/50-63\" class=\"abstract_t\">50-63</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h3\">People with no other identified immunodeficiency</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There are also data that suggest an association between MBL deficiency and respiratory tract infections in adults [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mannose-binding-lectin-deficiency/abstract/64\" class=\"abstract_t\">64</a>]. A higher prevalence of severe MBL deficiency (MBL level &le;50 <span class=\"nowrap\">ng/mL)</span> was seen in one case-control study of patients with a history of recurrent <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> severe infections, particularly respiratory tract infections [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mannose-binding-lectin-deficiency/abstract/65\" class=\"abstract_t\">65</a>]. This difference persisted even in the absence of concomitant immunodeficiency. However, the existence of other cofactors that influence the clinical phenotype in patients with MBL deficiency was suspected in this study for several reasons. Patients with severe MBL deficiency and recurrent <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> severe infections had a broad spectrum of clinical severity. No correlation was seen between severe MBL deficiency and severity of infection. Onset of recurrent <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> severe infections was not until adolescence or adulthood despite presumed longstanding MBL deficiency. In addition, a number of control subjects with no significant infection history had severe MBL deficiency.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14\"><span class=\"h2\">Autoimmunity</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In the presence of MBL deficiency, chronic inflammatory conditions may be more severe. Low MBL serum levels and <em>MBL2</em> genetic polymorphisms with corresponding impaired MBL function appear to affect several autoimmune diseases.</p><p>It is generally assumed that the recognition of self-determinants is confined to the adaptive immune system and that the innate immune system plays little role in autoimmunity. However, evidence is growing that the innate immune system may contribute to autoimmunity, either by priming or promoting aggressive immune responses [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mannose-binding-lectin-deficiency/abstract/66,67\" class=\"abstract_t\">66,67</a>].</p><p>A major pathophysiologic concept of autoimmunity is impaired apoptotic cell clearance. MBL facilitates the clearance of apoptotic cells [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mannose-binding-lectin-deficiency/abstract/68,69\" class=\"abstract_t\">68,69</a>]. Membrane carbohydrates are altered when a cell goes into apoptosis, leading to increased expression of fucose and N-acetyl-glucosamine [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mannose-binding-lectin-deficiency/abstract/70,71\" class=\"abstract_t\">70,71</a>]. Redistribution or clustering of glycoproteins expressed on apoptotic cells may enable MBL to bind to these carbohydrates, thereby facilitating clearance [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mannose-binding-lectin-deficiency/abstract/72,73\" class=\"abstract_t\">72,73</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15\"><span class=\"h3\">Rheumatoid arthritis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The data on the effect of MBL levels and rheumatoid arthritis are variable, depending upon patient factors and outcomes studied [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mannose-binding-lectin-deficiency/abstract/74-80\" class=\"abstract_t\">74-80</a>]. Early disease onset and findings linked with poor prognosis, including reactive systemic amyloidosis and increased joint erosions and inflammation, are generally associated with low MBL levels [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mannose-binding-lectin-deficiency/abstract/74-79\" class=\"abstract_t\">74-79</a>].

This finding is in accord with previous findings of increased serum concentrations of MBL in patients with rheumatoid arthritis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mannose-binding-lectin-deficiency/abstract/82\" class=\"abstract_t\">82</a>].</p><p>MBL deficiency does not increase susceptibility to juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA), but it is associated with a younger age at onset of polyarticular JIA [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mannose-binding-lectin-deficiency/abstract/83\" class=\"abstract_t\">83</a>]. On the other hand, MBL-deficient children with oligoarticular JIA are more likely to go into remission than MBL-sufficient children.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H16\"><span class=\"h3\">Systemic lupus erythematosus</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There are mixed reports regarding the relationship between MBL deficiency and systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), although, on balance, low MBL levels are associated with SLE [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mannose-binding-lectin-deficiency/abstract/84-86\" class=\"abstract_t\">84-86</a>].

Testing includes total hemolytic complement (CH50), alternative pathway hemolytic (AH50), and MBL assays. This testing is reviewed in greater detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-and-clinical-assessment-of-the-complement-system\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview and clinical assessment of the complement system&quot;</a>.)</p><p>There is no role for routine testing of MBL genotype or serum concentration in children with chronic wet cough [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mannose-binding-lectin-deficiency/abstract/115\" class=\"abstract_t\">115</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H24\"><span class=\"h2\">Laboratory evaluation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There is a strong correlation between MBL serum concentration and MBL activity. Thus, antigenic measurement of MBL serum concentration is an appropriate screening test for MBL deficiency. However, this method will not detect rarer causes of impairment of the lectin pathway due to mutations in the mannan-binding lectin-associated protease (MASP) or ficolin genes. The activation assay is an alternative test that can detect impairment due to MBL, MASP, or ficolin defects [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mannose-binding-lectin-deficiency/abstract/116\" class=\"abstract_t\">116</a>]. Separate testing for opsonic activity is not necessary, since it is always low in cases of MBL deficiency.

Testing only by genotyping is not recommended, because MBL levels can differ by 10-fold in individuals with identical genotypes for all of the known MBL variants [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mannose-binding-lectin-deficiency/abstract/114\" class=\"abstract_t\">114</a>]. In addition, patients with low levels of MBL can be missed by genotyping for only the exon 1 variants but not the promoter polymorphisms (eg, patients with the LXPA haplotype would be grouped with those with normal MBL levels). The other components of the lectin pathway, the MASPs and ficolins, can be analyzed if the <em>MBL2</em> gene is normal.
