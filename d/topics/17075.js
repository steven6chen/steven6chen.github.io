In the northern hemisphere, this yearly epidemic begins with an increase in the number of rhinovirus infections in September [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-common-cold-in-children-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>], followed by parainfluenza viruses in October and November.

Adenovirus infections are continuously present at a low rate throughout the common cold season.

The risk of person-to-person transfer is dependent upon the amount of time people spend together, the proximity of their contact with one another, and the amount of virus shed by the infected patient. In experimental studies, rhinovirus was efficiently transferred from hand to hand after minimal contact (10 seconds) and subsequent contact with nasal or conjunctival mucosa resulted in infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-common-cold-in-children-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. Particle aerosols were an inefficient method of rhinovirus transmission [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-common-cold-in-children-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/10,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,11</a>]. However, both influenza virus and coronavirus can be transmitted via aerosols.

Low titers of rhinovirus are present in saliva in approximately one-half of infected individuals. Viral contamination of the hands of infected individuals is common. Rhinoviruses may remain viable on human skin for as long as two hours [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-common-cold-in-children-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. Rhinoviruses also can survive for up to one day on inanimate surfaces, although porous materials such as tissues and cotton handkerchiefs do not appear to support virus survival [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-common-cold-in-children-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/12-15\" class=\"abstract_t\">12-15</a>].</p><p>Surface contamination of pediatric office toys with respiratory viral ribonucleic acid (RNA) does not appear to be an important method of transfer. In an observational study, approximately 20 percent of the toys in a pediatric office waiting room were contaminated with picornavirus RNA (rhinovirus or enterovirus). Cleaning with a disposable germicidal wipe (containing quaternary ammonium with alcohol) was only modestly effective in removing the viral RNA, but transfer from the toys to the fingers was inefficient [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-common-cold-in-children-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H199066530\"><span class=\"h2\">Period of infectivity</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Rhinovirus shedding peaks on the third day after inoculation; this coincides with a peak in symptoms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-common-cold-in-children-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/17,18\" class=\"abstract_t\">17,18</a>].

After deposition on nasal or conjunctival mucosa, cold viruses attach to receptors on epithelial cells in the nasopharynx and enter the cells [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-common-cold-in-children-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. During rhinovirus infection, viral replication occurs in only a small number of nasal epithelial cells [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-common-cold-in-children-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/20,21\" class=\"abstract_t\">20,21</a>]. The infected cells release cytokines, including interleukin (IL)-8, which attracts polymorphonuclear cells (PMNs) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-common-cold-in-children-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/22-24\" class=\"abstract_t\">22-24</a>]. Large numbers of PMNs (100-fold increase) accumulate in the nasal secretions and mucociliary clearance is slowed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-common-cold-in-children-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>].</p><p>Symptoms usually appear one to two days after viral inoculation, coinciding with the influx of PMNs in the nasal submucosa and epithelium [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-common-cold-in-children-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/25-27\" class=\"abstract_t\">25-27</a>]. The severity of symptoms correlates with mucosal IL-8 concentrations. A change in the character of the nasal discharge from clear to <span class=\"nowrap\">yellow/white</span> or green correlates with the increase in PMNs but not with an increase in positive bacterial cultures [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-common-cold-in-children-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. The colored discharge may signify the presence of PMNs (yellow or white) or of PMN enzymatic activity (green color).</p><p>By an unknown mechanism, rhinovirus infection increases vascular permeability in the nasal submucosa, releasing albumin and kinins (bradykinin), which may then contribute to the symptoms of the common cold [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-common-cold-in-children-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/25,29\" class=\"abstract_t\">25,29</a>].
