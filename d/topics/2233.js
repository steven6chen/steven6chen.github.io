The World Health organization (WHO), the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP), the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG), and the United States Preventive Services Task Force all recommend breastfeeding for the first six months of life [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/breastfeeding-the-preterm-infant/abstract/1-5\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-5</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=infant-benefits-of-breastfeeding\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Infant benefits of breastfeeding&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=maternal-and-economic-benefits-of-breastfeeding\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Maternal and economic benefits of breastfeeding&quot;</a>.)</p><p>However, mothers of vulnerable infants, such as preterm infants, encounter a variety of unique breastfeeding barriers and challenges that result in a decreased rate of breastfeeding in preterm compared with term infants [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/breastfeeding-the-preterm-infant/abstract/4,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,6</a>]. As an example, in Massachusetts, breastfeeding initiation rates were 77, 70, and 63 percent in term infants, infants born between 32 and 36 weeks gestation, and those born between 24 and 31 weeks, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/breastfeeding-the-preterm-infant/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. These results emphasize the need to address the breastfeeding barriers in the maternal-preterm infant dyad, especially as the benefits of human milk are well-established in these infants.

The nutritional composition of human milk, fortification of human milk for premature infants, and approach to enteral feeds in the preterm infant are discussed separately.

(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=breastfeeding-parental-education-and-support\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Breastfeeding: Parental education and support&quot;</a>.)</p><p>In the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU), further educational efforts are needed to address the specific breastfeeding needs of parents with preterm infants. In most cases, mothers who deliver prematurely have not made a final decision on whether to breastfeed their infant and may not have the necessary information to make an informed decision. Clinical staff should discuss the benefits of human milk, including the long-term effects of exclusive breastfeeding. In most cases, mothers opt to feed their infant breast milk, and are willing to express when they learn about the benefits of human milk [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/breastfeeding-the-preterm-infant/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].</p><p>In one retrospective study from the California Perinatal Quality Care Collaborative, 61 percent of very low birth weight infants (birth weight &lt;1500 g) were fed breast milk or breast milk supplemented with formula at discharge [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/breastfeeding-the-preterm-infant/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. After adjusting for birth weight and gestational age, factors associated with lower rates of breast milk feeding were lack of prenatal care, maternal age less than 20 years, and maternal <span class=\"nowrap\">race/ethnicity</span> of either Hispanic or African-American background. Mothers with one or more of these risk factors may benefit from additional support to promote breast milk feeding. </p><p>Maternal feeding goals are not static. This was shown in a prospective study of 352 mothers (53 percent black; 70 percent low-income) of preterm infants [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/breastfeeding-the-preterm-infant/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. Prior to delivery, 55 percent of mothers had planned to provide exclusive breast milk. However, during the NICU hospitalization, only 10 percent of mothers chose exclusive at-breast feeding, and rates were especially low for black mothers. </p><p>Because many preterm infants cannot initially feed at the breast, mothers need instructions regarding expression and collection of milk. At the point that the infant can breastfeed, mothers require additional instructions on how best to initiate breastfeeding and postdischarge breastfeeding management [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/breastfeeding-the-preterm-infant/abstract/10,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,11</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=breast-milk-expression-for-the-preterm-infant\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Breast milk expression for the preterm infant&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The efforts to promote breastfeeding should be directed and coordinated by a clinician with expertise in both lactation and intensive neonatal care. Staff should have a comprehensive understanding of the benefits of breastfeeding, and the policy and procedures of the lactation support service, and be trained to implement the policy. Optimal care practice policy, which promotes breastfeeding, is outlined in the criteria required for the World Health Organization and the United Nations Children's Fund Baby-Friendly Hospital Initiative, and is discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=initiation-of-breastfeeding#H2\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Initiation of breastfeeding&quot;, section on 'Hospital environment'</a>.)</p><p>When NICUs adopt policies that promote breastfeeding, even the smallest premature infants can successfully receive breast milk. This was illustrated in one study of 239 very low birth weight survivors (birth weight &lt;1500 g) that reported 60 percent of infants were fed breast milk at the time of final discharge, and 40 percent were exclusively formula fed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/breastfeeding-the-preterm-infant/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. In this NICU, mothers are strongly encouraged to express breast milk for their infants with provision of electrical breast pumps both in the hospital and at home.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">PRETERM INFANTS BELOW 34 WEEKS GESTATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The steps for successful implementation of full breastfeeding in the preterm infant below 34 weeks gestation include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Demonstration of the oral skills indicating readiness to feed</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Initiation and advancement of breastfeeding</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Transition to full breastfeeding</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Readiness</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The earliest postmenstrual age (PMA) at which preterm infants can successfully take oral feedings is uncertain. Oral feedings often are initiated at 33 to 34 postmenstrual weeks, a time when they begin to have a sucking pattern, although observed in shorter bursts, that appears similar to that of term infants. However, there are no universally established criteria for when oral feedings for preterm infants should be started. As a result, there is wide variability in the gestational age of when oral feeds are initiated among neonatal intensive care units (NICUs) and individual infants [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/breastfeeding-the-preterm-infant/abstract/13-15\" class=\"abstract_t\">13-15</a>].</p><p>Gestational or postmenstrual age is an unreliable marker of infant oral feeding ability [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/breastfeeding-the-preterm-infant/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. Oral behaviors, such as nonnutritive sucking and rooting, appear to be better indicators of readiness to feed. These behaviors may be present in some infants as early as 28 weeks PMA. For example, in a study of 71 singleton preterm infants (born between 27 to 36 weeks gestation), rooting, areolar grasp, and latch were observed at 28 weeks PMA, and nutritive sucking at 31 weeks gestation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/breastfeeding-the-preterm-infant/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. Breastfeeding was initiated between 28 and 36 weeks PMA.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h3\">Nonnutritive sucking</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>When early indicators of readiness are noted, nonnutritive sucking (eg, suckling at an emptied breast) may enhance the transition from tube to oral feeding with a more rapid maturation of oral feeding behaviors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/breastfeeding-the-preterm-infant/abstract/18-22\" class=\"abstract_t\">18-22</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=neonatal-oral-feeding-difficulties-due-to-sucking-and-swallowing-disorders#H2\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Neonatal oral feeding difficulties due to sucking and swallowing disorders&quot;, section on 'Sucking'</a>.)</p><p>Suckling at an emptied breast promotes nonnutritive sucking while providing maternal nipple tactile stimulation and bonding that may increase milk production. A mothers can use these opportunities to observe her infant's behavior and track <span class=\"nowrap\">his/her</span> developing oral skills as an indication of readiness for oral feeding. Suckling is initiated by placement of the infant at the breast after the mother expresses milk. Although the infant should be held in proximity to the breast, no attempt should be made to &quot;position&quot; the infant's mouth and gums over the nipple and areola. Instead, licking and suckling on the nipple tip is all that is expected during these initial sessions. When the mother is not available, nonnutritive sucking on a pacifier is strongly recommended for preterm infants. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=breast-milk-expression-for-the-preterm-infant#H24\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Breast milk expression for the preterm infant&quot;, section on 'Tactile nipple stimulation'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Initiation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>When the preterm infant is deemed ready to begin oral feedings, breastfeeding may be initiated directly. There is no evidence that initiating oral feedings with a bottle is either necessary or advantageous. In crossover studies, premature infants exhibited more stable oxygenation and body temperature, but less milk transfer, during breastfeeding compared with bottle feeding [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/breastfeeding-the-preterm-infant/abstract/23-25\" class=\"abstract_t\">23-25</a>]. The more stable respiratory patterns, including oxygenation, associated with breastfeeding may be a result of the slower rate of milk flow during breastfeeding compared with bottle feeding. In a prospective crossover study of 19 preterm infants (born at 32 weeks gestation), although feeding at the breast took longer, there was no difference in milk intake and resting energy expenditure between feeding at the breast or when bottle-fed expressed mother's milk [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/breastfeeding-the-preterm-infant/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. Direct breastfeeding, especially the first oral feeding, also appears to increase the likelihood of continued breastfeeding at discharge [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/breastfeeding-the-preterm-infant/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>].</p><p>When the infant demonstrates the ability to locate and latch on to the breast, breastfeeding may be initiated. However, less mature infants still may not be able to handle high rates of milk flow because their suck-swallow-breathe coordination is still not fully developed. These infants can be safely introduced to breastfeeding using a strategy to minimize milk flow during early feedings [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/breastfeeding-the-preterm-infant/abstract/19,28\" class=\"abstract_t\">19,28</a>]. The rate of milk flow can be controlled by fully or partially emptying the mother's breasts before the infant begins to breastfeed. In this way, the preterm infant with poorly developed suck-swallow-breathe coordination can be introduced to small droplets of milk that do not necessitate prolonged closure of the airway for swallowing. As the infant matures and demonstrates the ability to coordinate sucking and breathing, the infant can handle a greater milk flow rate, and the mother no longer needs to express milk prior to the feeding.</p><p>Milk transfer is dependent upon the infant's suckling ability to generate enough suction pressure and compression of the milk ducts. In some cases, milk volume and ejection can compensate for marginally effective suckling, because some infants can still consume an adequate quantity of milk during breastfeeding because the mothers have a copious milk volume that flows readily. (See <a href=\"#H12\" class=\"local\">'Milk transfer'</a> below.)</p><p>Mothers should be instructed and evaluated on positioning of their infant, obtaining an adequate latch-on and milk transfer, recognizing their infant's feeding cues and signs of satiety, and assessing their infant's intake. Latch-on and milk transfer are described in greater detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=initiation-of-breastfeeding#H7\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Initiation of breastfeeding&quot;, section on 'Latch-on'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=initiation-of-breastfeeding#H10\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Initiation of breastfeeding&quot;, section on 'Milk transfer'</a> and <a href=\"#H12\" class=\"local\">'Milk transfer'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h3\">Position</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Positioning the small, preterm infant for suckling or feeding at the breast is best achieved by using the clutch (also known as the football) or cross cradle (across the lap) holds. These positions provide support to the head and neck allowing for more control in placing the baby in an optimal position and maintaining the infant's torso in alignment at the breast (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F61447\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef61447 \">picture 1</a>).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Assessment of milk intake</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Clinical assessment of feeding behaviors, including observation of swallowing activity, is not a reliable tool for measuring milk transfer in preterm infants [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/breastfeeding-the-preterm-infant/abstract/29,30\" class=\"abstract_t\">29,30</a>]. With the use of an electronic scale, milk intake is best assessed by weighing the infant before and after breastfeeding.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h2\">Test weighing</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The most reliable and accurate measurement of milk intake is test weighing based upon the difference in weight before and after a feed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/breastfeeding-the-preterm-infant/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>].</p><p>However, the accuracy of test weighing depends upon the technique used. Accurate measurement of milk intake is based upon the infant's weight before and after a feed using the following procedure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/breastfeeding-the-preterm-infant/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The scale is placed on a level, stable surface, which is free of drafts.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>No part of the scale pan should be touched or come in contact with another surface during the weight procedure; nor should <span class=\"nowrap\">clothing/blankets</span> drape over the sides of the scale.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>All items of clothing, blankets, and any contents of the bowel or bladder included in the pre-feed weight must also be included in the post-feed weight.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Eliminating tension on the leads, and maintaining consistent positioning of any connected leads <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> tubing.</p><p/><p>Test weighing is particularly useful when evaluating the progression of the infant's ability to transfer milk, the need for supplemental feedings, and preparing for infant discharge. For example, it can determine if the milk transfer is adequate for an infant with marginal suckling ability whose mother has a sufficient pumped milk volume. In this case, it would be difficult to know whether the mother's milk flow can compensate for the infant's marginal suck unless the volume of intake is measured. As illustrated in a comparison study of two NICUs, exclusive breastfeeding was attained at an earlier PMA in the hospital using test weighing to measure milk intake versus the other, which used clinical indices [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/breastfeeding-the-preterm-infant/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>]. The authors concluded that the clinical indices used to evaluate milk intake could have been underestimated and that these infants might have reached exclusive breastfeeding earlier if test weighing had been practiced.</p><p>Preterm infants do not demonstrate predictable feeding cues until close to term, corrected age [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/breastfeeding-the-preterm-infant/abstract/17,29\" class=\"abstract_t\">17,29</a>]. The use of test weights permits a modified cue-based feeding schedule that allows preterm infants to develop cue-based feeding behavior, but retains a safeguard against slow weight gain <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> dehydration in the days before NICU discharge. (See <a href=\"#H13\" class=\"local\">'Transition to full breastfeeding'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h2\">Inadequate milk intake</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The cause of insufficient milk intake as measured by test weighing is likely due to poor milk transfer secondary to the preterm infant's feeding behavior. However, inadequate milk production may also be a cause of poor milk intake that can be identified by reviewing with the mother her milk expression schedule and pumped milk volumes, which also allows for timely intervention.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h3\">Milk production</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Mothers who deliver prematurely may have difficulty in establishing an adequate milk supply. Milk production decreases with lower gestational age, which may be in part due to incomplete mammary development due to the shortened pregnancy. However, early (within six hours of delivery) and frequent milk expression (about eight times a day) in the first two weeks following preterm delivery can increase the likelihood of establishing an adequate milk volume of greater than 500 mL per day.</p><p>Strategies to increase milk production for breastfeeding include the following:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Identify risk factors associated with decreased milk production, including previous breast surgery, maternal medications (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pseudoephedrine-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">pseudoephedrine</a>), and endocrine disorders (eg, hypothyroidism, polycystic ovarian syndrome).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Frequent emptying of the breast (&ge;6 times a day) to stimulate milk production, combined with breast massage and hand expression of milk.

Suckling in the preterm infant is characterized by low suction pressures, and short, irregular sucking bursts that may result in poor milk transfer and ineffective oral feeding. Despite these immature feeding characteristics, preterm infants as early as 32 weeks PMA have demonstrated the ability to transfer sufficient milk volumes for adequate growth [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/breastfeeding-the-preterm-infant/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>].</p><p>In addition, it is not uncommon for some mothers, whose milk-ejection response has become conditioned to the higher suction pressures experienced with the mechanical breast pump, to have difficulty eliciting milk-ejection during early breastfeeding attempts, which also contributes to poor milk transfer.</p><p>Weak sucking pressures (-2.5 to -15 mmHg) also may result in difficulties maintaining attachment to the breast [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/breastfeeding-the-preterm-infant/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. In the preterm infant, the use of a thin-walled nipple shield increases milk transfer and facilitates sustained breast attachment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/breastfeeding-the-preterm-infant/abstract/34,35\" class=\"abstract_t\">34,35</a>]. After the infant begins to suck, a vacuum is created in the shield chamber, and the negative pressure facilitates milk transfer. This results in an accumulation of milk within the shield chamber when the infant pauses between sucking episodes. When suckling is resumed, a flow of pooled milk occurs despite the low pressure generated by the infant. The efficacy of this intervention was illustrated in a study of 34 preterm infants that demonstrated greater milk transfer for feedings using a nipple shield compared with the previous feeding without a shield (18.4 versus 3.9 mL) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/breastfeeding-the-preterm-infant/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>]. The duration of breastfeeding also was increased with the use of the nipple shield after discharge.</p><p>The nipple shield is well accepted by mothers because it often is associated with the first breastfeeding experience in which the infant remains awake, sucks eagerly, and consumes measurable volumes of milk. Other feeding techniques, such as cup or finger feedings, are sometimes used as an alternative to the nipple shield. However, there is little evidence that these strategies improve milk transfer or the duration of breastfeeding after discharge [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/breastfeeding-the-preterm-infant/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h2\">Transition to full breastfeeding</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Transition to exclusive breastfeeding prior to hospital discharge is dependent upon the availability of the mother and feeding ability of the infant. Hospital environments that encourage participation of the mother in feeding and other daily care tasks enhance maternal self-efficacy and maternal-infant attachment. These maternal attributes are essential to developing a positive feeding relationship beyond the NICU stay. Providing mothers with the skills to know their infants by recognizing feeding cues and coregulating with the infant is more likely to improve feeding outcomes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/breastfeeding-the-preterm-infant/abstract/37,38\" class=\"abstract_t\">37,38</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H110462248\"><span class=\"h3\">Modified demand-feeding schedule</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Because preterm infants do not demonstrate predictable demand-feeding behaviors until close to term, corrected age [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/breastfeeding-the-preterm-infant/abstract/16,29\" class=\"abstract_t\">16,29</a>], a modified demand-feeding schedule allows mothers to recognize infant feeding cues and coregulate feedings in response to these behaviors while retaining a safeguard against slow weight gain <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> dehydration. A prescribed modified demand-feeding schedule is based on the infant's feeding cues and a 24-hour minimal milk intake. Results from a systematic review suggest that <span class=\"nowrap\">demand/semi-demand</span> feeding regimens were associated with an earlier attainment of full oral feedings [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/breastfeeding-the-preterm-infant/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>].</p><p>The schedule is determined by calculating the 24-hour minimal milk intake and subdividing into three or four aliquots that need to be administered over a six- or eight-hour period, respectively. During this time period, the infant can feed on demand with monitoring of the intake at each feed. If the infant does not consume the minimum volume over the designated time, extra milk is provided at the end of the time interval to ensure adequate caloric intake and prevent dehydration.</p><p>For example, if an infant weighing 1700 g requires a minimum of 300 mL of milk per day, the infant needs to receive 100 mL every eight hours. The infant is allowed to demand feed but must receive the prescribed 100 mL within the eight-hour period. Test weights are measured with each breastfeeding. This allows the infant the opportunity to self-regulate sleep and feeding.</p><p>This method allows the mother to breastfeed on demand during the hours that she is with her infant in the hospital. It also provides the clinician with the necessary information regarding whether or not the infant can maintain an adequate intake solely by breastfeeding, and to modify the infant's feeding regimen in preparation for discharge. In addition, it allows the mother to observe the feeding and sleep habits of her infant in a controlled environment under the guidance of the NICU staff.</p><p>Special precautions should be considered regarding breast emptying, as direct breastfeeding progresses to protect maternal milk volume. Since the preterm infant will be unable to empty all available milk in the breasts, she should pump after nursing. This strategy will protect maternal milk volume levels during the transition from partial to exclusive breastfeeding and provide mother's own milk when supplemental feedings are needed.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14\"><span class=\"h3\">Supplementation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>During the transition from partial to full breastfeeding, additional milk feedings will be required based on test weights. Alternative feeding methods for supplemental feedings include tube, bottle, and cup. The most common method of supplemental feedings is by bottle once the infant is taking all feedings orally. However, cup feeding has been shown to be a safe method [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/breastfeeding-the-preterm-infant/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>] and results in more mature breastfeeding behaviors and higher rates of exclusive breastfeeding after discharge compared with bottle-fed infants [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/breastfeeding-the-preterm-infant/abstract/41-44\" class=\"abstract_t\">41-44</a>].

An adequate milk supply results in a sufficient milk flow rate that can compensate for the infant's immature suckling. The mother's milk supply should be evaluated periodically over the course of the NICU stay. If there is concern that the milk supply may be insufficient, efforts to increase milk production should be started. Mothers may need to continue to express milk after each feed to completely empty their breasts and for supplemental feeding of their infants.

Late preterm infants may not fully empty the breast because of increased sleepiness, fatigue, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> difficulty maintaining a latch because their oro-buccal coordination and swallowing mechanisms are not fully matured. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=late-preterm-infants#H15\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Late preterm infants&quot;, section on 'Feeding difficulties'</a>.)</p><p>In addition to the management routinely used to promote breastfeeding in all infants, interventions during the birth hospitalization that specifically address breastfeeding issues in late premature infants include the following:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Unlike mothers of smaller preterm infants who have established milk volumes, mothers of late preterm infants must build their milk production concurrently with breastfeeding initiation and progression.

It is important to recognize that the clinical indicators of milk intake used in term infants (ie, breastfeeding behaviors [signs of satiety], wet diapers, frequency of stooling, and sleep patterns) are not reliable or accurate markers in preterm infants. Test weighing remains the most accurate assessment of milk intake. (See <a href=\"#H9\" class=\"local\">'Test weighing'</a> above.)</p><p>As a result, many parents find it reassuring to perform serial weight measurements (either test or daily weights) after discharge. A portable, battery-operated scale that mothers can rent and use to perform test weights <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> daily weights in the home is ideal for this purpose. The scale, which weighs to the nearest 2 g and automatically calculates milk intake from the pre-feed and post-feed weights, has been demonstrated to measure milk intake accurately for term and preterm infants [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/breastfeeding-the-preterm-infant/abstract/51\" class=\"abstract_t\">51</a>]. This scale can be a useful adjunct to breastfeeding management for mothers and preterm infants during the first week or two after discharge [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/breastfeeding-the-preterm-infant/abstract/52\" class=\"abstract_t\">52</a>]. Mothers should be introduced to the proper use of the scale during the days prior to discharge. (See <a href=\"#H9\" class=\"local\">'Test weighing'</a> above.)</p><p>Mothers should be encouraged to continue the breastfeeding strategies used in the hospital until their infants have demonstrated an acceptable pattern of growth (ie, 20 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/day</span> weight gain) for at least one or two weeks. These may include use of a breast pump after feeding to ensure emptying of the breast, nipple shields, and in-home weighing. In addition, parents should be referred to community-based lactation support programs <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> resources. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=breastfeeding-parental-education-and-support\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Breastfeeding: Parental education and support&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The growth of the discharged preterm infant needs to be carefully monitored by the primary care provider.

(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=infant-benefits-of-breastfeeding\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Infant benefits of breastfeeding&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=maternal-and-economic-benefits-of-breastfeeding\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Maternal and economic benefits of breastfeeding&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Because many preterm infants cannot initially feed at the breast, breast milk needs to be expressed, collected, and given to the infant by gavage feeding. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=breast-milk-expression-for-the-preterm-infant\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Breast milk expression for the preterm infant&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Breastfeeding is dependent upon the development of sufficient oral skills for successful milk transfer from the breast. The earliest postmenstrual age (PMA) at which preterm infants have sufficient suckling abilities remains uncertain. Although oral feedings often are initiated at approximately 33 to 34 postmenstrual weeks, successful breastfeeding has been achieved in infants as early as 28 weeks PMA. (See <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Readiness'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>When the infant demonstrates the ability to locate and latch on to the breast, breastfeeding is initiated. In some cases, the preterm infant with poorly developed suck-swallow-breathe coordination can only handle a small volume of milk. As the infant's oral skills mature and <span class=\"nowrap\">his/her</span> ability to handle greater milk flow rates increase, breastfeeding is advanced. (See <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'Initiation'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>During the hospitalization, the progression of breastfeeding is monitored by assessing milk intake. The most accurate measurement of milk intake is test weighing (ie, the difference in weight before and after each feeding). (See <a href=\"#H8\" class=\"local\">'Assessment of milk intake'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The two causes of insufficient milk intake are inadequate milk production or failure of milk transfer. They are differentiated from one another by test weighing to measure milk transfer during breastfeeding and assessing maternal pumped milk volume. Interventions are targeted to correct the underlying cause of insufficient milk intake. (See <a href=\"#H10\" class=\"local\">'Inadequate milk intake'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>When the infant demonstrates the ability to consume all feeds orally then a modified demand-feeding schedule based upon a 24-hour minimal milk intake should be prescribed. (See <a href=\"#H13\" class=\"local\">'Transition to full breastfeeding'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Although late preterm infants (gestational age between 34 weeks, and 36 weeks and 6 days) are usually able to breastfeed, they are more likely to experience difficulty in establishing successful breastfeeding than term infants because their oro-buccal coordination and swallowing mechanisms may not be fully matured.

Key elements of discharge planning include: breast feeding the infant, protecting the mother's milk supply, and developing a plan based on the individual needs and abilities of the <span class=\"nowrap\">mother/infant</span> couplet. Optimal care after discharge includes close growth monitoring, continuation of the breastfeeding strategies used in the hospital until an acceptable pattern of growth is achieved, and parental referral to community-based lactation support programs <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> resources. (See <a href=\"#H18\" class=\"local\">'Postdischarge'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Preterm infants who are breastfed or receiving expressed breast milk require supplements of iron and vitamin D.
