In one case series of 49 metformin-treated patients, mortality was 45 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/metformin-poisoning/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. Neither arterial lactate levels nor plasma metformin concentrations predicted mortality. Death in these patients more closely correlated with underlying comorbid conditions. Another case series of 42 patients reported a mortality rate of 48 percent among patients with unintentional metformin poisoning [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/metformin-poisoning/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. In this study, the most accurate predictor of death was liver dysfunction, as demonstrated by an elevated prothrombin time. In a case series of 66 patients with metformin associated lactic acidosis, metformin concentrations correlated with creatinine and lactate levels, although the absolute metformin and lactate concentrations were not different in survivors and nonsurvivors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/metformin-poisoning/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. </p><p>Metformin-associated lactic acidosis may also occur following acute overdose [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/metformin-poisoning/abstract/16-21\" class=\"abstract_t\">16-21</a>].

It is important to note that hyperpnea and tachypnea may reflect compensation for a metabolic acidosis and may not represent impending respiratory failure. If intubation is required, the clinician should pay special attention to ventilator management. Minute ventilation sufficient to compensate for any underlying acidosis should be maintained and arterial blood gas results checked frequently until the patient is stabilized.</p><p>Hypotension should initially be treated with intravenous fluids, followed by vasopressors if needed.

It is logical to treat pediatric metformin toxicity in the same manner as one would treat adults, and anecdotal success supports such therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/metformin-poisoning/abstract/30,31\" class=\"abstract_t\">30,31</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H17\"><span class=\"h1\">ADDITIONAL RESOURCES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Regional poison control centers in the United States are available at all times for consultation on patients who are critically ill, require admission, or have clinical pictures that are unclear (1-800-222-1222). In addition, some hospitals have clinical <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> medical toxicologists available for bedside consultation <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> inpatient care.

It may accumulate in renal failure. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Pharmacology'</a> above and <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Kinetics'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Lactic acidosis is the major toxicity of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=metformin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">metformin</a> and is associated with high mortality. Metformin-associated lactic acidosis may occur in patients with renal insufficiency, liver disease, hemodynamic instability, or others in whom high levels of the drug accumulate. In such patients, mortality correlates with the severity of the underlying medical conditions and appears to be increased in the setting of liver dysfunction. Lactic acidosis may also occur in acute metformin overdose. Among these patients, death correlates with high plasma lactate and low serum pH. Early consultation with a medical toxicologist and nephrologist should be obtained for any patient with evidence of acidosis or signs of severe toxicity. (See <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Toxicity'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In the setting of acute overdose, clinicians should seek information about dose, coingestants (although such information is frequently unreliable), and whether other diabetic agents are used. Patients may complain of nausea and abdominal pain; physical examination findings may include tachycardia, hypotension, and tachypnea in patients with severe lactic acidosis. Alterations in mental status may be due to acidosis or hypoglycemia, although the latter is uncommon without concurrent use of a hypoglycemic agent. (See <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'History and physical examination'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Routine laboratory evaluation of any acutely poisoned patient should include:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Fingerstick glucose</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span><a href=\"topic.htm?path=acetaminophen-paracetamol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Acetaminophen</a> and salicylate levels</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Electrocardiogram, to rule out conduction system poisoning by coingestants that affect the QRS or QTc intervals</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Pregnancy test in women of childbearing age (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=general-approach-to-drug-poisoning-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;General approach to drug poisoning in adults&quot;</a>)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Specific laboratory testing in cases of known or suspected <a href=\"topic.htm?path=metformin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">metformin</a> toxicity should include:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Arterial or venous blood gas for determination of acid-base status</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Basic chemistry to determine the bicarbonate and to assess renal function</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Serum lactate level to confirm the metabolic acidosis is in fact a lactic acidosis (see <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'Laboratory evaluation'</a> above)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Victims of acute or chronic <a href=\"topic.htm?path=metformin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">metformin</a> toxicity rarely require tracheal intubation. Hyperpnea and tachypnea may reflect compensation for a metabolic acidosis and may not represent impending respiratory failure. If intubation is required, the clinician should pay special attention to ventilator management. Minute ventilation sufficient to compensate for any underlying acidosis should be maintained and arterial blood gas results checked frequently until the patient is stabilized. Persistent hypotension suggests profound toxicity. There is no antidote for metformin toxicity. (See <a href=\"#H9\" class=\"local\">'Airway, breathing, circulation'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We suggest gastrointestinal (GI) decontamination with activated charcoal (AC) be performed in patients with <strong>acute</strong>&nbsp;<a href=\"topic.htm?path=metformin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">metformin</a> ingestion unless specific contraindications exist (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). We recommend that patients with toxicity from <strong>chronic</strong> use <strong>not</strong> be treated with GI decontamination (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=3\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1C</a>). The clinician must assess aspiration risk before any attempts to administer AC. (See <a href=\"#H10\" class=\"local\">'Gastrointestinal decontamination'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Hypoglycemia should be treated with dextrose 0.5 to 1 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/kg</span> IV, followed by a meal if food is not contraindicated. (See <a href=\"#H11\" class=\"local\">'Dextrose'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The use of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sodium-bicarbonate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">sodium bicarbonate</a> in metformin-induced lactic acidosis is controversial. We suggest administering sodium bicarbonate to patients with severe metabolic acidemia (arterial pH below 7.10 to 7.15) (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). A reasonable goal is to maintain the pH above 7.15 until the acute toxicity resolves. (See <a href=\"#H12\" class=\"local\">'Sodium bicarbonate'</a> above and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=bicarbonate-therapy-in-lactic-acidosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Bicarbonate therapy in lactic acidosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Hemodialysis has been used successfully in patients with metformin-associated lactic acidosis due to chronic use or acute overdose. We recommend hemodialysis for patients with: lactate concentrations &gt;20 <span class=\"nowrap\">mmol/L;</span> severe metabolic acidosis (pH &le;7.0); or who fail to improve within two to four hours despite appropriate supportive care and bicarbonate therapy (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=3\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1C</a>). We suggest hemodialysis for patients with: lactate concentrations from 15 to 20 <span class=\"nowrap\">mmol/L,</span> metabolic acidosis (pH 7 to 7.1), or comorbid conditions (shock, renal impairment, liver failure, or decreased level of consciousness) (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). Early consultation with a medical toxicologist and a nephrologist should be obtained for any patient with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=metformin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">metformin</a> toxicity for which hemodialysis may be required. (See <a href=\"#H13\" class=\"local\">'Extracorporeal removal'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients reporting an acute ingestion should be observed for at least six to eight hours. Patients who are well appearing and who have a normal acid-base status after six to eight hours may be discharged or transferred to the care of a psychiatrist. If a patient deteriorates during a period of observation, the clinician should promptly consult nephrology regarding the possibility of hemodialysis. Serial acid-base determinations help document the patient's deterioration. (See <a href=\"#H15\" class=\"local\">'Disposition'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><a href=\"topic.htm?path=metformin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Metformin</a> is approved for the treatment of Type II diabetes in children. We suggest children with metformin overdose be treated in the same manner as adults.
