Relapsed or refractory MM is usually identified on routine surveillance performed during treatment or after the completion of therapy. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluating-response-to-treatment-of-multiple-myeloma#H2\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluating response to treatment of multiple myeloma&quot;, section on 'Response criteria'</a>.)</p><p>Treatment options for patients with relapsed or refractory MM include hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT), a rechallenge of the previous chemotherapy regimen, or a trial of a new regimen. Factors used to determine the choice of therapy include a risk stratification of myeloma (ie, high- or standard-risk disease), prior treatments used, and the duration of response to these treatments.</p><p>The treatment of relapsed or refractory MM will be discussed here. The initial treatment of MM with chemotherapy and the use of HCT are discussed separately.

The preferred monitoring method is the measurement of monoclonal (M) protein in the serum or urine and serum free light chain (FLC) levels (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F111430\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef111430 \">table 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-relapsed-or-refractory-multiple-myeloma/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. An increase in one of these measurements raises the suspicion of progressive disease (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F55362\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef55362 \">table 2</a>).

Clinical relapse occurs when the patient develops CRAB symptoms (hypercalcemia, renal insufficiency, anemia, or new bone lesions). Relapsed disease can also be documented when there is a doubling of the monoclonal protein over two months, with an increase in the absolute levels of monoclonal protein of &ge;1 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/dL</span> in the serum or of &ge;500 mg per 24 hours in the urine, confirmed by two consecutive measurements.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Risk stratification</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>At the time of their initial diagnosis, individual patients are stratified into high-, intermediate-, or standard-risk MM based on the results of fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) for specific translocations <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> deletions, and conventional cytogenetics (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F78344\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef78344 \">table 3</a>). This evaluation helps to identify the 15 percent of patients with high-risk MM who have a median survival of approximately two years or less with standard therapy. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=selection-of-initial-chemotherapy-for-symptomatic-multiple-myeloma#H3140038\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Selection of initial chemotherapy for symptomatic multiple myeloma&quot;, section on 'Risk stratification'</a>.)</p><p>When progressive disease is identified, information on the initial response to therapy can be used to further identify patients with high-risk disease:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients who relapse less than 12 months from first-line therapy or relapse on therapy (ie, refractory disease) are considered to have high-risk disease even if evaluation by FISH and cytogenetics previously classified their disease as standard risk.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>On the other hand, patients previously diagnosed with high-risk disease by cytogenetics <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> FISH who relapse more than two years from initial therapy can be considered as having standard-risk disease at the time of relapse in the absence of new additional high-risk cytogenetic abnormalities.</p><p/><p>These concepts are supported by retrospective studies that have demonstrated inferior survival among patients who relapse less than 12 months after initial therapy. As an example, a retrospective analysis of 102 patients with relapsed MM reported that patients who had a time to first progression &le;12 months had a significantly shorter median overall survival rate when compared with those who had a time to first progression after 12 months (20 versus 59 months, respectively) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-relapsed-or-refractory-multiple-myeloma/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].</p><p>Patients with high-risk disease at the time of relapse are best treated in the context of a clinical trial. These are the patients who will be the least likely to respond to conventional therapies and likely require more intensive treatment, which may include prolonged maintenance therapy, multi-agent combination therapy, autologous stem cell transplantation, or consideration for allogeneic transplantation.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Transplant eligibility</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Eligibility for autologous or allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) is primarily determined based on the patient's age, performance status, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> the presence of comorbid conditions. Given the potential role for HCT in relapsed disease, reassessment of transplant eligibility should be performed at the time of relapse. This is discussed in more detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-the-management-of-multiple-myeloma#H7\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of the management of multiple myeloma&quot;, section on 'Determining transplant eligibility'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h1\">OVERVIEW OF TREATMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Treatment options for relapsed or refractory MM include hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT), the use of new treatment regimens that the patient has not been previously exposed to, or a rechallenge of the chemotherapeutic regimen used previously. In addition, patients should be encouraged to participate in clinical trials whenever possible.</p><p>When a clinical trial is not available or if a patient does not want to participate in a trial, the choice of therapy depends on eligibility for HCT, what agents have been used previously, how the disease responded to this therapy, aggressiveness of the relapse, side effect profiles, and patient comorbidities [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-relapsed-or-refractory-multiple-myeloma/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].</p><p>With each regimen, progressive disease (PD) eventually occurs while the patient is on- or off-therapy, at which point a new treatment regimen is needed. In some instances, when PD is not accompanied by worsening clinical symptoms (ie, the PD is only based on laboratory values), salvage treatment may be deferred depending on the speed at which the monoclonal protein levels are rising, and the clinical condition of the patient.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Patients who are transplant candidates</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The treatment of relapsed disease in patients who are eligible for autologous HCT depends partly on whether they have undergone HCT in the past.</p><p>Prospective randomized trials have shown that autologous HCT results in superior event-free and overall survival rates when compared with combination chemotherapy in patients with previously untreated MM. In addition, at least one randomized trial found similar overall survival rates among patients who underwent HCT as part of their initial therapy and those who delayed HCT until the time of relapse. As such, after initial chemotherapy and collection of stem cells, patients can either proceed to early (upfront) autologous HCT or can opt for delayed autologous HCT at the time of relapse. This is discussed in more detail separately.

Patients who are initially refractory to induction chemotherapy (primary refractory disease) can achieve a good response to subsequent autologous HCT, and lack of response to initial therapy does not preclude transplantation.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12216861\"><span class=\"h2\">Patients who are not transplant candidates</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients who relapse more than one year after stopping initial therapy will likely respond to a repeat course of the previous therapy. This is given to maximum response for up to one year of therapy, or until progression.</p><p>There are a number of options that are available for the treatment of relapsed MM, but the duration and quality of response are usually inferior to those of the initial response, and become progressively shorter with each successive regimen [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-relapsed-or-refractory-multiple-myeloma/abstract/8,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,9</a>]. As an example, in our series of 578 patients followed for the course of their disease, median event-free survival rates for initial and subsequent treatment regimens were, as follows [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-relapsed-or-refractory-multiple-myeloma/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Initial regimen &ndash; 10 months</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Second regimen &ndash; 7 months</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Third regimen &ndash; 6 months</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Fourth regimen &ndash; 4.5 months</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Fifth regimen &ndash; 4 months</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Sixth regimen &ndash; 3 months</p><p/><p>It must be noted that patients in this study were treated before immunomodulatory drugs and proteasome inhibitors became available for general use, and the absolute numbers for median event-free survival have improved over the years.
