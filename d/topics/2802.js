The beta-D-glucan assay using CSF can possibly be a useful adjunct to CSF culture and analysis.</p><p>In a review of neonatal infection, <em>Candida</em> was isolated from the CSF in 17 of 23 patients (74 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/candida-infections-of-the-central-nervous-system/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. The initial CSF analysis was not always helpful. Twelve patients had a normal CSF white cell count.

The Gram stain was negative for yeast in all patients, and eight of the neonates had sterile blood cultures.

Use of special techniques resulted in the growth of <em>Candida</em> species in four patients, but the cultures remained negative in three.</p><p/><p>In patients with chronic <em>Candida</em> meningitis, large-volume (10 to 20 mL) spinal taps are often required to obtain sufficient CSF for culture. The microbiology laboratory should be asked to culture the entire sample or to filter the sample through a Millipore filter and culture the filter on appropriate media.

The serum beta-D-glucan assay may be positive in patients with a variety of invasive fungal infections, including invasive candidiasis. Based upon a case report of <em>Candida </em>meningitis and experience with an outbreak of fungal meningitis related to injection of mold-contaminated <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methylprednisolone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">methylprednisolone</a>, the beta-D-glucan assay may also be useful in testing CSF as an adjunct to CSF cultures in patients with chronic <em>Candida</em> meningitis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/candida-infections-of-the-central-nervous-system/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. Importantly, this test can be positive in the setting of many different fungal infections, and cut-offs to define positivity in CSF are not defined.

However, intracranial abscesses can occur either as an isolated phenomenon or associated with meningitis. The abscesses are usually small microabscesses, multiple, and associated with disseminated infection in immunocompromised hosts. (See <a href=\"#H1\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><em>Candida</em> meningitis can occur as a manifestation of disseminated candidiasis, which most often occurs in premature neonates, in the presence of ventricular drainage devices, and as isolated chronic meningitis. In addition to hematogenous spread, <em>Candida</em> can enter the CNS at the time of craniotomy or through a ventricular shunt. (See <a href=\"#H1\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>As with <em>Candida</em> infections at most other sites, patients who develop CNS infections are usually immunocompromised. In addition to occurring in premature neonates and after neurosurgery, the risk is also increased in HIV-infected patients and in those with leukemia. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Epidemiology'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The symptoms of <em>Candida</em> meningitis can be the same as in patients with acute bacterial meningitis (eg, fever, stiff neck, altered mental status, headache). Fever may be the only manifestation in patients who are neutropenic, whereas signs of sepsis and multiorgan failure often predominate in neonates. Patients with multiple cerebral microabscesses can develop a diffuse encephalopathy. (See <a href=\"#H1833985676\" class=\"local\">'Clinical features'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Drainage device infection usually occurs within several months of the surgical procedure and probably results from implantation during the procedure rather than hematogenous seeding of the device. The symptoms and signs associated with <em>Candida</em> ventricular drainage device infections are similar to those seen with the more common bacterial infections of these devices. In addition to fever, shunt malfunction can result in manifestations of increased intracranial pressure, such as headache, nausea, vomiting, and mental status changes. (See <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'CNS shunts and other devices'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1833986186\"><span class=\"h2\">Diagnosis</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The possible presence of CNS <em>Candida</em> infection should be suspected in patients with neurologic symptoms who have one or more of the following:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Isolation of <em>Candida</em> from the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Isolation of <em>Candida</em> from another normally sterile site in patients who have pleocytosis on CSF analysis.
