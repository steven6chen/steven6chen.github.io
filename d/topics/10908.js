They account for 30 to 40 percent of all hand fractures. Fractures of the base of the metacarpal bones may be the result of direct or indirect trauma.</p><p>This topic will review issues related to fractures of the base of the metacarpal. A general overview of metacarpal fractures is presented separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-metacarpal-fractures\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of metacarpal fractures&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Although first (thumb) metacarpal fractures typically occur at the base, the anatomy and biomechanics of the thumb are unique and fractures of the metacarpal of the thumb are presented separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=first-thumb-metacarpal-fractures\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;First (thumb) metacarpal fractures&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL ANATOMY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Fractures of the metacarpal base are provided a degree of stability due to the dorsal and palmar carpometacarpal ligaments as well as the interosseous ligaments. This is particularly true for second and third metacarpal base fractures. Fractures of the fourth and the fifth metacarpal base are somewhat less stable due to increased mobility at the carpometacarpal (CMC) joint. In addition, the motor branch of the ulnar nerve runs in close proximity with the fourth and fifth metacarpal bases, and accordingly, fractures of these areas warrant a thorough evaluation of ulnar-distributed motor function.</p><p>The fifth metacarpal CMC joint surface slopes in ulnar fashion, and is only buttressed on the radial side (by the fourth metacarpal and the hamate bone). The tendon of the powerful extensor carpi ulnaris muscle attaches on the ulnar aspect of the fifth metacarpal base, making it common for fractures here, particularly intraarticular fractures, to have a large fragment displaced in an ulnar and proximal direction.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">MECHANISM OF INJURY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Fractures of the metacarpal bases generally result from a torsional force exerted distally on the affected digit or from a direct blow to the hand. Rarely, a fall on an outstretched hand or punching can cause fractures to the base of the metacarpal.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h1\">SYMPTOMS AND EXAMINATION FINDINGS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Fractures of the metacarpal bases are usually swollen and tender at the fracture site. Movement at the wrist exacerbates pain. Assessment for rotational malalignment and function of muscles innervated by the ulnar nerve proximal and distal to the wrist are both imperative. Even a subtle rotational deformity at the base of the metacarpal can leave a pronounced malalignment at the fingertip.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Rotational alignment</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Rotational alignment should be assessed with the MCP joint in flexion. The rotational alignment of the metacarpals can be assessed in two ways:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>With a semi-clenched fist (flexion to 90 degrees at the MCP and PIP joints), normal alignment will enable each finger to point toward the scaphoid pole show convergence of the digits, but not necessarily to a single point (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F73269%7EEM%2F71612\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef73269 graphicRef71612 \">picture 1A-B</a>).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>With the MCP joint flexed 90 degrees and the PIP and DIP joints in full extension, the plane of the fingernails should be aligned and can be compared with the contralateral side (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F52326\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef52326 \">picture 2</a>).</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Ulnar nerve motor branch integrity</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Assessment of intrinsic hand muscle function should be performed by having the patient abduct and adduct the fingers to ensure ulnar nerve motor integrity. Impaired intrinsic muscle strength in the absence of weakness of the finger flexors (the latter supplied by the ulnar nerve proximal to the wrist) is suggestive of damage to the motor branch. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-upper-extremity-peripheral-nerve-syndromes#H31\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of upper extremity peripheral nerve syndromes&quot;, section on 'Ulnar nerve syndromes'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h1\">RADIOGRAPHIC FINDINGS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A standard hand series (AP, lateral, and oblique) is used in evaluating metacarpal base fractures (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F58725\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef58725 \">image 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RHEUM%2F79635\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef79635 \">image 2</a>). However, if the metacarpal base cannot be isolated, 30 degrees obliques pronated and supinated may be needed. Lateral views are particularly important in detection of dorsal displacement, subluxation, or dislocation of the metacarpal from the distal carpal row.</p><p>Because these fractures can be difficult to detect, specialized views (Brewerton views) or CT scans are sometimes necessary. Due to the widespread availability and the accuracy of CT in detecting occult bony abnormalities, this is a good choice if the index of suspicion for an occult fracture is high and plain films do not reveal a fracture.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h1\">INDICATIONS FOR SURGICAL REFERRAL</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Intraarticular fractures; extraarticular fractures with malrotation, subluxation, or dislocation of the metacarpal base CMC joint; or those with ulnar nerve injury all require orthopedic evaluation. In addition, fractures of the base of the fifth metacarpal typically require operative fixation and should be referred.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h1\">INITIAL TREATMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Splinting is used in the initial immobilization of and sometimes is the definitive treatment for metacarpal fractures [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/metacarpal-base-fractures/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>]. A detailed description of the techniques for applying splints is presented separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=basic-techniques-for-splinting-of-musculoskeletal-injuries\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Basic techniques for splinting of musculoskeletal injuries&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cast-and-splint-care-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">&quot;Patient education: Cast and splint care (Beyond the Basics)&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Patients with metacarpal base fractures warranting orthopedic referral should be splinted using dorsal and volar splints with the wrist in 30 degrees of extension and MCP joints free (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F50501\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef50501 \">figure 1</a>). These patients should be seen within three to five days. Non-displaced fractures should be immobilized with dorsal and volar splints (or a short arm cast if swelling is not too great) with MCPs free and wrist extended at 30 degrees. All fractures should be iced aggressively and elevated above the level of the heart during the first 48 to 72 hours to minimize swelling.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h1\">FOLLOW-UP CARE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients with non-displaced or reduced fractures of the base of the metacarpal should be seen within a week for repeat radiographs. If position is adequate, these patients are placed in a short arm cast for four weeks. If displacement occurs, referral for possible surgical intervention should be made. Radiographs should be performed weekly for three weeks to assure maintenance of fracture position. Loss of anatomic position warrants orthopedic referral, as displacement can lead to early CMC arthrosis and chronic pain. In addition, prior to initial cast application, ulnar nerve motor function should be reassessed, particularly in fractures involving the base of the fourth and fifth metacarpals.</p><p>Fractures of the metacarpal bases require rehabilitation efforts focused on wrist flexion, extension and grip strength. If a trial of home ROM exercises does not yield adequate results, referral to occupational therapy should be considered.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h1\">RECOMMENDATIONS FOR RETURN TO SPORT OR WORK</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Athletes desiring return to contact sport should use an orthotic for protection during activity for four to six weeks after constant immobilization is discontinued. Return to work requiring regular use of the affected hand is acceptable when patients are pain-free, non-tender, and have radiographic evidence of healing and functional range of motion. This usually takes four to six weeks.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h1\">SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Fractures of the base of the second, third, and fourth metacarpals (associated with index, middle, and ring fingers, respectively) are relatively stable due to their fixed position at the CMC joints and to adjacent metacarpals. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Clinical anatomy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Fractures of the base of the fifth metacarpal (associated with the little finger) are unstable and warrant early orthopedic referral for surgical fixation. (See <a href=\"#H8\" class=\"local\">'Indications for surgical referral'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Fractures of the metacarpal bases require near anatomic correction to avoid development of early CMC arthrosis and chronic pain.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Assessment of rotational malalignment is imperative and is best done with patient in a clenched fist position. Any malrotation warrants referral. (See <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Rotational alignment'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Definitive treatment of non-displaced fractures involves dorsal and volar splinting followed by short arm casting. (See <a href=\"#H9\" class=\"local\">'Initial treatment'</a> above and <a href=\"#H10\" class=\"local\">'Follow-up care'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Fractures of the base of the fourth and fifth metacarpals can result in damage to the motor branch of the ulnar nerve, which supplies intrinsic musculature of the hand (enabling finger abduction and adduction). Special care must be taken to assess the integrity of this motor function. (See <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'Ulnar nerve motor branch integrity'</a> above.)</p></div><div id=\"topicAgreement\">Use of UpToDate is subject to the <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/legal/license\" class=\"licenseLink\" id=\"sla_in_page\">Subscription and License Agreement</a>.</div><div id=\"references\" class=\"headingAnchor\"><h1>REFERENCES</h1><ol id=\"reference\"><li><a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/metacarpal-base-fractures/abstract/1\" class=\"nounderline abstract_t\">Ashkenaze DM, Ruby LK.
