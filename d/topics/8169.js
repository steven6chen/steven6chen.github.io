Extensive animal experiments have shown that hepatocytes transplanted in the liver or at ectopic sites survive, function, and participate in the regenerative process. Because the host liver architecture remains intact following the integration of the engrafted hepatocytes in the liver cords, hepatocyte transplantation is metabolically less stressful than transplantation of the whole organ, and the consequences of graft loss are much less severe.</p><p>Hepatocyte transplantation has many potential applications. Therapeutic genes can be transferred into cultured hepatocytes, and the phenotypically modified cells can then be transplanted for ex vivo gene therapy. Such gene transfer could be used to replace a missing gene product, to prevent immune rejection, or to give the cells a proliferative advantage. Hepatocyte transplantation does not interfere with subsequent liver transplantation or gene therapy. Although the clinical efficacy of hepatocyte transplantation has been demonstrated, the shortage of good quality donor livers for hepatocyte isolation and the lack of dependable methods of cryopreservation will limit widespread clinical application of this method until further research overcomes these problems.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2860537088\"><span class=\"h1\">SCOPE OF HEPATOCYTE TRANSPLANTATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Potential clinical applications of hepatocyte transplantation are listed in (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F74795\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef74795 \">table 1</a>).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2931988763\"><span class=\"h2\">Treatment of inherited metabolic diseases</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Missing gene products can be substituted by transplanting normal primary hepatocytes from allogeneic donors. This simple approach holds promise for diseases such as Crigler-Najjar syndrome type 1, urea cycle disorders, and coagulopathies, including hemophilias. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=crigler-najjar-syndrome\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Crigler-Najjar syndrome&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=inborn-errors-of-metabolism-classification#H6\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Inborn errors of metabolism: Classification&quot;, section on 'Urea cycle disorders'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=genetics-of-hemophilia-a-and-b\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Genetics of hemophilia A and B&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Hepatocytes used for gene therapy can be derived from a separate donor (allogeneic transplantation) or the recipient can serve as the donor, in which case the genetic defect needs to be corrected before transplantation (autologous transplantation). An advantage of autologous transplantation is that it does not require immunosuppression [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatocyte-transplantation/abstract/1-3\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-3</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2989429636\"><span class=\"h2\">Management of acute liver failure</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Liver cell transplantation can assist in the management of patients with fulminant hepatic failure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatocyte-transplantation/abstract/4-6\" class=\"abstract_t\">4-6</a>]. The transplanted hepatocytes can provide temporary liver support in patients awaiting the availability of a donor liver or spontaneous recovery. In some patients, regeneration of endogenous hepatocytes combined with the transplanted hepatocytes could possibly replace the need for transplantation of the whole liver. Hepatocyte transplantation has been shown to improve some biochemical parameters, such as reduction of blood ammonia levels, as well as improvement of encephalopathy, but patient survival beyond a week without liver transplantation has been rare [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatocyte-transplantation/abstract/7-9\" class=\"abstract_t\">7-9</a>]. Whether hepatocyte transplantation is superior to the use of artificial liver assist devices for bridging to liver transplantation remains to be determined. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acute-liver-failure-in-adults-management-and-prognosis#H233808218\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Acute liver failure in adults: Management and prognosis&quot;, section on 'Artificial hepatic assist devices'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1952966727\"><span class=\"h2\">Management of chronic liver failure</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Hepatocyte transplantation can provide metabolic support and partially restore liver function in patients with chronic liver failure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatocyte-transplantation/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. Transplanted normal hepatocytes have a survival advantage compared with the host cells in some inherited disorders, such as hereditary tyrosinemia type I (fumarylacetoacetate hydrolase deficiency), and could potentially repopulate the liver over time [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatocyte-transplantation/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=disorders-of-tyrosine-metabolism\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Disorders of tyrosine metabolism&quot;</a>.) </p><p>Most patients with chronic liver failure have already established cirrhosis, and the benefit of hepatocyte transplantation in the presence of cirrhosis has not been established by studies performed to date. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1572920050\"><span class=\"h1\">SOURCES OF HEPATOCYTES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In animal experiments, primary hepatocytes derived from congenic (varying in only one gene locus) or syngeneic (immunologically compatible) strains can be transplanted without the need for immunosuppression. Such complete tissue matching is not possible in clinical situations. As mentioned above, when hepatocytes are used as vehicles for ex vivo gene therapy, immunosuppression can be circumvented by isolating hepatocytes from resected liver segments and transplanting them back to the donor after genetic manipulations. However, in most cases, the cells are obtained from allogeneic donors and immunosuppression will be required, unless specific tolerance to the alloantigens can be achieved (see below).</p><p>The worldwide shortage of donor organs severely limits the number of donor livers that can be used for hepatocyte isolation. Investigators have attempted to alleviate this shortage by transplanting hepatocytes isolated from one fragment of a donor liver to several recipients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatocyte-transplantation/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. In addition, livers explanted from patients with a monogenic disorder at the time of liver transplantation have been used to isolate hepatocytes for transplantation into a recipient with a different monogenic disease (domino transplantation) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatocyte-transplantation/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. The shortage of transplantable primary human hepatocytes has led to the search for alternative sources of hepatocytes as follows:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Immortalized hepatocytes: Hepatocytes derived from animal and human livers have been immortalized by transferring the gene for the large T antigen of the simian virus 40 (SV40). A potential problem with this approach is that while the T antigen alone does not result in malignant transformation of hepatocytes, it predisposes to transformation by oncogenes, such as Ras. As a result, for transplantation purposes, methods for conditional immortalization of hepatocytes are being sought [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatocyte-transplantation/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. One such approach (developed in rat hepatocytes) involves transfer of a gene for a thermolabile mutant T antigen into hepatocytes using retroviral vectors. The transduced cells proliferate in vitro at permissive temperatures (33&deg;C). However, at physiologic temperatures (37 to 39&deg;C), the mutant T antigen is degraded, thereby stopping cell growth and leading the cells to exhibit features of differentiated hepatocytes. In rodent models, conditionally immortalized hepatocytes have been used to provide metabolic support in acute or chronic liver failure, and for ex vivo gene therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatocyte-transplantation/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Methods utilizing the <span class=\"nowrap\">p-lox/cre</span> recombinase system have been used to reversibly immortalize hepatocytes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatocyte-transplantation/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. Human hepatocytes, conditionally immortalized in this manner, were used successfully to rescue rats with acute liver failure, induced by 90 percent hepatectomy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatocyte-transplantation/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Xenogeneic hepatocytes: Hepatocytes derived from porcine or other animal sources could be potentially used for providing metabolic support during liver failure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatocyte-transplantation/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>], but major immunological hurdles remain. Another concern about these approaches is the potential to transmit agents, such as the porcine endogenous retroviruses, which can infect humans.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Fetal hepatocytes: Human fetal hepatocytes have been transplanted into patients with acute liver failure with marginal benefit. Transplantation of EpCAM+ve liver progenitor cells isolated from human fetal liver by infusion into the hepatic artery of patients with decompensated cirrhosis was reported to improve synthetic and excretory functions of the liver [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatocyte-transplantation/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Hepatocytes derived from pluripotent cells: Several laboratories have developed methods to generate hepatocyte-like cells by in vitro differentiation of human embryonic stem cells or induced pluripotent stem cells produced by reprogramming of somatic cells, such as fibroblasts, blood cells, and epithelial cells shed in the urine [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatocyte-transplantation/abstract/19-22\" class=\"abstract_t\">19-22</a>]. In addition, an alternative approach to directly reprogram human skin fibroblasts to hepatocyte-like cells without initial conversion to induced pluripotent cells has been reported [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatocyte-transplantation/abstract/23,24\" class=\"abstract_t\">23,24</a>]. Hepatocyte-like cells derived from human-induced pluripotent stem cells have been transplanted into genetically analbuminemic rats [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatocyte-transplantation/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>], with rats inheriting jaundice due to lack of bilirubin glucuronidation (Gunn strain) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatocyte-transplantation/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>] and mice expressing mutant human alpha-1-antitrypsin [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatocyte-transplantation/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. In each case, there was partial repopulation of the liver with the human cells. Such cells could be potentially renewable sources of hepatocytes, suitable for transplantation, provided the safety and regulatory issues could be addressed adequately.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Adult <span class=\"nowrap\">stem/progenitor</span> cells: Cells that can self-replicate, as well as differentiate into multiple cell types, persist in many adult tissues including the bone marrow [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatocyte-transplantation/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>], fat, and the liver. In animal studies, transplanted bone marrow-derived cells have been shown to give rise to hepatocytes, albeit at a very low frequency, making it questionable whether they could be a significant source of hepatocytes for transplantation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatocyte-transplantation/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. Mesenchymal stem cells derived from human adipose tissue [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatocyte-transplantation/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>] and mouse tail fibroblasts [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatocyte-transplantation/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>] have been differentiated into cells exhibiting some characteristics of hepatocytes. Benefits of using such cells for the treatment of liver-based disorders have yet to be demonstrated.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H151102749\"><span class=\"h1\">SITES OF HEPATOCYTE TRANSPLANTATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The liver provides the most supportive environment for engraftment and function of transplanted hepatocytes because of the availability of nutrients and growth factors present in the portal circulation, and interaction with other liver cells and the hepatic matrix. However, the optimum route for hepatocyte transplantation also depends upon the specific application.</p><p>Hepatocytes infused into the portal vein or injected into the splenic pulp travel to the hepatic sinusoids and integrate into the liver cords [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatocyte-transplantation/abstract/30,31\" class=\"abstract_t\">30,31</a>]. The cells obtain polarity and establish appropriate junctions with the neighboring hepatocytes within 24 hours. Studies in rats, mice, and rabbits have shown that syngeneic or congenic hepatocytes survive and function throughout the life of the host. Hepatocytes equivalent to up to 5 percent of the liver mass could be transplanted into normal livers with only a transient and reversible increase in the portal pressure. By contrast, hepatocyte transplantation in cirrhotic animals results in portal hypertension and an increase in right atrial pressure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatocyte-transplantation/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>].</p><p>After injection into the splenic pulp, a fraction of the transplanted cells may survive in the spleen and eventually develop liver cord-like structures, replacing up to 40 percent of the splenic mass. Over time, bile canaliculi, sinusoids, and endothelial cells may develop. Thus, in specific circumstances, the spleen may serve as an important site of hepatocyte engraftment.</p><p>For inherited metabolic disorders, implantation into the liver via injection into a tributary of the portal vein or into the splenic pulp has been most effective [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatocyte-transplantation/abstract/33-35\" class=\"abstract_t\">33-35</a>]. However, in the presence of cirrhosis, the liver may not be the most desirable site for hepatocyte transplantation. Although hepatocytes can engraft within cirrhotic nodules, the transplanted cells may not function normally in this environment. Similarly, a liver that is undergoing massive necrosis may not provide a hospitable environment for the transplanted cells. In the presence of portal hypertension, a large proportion of the cells infused into the portal vein may be translocated to the pulmonary vascular bed. In such cases, hepatocytes have been transplanted into the spleen by injection into the splenic pulp or infusion into the splenic artery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatocyte-transplantation/abstract/33,34\" class=\"abstract_t\">33,34</a>]. More study is needed to determine if the transplantation in the splenic artery would augment liver function in patients with liver cirrhosis.</p><p>Other sites, such as the renal subcapsular space or subcutaneous tissue, are less efficient. However, with further development, the peritoneal cavity could be an effective site for transplanting hepatocytes that are encapsulated [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatocyte-transplantation/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>], attached to collagen-coated microcarriers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatocyte-transplantation/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>], or encased in Hydrogel-based hollow fibers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatocyte-transplantation/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1868480209\"><span class=\"h1\">PRECLINICAL EVALUATION IN EXPERIMENTAL ANIMAL MODELS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The efficacy of hepatocyte transplantation has been evaluated extensively in natural mutant animals.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3393218768\"><span class=\"h2\">Disorders due to single gene defects</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Hepatocytes have been transplanted into Gunn rats (a model of Crigler-Najjar syndrome type 1), which have life-long unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia due to the lack of hepatic bilirubin-UDP-glucuronosyltransferase activity, by infusion into the portal vein, injection into the splenic pulp, or attachment to microcarriers, followed by injection into the peritoneal cavity. These procedures resulted in the excretion of bilirubin glucuronides in the bile and amelioration of hyperbilirubinemia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatocyte-transplantation/abstract/39,40\" class=\"abstract_t\">39,40</a>]. The metabolic defect was corrected in subsequent studies in which the rats were first treated with liver resection and radiation, thereby promoting the preferential repopulation of the native liver with the transplanted hepatocytes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatocyte-transplantation/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>]. Hepatic irradiation appears to disrupt hepatic sinusoidal endothelial cells and inhibit the phagocytic function of Kupffer cells, thereby enhancing hepatocyte engraftment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatocyte-transplantation/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>].</p><p>Similarly, serum albumin levels increased after transplantation of normal hepatocytes into Nagase analbuminemic rats [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatocyte-transplantation/abstract/43\" class=\"abstract_t\">43</a>]. Hepatocyte transplantation reduced plasma cholesterol levels by up to 50 percent in Watanabe heritable hyperlipidemic rabbits that lack LDL receptors (an animal model of familial hypercholesterolemia) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatocyte-transplantation/abstract/44\" class=\"abstract_t\">44</a>]. Hepatocyte transplantation also ameliorates the metabolic abnormality in fumarylacetoacetate hydrolase (FAH)-deficient mice (a model of hereditary tyrosinemia 1) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatocyte-transplantation/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>], Long-Evans Cinnamon rats (a model of Wilson disease) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatocyte-transplantation/abstract/45\" class=\"abstract_t\">45</a>], and mdr2 <span class=\"nowrap\">(-/-)</span> mice (a model of progressive familial intrahepatic cholestasis) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatocyte-transplantation/abstract/46\" class=\"abstract_t\">46</a>].

Hepatocyte transplantation reversed encephalopathy and prevented intracranial hypertension in animals with ischemic liver failure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatocyte-transplantation/abstract/49\" class=\"abstract_t\">49</a>]. In rats with hepatic encephalopathy caused by end-to-side portacaval shunt, intrasplenic transplantation of hepatocytes improved the behavior score, partially corrected amino acid imbalances, and protected the rats from hepatic coma induced by an exogenous ammonia load [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatocyte-transplantation/abstract/49\" class=\"abstract_t\">49</a>]. In similar experiments, transplantation of hepatocytes that had been immortalized by transfection with the simian virus 40 T antigen was able to improve measures of liver failure and prolong survival [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatocyte-transplantation/abstract/50\" class=\"abstract_t\">50</a>]. Hepatocyte transplantation in rats with chronic decompensated liver cirrhosis stabilized total bilirubin and prothrombin time, improved serum albumin and encephalopathy scores, and prolonged survival [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatocyte-transplantation/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H929633674\"><span class=\"h2\">Massive repopulation of the liver</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The effectiveness of hepatocyte transplantation could be greatly enhanced if the transplanted cells could be induced to proliferate preferentially over the host hepatocytes. Hepatocytes have a great reserve regenerative capacity. However, because there are normal physiologic mechanisms that tend to keep the total hepatocyte mass constant, replacement of the host liver cells with transplanted hepatocytes requires a combination of proliferative stimuli to the hepatocytes and impairment of the ability of host hepatocytes to divide.</p><p>This combination exists naturally in urokinase plasminogen activator transgenic mice (uPA). In these animals, the host hepatocytes have a markedly reduced life span, and therefore, transplanted normal hepatocytes proliferate preferentially until the whole liver is replaced [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatocyte-transplantation/abstract/51\" class=\"abstract_t\">51</a>]. A similar situation exists in FAH-deficient mouse models of hereditary tyrosinemia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatocyte-transplantation/abstract/52\" class=\"abstract_t\">52</a>] and MDR3 gene knockout-deficient mice (model of progressive intrahepatic cholestasis type 3) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatocyte-transplantation/abstract/53\" class=\"abstract_t\">53</a>]. However, severe liver injury or markedly reduced hepatocyte life span is not always necessary for hepatic repopulation with transplanted cells. In a transgenic mouse model of the classic form of human alpha-1 antitrypsin disease (AAT-ZZ), transplanted normal hepatocytes were shown to spontaneously proliferate and replace the host hepatocytes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatocyte-transplantation/abstract/54\" class=\"abstract_t\">54</a>]. As in the case of a majority of human AAT-ZZ patients, liver injury is minimal in these mice, but the stress of production of the misfolded protein (AAT-Z) is sufficient to provide a competitive proliferative advantage to the engrafted normal hepatocytes. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-natural-history-of-alpha-1-antitrypsin-deficiency\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and natural history of alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency&quot;</a>.)</p><p>For more generalized application of these principles, chemical and physical devices are being explored for inhibiting the proliferation of host hepatocytes. In one approach, the recipient was treated with a DNA-modifying agent, retrorsine, followed by partial hepatectomy and hepatocyte transplantation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatocyte-transplantation/abstract/55\" class=\"abstract_t\">55</a>]. The transplanted cells progressively replaced the host liver. An alternative strategy uses preparative resection and irradiation of the host liver. Using this method, it has been possible to replace the host hepatocytes almost entirely with normal transplanted hepatocytes, while retaining the normal hepatic architecture and function [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatocyte-transplantation/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. Application of this procedure in Gunn rats resulted in complete normalization of serum bilirubin levels [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatocyte-transplantation/abstract/41,56\" class=\"abstract_t\">41,56</a>]. None of these procedures has been evaluated in humans.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1820078390\"><span class=\"h2\">Ex vivo gene therapy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Hepatocytes can be transduced in vitro and then transplanted [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatocyte-transplantation/abstract/57,58\" class=\"abstract_t\">57,58</a>]. In one report, for example, primary hepatocytes from LDL-receptor deficient Watanabe heritable hyperlipidemic rabbits were harvested and transduced with a recombinant virus expressing the LDL receptor gene [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatocyte-transplantation/abstract/57\" class=\"abstract_t\">57</a>]. The transduced hepatocytes were then transplanted back into the rabbits. Long-term expression of the transgene was observed, and the serum cholesterol levels were reduced by 20 to 30 percent during several months of observation. A clinical trial of this method in human subjects with familial hypercholesterolemia resulted in modest reduction of serum LDL cholesterol levels, which were not considered to be therapeutically useful.</p><p>At this time, several factors limit the efficiency of ex vivo gene therapy for liver diseases. The procedure requires partial hepatectomy and, as a result, cannot be repeated easily. The proportion of primary hepatocytes that can be established in culture and transduced using recombinant viral vectors remains modest and variable. The number of phenotypically corrected hepatocytes that can be harvested and engrafted after transplantation also restricts the final metabolic impact of ex vivo gene therapy. Solutions to these technical problems may come from improved hepatocyte culture methods and conditional immortalization of hepatocytes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatocyte-transplantation/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. However, because of the current hurdles, ex vivo gene therapy for liver diseases is unlikely to be applied broadly in the near future.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3775573170\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL EXPERIENCE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Experience with hepatocyte transplantation in humans is growing.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2335336782\"><span class=\"h2\">Metabolic disorders</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients have undergone hepatocyte transplantation for a variety of conditions, including alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency, Crigler-Najjar syndrome type 1, coagulation factor VII deficiency, glycogen storage disease types 1a and 1b, infantile Refsum's disease, phenylketonuria, progressive familial intrahepatic cholestasis, tyrosinemia type 1, primary hyperoxaluria type 1 and several types of urea cycle disorders (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F67880\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef67880 \">table 2</a>).

Also, if the host liver is not manipulated pretransplant, the engrafted hepatocytes do not tend to survive and function beyond a few months to a few years. Most patients have required subsequent liver transplantation for various reasons. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Hepatocyte transplantation has been particularly useful as a &quot;bridge&quot; to subsequent liver transplantation in newborns or infants with life-threatening metabolic emergencies. For example, several infants with urea cycle disorders showed significant metabolic improvement, permitting them to grow until liver transplantation could be performed safely [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatocyte-transplantation/abstract/64\" class=\"abstract_t\">64</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2846881217\"><span class=\"h2\">Liver failure</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>While the efficacy of transplanted cells can be best evaluated in the treatment of inherited metabolic disorders, the greatest need for hepatocyte transplantation is for acute and chronic liver failure. In an early study, hepatocytes were injected into the spleen of several patients with chronic hepatitis and cirrhosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatocyte-transplantation/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>]. Epidermal growth factor was injected into the splenic artery to stimulate hepatocyte proliferation. The transplanted hepatocytes were detected in 88 percent of patients 1 to 11 months after transplantation, although the metabolic benefit was not clear.</p><p>Another group injected 5 billion pooled human fetal (24- to 34-week gestation) hepatocytes into the peritoneal cavity of patients with fulminant hepatic failure (FHF) of less than two weeks in duration and grade III to IV encephalopathy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatocyte-transplantation/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. More patients who received the transplanted cells survived (48 versus 33 percent), but the difference was not statistically significant because of the small number of patients. Best results were obtained when the transplantation was performed during earlier stages of liver failure. In the survivors, plasma ammonia and serum bilirubin levels decreased in 48 hours after hepatocyte transplantation.</p><p>In the United States, hepatocyte transplantation has been performed in an effort to &quot;bridge&quot; patients awaiting OLT for FHF or chronic liver failure with acute decompensation (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F70376\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef70376 \">table 3</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F69654\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef69654 \">table 4</a>). Following transplantation by infusion into the splenic artery, 66 percent of patients with FHF survived long enough to receive OLT [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatocyte-transplantation/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. In the patients with chronic failure with acute decompensation, only one of four survived long enough to receive OLT. In the transplant recipients, there was improvement in plasma ammonia levels, grade of encephalopathy, cerebral perfusion pressure, and prothrombin time, but the differences from the values observed in controls were not statistically significant. Because most survivors had received OLT, it is difficult to be sure whether hepatocyte transplantation provided a significant clinical benefit. However, in one 37-year-old woman with hepatitis B virus-induced liver failure, there was sufficient recovery after hepatocyte transplantation to permit discharge from the hospital without OLT.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1609006577\"><span class=\"h2\">Ex vivo gene therapy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Ex vivo gene therapy has been performed in patients with familial hypercholesterolemia (LDL receptor deficiency). Hepatocytes were isolated by collagenase perfusion of resected liver segments from patients. The cells were transduced with LDL receptor gene in culture using retroviral vectors, and were transplanted back into the donors. Although persistence of the transgene expression was demonstrated [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatocyte-transplantation/abstract/57\" class=\"abstract_t\">57</a>], the serum cholesterol reduction was modest and probably not therapeutically beneficial [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatocyte-transplantation/abstract/65\" class=\"abstract_t\">65</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3019873064\"><span class=\"h1\">BARRIERS AND ADDITIONAL RESEARCH</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>As discussed above, the major barrier to extensive clinical application of hepatocyte transplantation is the shortage of donor organs for hepatocyte isolation. Hepatocytes are usually obtained from donor organs that have been rejected for transplantation because of extensive steatosis. Cells obtained from these livers are of variable viability and their survival after cryopreservation is unpredictable. The best quality hepatocytes are obtained from segmental transplants or reduced liver grafts, which have the shortest duration of cold-ischemia.</p><p>Although the experience is limited, it appears that repeated cell transplantation from multiple donors may increase the possibility of allograft rejection. Development of reliable methods of cryopreservation of human hepatocytes will be needed for repeated transplantation of hepatocytes obtained from a single donor. A study in fumaryl acetoacetate dehydrogenase-(FAH) deficient mice (model of hereditary tyrosinemia) demonstrated that adult human hepatocytes, like adult rodent hepatocytes, retain the capacity to proliferate extensively and massively repopulate the liver [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatocyte-transplantation/abstract/66\" class=\"abstract_t\">66</a>]. In some disorders, such as the classic form of alpha1 antitrypsin (AAT) deficiency, accumulation of the mutant AAT-Z protein in hepatocytes causes a stress in the host liver that promotes spontaneous repopulation by transplanted normal hepatocytes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatocyte-transplantation/abstract/54\" class=\"abstract_t\">54</a>]. However, in a majority of liver-based inherited metabolic disorders, the longevity and regenerative capacity of host hepatocytes remains normal. In these cases, an alternative solution could be to prepare the host liver to promote repopulation by a relatively small number of transplanted hepatocytes. The use of preparative irradiation of the host liver [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatocyte-transplantation/abstract/6,56,67\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,56,67</a>] or treatment of the host with drugs (eg, retrorsine) that suppress host hepatocyte proliferation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatocyte-transplantation/abstract/55\" class=\"abstract_t\">55</a>] have been evaluated in preclinical studies for enhancing the engraftment and preferential proliferation of the transplanted cells. </p><p>Alternative sources of hepatocytes are also being explored. Research on culture and transplantation of fetal hepatocytes is in its infancy, but offers great possibilities. As mentioned above, conditionally immortalized human hepatocytes, from which the immortalizing gene (eg, SV40 large T antigen) can be deleted prior to transplantation, have been developed and are being evaluated [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatocyte-transplantation/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. Transplantation of hepatocytes from xenogeneic sources is also being explored, although major immunological barriers and the risk of infection of human tissues by known or unknown animal viruses are important concerns. A novel potential source of human hepatocytes is an animal liver repopulated by human hepatocytes. This has been achieved by transplanting human hepatocytes serially into FAH-deficient, immunodeficient mice. Human hepatocytes isolated from the repopulated mouse livers have been successfully transplanted into the livers of immunodeficient animals [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatocyte-transplantation/abstract/66\" class=\"abstract_t\">66</a>]. </p><p>A noninvasive method to measure the mass of engrafted cells could greatly facilitate the follow-up and optimization of hepatocyte transplantation methods. One way to accomplish this is to mark cells genetically before transplantation. Luciferase-based optical imaging, which is effective in mouse experiments, is not applicable to humans because of the greater thickness of the abdominal wall. However, magnetic resonance imaging methods are being developed for three-dimensional quantification of transplanted hepatocytes using genetic marking with creatine kinase, which is not normally expressed in hepatocytes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatocyte-transplantation/abstract/68\" class=\"abstract_t\">68</a>].</p><p>Hepatocyte transplantation would be much more useful and attractive if the need for immunosuppression could be circumvented. For this purpose, the immune response of the host to specific alloantigens could be abrogated by interference with costimulation between antigen-presenting cells and cytotoxic lymphocytes, at the time of hepatocyte transplantation, by the administration of CTLA4-Ig alone, or in combination with an anti-CD40 antibody. CTLA4-Ig could also be expressed in vivo by gene transfer for this purpose [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatocyte-transplantation/abstract/69,70\" class=\"abstract_t\">69,70</a>]. As an alternative, immunomodulatory genes could be transduced into the donor hepatocytes before transplantation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatocyte-transplantation/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Some studies in rodents showed that ex vivo transduction with some viral genes can protect transplanted liver cells from allograft rejection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatocyte-transplantation/abstract/71\" class=\"abstract_t\">71</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2782677197\"><span class=\"h1\">SUMMARY</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Hepatocyte transplantation has many potential clinical applications including treatment of inherited metabolic diseases and management of acute and chronic liver failure.
