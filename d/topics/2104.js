Bleeding can occur immediately following polypectomy or be delayed from hours to up to 29 days [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bleeding-after-colonic-polypectomy/abstract/2,5,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,5,6</a>]. The severity of bleeding ranges from arterial pumping to minor oozing. The risk is related to the type and size of the polyp, the location of the polyp, the technique of polypectomy, and the coagulation status of the patient [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bleeding-after-colonic-polypectomy/abstract/3-5,8-11\" class=\"abstract_t\">3-5,8-11</a>]. Bleeding can be controlled endoscopically in the majority of patients. Thus, those who perform polypectomy should also have the ability to perform hemostasis and should have the necessary tools available.</p><p>This topic will review bleeding after colonic polypectomy, including measures to decrease the risk of bleeding and the management of bleeding. Other issues related to colonoscopy and polypectomy are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-colonoscopy-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of colonoscopy in adults&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=endoscopic-removal-of-large-colon-polyps\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Endoscopic removal of large colon polyps&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">IMMEDIATE BLEEDING</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Immediate bleeding has been observed in approximately 1.5 percent of polypectomies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bleeding-after-colonic-polypectomy/abstract/2,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,12</a>]. The risk is increased when blended current (rather than pure coagulation current) is used [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bleeding-after-colonic-polypectomy/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>] and when the snare is pulled through larger polyps without the use of cautery (&quot;cheese wiring&quot;) (although bleeding is not a problem with small polyps [ie, less than 1 cm] removed in this manner [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bleeding-after-colonic-polypectomy/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]). Bleeding is also more likely with large polyps (particularly if the patient is anticoagulated), polyps with a thick stalk, and polyps that are sessile [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bleeding-after-colonic-polypectomy/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p>In a multicenter study, immediate bleeding was observed in 2.8 percent of 9336 polypectomies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bleeding-after-colonic-polypectomy/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. Independent risk factors for bleeding included age &ge;65 years, cardiovascular or chronic renal disease, use of anticoagulants, polyp size greater than 1 cm, polyp morphology, poor bowel preparation, cutting mode of electrosurgical current, and inadvertent cutting of a polyp before current application. This is similar to our experience, where the risk of significant bleeding is greatest with sessile polyps larger than 2 cm in diameter, followed by those with a thick stalk; significant bleeding is unlikely to occur if a small polyp is removed with a snare without cautery.</p><p>Polyps up to 1 cm in diameter have been safely removed in patients on <a href=\"topic.htm?path=warfarin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">warfarin</a> therapy. In some cases, the warfarin has been discontinued warfarin for 36 hours (to avoid a supratherapeutic INR). In a report of 225 polypectomies in 123 anticoagulated patients, three patients bled (one requiring treatment) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bleeding-after-colonic-polypectomy/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. All patients in the study had prophylactic endoscopic clips applied to their polypectomy sites. In a randomized trial, 70 patients with a total of 159 polyps up to 1 cm in diameter underwent polypectomy while taking warfarin [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bleeding-after-colonic-polypectomy/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. Patients were assigned to have their polyps removed either with a cold snare technique or electrocautery. Immediate bleeding occurred in 10 of 70 patients (14 percent) and was more common in patients who had their polyps removed using electrocautery (23 versus 6 percent).</p><p>Most bleeding that occurs immediately after resection can be controlled by the endoscopist [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bleeding-after-colonic-polypectomy/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. The technique for controlling bleeding depends upon the severity of bleeding, the type of polyp, and individual preference. A combination of techniques is frequently required (see below). Patients whose polypectomies were performed on an ambulatory basis may be sent home after hemostasis has been achieved, assuming that the bleeding was not torrential, and the patient was stable throughout the bleeding episode. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Management of active bleeding</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h3\">Application of pressure</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>For pedunculated polyps, immediate bleeding after resection can usually be stopped by regrasping the pedicle with a snare and holding pressure on the pedicle to stop blood flow, permitting the hemostatic cascade to occur. Retransection of the pedicle can be performed but is not the preferred approach since there may be too little of the pedicle remaining to regrasp if bleeding recommences. Holding a snare around a bleeding pedicle tightly for five minutes will usually result in hemostasis. Reapplication of pressure for an additional five minutes will almost always result in cessation of bleeding when bleeding recurs upon loosening the snare. </p><p>Once active bleeding is controlled, there is usually no further acute bleeding, although further application of bipolar cautery (BICAP) to the bleeding site or injection with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epinephrine-adrenaline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">epinephrine</a> or application of endoclips or an endoloop is reasonable. Pretransection epinephrine injection has been suggested, but its efficacy has not been demonstrated. Because of the low risk of immediate bleeding, most endoscopists do not preinject the stalk of pedunculated polyps with epinephrine. (See <a href=\"#H11\" class=\"local\">'Epinephrine injection'</a> below.)</p><p>Several additional measures, including <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epinephrine-adrenaline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">epinephrine</a> injection and the applications of hemoclips, used alone or in combination can be effective in patients with large stalks in whom bleeding cannot be controlled using the regrasping maneuver (such as those in whom the residual stalk cannot be ensnared). </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h3\">Epinephrine</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The bleeding site can be injected with dilute <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epinephrine-adrenaline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">epinephrine</a> (1:10,000) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bleeding-after-colonic-polypectomy/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>], although some use a 1:20,000 dilution to reduce the risk of cardiovascular complications [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bleeding-after-colonic-polypectomy/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. Several milliliters may be required to stop the bleeding. The desired effect is a large bleb at the bleeding site, with several injections made around the bleeding site. While catecholamine levels rise following epinephrine injection for actively bleeding peptic ulcers in the upper GI tract, these levels have not been associated with any adverse cardiac events [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bleeding-after-colonic-polypectomy/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h3\">Cautery</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Another treatment option is to treat the bleeding site with cautery. This can be achieved with thermal probes, bipolar electrocoagulation (BICAP), or the tip of a polypectomy snare. When a thermal probe or BICAP is used, the current delivered should be decreased by approximately 50 percent relative to that used in the upper GI tract because the colon wall is very thin. The heater probe can be set at 15 J and the BICAP at 10 to 15 W applied for one to two seconds. Multiple applications at these power settings with light pressure of the probe appear to be safe in the colon. However, it is not wise to apply a great deal of force, as is recommended in the upper intestinal tract, due to the increased risk of perforation. The water jet from the probes is extremely useful for precise localization of the bleeding site to permit accurate probe application. </p><p>Monopolar cautery can also be used to control immediate bleeding from a polypectomy site with either the tip of the polypectomy snare, the hot biopsy forceps, or a grasping forceps. When the tip of the polypectomy snare is used as a cautery device, the setting does not need to be changed from that used during polypectomy; however, the snare-tip method is associated with an increased risk of a deep burn to the colon wall. A hot biopsy forceps (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F82749\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef82749 \">picture 1</a>) or a grasping forceps may also be used but requires a different technique than the other thermal probes. The area is grasped with the forceps and the tissue gently tented toward the colonoscope. A short 1- to 2-second burst of cautery is typically applied using this technique. Repeated use of the activated hot biopsy forceps to the tissue results in better fulguration than continuous cautery since the latter may cause heating of tissue without hemostasis. The setting of the electrosurgical unit for the hot biopsy forceps is the same as for polypectomy, although it may be increased to 50 W with the grasping forceps. This method is most commonly used in larger colon polyp resection by endoscopic submucosal resection (ESD) or endoscopic mucosal resection (EMR). <br/></p><p>Oozing can be controlled with argon plasma coagulation (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F62421\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef62421 \">picture 2</a>). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=argon-plasma-coagulation-in-the-management-of-gastrointestinal-hemorrhage\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Argon plasma coagulation in the management of gastrointestinal hemorrhage&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h3\">Hemoclips</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Bleeding can also be controlled by placement of hemoclips directly on the bleeding site in an attempt to occlude the bleeding vessel or on the pedicle of a stalk [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bleeding-after-colonic-polypectomy/abstract/21-23\" class=\"abstract_t\">21-23</a>]. The average number of clips required to achieve hemostasis in one report was 2.9&plusmn;2 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bleeding-after-colonic-polypectomy/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. The clips are especially useful for bleeding from flat polypectomy sites, but have also been used successfully to stop arterial pulsatile bleeding from the severed stalk of pedunculated polyps [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bleeding-after-colonic-polypectomy/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=endoclip-therapy-in-the-gastrointestinal-tract-bleeding-lesions-and-beyond\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Endoclip therapy in the gastrointestinal tract: Bleeding lesions and beyond&quot;</a>.)</p><p>We use endoclips or endoloops to seal a postpolypectomy site in patients who have bleeding diatheses. (See <a href=\"#H10\" class=\"local\">'Prevention of immediate bleeding'</a> below and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=endoclip-therapy-in-the-gastrointestinal-tract-bleeding-lesions-and-beyond\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Endoclip therapy in the gastrointestinal tract: Bleeding lesions and beyond&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h3\">Loops and band ligators</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Often, when pedunculated polyps are resected by snare polypectomy, even though a long pedicle may be transected in its mid portion, the residual stalk may contract immediately leaving a flat polypectomy site. The phenomenon of pedicle disappearance may result in a situation where there is no protuberant stalk remaining on the colon wall to regrasp with a snare. If a sufficient length of pedicle remains after resection, a detachable endoloop can be applied to the bleeding stalk for hemostasis.</p><p>Massive immediate and delayed postpolypectomy bleeding has also been managed by band ligation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bleeding-after-colonic-polypectomy/abstract/24-26\" class=\"abstract_t\">24-26</a>]. Care must be taken to avoid high suction pressure, since the thin muscularis propria and serosa could be entrapped within the band, leading to subsequent full thickness necrosis. Endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) has demonstrated that the colon wall varies in thickness from 1.06 to 1.83 mm [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bleeding-after-colonic-polypectomy/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. Approximately one-third of the thickness of the colon wall consists of mucosa, one-third submucosa, and the rest muscularis propria. High suction can easily pull the thin muscle layer into the banding device, leading to full thickness strangulation and possible perforation when the tissue sloughs. Band ligation is probably unsafe in the right colon where other methods to achieve hemostasis are preferable [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bleeding-after-colonic-polypectomy/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h2\">Prevention of immediate bleeding</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Coagulation status should be optimized in patients who are scheduled to undergo colonoscopy with possible polypectomy. Recommendations regarding anticoagulants and antiplatelet agents in patients undergoing polypectomy and undergoing endoscopy in general are discussed below and in separate topic reviews. (See <a href=\"#H16\" class=\"local\">'Prevention of delayed bleeding'</a> below and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=endoscopic-procedures-in-patients-with-disorders-of-hemostasis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Endoscopic procedures in patients with disorders of hemostasis&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-anticoagulants-in-patients-undergoing-endoscopic-procedures\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of anticoagulants in patients undergoing endoscopic procedures&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-antiplatelet-agents-in-patients-undergoing-endoscopic-procedures\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of antiplatelet agents in patients undergoing endoscopic procedures&quot;</a>.)</p><p>In addition, there are several techniques that can be applied prior to transection for prevention of bleeding during polypectomy. We use cold snare polypectomy for all polyps less than 1 cm in diameter. Large polyps, especially on the right side of the colon, may be lifted with a saline injection prior to removal. However, there have been no well-designed randomized trials to guide the selection of technique. Thus, the decision to use a prophylactic measure depends upon the endoscopist&rsquo;s experience, preference, and appraisal of the risk of bleeding. The following discussion will summarize our experience and preferences. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=endoscopic-removal-of-large-colon-polyps\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Endoscopic removal of large colon polyps&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h3\">Epinephrine injection</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span><a href=\"topic.htm?path=epinephrine-adrenaline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Epinephrine</a> can be injected into the stalk of a pedunculated polyp or into the base of a sessile polyp prior to transection. However, the low risk of immediate bleeding following resection of such polyps does not justify its routine use. One randomized trial that evaluated this issue included 120 patients with 151 sessile polyps who were randomly assigned to prophylactic epinephrine injection or standard polypectomy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bleeding-after-colonic-polypectomy/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. A total of nine episodes of postpolypectomy bleeding were observed, two in the epinephrine group and seven in the control group. There was one case of perforation in each group. Although the differences in immediate bleeding reached statistical significance, the rate of bleeding observed in the control group was much higher than has been described in other reports, raising uncertainty regarding the generalizability of the findings. Similar considerations apply in interpreting another report that reached the same conclusions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bleeding-after-colonic-polypectomy/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. A later study reported that there was no difference in the rates of overall, early, or late bleeding, regardless of whether epinephrine was added to the saline solution for submucosal injections during EMR of polyps over 10 mm in diameter [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bleeding-after-colonic-polypectomy/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h3\">Detachable loops</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A detachable nylon loop can be placed over the stalk like a wire snare and tightened with a one-way silicone-rubber stopper. The stopper prevents opening of the loop once it has been closed. The fully assembled endoloop, with an accompanying over-sheath (to permit the soft nylon loop to slide through the instrument channel), has the same diameter as a snare sheath. Once extruded from the end of the delivery system, the loop can be maneuvered around the head of a polyp or onto the bleeding base under direct vision (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F59681\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef59681 \">picture 3</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F68387\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef68387 \">picture 4</a>). There are two sizes of loops, with the smaller (2.5 cm in diameter) being best suited for capture of the postpolypectomy base, and the larger (4 cm in diameter) used prepolypectomy for hemostasis. The loops spontaneously slough in approximately four to seven days, leaving residual shallow ulcers.</p><p>A randomized trial using detachable snares or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epinephrine-adrenaline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">epinephrine</a> stalk injection showed that both of these had a lower incidence of early bleeding following snare polypectomy of pedunculated polyps (&lt;2 percent) compared with snare transection alone (6 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bleeding-after-colonic-polypectomy/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>]. As expected, large pedunculated polyps had more bleeding than those in the 10 to 19 mm range. The treatment of patients who had bleeding consisted of epinephrine injection <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> clips. A separate randomized trial found a significantly lower rebleeding rate with combination therapy using detachable snare plus epinephrine injection compared with epinephrine injection alone [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bleeding-after-colonic-polypectomy/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>].</p><p>While the loop can be used for added hemostasis during or after polypectomy, we believe its greatest utility is after polypectomy, when the endoscopist is concerned about the site, or if bleeding is seen. Placement of the loop after polypectomy is usually easier than placement prior to polypectomy. The loop is deployed onto the base of a severed pedunculated polyp and left there for hemostasis. However, sometimes the resected pedicle flattens, leaving no protuberant stalk on which to place the loop [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bleeding-after-colonic-polypectomy/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. In this event, a two-channel endoscope can be used to grasp the bleeding site with a forceps while placing a loop over the bleeding site to strangulate the blood supply [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bleeding-after-colonic-polypectomy/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>]. It may also be possible to place the flexible loop into a transparent mucosectomy cap and, after suctioning the base of the polypectomy site into the cap, successfully deploy the loop on the residual pedicle [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bleeding-after-colonic-polypectomy/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>]. Occasionally, hemoclips and loops are deployed sequentially to stop bleeding [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bleeding-after-colonic-polypectomy/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>].</p><p>We do not routinely place loops on polyp pedicles, even large pedicles, because of the low risk of bleeding [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bleeding-after-colonic-polypectomy/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Because the loops are somewhat flexible, they can be quite difficult to pass over the head of a large polyp. Under the best of circumstances, the detachable loop can be placed over a polyp and maneuvered toward the colon wall. After securing the loop, a snare must be placed over the top of the polyp and positioned above the loop ligature trying to avoid partial ensnaring of the loop (which would make transection impossible). Our experience is that the floppy loop can become entrapped within the interstices of a large polyp and, when tightened, actually constrict the polyp head rather than the pedicle, making subsequent transection of the stalk difficult or even impossible. Other problems with the loop include severing of the pedicle by over tightening (the endoscopy assistant does not experience the same tactile sensation as when handling a standard snare), slipping of the loop, and insufficient tightening [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bleeding-after-colonic-polypectomy/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. We typically only use loops prior to polypectomy when removing pedunculated polyps from patients with known bleeding diatheses, such a clotting factor deficiencies or ongoing need for antithrombotic or anticoagulant therapy.</p><p>Some centers have reported dramatic immediate reduction in polyp size by injecting the stalk with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epinephrine-adrenaline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">epinephrine</a>. This then can enable easier and more accurate loop placement [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bleeding-after-colonic-polypectomy/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h3\">Hemoclips</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>It is possible to apply a hemoclip onto the base of a smaller pedunculated polyp (the stalk should be able to be completely entrapped by the closed hemoclips) close to the bowel wall (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F56809\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef56809 \">picture 5</a>) and snare the polyp above the clip using standard snare techniques. It is important that the wire snare does not touch the metal clip, lest an aberrant current pathway be activated, with a potential burn of the colon wall [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bleeding-after-colonic-polypectomy/abstract/38,39\" class=\"abstract_t\">38,39</a>]. Our personal preference is to use the clips in case of bleeding and not to apply them prophylactically.

Patients who received polidocanol were less likely to have immediate or delayed bleeding than patients who received epinephrine (4 versus 11 percent and 1 versus 6 percent, respectively). While sclerosant injection has been associated with significant adverse events (including transmural wall necrosis and perforation) when used in higher concentrations, there were no perforations seen in this study.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14\"><span class=\"h1\">DELAYED BLEEDING</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There appear to be two general causes for postpolypectomy hemorrhage. One is sloughing of the eschar that covered a blood vessel. Dislodgement may be spontaneous or related to the passage of the fecal effluent across the eschar. Another cause is related to excavation of a zone of thermal necrosis induced by the electrothermal energy used to sever and cauterize the polypectomy site. Over several days, the zone of thermal necrosis excavates to the level of non-injured tissue. The actual zone of thermal necrosis is usually considerably deeper than is visualized at the time of polypectomy. The necrosis invariably involves some degree of the submucosa, which may lead to hemorrhage should it extend into a blood vessel.</p><p>Delayed bleeding occurs in up to 2 percent of patients who have polyps removed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bleeding-after-colonic-polypectomy/abstract/2,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,6</a>]. It develops on average five to seven days after the procedure, but it can be seen from a few hours to 29 days later [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bleeding-after-colonic-polypectomy/abstract/2,5,6,41\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,5,6,41</a>].

Having a polypectomy was one of the associated risk factors for delayed bleeding.</p><p>Although use of NSAIDs and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aspirin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">aspirin</a> are commonly believed to increase the risk of delayed bleeding, studies suggest the risk of post-polypectomy bleeding is not increased with their use [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bleeding-after-colonic-polypectomy/abstract/10,49\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,49</a>]By contrast, patients receiving anticoagulant therapy (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=warfarin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">warfarin</a>) do have an increased risk for delayed postpolypectomy bleeding [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bleeding-after-colonic-polypectomy/abstract/43,50,51\" class=\"abstract_t\">43,50,51</a>]. There usually is some slight bleeding that occurs when the coagulation eschar sloughs, which can occur several days to several weeks after polypectomy, when the patient's INR is at a therapeutic level. Bleeding from the sloughed eschar in an anticoagulated patient can become a potentially serious matter. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=endoscopic-procedures-in-patients-with-disorders-of-hemostasis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Endoscopic procedures in patients with disorders of hemostasis&quot;</a>.)</p><p>A retrospective study looked at 425 patients receiving <a href=\"topic.htm?path=warfarin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">warfarin</a> therapy and 800 matched controls [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bleeding-after-colonic-polypectomy/abstract/51\" class=\"abstract_t\">51</a>]. Most of the patients had their warfarin stopped four days prior to the colonoscopy and the mean INR for patients taking warfarin was 1.3 the day prior to the colonoscopy. Most patients resumed their warfarin the evening of the colonoscopy. The overall rate of postpolypectomy bleeding was 1 percent. Bleeding was more common in patients receiving warfarin compared with those not on warfarin (2.6 percent versus 0.2 percent). On predictive modeling, warfarin therapy was an independent predictor of postpolypectomy bleeding (adjusted odds ratio 11.6).</p><p>Postpolypectomy bleeding in patients on <a href=\"topic.htm?path=warfarin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">warfarin</a> who do not stop it prior to the procedure has also been studied. In the randomized trial referenced above, 70 patients with a total of 159 polyps up to 1 cm in diameter underwent polypectomy while taking warfarin [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bleeding-after-colonic-polypectomy/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. Patients were assigned to have their polyps removed either with a cold snare technique or snare electrocautery. Delayed bleeding occurred in 5 of 70 patients (7 percent). All of the bleeding occurred in the 35 patients who had their polyps removed using electrocautery. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Immediate bleeding'</a> above.) </p><p>Heparin bridge therapy, sometimes used to reduce the risk of post-polypectomy bleeding in high risk patients for thromboembolic disease, is associated with a high incidence of bleeding [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bleeding-after-colonic-polypectomy/abstract/52,53\" class=\"abstract_t\">52,53</a>]. In a study of 117 patients that included 45 patients undergoing a heparin bridge and polypectomy, the risk of post-polypectomy bleeding in the heparin bridge group was significantly higher as compared with controls (20 versus 1.4 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bleeding-after-colonic-polypectomy/abstract/52\" class=\"abstract_t\">52</a>]. In addition, post-polypectomy bleeding in patients undergoing heparin bridging therapy was later in onset (mean post-procedure day 4 versus day 1) and resulted in longer hospital stays. </p><p>There are several studies that have examined the effect of thienopyridines on post polypectomy bleeding. A meta-analysis of five observational studies that included 574 patients on <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clopidogrel-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">clopidogrel</a> and 6169 control subjects found an increase in delayed post polypectomy bleeding in patients on continued clopidogrel therapy, pooled relative risk 4.66 (95% confidence interval 2.37-9.17) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bleeding-after-colonic-polypectomy/abstract/54\" class=\"abstract_t\">54</a>]. However, the studies have shown that the risk of post polypectomy bleeding is almost entirely in those patients who continue on both <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aspirin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">aspirin</a> and a thienopyridine and is not increased in patients maintained on a thienopyridine alone [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bleeding-after-colonic-polypectomy/abstract/55,56\" class=\"abstract_t\">55,56</a>]. The cardiovascular risks of discontinuing antithrombotic agents must be carefully weighed against the risk of post polypectomy bleeding. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-antiplatelet-agents-in-patients-undergoing-endoscopic-procedures#H8\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of antiplatelet agents in patients undergoing endoscopic procedures&quot;, section on 'P2Y12 platelet receptor blockers'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15\"><span class=\"h2\">Management of delayed bleeding</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Most polypectomy bleeding can be managed endoscopically, with only the unusual case requiring surgery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bleeding-after-colonic-polypectomy/abstract/6,57\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,57</a>]. Approximately half of patients who present to the hospital with hematochezia within six hours to 14 days after polypectomy require blood transfusion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bleeding-after-colonic-polypectomy/abstract/43\" class=\"abstract_t\">43</a>]. Colonoscopy should be performed urgently in patients who appear to be actively bleeding [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bleeding-after-colonic-polypectomy/abstract/46\" class=\"abstract_t\">46</a>]. Blood is a cathartic and may clean residual stool out of the colon. </p><p>The frequency with which patients pass bloody bowel movements is a good indicator of whether bleeding is ongoing. Bowel movements are frequent and bloody in those with active bleeding, while the cessation of bleeding is almost always heralded by the absence of stooling. In patients who present with ongoing bloody bowel movements, an urgent colonoscopy should be performed. On the other hand, it is generally safe to wait and observe while applying conservative therapy if bowel movements have stopped. However, urgent endoscopic examination should be performed if bleeding resumes during observation. If the bleeding has stopped spontaneously, it is unusual for it to resume. As a result, there is generally no need to repeat the colonoscopic examination to evaluate or treat the presumed site of bleeding in a patient whose bleeding has stopped.</p><p>The timing of intervention also depends upon the estimated rate of bleeding. If there are frequent bloody bowel movements, and the patient becomes hemodynamically unstable, urgent colonoscopy should be performed. On the other hand, if small amounts of blood are being passed per rectum, conservative treatment may be considered. The best time to perform an urgent colonoscopic examination is when the full endoscopy staff is present, and that is usually during the hours of operation of the endoscopy unit. If patients come to the emergency department late after hours, or in the early hours of the morning, it may be prudent to give the patient an oral electrolyte lavage and perform the colonoscopic examination when the endoscopy unit is open and the colon is cleaner and easier to visualize.</p><p>Therapy is often with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epinephrine-adrenaline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">epinephrine</a> injection in combination with a thermal modality [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bleeding-after-colonic-polypectomy/abstract/6,57\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,57</a>]. It has been our experience that there is a considerable amount of swelling and firm induration at the polypectomy site within one to two days of polypectomy. This inflammatory response may cause obliteration of the separation of the layers of the colon wall, resulting in the inability for epinephrine injection to infiltrate into the tissue spaces, causing the injected fluid solution to run out of the needle hole at the injection site. However, the induration and resulting increased thickness of the wall makes the use of thermal modalities safer, such that repeated applications of a heater probe or bipolar electrocautery (BICAP) can be used to achieve hemostasis.</p><p>Hemoclips are also effective; an average of 4.6 clips was required in one report of patients with severe bleeding that required hospitalization [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bleeding-after-colonic-polypectomy/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. Angiography may be of benefit in the presence of severe bleeding [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bleeding-after-colonic-polypectomy/abstract/58\" class=\"abstract_t\">58</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=angiographic-control-of-nonvariceal-gastrointestinal-bleeding-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Angiographic control of nonvariceal gastrointestinal bleeding in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Whenever patients present with postpolypectomy hemorrhage, the interventional radiology and surgical teams should be notified since it is impossible to know whether or not that patient will require emergency therapy. Surgery may be necessary when there is torrential hemorrhage. If only one polyp was removed, the endoscopist should be able to inform the surgeon as to which side of the colon needs to be resected. A subtotal colectomy may be required if several polyps were removed in various areas of the colon, and a colonoscopic examination cannot identify or exclude some of the distal-most sites. Angiographic therapy should be considered in cases of severe hemorrhage before proceeding to surgery. Super selective transcatheter arterial embolization with microcoils has been effective in controlling bleeding refractory to endoscopic therapy in case reports [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bleeding-after-colonic-polypectomy/abstract/59\" class=\"abstract_t\">59</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=angiographic-control-of-nonvariceal-gastrointestinal-bleeding-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Angiographic control of nonvariceal gastrointestinal bleeding in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H16\"><span class=\"h2\">Prevention of delayed bleeding</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Appropriate measures should be taken in patients with hereditary or acquired hemostatic disorders. Whether to discontinue anticoagulation or treat with bridge therapy in patients undergoing endoscopic procedures is discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-anticoagulants-in-patients-undergoing-endoscopic-procedures\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of anticoagulants in patients undergoing endoscopic procedures&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=endoscopic-procedures-in-patients-with-disorders-of-hemostasis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Endoscopic procedures in patients with disorders of hemostasis&quot;</a>.) </p><p>We request that the patient refrain from <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aspirin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">aspirin</a> for two weeks if the polyp to be removed is large and only if the patient is on aspirin therapy for primary prevention, despite the recommendation from the American Society of Gastrointestinal Endoscopy suggesting that polypectomy in the setting of aspirin use is not contraindicated [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bleeding-after-colonic-polypectomy/abstract/60\" class=\"abstract_t\">60</a>]. In a patient who is taking aspirin and is found to have a large polyp on screening colonoscopy, we will remove the polyp at that time rather than having the patient return for a second colonoscopy after stopping aspirin. If the polyp is greater than 2 cm in size, or if it is greater than 1 cm in size and the patient is on dual antiplatelet therapy or is receiving an anticoagulant, we will employ prophylactic measures (such as hemoclip placement) to try to decrease the risk of bleeding. </p><p>Two studies have confirmed the lack of association between postpolypectomy bleeding and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aspirin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">aspirin</a> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bleeding-after-colonic-polypectomy/abstract/50,61\" class=\"abstract_t\">50,61</a>] or antiplatelet agents [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bleeding-after-colonic-polypectomy/abstract/50\" class=\"abstract_t\">50</a>]. When patients have a coagulopathy or must return to an anticoagulation regimen, the risk of delayed bleeding may be reduced by the use of mechanical hemostatic tools such as hemoclips (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F60247\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef60247 \">picture 6</a>) or endoloops, though studies of this approach are lacking. (See <a href=\"#H10\" class=\"local\">'Prevention of immediate bleeding'</a> above.)</p><p>Studies have found that the routine use of hemoclips to close postpolypectomy ulcers in patients not taking anticoagulants or antiplatelet agents does not appear to reduce bleeding rates in [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bleeding-after-colonic-polypectomy/abstract/45,62\" class=\"abstract_t\">45,62</a>]. Similarly, prophylactic use of argon plasma coagulation did not reduce delayed bleeding in a randomized trial of 600 consecutive patients undergoing polypectomy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bleeding-after-colonic-polypectomy/abstract/63\" class=\"abstract_t\">63</a>]. Injection of a sclerosant has been associated with a lower rate of postpolypectomy bleeding, but may be associated with significant adverse events. (See <a href=\"#H68586133\" class=\"local\">'Other interventions'</a> above.)</p><p>Postpolypectomy diet does not appear to be a factor in delayed bleeding except (in our experience) in patients in whom the polypectomy leaves a large mucosal defect. We often suggest a liquid diet for 24 hours in such patients, followed by a day of soft food. For all other polypectomy patients, a regular diet is permitted, with a suggestion that the first meal be &quot;light.&quot;</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H635922960\"><span class=\"h1\">SOCIETY GUIDELINE LINKS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Links to society and government-sponsored guidelines from selected countries and regions around the world are provided separately.
