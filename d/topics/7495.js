It can be mild or severe.</p><p>Frostbite is most common on the ears, nose, cheeks, chin, fingers, and toes. Skin affected by frostbite might look white and feel numb or hard.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1823182364\"><span class=\"h1\">What are the symptoms of frostbite?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Symptoms can include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Cold, numb skin &ndash; Skin might look white or gray and feel hard or waxy.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Trouble moving the affected area &ndash; For example, fingers with frostbite might feel clumsy.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Blisters with fluid or blood inside</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Areas of black skin &ndash; This is a sign of severe frostbite.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1823182379\"><span class=\"h1\">How can I help a person who might have frostbite?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>If you think you or someone you are with might have frostbite, you should:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Move the person to a warmer place as soon as possible</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Take off any wet clothing</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Try to warm up the affected area. To do this, you can:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Put it in warm water &ndash; The water should feel comfortable when you touch it with unaffected skin. Do <strong>not</strong> use hot water.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Use body heat &ndash; For example, you can hold cold, numb fingers under the armpits.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Avoid things that could cause worse damage. For example:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Try not to walk on feet that have frostbite, unless you have to walk to get to a warm place.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Do not warm the area if it might get cold again before you see a doctor or nurse.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Do not rub the area.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Do not use a stove or fire to warm the area, because numb skin can get burned by accident.</p><p/><p>If frostbite symptoms don't get better after taking these steps, get to a hospital as soon as possible.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1823182396\"><span class=\"h1\">How is frostbite treated?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Treatments include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Warming the affected area in water &ndash; This can hurt, but doctors can give medicines to help with pain.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Medicine to help with blood flow &ndash; Frostbite can damage blood vessels and cause blood clots in affected body parts. This can lead to serious problems. Medicines that can help with blood flow include:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>tPA &ndash; If you have severe frostbite and a high risk of losing a body part, doctors might give you a medicine called &quot;tPA.&quot; tPA helps the blood flow normally again. But tPA increases the risk of severe bleeding, including bleeding in the brain. So doctors only give it to people with a low risk of bleeding.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span><a href=\"topic.htm?path=iloprost-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">Iloprost</a> &ndash; This medicine can also improve blood flow to the body parts with frostbite. It can be given with or without tPA. Iloprost is not available everywhere.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Tetanus shot &ndash; Tetanus is a germ (bacteria) that lives in the soil. It can get into tissue that is damaged by frostbite. A tetanus shot prevents people from getting sick.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Antibiotics &ndash; Tissue that is damaged by frostbite is more likely to get infected. If this happens, doctors can give antibiotic medicines.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Surgery &ndash; Severe frostbite can kill tissue. The dead tissue sometimes falls off by itself, but doctors sometimes need to remove it. Some people with severe frostbite need a kind of surgery called &quot;amputation&quot; to remove a damaged body part.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1823182413\"><span class=\"h1\">Can frostbite be prevented?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Yes. In most cases, you can prevent frostbite by being careful not to stay out in the cold for too long. Be sure to dress warmly enough. It can be good to wear:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A hat</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Face protection, such as a ski mask</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Sunglasses or goggles</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Mittens &ndash; Mittens keep hands warmer than gloves.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Warm, water-resistant shoes or boots</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Layers of clothing &ndash; These might include long underwear, fleece or wool clothing, and a coat and pants that protect against wind, rain, and snow.</p><p/><p>It can also help to:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Eat enough when you are out in the cold</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Avoid alcohol and smoking</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Avoid contact with water or metal &ndash; These can be very cold.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Know the weather &ndash; If it gets very cold and windy, frostbite can happen more quickly (in a few minutes).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Tell people where you are going</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Carry emergency supplies in case you are outside longer than you planned</p><p/><p>Some people put lotion or ointment on the skin to prevent frostbite. But this might actually make frostbite more likely.</p><p>Most people think frostbite only happens outside. But putting cold objects on the skin, such as ice packs, can cause frostbite. Only use an ice pack (or other cold object) for 15 minutes every 1 or 2 hours. Put a cloth or towel between the ice and your skin.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1823182437\"><span class=\"h1\">More on this topic</span></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=hypothermia-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Hypothermia (The Basics)</a></p></div><div id=\"reviewProcess\"><span>All topics are updated as new evidence becomes available and our <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/home/editorial-policy\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"policy policy_editorialpolicy\">peer review process</a> is complete.</span></div><div id=\"topicRetrievedDate\"><span class=\"emphasis\">This topic retrieved from UpToDate on: </span>Apr 03, 2018.</div><div id=\"disclaimer\">The content on the UpToDate website is not intended nor recommended as a substitute for medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.
