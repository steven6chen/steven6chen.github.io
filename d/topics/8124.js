The most frequently occurring form of SCD is sickle cell anemia (HbSS), followed by HbSC and HbS&szlig;-thalassemia. In SCD the majority of the hemoglobin (greater than 50 percent) is hemoglobin S. In the United States, 6 to 10 percent of African-American newborns have sickle cell trait (HbSA), and approximately 0.2 percent have sickle cell anemia (HbSS) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatic-manifestations-of-sickle-cell-disease/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Sickle cell trait is not considered SCD. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=introduction-to-hemoglobin-mutations\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Introduction to hemoglobin mutations&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The liver can be affected by a number of complications due to the disease itself and its treatment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatic-manifestations-of-sickle-cell-disease/abstract/2-4\" class=\"abstract_t\">2-4</a>]. In addition to the vascular complications from the sickling process, patients with SCD have often received multiple transfusions, placing them at risk for viral hepatitis, iron overload, and (combined with the effects of chronic hemolysis) the development of pigment gallstones, all of which may contribute to the development of liver disease. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epidemiology-and-transmission-of-hepatitis-c-virus-infection#H5\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Epidemiology and transmission of hepatitis C virus infection&quot;, section on 'Blood transfusion'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epidemiology-transmission-and-prevention-of-hepatitis-b-virus-infection#H7\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Epidemiology, transmission, and prevention of hepatitis B virus infection&quot;, section on 'Transfusion'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=red-blood-cell-transfusion-in-sickle-cell-disease#H105104\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Red blood cell transfusion in sickle cell disease&quot;, section on 'Excessive iron stores'</a>.)</p><p>The term &quot;sickle cell hepatopathy&quot; has sometimes been used to reflect the overlapping causes of liver dysfunction in these patients. Sickle cell hepatopathy occurs predominantly in patients with homozygous sickle cell anemia, and to a lesser extent in patients with HbSC disease or HbS&szlig;-thalassemia.</p><p>This topic will review the hepatic manifestation of SCD. Other issues related to SCD are discussed elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-the-clinical-manifestations-of-sickle-cell-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of the clinical manifestations of sickle cell disease&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-the-management-and-prognosis-of-sickle-cell-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of the management and prognosis of sickle cell disease&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">EPIDEMIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The overall incidence of liver disease in patients with sickle cell disease (SCD) has not been well established. The major risk factor for liver disease in patients with SCD is receiving multiple blood transfusions, which is associated with infection (hepatitis B and C) and excessive iron stores.</p><p>In one report, 32 of 100 patients had abnormal liver biochemical tests during a five-year follow-up period [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatic-manifestations-of-sickle-cell-disease/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. In an autopsy series, hepatomegaly was noted in 91 percent of 70 patients with sickle cell anemia or others forms of SCD, suggesting that some form of liver involvement is common [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatic-manifestations-of-sickle-cell-disease/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. In other autopsy series, 16 to 29 percent of patients had cirrhosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatic-manifestations-of-sickle-cell-disease/abstract/6-9\" class=\"abstract_t\">6-9</a>]. However, it is unclear whether cirrhosis was due to the sickle cell anemia itself or to concurrent liver disease acquired as a consequence of multiple transfusions, leading to excessive iron overload <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> chronic hepatitis B or C infection.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">LABORATORY AND RADIOLOGIC LIVER TESTS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Biochemical and radiologic hepatic abnormalities are common in individuals with sickle cell disease (SCD). A major risk factor for liver biochemical abnormalities in patients with SCD is infection (hepatis B or C) or excessive iron stores related to multiple blood transfusions. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=red-blood-cell-transfusion-in-sickle-cell-disease#H105104\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Red blood cell transfusion in sickle cell disease&quot;, section on 'Excessive iron stores'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Biochemical tests</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Elevated bilirubin levels, predominantly unconjugated, are universal in patients with SCD due to chronic hemolysis. Total bilirubin concentrations are usually &lt;6 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> (102.6 <span class=\"nowrap\">micromoles/L),</span> but may double during sickle hepatic crises [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatic-manifestations-of-sickle-cell-disease/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. In one series, 72 of 100 patients with sickle cell anemia had an isolated elevation of bilirubin, with no other clinical or laboratory evidence of liver disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatic-manifestations-of-sickle-cell-disease/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. Bilirubin levels correlated with lactic dehydrogenase levels, suggesting that variable levels found in patients are related to the degree of hemolysis <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> ineffective erythropoiesis rather than to disorders of bilirubin transport or processing. The serum aspartate aminotransferase level (AST) is also raised by hemolysis. Thus, AST levels correlate with lactic dehydrogenase levels and serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT) levels may more accurately reflect hepatocyte injury [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatic-manifestations-of-sickle-cell-disease/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].</p><p>Elevation of the serum alkaline phosphatase is common, particularly during pain crises. However, bone alkaline phosphatase is the major enzyme fraction contributing to this rise [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatic-manifestations-of-sickle-cell-disease/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. This is supported by the observation that the serum-5' nucleotidase concentration correlates with the ALT and gamma glutamyl transferase levels, but not with alkaline phosphatase levels [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatic-manifestations-of-sickle-cell-disease/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=enzymatic-measures-of-cholestasis-eg-alkaline-phosphatase-5-nucleotidase-gamma-glutamyl-transpeptidase\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Enzymatic measures of cholestasis (eg, alkaline phosphatase, 5'-nucleotidase, gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase)&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Acute elevations of the serum ALT and AST are seen in the setting of vasoocclusive crises leading to hepatic ischemia, whereas chronic liver function test abnormalities are usually due to coexisting hepatic pathology. In a study of 130 patients with sickle cell anemia or SCD, chronic abnormalities in liver function tests were found in 32 patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatic-manifestations-of-sickle-cell-disease/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. In 30 of these patients, the abnormalities could be explained by coexisting liver pathology, including chronic hepatitis B, common bile duct obstruction, and alcohol use. Only two patients had unexplained abnormalities, neither of whom had been tested for antibodies against hepatitis C. In another series of 121 consecutive patients with sickle cell anemia, 11 (9 percent) had chronically raised ALT levels. Of these, nine patients were positive for HCV antibodies and one for HBsAg [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatic-manifestations-of-sickle-cell-disease/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>].</p><p>Several studies have demonstrated low protein C and protein S levels in patients with sickle cell anemia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatic-manifestations-of-sickle-cell-disease/abstract/14-16\" class=\"abstract_t\">14-16</a>]. It is unclear whether decreased levels of protein C and S were primarily due to decreased hepatic production, or were a consequence of increased consumption. Low levels of protein C and S may increase the risk of stroke [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatic-manifestations-of-sickle-cell-disease/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=protein-c-deficiency\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Protein C deficiency&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h3\">Hyperammonemia due to zinc deficiency</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients with sickle cell anemia excrete excessive amounts of zinc due to impaired renal tubular handling [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatic-manifestations-of-sickle-cell-disease/abstract/17,18\" class=\"abstract_t\">17,18</a>], which may lead to zinc deficiency. <a href=\"topic.htm?path=deferoxamine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Deferoxamine</a> therapy may also increase urinary and fecal losses of zinc [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatic-manifestations-of-sickle-cell-disease/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. A study of 104 patients with sickle cell disease indicated that 44 percent had low plasma levels of zinc [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatic-manifestations-of-sickle-cell-disease/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. Zinc is a cofactor for ornithine transcarbamylase, a urea cycle enzyme [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatic-manifestations-of-sickle-cell-disease/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. Thus, zinc deficiency may be associated with inhibition of the urea cycle and hyperammonemia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatic-manifestations-of-sickle-cell-disease/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. The hyperammonemia may theoretically contribute to encephalopathy in cirrhotic patients with sickle cell anemia, and can be corrected by administration of zinc [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatic-manifestations-of-sickle-cell-disease/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. Zinc supplementation may also significantly decrease the number of <span class=\"nowrap\">sickle/pain</span> crises [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatic-manifestations-of-sickle-cell-disease/abstract/24,25\" class=\"abstract_t\">24,25</a>]. Thus zinc deficiency should be looked for and corrected.</p><p>Zinc may also regulate copper absorption from the gastrointestinal tract. Enhanced copper absorption and increased ceruloplasmin levels may be seen with zinc deficiency [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatic-manifestations-of-sickle-cell-disease/abstract/22,26\" class=\"abstract_t\">22,26</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Liver histology</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Percutaneous liver biopsy has been associated with serious complications when performed in individuals with SCD with acute hepatic disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatic-manifestations-of-sickle-cell-disease/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. Thus, the risk-benefit ratio of obtaining the liver histology must be strongly considered, particularly in light of how the results will alter management. Liver histology can be used to determine hepatic iron content. However, we typically do not perform a needle biopsy for assessment of liver iron in individuals with SCD. We reserve liver biopsy for individuals with SCD in whom magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)-based estimates of liver iron content are inconsistent with the transfusion history, or where there is concern regarding liver function, and we want to assess histology of the liver. Further, significant variability of the liver iron content may occur within the liver, such that a single needle biopsy may not be representative of the total iron content in the liver [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatic-manifestations-of-sickle-cell-disease/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H9\" class=\"local\">'Magnetic resonance imaging'</a> below.)</p><p>When it has been obtained, liver histology may reflect changes of concurrent chronic viral hepatitis, cholestasis due to common bile duct stones, and features primarily due to the sickle cell anemia itself. Histologic features due to sickle cell anemia include intrasinusoidal sickling with proximal sinusoidal dilatation, Kupffer cell hyperplasia with erythrophagocytosis, and hemosiderosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatic-manifestations-of-sickle-cell-disease/abstract/6,8,29-31\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,8,29-31</a>]. The following findings were observed in a postmortem series of 70 patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatic-manifestations-of-sickle-cell-disease/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]: sinusoidal red blood cell distension (71 percent), Kupffer cell erythrophagocytosis (91 percent), iron deposition (47 percent), focal necrosis (35 percent), portal fibrosis (20 percent), regenerative nodules (20 percent), and cirrhosis (16 percent).</p><p>Other histologic features may reflect the clinical setting. Mild centrilobular necrosis has been described in patients with sickle hepatic crises [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatic-manifestations-of-sickle-cell-disease/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. Widespread anoxic necrosis was seen in two post-mortem biopsies in patients with sickle cell intrahepatic cholestasis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatic-manifestations-of-sickle-cell-disease/abstract/10,32\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,32</a>]. Other findings that may be seen on liver biopsy include perisinusoidal fibrosis, peliosis hepatis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatic-manifestations-of-sickle-cell-disease/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>], and extramedullary erythropoiesis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatic-manifestations-of-sickle-cell-disease/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>].</p><p>The degree of intrasinusoidal sickling does not correlate with the serum aminotransferase concentrations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatic-manifestations-of-sickle-cell-disease/abstract/5,31,35\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,31,35</a>]. It is possible that some of the sickling observed in liver biopsy specimens results from fixation with formaldehyde, which in one study increased the sickle cell count from a mean of 12 to 48 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatic-manifestations-of-sickle-cell-disease/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].</p><p>The relationship between liver fibrosis and excessive iron stores is not well defined. In a retrospective study in individuals with SCD who were receiving regular blood transfusion therapy over a median of 8.4 years (range 2.3 to 24 years), predictors of liver fibrosis were assessed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatic-manifestations-of-sickle-cell-disease/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>]. A total of 26 individuals had at least two liver biopsies, with an average of two years between the first and second biopsy. Each biopsy was scored for fibrosis in a blinded fashion. The primary outcome was assessment of changes in liver fibrosis. Liver fibrosis was rated as grade 0 or 1 in all biopsies. Between the first and second biopsy, there was fibrosis regression in 6 individuals, development of fibrosis in 2, persistent fibrosis in 1, and absence of fibrosis in 17. No association between fibrosis and liver iron content was observed. </p><p>Eight individuals had magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) assessment of liver iron content within three months of a liver biopsy. Liver iron content in these individuals did not have any correlation with liver fibrosis. Although this retrospective study has limitations, these data suggest that natural history and risk factors for fibrosis in individuals with SCD receiving regular blood transfusions are poorly understood.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Imaging tests</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Imaging tests are frequently abnormal in patients with SCD.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h3\">Computed tomography</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Computed tomography (CT) scanning in patients with HbSS usually reveals diffuse hepatomegaly, possibly a reflection of expansion of the hepatic reticuloendothelial system. The spleen is usually small and atrophic and may have dense calcifications, often due to repeated splenic infarction. Compound heterozygotes (ie, HbSC and HbS&szlig;-thalassemia) usually have splenomegaly and may have infarcts, splenic rupture from extensive infarction and necrosis, hemorrhage, abscess, and acute splenomegaly due to sequestration. A CT scan of the abdomen may also incidentally reveal basal pulmonary pathology, especially in patients presenting with abdominal pain. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-the-pulmonary-complications-of-sickle-cell-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of the pulmonary complications of sickle cell disease&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h3\">Magnetic resonance imaging</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Given the advancement in the use of MRI methods to evaluate liver iron, MRI's reliability, and its noninvasive nature, MRI imaging has become the standard approach for assessing liver iron stores in individuals with SCD who are chronically transfused [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatic-manifestations-of-sickle-cell-disease/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>]. Many centers use commercial software to quantify liver iron stores, particularly in such patients. MRI in transfusion dependent patients usually shows decreased signal intensity in the liver and pancreas [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatic-manifestations-of-sickle-cell-disease/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>] due to iron deposition [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatic-manifestations-of-sickle-cell-disease/abstract/39-41\" class=\"abstract_t\">39-41</a>].

However, the distinction between these two categories is not always clear because they often exist concurrently. Furthermore, studies describing liver disease in these patients did not always evaluate for secondary causes of liver disease such as hepatitis C. Thus, the relative contribution of these coexisting conditions to the clinical presentation has not always been clear.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h2\">Acute pain and jaundice</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Acute presentation with pain and jaundice may be due to several different causes that may coexist. These include acute sickle hepatic crisis, sickle cell intrahepatic cholestasis, acute viral hepatitis, cholecystitis, and choledocholithiasis with common bile duct obstruction. The diagnosis can usually be established by the medical history and specific laboratory and radiologic testing.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h3\">Acute sickle hepatic crisis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Acute hepatic crisis has been observed in approximately 10 percent of patients with SCD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatic-manifestations-of-sickle-cell-disease/abstract/10,42,43\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,42,43</a>]. Patients usually present with acute right upper quadrant pain, nausea, low grade fever, tender hepatomegaly, and jaundice [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatic-manifestations-of-sickle-cell-disease/abstract/10,42,43\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,42,43</a>]. The serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) concentrations are seldom &gt;300 international <span class=\"nowrap\">units/L</span> (5.001 <span class=\"nowrap\">microkatal/L)</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatic-manifestations-of-sickle-cell-disease/abstract/10,43\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,43</a>], although levels &gt;1000 international <span class=\"nowrap\">unit/L</span> (16.67 <span class=\"nowrap\">microkatal/L)</span> have been described [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatic-manifestations-of-sickle-cell-disease/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. The serum total bilirubin concentration is usually &lt;15 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> (256.5 <span class=\"nowrap\">micromoles/L)</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatic-manifestations-of-sickle-cell-disease/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. Liver histology may reveal sickle cell thrombi in the sinusoidal space with engorgement by red blood cells. Other features that have been described include Kupffer cell hypertrophy, mild centrilobular necrosis, and occasional bile stasis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatic-manifestations-of-sickle-cell-disease/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>].</p><p>The pathogenesis is probably related to ischemia caused by sinusoidal obstruction. This hypothesis is supported by the observation that cocaine use by patients with sickle cell anemia can precipitate severe and life-threatening crisis due to synergistic hypoxic injury from cocaine-induced vasospasm and from sickling [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatic-manifestations-of-sickle-cell-disease/abstract/44\" class=\"abstract_t\">44</a>].</p><p>Supportive treatment with intravenous hydration and analgesia is usually sufficient.

Patients with hepatic sequestration usually present with right upper quadrant pain, rapidly increasing hepatomegaly, and a falling hematocrit [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatic-manifestations-of-sickle-cell-disease/abstract/45,46\" class=\"abstract_t\">45,46</a>]. One report described two patients with hepatic sequestration who initially presented with bone pain [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatic-manifestations-of-sickle-cell-disease/abstract/45\" class=\"abstract_t\">45</a>]. A rapid fall in the hematocrit paralleled a dramatic increase in the liver size, which returned to baseline after three to four days. Liver biochemical tests did not substantially change. Regression of hepatic size was associated with a rapid increase in hemoglobin from 4.2 to 7.5 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/dL</span> in one patient, indicating that not all sequestered cells were destroyed, and that some may return to the circulation upon resolution of the crisis and relief of sinusoidal obstruction.</p><p>Treatment of hepatic sequestration crisis, as with splenic sequestration crisis, involves prompt, aggressive restoration of blood volume to treat symptomatic hypovolemia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatic-manifestations-of-sickle-cell-disease/abstract/47,48\" class=\"abstract_t\">47,48</a>]. Typically, simple transfusion therapy is sufficient because the goal is to increase the hemoglobin to a level where the patient no longer has evidence of symptomatic anemia (congestive heart failure, postural hypotension, tachycardia, increased respiratory effort, altered mental status). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=red-blood-cell-transfusion-in-sickle-cell-disease#H9587206\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Red blood cell transfusion in sickle cell disease&quot;, section on 'Symptomatic or severe anemia'</a>.)</p><p>Transfusion should be given in small amounts (5 <span class=\"nowrap\">cc/kg</span> for children or 1 unit of red blood cells for adults) and the post-transfusion hemoglobin level should be targeted to the minimum level that prevents symptoms of hypovolemia, because the patient may within hours to days have an episode of auto-transfusion, resulting in blood that was sequestrated in the liver being released into the circulation, resulting in hyperviscosity syndrome. Following transfusion, patients should have their posttransfusion hemoglobin levels monitored closely (at least daily for several days following the transfusion or more frequently if the patient is symptomatic). If there is an abrupt rise in hemoglobin concentration to above 11 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/dL,</span> consideration should be made for phlebotomy.
