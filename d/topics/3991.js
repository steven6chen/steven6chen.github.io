Human infection occurs following contact with infected animals or invertebrate vectors. The clinical manifestations from <em>Francisella</em> infection may range from asymptomatic illness to septic shock and death, in part depending on the virulence of the infecting strain, portal of entry, inoculum, and the immune status of the host [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-treatment-of-tularemia/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p>The clinical manifestations, diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of tularemia will be reviewed here. The microbiology, pathogenesis, and epidemiology of infection due to <em>F. tularensis</em> are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epidemiology-microbiology-and-pathogenesis-of-tularemia\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Epidemiology, microbiology, and pathogenesis of tularemia&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL MANIFESTATIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The average incubation period following infection with <em>F. tularensis</em> is 3 to 5 days (range 1 to 21 days). Tularemia usually has an abrupt or rapid onset of nonspecific systemic symptoms, including some combination of fever, chills, anorexia, and malaise. Patients also may complain of headache, fatigue, soreness in the chest or muscles, abdominal pain, emesis, or diarrhea. Classically the fever may abate after a few days but then quickly return.</p><p>Additional signs and symptoms develop depending on the portal of entry; when patients come to medical attention, they usually have at least one of the six major clinical forms of tularemia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-treatment-of-tularemia/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]: </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Ulceroglandular tularemia</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Glandular tularemia</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Oculoglandular tularemia</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pharyngeal (oropharyngeal) tularemia</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Typhoidal tularemia</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pneumonic tularemia</p><p/><p>In some, systemic symptoms may have waned by the time the patient is evaluated. Thus, the correct diagnosis may be obscure, particularly if an exposure history or other epidemiological clues are not evident.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H17567759\"><span class=\"h2\">Forms of tularemia</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h3\">Ulceroglandular disease</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Ulceroglandular disease is the most common form of tularemia, and it is the clinical form most easily recognized as tularemia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-treatment-of-tularemia/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>]. In a review of 190 tularemia cases in Missouri between 2000 and 2007, ulceroglandular tularemia was the most common clinical form overall and among adults; among children, it was the second most common form (glandular disease was the most common among children) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-treatment-of-tularemia/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Ulceroglandular disease was also among the most common forms of tularemia during 2015 in Colorado, Nebraska, South Dakota, and Wyoming &ndash; states with significantly increased numbers of cases during that time [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-treatment-of-tularemia/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. Patients with ulceroglandular disease usually report recent animal contact, or exposure to potential insect vectors (particularly ticks). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epidemiology-microbiology-and-pathogenesis-of-tularemia\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Epidemiology, microbiology, and pathogenesis of tularemia&quot;</a>.) </p><p>Affected patients typically present with fever and a single erythematous papulo-ulcerative lesion with a central eschar at the site of a tick bite (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F51005\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef51005 \">picture 1</a>). Tender regional lymphadenopathy may begin before, at the same time, or shortly after the appearance of the skin lesion. Occasionally more than one skin lesion may be present [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-treatment-of-tularemia/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Ulcers on the hands and arms are more common following animal exposures; ulcers on the head or neck, trunk, perineum, and legs are more common following tick exposures. </p><p>Adenopathy involving cervical or occipital nodes is more common in children than adults, and the associated ulcers may be hidden in the scalp. In a series of 215 Swedish patients with infection due to the less virulent <em>F. tularensis</em> subspecies <em>holarctica</em>, erythema of the overlying skin was observed in 19 percent of cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-treatment-of-tularemia/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. A &quot;sporotrichoid&quot; presentation, or subcutaneous nodules along the draining lymphatics, has been described in some patients with tularemia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-treatment-of-tularemia/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. However, frank lymphangitis is not usually seen; its presence should suggest bacterial superinfection of the skin ulcer. </p><p>Patients seeking initial medical attention relatively late in the course of disease may have adenopathy with little or no fever and only evidence of a healed skin lesion.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h3\">Glandular disease</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Glandular tularemia refers to tender regional lymphadenopathy involving single or multiple nodes, in the absence of an identifiable skin lesion. In the past it has accounted for no more than 20 percent of tularemia cases in the United States [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-treatment-of-tularemia/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. However, among 190 cases of tularemia in Missouri between 2000 and 2007, glandular disease was the most common presentation among children (44 percent of cases), and it was the second most common presentation overall (28 percent of cases); it was the third most common presentation in adults (16 percent of cases) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-treatment-of-tularemia/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. </p><p>Glandular disease is transmitted via the same mechanism as ulceroglandular disease, although without clinical evidence of a lesion at the site of inoculation. Consideration of the correct diagnosis may be delayed, particularly if there is little or no fever at the time of presentation. Suppurated nodes can become fluctuant, an indication for surgical or needle drainage. (See <a href=\"#H11\" class=\"local\">'Treatment'</a> below.) </p><p>The differential diagnosis of ulceroglandular and glandular tularemia is broad and includes cat scratch disease, malignancy, mycobacterial infection, syphilis, lymphogranuloma venereum, chancroid, streptococcal or staphylococcal lymphadenitis, fungal infection, toxoplasmosis, sporotrichosis, rat bite fever, herpes simplex infection, anthrax, plague, and necrotic spider bite [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-treatment-of-tularemia/abstract/1,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,7</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H280874049\"><span class=\"h3\">Oculoglandular disease</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Oculoglandular tularemia accounts for a small percentage of tularemia cases. The illness is acquired when <em>F. tularensis</em> gains access to the conjunctiva, either via splashing infected material into the eye, rubbing eyes with contaminated fingers, or by infected aerosols. Eye symptoms are usually unilateral and may include pain, photophobia, and increased tearing. Examination of the eye demonstrates conjunctival erythema with edema and vascular engorgement. Some patients may have conjunctival purulence, small conjunctival ulcers or nodules, and periorbital erythema <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> edema [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-treatment-of-tularemia/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. Tender regional adenopathy may be present in the preauricular, postauricular, cervical, and submandibular regions. Specific complications may include corneal ulceration and dacryocystitis. Tularemia also has been associated with other less common ocular manifestations, including a case of unilateral uveitis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-treatment-of-tularemia/abstract/9,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,10</a>].</p><p>Parinaud&rsquo;s oculoglandular syndrome refers to conjunctivitis in one eye and swollen lymph nodes in front of the ear on the same side; the causes include <em>F. tularensis</em>, <em>Bartonella henselae</em> (cat scratch disease) and herpes simplex infection. Other items in the differential diagnosis for oculoglandular disease include adenoviral infection and pyogenic bacterial infection.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H280874057\"><span class=\"h3\">Pharyngeal (oropharyngeal) disease</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Pharyngeal tularemia accounts for a small percentage of cases in the United States. However, pharyngeal disease has comprised a larger percentage of cases in other parts of the world, particularly in outbreaks that have occurred as a consequence of the disruptions caused by war or natural disaster [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-treatment-of-tularemia/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. This syndrome is the result of a primary oropharyngeal portal of infection, and is usually acquired by ingestion of contaminated food or water. Transmission can also occur from contaminated droplets or from hand to mouth following finger contamination after crushing ticks. </p><p>The major symptoms are fever, severe sore throat, and swelling in the neck [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-treatment-of-tularemia/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. Examination demonstrates an exudative pharyngitis and tonsillitis, cervical lymph node enlargement, and usually pharyngeal or tonsillar ulcers. Preparotid and retropharyngeal lymph nodes also may be involved. Pharyngeal tularemia should be considered in patients with severe pharyngitis unresponsive to penicillin and undiagnosed after routine testing. </p><p>The differential diagnosis includes adenoviral pharyngitis, infectious mononucleosis, and streptococcal pharyngitis. In addition, a pharyngeal membrane mimicking diphtheria may occur [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-treatment-of-tularemia/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h3\">Typhoidal disease</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Typhoidal tularemia is a febrile illness without prominent regional adenopathy or other localizing signs that does not fit another major form of the disease. Patients often have chronic underlying conditions, and their clinical presentation may range from acute sepsis to a chronic illness. Typhoidal disease may result from any portal of entry, and often the diagnosis is difficult to establish since relevant exposure history may be absent and the culture yield for blood and other specimens is low. </p><p>Typhoidal disease was the most common presentation overall among tularemia cases reported in Arkansas from 2009 through 2013, and was particularly frequent among older patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-treatment-of-tularemia/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. It was also among the most common forms of tularemia during 2015 in Colorado, Nebraska, South Dakota, and Wyoming [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-treatment-of-tularemia/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].</p><p>Major symptoms include fever, chills, anorexia, headache, myalgias, sore throat, cough, abdominal pain, and diarrhea. Prominent physical findings may include evidence of intravascular volume depletion, mild pharyngitis, and diffuse abdominal tenderness. A clinical presentation with predominant abdominal symptoms has been referred to as &quot;abdominal tularemia,&quot; potentially from ingestion of the pathogen; mesenteric adenopathy may be present. Enlargement of the liver and spleen is more likely to be detectable with a longer duration of illness. Pulmonary infiltrates or pleural effusion secondary to hematogenous involvement is seen in up to 45 percent of cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-treatment-of-tularemia/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Pulmonary nodules, pleural effusion, and mediastinal adenopathy have been described in a patient with typhoidal tularemia who had been treated with the anti-tumor necrosis factor agent <a href=\"topic.htm?path=infliximab-including-biosimilars-of-infliximab-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">infliximab</a> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-treatment-of-tularemia/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. </p><p>Laboratory findings in severe typhoidal tularemia may include elevated creatine phosphokinase, myoglobinuria, hyponatremia, renal failure, and <em>F. tularensis</em> bacteremia. </p><p>The differential diagnosis includes <em>Salmonella</em> spp typhoid fever, brucellosis, Q fever, endocarditis, and the many infectious and noninfectious causes of enigmatic fever.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h3\">Pneumonic disease</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The illness is referred to as pneumonic tularemia when clinical manifestations of tularemia are dominated by pulmonary involvement. Pneumonic disease is more common in adults but can affect any age group and has occurred with increasing frequency. Among 190 cases in Missouri between 2000 and 2007, pneumonic disease accounted for 39 percent of adult cases and 24 percent of tularemia cases overall [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-treatment-of-tularemia/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Pneumonic tularemia was as common as ulceroglandular disease among the increased numbers of cases reported in Colorado, Nebraska, South Dakota, and Wyoming during 2015 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-treatment-of-tularemia/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. In one series of 128 patients with tularemia, those with pneumonic disease were more likely to have underlying typhoidal illness, to recall no potential exposure, to require hospitalization, to have a longer hospital stay, to have positive cultures, and to have a higher mortality rate [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-treatment-of-tularemia/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. Pneumonic disease caused by <em>F. tularensis</em> subspecies <em>tularensis</em> (prevalent in North America) is generally more severe than that caused by subspecies <em>holarctica</em> (prevalent in other parts of the world) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-treatment-of-tularemia/abstract/17,18\" class=\"abstract_t\">17,18</a>]; however, subspecies <em>holarctica</em> may also cause severe pneumonia, particularly in immunocompromised patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-treatment-of-tularemia/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epidemiology-microbiology-and-pathogenesis-of-tularemia#H29154667\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Epidemiology, microbiology, and pathogenesis of tularemia&quot;, section on 'Epidemiology'</a>.)</p><p>Primary pneumonic disease results from direct inhalation of the organism into the lungs. Occupations at risk for primary disease include farmers, sheep shearers, landscapers, and laboratory workers. Initial manifestations are nonspecific, and may include headache, fever, malaise, myalgias, and anorexia. Over time, fevers and a cough with little sputum production become more pronounced, and there may be substernal or pleuritic chest pain [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-treatment-of-tularemia/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. Findings on chest examination may include rales, signs of consolidation, and a friction rub or evidence of pleural fluid. </p><p>Early after exposure, the chest radiograph may be normal, but it usually becomes abnormal as respiratory findings become more prominent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-treatment-of-tularemia/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. Common radiographic changes include peribronchial infiltrates, lobar consolidation, pleural effusion, and hilar adenopathy. Rounded infiltrates and cavitation from pneumonic tularemia are uncommon, although the presence of nodular infiltrates with a pleural effusion should raise concern for tularemic pneumonia or pneumonic plague. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-treatment-of-plague-yersinia-pestis-infection#H3\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and treatment of plague (Yersinia pestis infection)&quot;, section on 'Clinical manifestations'</a>.) </p><p>Secondary pneumonic disease results from hematogenous spread to the lung. Secondary pneumonic disease is most common with typhoidal and ulceroglandular tularemia but may complicate any of the major forms of tularemia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-treatment-of-tularemia/abstract/2,16\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,16</a>]. Secondary pneumonia may present with bilateral disease, involvement of the lower lobes, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> with miliary disease. In one series, some patients with secondary lung involvement had abnormal chest radiographs but no clinical evidence of pneumonia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-treatment-of-tularemia/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. </p><p>Pleural effusions in pneumonic tularemia are exudative with a lymphocytic predominance, and may have an elevated adenosine deaminase level [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-treatment-of-tularemia/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. Pleural or lung biopsies may demonstrate granuloma formation and therefore be confused with pulmonary tuberculosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-treatment-of-tularemia/abstract/1,21\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,21</a>]. Respiratory failure requiring mechanical ventilation and the adult respiratory distress syndrome may result from either primary or secondary pneumonic tularemia.</p><p>The differential diagnosis of pneumonic tularemia includes Q fever, psittacosis, tuberculosis, pulmonary mycoses, pneumonic plague, and many other causes of community-acquired pneumonia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-treatment-of-tularemia/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Clinical symptoms and radiographic findings are not sufficiently specific to distinguish tularemic pneumonia from other causes of community-acquired pneumonia. The diagnosis should be considered in patients with appropriate epidemiologic exposure with a febrile illness, clinical evidence of pneumonia, negative cultures, and failure to respond to routine treatments.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H280874625\"><span class=\"h2\">Secondary skin manifestations</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Secondary skin changes are common in tularemia and often misdiagnosed or overlooked [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-treatment-of-tularemia/abstract/5,22,23\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,22,23</a>]. Among children described in an outbreak in Finland, 52 percent had a secondary skin eruption [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-treatment-of-tularemia/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. Secondary rashes are usually maculopapular, vesiculopapular, erythema multiforme, erythema nodosum, or urticarial; some have been mistaken for varicella or drug eruptions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-treatment-of-tularemia/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. More than one type of rash may be present in the same patient [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-treatment-of-tularemia/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. Patients with typhoidal tularemia may have erythema multiforme or erythema nodosum, while patients with pneumonic tularemia are more likely to have erythema nodosum.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H280874633\"><span class=\"h2\">Complications</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The most frequently encountered complication of tularemia is lymph node suppuration. Suppurative nodes benefit from drainage even if pus is found to be sterile. In a review of tularemia cases in Missouri, 15 of 81 patients (19 percent) with lymphadenopathy required incision and drainage of suppurative nodes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-treatment-of-tularemia/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. Recurrent lymph node suppuration despite treatment has been described in a patient with glandular tularemia who had been treated with the anti-tumor necrosis factor (TNF) certolizumab and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methotrexate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">methotrexate</a> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-treatment-of-tularemia/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>].</p><p>Other complications include sepsis, renal failure, rhabdomyolysis, and hepatitis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-treatment-of-tularemia/abstract/2,27\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,27</a>]. Empyema requiring decortication has been reported in patients with pneumonic disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-treatment-of-tularemia/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. Rarely <em>F. tularensis</em> infection may cause otitis media and mastoiditis, endocarditis, pericarditis, meningitis, osteomyelitis, peritonitis, aortitis, or prosthetic joint infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-treatment-of-tularemia/abstract/1,28-30\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,28-30</a>]. All four patients identified in one literature review of <em>F. tularensis</em> endocarditis initially presented with typhoidal disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-treatment-of-tularemia/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. One report described a patient whose only manifestation of tularemia was pericarditis; the diagnosis was made serologically [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-treatment-of-tularemia/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]. Meningitis, reported with ulceroglandular and typhoidal disease, can develop 3 to 30 days after the onset of illness and cause a cerebrospinal fluid mononuclear cell pleocytosis with low glucose and high protein [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-treatment-of-tularemia/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>].</p><p>If untreated, tularemia may cause prolonged fever, weight loss, adenopathy, and debility that can last for weeks or months [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-treatment-of-tularemia/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. Even with appropriate treatment, some patients will have a prolonged recovery following tularemia. They often complain of fatigue and lassitude, and may have anorexia, weakness, and weight loss. Neuropsychiatric complaints have included headache, difficulty concentrating, and disturbed sleep [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-treatment-of-tularemia/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>]. Many of these patients have had suppurative lymph nodes. Risk factors for a poor outcome include older age, serious underlying disease, a delay in correct diagnosis, prolonged symptoms prior to treatment, pneumonic or typhoidal disease, renal failure, and inadequate antibiotic treatment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-treatment-of-tularemia/abstract/16,27\" class=\"abstract_t\">16,27</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H280874727\"><span class=\"h2\">Bioterrorism event</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A bioterrorist attack with <em>F. tularensis</em> would most likely employ aerosolization of the organism to do the most harm to the most people [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-treatment-of-tularemia/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>]. As a result, it is expected that most patients would develop either primary pneumonic or typhoidal tularemia. Because the airborne organism also may invade through sites other than the lung and may contaminate food and water, less common presentations include oculoglandular, pharyngeal, ulceroglandular, or glandular disease. Rapid recognition and reporting of a possible bioterrorist event due to tularemia is a difficult clinical challenge. It should be suggested by clustered cases of pneumonic or typhoidal disease, particularly in urban areas in patients without the usual exposure history.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h1\">DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The diagnosis of tularemia requires a high index of suspicion based on the clinical presentation and epidemiologic history. Routine laboratory tests are nonspecific. The white blood cell count may be low, normal, or elevated. Other nonspecific findings may include low platelet count, low serum sodium, abnormal liver enzymes, evidence of rhabdomyolysis or myoglobinuria, and pyuria.</p><p>The diagnosis is usually confirmed serologically by detecting antibodies to <em>F. tularensis</em> using a tube agglutination or microagglutination assay; commercially available enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs) are more commonly used in Europe than in the United States [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-treatment-of-tularemia/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>]. Antibody titers are not reliably positive until after at least two weeks of infection, so they are rarely helpful in the acute setting. Both IgM and IgG antibodies appear together following the initial infection, and both antibody titers may remain elevated for years after an infection. Thus, a single positive tube agglutination titer of 1:160 or higher, or a microagglutination titer of 1:128 or higher, is only supportive of the diagnosis, but may also result from an old infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-treatment-of-tularemia/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>]. A fourfold or greater change in titer between acute and convalescent serum specimens is needed for diagnostic confirmation, and at least one titer must be positive [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-treatment-of-tularemia/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>]. A diagnostic increase in antibody titer generally occurs two to four weeks after the onset of symptoms. Serologic tests cannot identify the specific infecting <em>F. tularensis</em> subspecies. Investigational methods to improve serodiagnostic testing are being pursued [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-treatment-of-tularemia/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>]. </p><p>The results of serologic testing should always be interpreted in the context of the clinical suspicion for tularemia. Serologic studies should be performed only in patients in whom tularemia is a realistic possibility; they should not be used as a screening test among febrile patients.</p><p>Gram-stained smears and tissue biopsies rarely demonstrate the organism. When <em>F. tularensis</em> is seen in clinical specimens, it appears as weakly-stained, tiny gram-negative coccobacilli. Routine cultures of blood, pleural fluid, skin lesions, lymph nodes, sputum, or pharynx are frequently negative since the organism is quite fastidious. In addition, most routine solid media do not contain cysteine, which many <em>Francisella</em> strains require for growth. However, <em>F. tularensis</em> has been cultured from blood and other specimens with supportive media; a positive culture confirms the diagnosis and may permit subspecies identification. Therefore, if there is a clinical suspicion for tularemia, the laboratory should be notified prior to obtaining specimens for culture to optimize growth conditions as well as to take proper precautions to reduce the risk of infection among laboratory personnel. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epidemiology-microbiology-and-pathogenesis-of-tularemia\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Epidemiology, microbiology, and pathogenesis of tularemia&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Several specific techniques for the rapid presumptive diagnosis of tularemia have been developed, including direct fluorescent antibody (DFA) staining of clinical specimens and immunohistochemical staining of tissue [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-treatment-of-tularemia/abstract/1,35\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,35</a>]. However, these methods are not commercially available. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assays on human specimens have been successful for the rapid presumptive diagnosis of tularemia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-treatment-of-tularemia/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>]. PCR assays offer the potential advantages of a more rapid diagnosis than serologies or cultures, a greater sensitivity than smears or cultures, a more limited exposure of laboratory personnel to the potential hazards of processing cultures, and the availability of the basic methodology in many clinical laboratories. PCR also eventually may prove useful for the diagnosis of patients with prolonged illness, and in those already given antibiotic treatment. DFA and PCR assays may be obtained through the Laboratory Response Network. A real-time PCR assay has been developed that can distinguish between <em>F. tularensis</em> subspecies <em>tularensis</em> types A1 and A2 infections [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-treatment-of-tularemia/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>]. Another sensitive, cartridge-based, automated PCR assay is able to detect <em>F. tularensis</em> bacteremia in a primate model [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-treatment-of-tularemia/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>].</p><p>Rapid tests to detect multiple potential bioterrorism pathogens simultaneously are being explored, as are proteomic and immunologic methods for diagnosis. In the event of a suspected bioterrorist event using <em>F. tularensis</em>, appropriate authorities should be contacted for assistance in sending specimens to a specialized laboratory in the Laboratory Response Network for direct visualization of the organism and other rapid diagnostic tests.

Affected patients typically present with fever and a single erythematous papulo-ulcerative lesion with a central eschar. The skin lesion is accompanied by tender regional lymphadenopathy. Patients seeking initial medical attention relatively late in the course of disease may have minimal fever and a healed skin lesion. Glandular disease involving single or multiple regional nodes in the absence of an identifiable skin lesion, although less common overall, recently has occurred more often in children than adults. Oculoglandular and pharyngeal tularemia are less common but analogous syndromes resulting from organism invasion through the conjunctivae and oral mucosa, respectively. (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Ulceroglandular disease'</a> above and <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Glandular disease'</a> above and <a href=\"#H280874049\" class=\"local\">'Oculoglandular disease'</a> above and <a href=\"#H280874057\" class=\"local\">'Pharyngeal (oropharyngeal) disease'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Typhoidal tularemia has been relatively uncommon, although it has been subsequently increasing in frequency. These patients present with a febrile, septic illness, with or without pneumonia. Pneumonic tularemia should be considered in patients with appropriate epidemiologic exposure and a febrile illness, clinical evidence of pneumonia, negative cultures, and failure to respond to routine treatments. (See <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Typhoidal disease'</a> above and <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'Pneumonic disease'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Secondary skin rashes are an underappreciated and relatively common manifestation of tularemia. Complications from tularemia include suppurative lymph nodes, persistent debility, sepsis, empyema, meningitis, and many other potential sites of organ involvement. (See <a href=\"#H280874625\" class=\"local\">'Secondary skin manifestations'</a> above and <a href=\"#H280874633\" class=\"local\">'Complications'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A bioterrorist attack using <em>F. tularensis</em> would most likely result in primary pneumonic tularemia and typhoidal tularemia; other clinical syndromes are possible but less common. Such an event should be suggested by clustered cases of pneumonic or typhoidal disease, particularly in urban areas in patients without the usual exposure history. (See <a href=\"#H280874727\" class=\"local\">'Bioterrorism event'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The diagnosis of tularemia requires a high index of suspicion based on the clinical presentation and epidemiologic history. The diagnosis is usually confirmed serologically. A single tube agglutination titer of 1:160 or higher, or a single microagglutination titer of 1:128 or higher, is supportive of the diagnosis; a fourfold or greater change in titer between acute and convalescent serum specimens, with at least one positive titer, is confirmatory. A diagnostic increase in antibody titer generally occurs two to four weeks after the onset of the disease. (See <a href=\"#H9\" class=\"local\">'Diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Routine cultures of blood, pleural fluid, skin lesions, lymph nodes, sputum, or pharynx are frequently negative since the organism is quite fastidious. If there is a clinical suspicion of tularemia, the laboratory should be notified prior to obtaining specimens for culture to optimize growth conditions and take proper precautions to reduce the risk of infection among laboratory personnel. In the event of a suspected bioterrorist event using <em>F. tularensis</em>, appropriate authorities should be contacted for assistance in sending specimens to a specialized National Public Health Network laboratory. (See <a href=\"#H9\" class=\"local\">'Diagnosis'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We suggest <a href=\"topic.htm?path=streptomycin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">streptomycin</a> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=gentamicin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">gentamicin</a> for treatment of tularemia, and particularly in patients with severe disease (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=5\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2B</a>).
