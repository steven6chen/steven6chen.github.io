ECT is a standard treatment for unipolar major depression; it is also used for bipolar major depression and less commonly for mania and bipolar mood episodes with mixed features. Indications for ECT include failure to respond to multiple antidepressant medication trials, or acute illness (eg, severe suicidality) that requires a rapid and definitive response. A course of ECT typically consists of 6 to 12 treatments given two or three times per week.</p><p>This topic reviews the indications and efficacy of ECT for bipolar disorder.
