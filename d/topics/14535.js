The proximal humerus articulates with the glenoid of the scapula to form the glenohumeral (shoulder) joint. The muscles and tendons of the rotator cuff, the acromion, and ligamentous attachments such as those between the coracoid process of the scapula and the acromion, serve to both stabilize the glenohumeral articulation and provide for a wide range of shoulder joint motion.</p><p>The pediatric humerus has distinctive structural features that influence fracture risk, fracture pattern, and the potential for healing [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/proximal-humeral-fractures-in-children/abstract/3,4\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,4</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Periosteum</strong> &ndash; In the humerus bone, a thick periosteal sleeve is present along the shaft which limits fracture displacement and promotes healing in proximal humeral fractures [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/proximal-humeral-fractures-in-children/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].

This series includes an anterior-posterior view of the glenohumeral joint, an axillary view, and a scapular Y view.

Plain films alone may be inadequate to distinguish between a physeal fracture and a dislocation.

Gentle pendulum exercises may be started between two and four weeks post-injury, and an active range of motion may be started between four and six weeks. Most patients can resume overhead activities after four to six weeks and often have normal or near-normal function two months from the date of injury [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/proximal-humeral-fractures-in-children/abstract/3,6,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,6,7</a>].</p><p>Individual variation in duration of immobilization and progress in return to normal activity may reflect the patient's healing capacity and injury severity. Orthopedic follow-up is recommended during the course of the injury to confirm appropriate management and clinical progress.</p><p>In most cases, even markedly displaced proximal humeral fractures in children &le;12 years of age should be treated with a U-slab, sling, and swathe (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F63053\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef63053 \">figure 8</a>)&nbsp;[<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/proximal-humeral-fractures-in-children/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. In this young patient population, the significant remodeling potential of the proximal humerus allows a markedly displaced fracture to heal and remodel to a normal appearing, fully functional shoulder [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/proximal-humeral-fractures-in-children/abstract/6,15,16\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,15,16</a>].

The results of some published reports suggest that operative treatment should be considered in older children (&ge;12 years of age) with marked displacement [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/proximal-humeral-fractures-in-children/abstract/18,19\" class=\"abstract_t\">18,19</a>].</p><p>The indications for closed reduction or operative treatment are controversial. The literature contains no generally accepted guidelines for acceptable angulation and displacement [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/proximal-humeral-fractures-in-children/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. It is reasonable to attempt closed reduction in children who have significantly displaced fractures [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/proximal-humeral-fractures-in-children/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. The technique of closed reduction involves traction, abduction, forward flexion, and external rotation of the arm. If the fracture is unstable, percutaneous fixation may be required [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/proximal-humeral-fractures-in-children/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. Patients treated with a successful closed reduction are immobilized for four to six weeks, followed by an active range of motion.

Some pediatric orthopedic surgeons favor nonoperative management unless the patient is within one year of skeletal maturity, the dominant arm is affected, or the patient is an athlete or worker.</p><p>Open treatment is reserved for those patients who have displaced intraarticular fractures or those with neurovascular compromise, which is extremely rare in the pediatric patient population [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/proximal-humeral-fractures-in-children/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H24\"><span class=\"h1\">FOLLOW-UP CARE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients with proximal humeral fractures should be discharged with instructions to follow-up with an orthopedic surgeon in 7 to 10 days. Infants are maintained in a sling and swathe for three to four weeks. Either sling immobilization or a shoulder immobilizer should be used for proximal humeral fractures in older children and adolescents who do not undergo surgical repair.</p><p>Children who have received operative care (closed reduction with percutaneous pinning or open reduction with internal fixation or fragment removal) should be admitted for 24 to 48 hour observation of neurovascular status and soft tissue compartments.

These articles are best for patients who want a general overview and who prefer short, easy-to-read materials. Beyond the Basics patient education pieces are longer, more sophisticated, and more detailed. These articles are written at the 10<sup>th</sup> to 12<sup>th</sup> grade reading level and are best for patients who want in-depth information and are comfortable with some medical jargon.</p><p>Here are the patient education articles that are relevant to this topic.

A growth plate (physis) is present in the proximal humerus which closes between 16 and 19 years of age (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F67781\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef67781 \">figure 1</a>). Growth plates are susceptible to fracture and these physeal injuries are more common during times of rapid growth, such as adolescence (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F71443\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef71443 \">figure 4</a>). (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Pertinent anatomy'</a> above and <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Mechanism of injury'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A humeral fracture which occurs with a history of minimal trauma may suggest a pathological fracture or an intentional injury (child abuse). (See <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'Pathologic fracture'</a> above and <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'Child abuse'</a> above and <a href=\"#H20\" class=\"local\">'Child protection'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The child with a proximal humeral fracture typically presents with a history of trauma, severe shoulder pain, and marked pain on arm movement. For nondisplaced proximal humeral fractures, the physical findings may be limited to tenderness and mild swelling. For displaced fractures, significant anterior swelling and altered shoulder appearance relative to the unaffected side is typically present, and the arm is often shortened and held in extension. (See <a href=\"#H8\" class=\"local\">'Physical findings'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Detailed neurovascular assessment is important to identify axillary nerve deficit manifest by decreased sensation over the lateral shoulder and loss of deltoid muscle function (shoulder abduction). (See <a href=\"#H8\" class=\"local\">'Physical findings'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>If the injured child is tender at the physis, the treating physician should suspect a fracture and not a sprain, even in the presence of normal radiographs. (See <a href=\"#H9\" class=\"local\">'Proximal humerus fractures'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Proximal humeral fractures involving the physis are classified using the Salter-Harris classification system (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F71443\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef71443 \">figure 4</a>). Physeal fractures of the proximal humerus are most commonly seen in adolescents, in whom rapid growth leads to relative weakness of the physis (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F78155\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef78155 \">image 2</a>). Salter-Harris II fractures are the most common pattern seen in this age group. Younger children most commonly suffer metaphyseal fractures (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F78062\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef78062 \">image 3</a>).

(See <a href=\"#H22\" class=\"local\">'Infants'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Children with minimally displaced fractures may be immobilized with a sling and swathe (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F78370\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef78370 \">figure 7</a>) or shoulder immobilizer. (See <a href=\"#H23\" class=\"local\">'Children and adolescents'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Displaced proximal humeral fractures typically are treated initially with a U slab splint, sling, and swathe in children and adolescents (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F63053\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef63053 \">figure 8</a>), depending on the child's age, degree of angulation, and displacement. (See <a href=\"#H23\" class=\"local\">'Children and adolescents'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The emergency clinician should obtain prompt orthopedic consultation in selected circumstances.
