In the United States, it is the second most commonly reported communicable disease, with more than 350,000 cases reported annually [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-neisseria-gonorrhoeae-infection-in-adults-and-adolescents/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>], with probably an equal number of cases that remain unreported [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-neisseria-gonorrhoeae-infection-in-adults-and-adolescents/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Gonorrhea is a major cause of urethritis in men and cervicitis in women; the latter can result in pelvic inflammatory disease (PID), infertility, ectopic pregnancy, and chronic pelvic pain. Extragenital infections of the pharynx and rectum are prevalent in certain groups, such as men who have sex with men (MSM). Invasive infections with <em>N. gonorrhoeae</em>, including disseminated gonococcal infection, endocarditis, and meningitis, are uncommon but can result in serious morbidity. Gonococcal resistance to several classes of antimicrobial agents is widespread [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-neisseria-gonorrhoeae-infection-in-adults-and-adolescents/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. The growing threat of antimicrobial resistance in <em>N. gonorrhoeae</em> highlights the importance of ensuring the availability of appropriate diagnostic modalities for surveillance. </p><p>This topic discusses the clinical manifestations and diagnosis of gonorrhea in adults and adolescents.

Compared with culture, commercially available NAAT offers rapid results (within hours) and enhanced sensitivity. Additionally, the ability to use NAAT for self-collected vaginal swabs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-neisseria-gonorrhoeae-infection-in-adults-and-adolescents/abstract/54\" class=\"abstract_t\">54</a>] or urine samples represents an important improvement compared with conventional methods like culture, which require a pelvic examination in women or a urethral swab in men. The main drawback to NAAT methodology is that does not enable determination of antimicrobial susceptibility, which is paramount if antibiotic resistant infection is suspected. </p><p>Although NAAT-based technology has not been approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for testing on specimens collected from extragenital sites, laboratories may validate the assay for use with such clinical specimens. These laboratories must ensure that testing for <em>N. gonorrhoeae</em> is not compromised by cross-reactivity with nonpathogenic Neisseria, which are found in the rectum or pharynx. Specific standards set by the Clinical Laboratory Improvement Act (CLIA) are to be used, and results must indicate that the assay has been validated accordingly. (See <a href=\"#H790871072\" class=\"local\">'Performance on extragenital specimens'</a> below.)</p><p>Although NAAT tests may be individually more expensive than culture or other tests, high-volume laboratories may consider &quot;pooling&quot; techniques to identify a positive sample (made up of aliquots from several clinical specimens); a pooled sample that is &quot;positive&quot; is subsequently parsed to find the single positive clinical specimen. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H790871060\"><span class=\"h3\">Methodology</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>NAAT methodology consists of amplifying <em>N. gonorrhoeae</em> DNA or RNA sequences using various techniques, such as polymerase chain reaction (PCR), transcription-mediated amplification (TMA), or strand displacement amplification (SDA). NAAT can theoretically detect as little as one organism per sample, while the detection threshold of other methods is approximately 1000 organisms. Although the sensitivity of NAAT is generally better than culture, the sensitivity of the individual NAAT (eg, PCR-based versus TMA-based versus SDA-based testing) varies by NAAT and specimen type. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H123172170\"><span class=\"h3\">Performance on urogenital specimens</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>NAAT can be performed on a wide variety of urogenital samples including endocervical (including thin prep cervical cancer screening medium) and vaginal samples, urine samples (from men and women), and urethral samples (from men only). The preferred specimens are a first-catch urine for men and a vaginal swab for women [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-neisseria-gonorrhoeae-infection-in-adults-and-adolescents/abstract/53\" class=\"abstract_t\">53</a>].

The main reason to use vaginal swabs is that they can be obtained by the patient, through noninvasive self-collection. The sensitivity of testing on urine in women appears to be slightly lower compared with vaginal samples. </p><p>In contrast, the sensitivity and specificity of NAAT on urine or urethral specimens are similar in men. As an example, in a large study that included 683 men with gonorrhea, NAAT had a sensitivity of 99 percent with urethral swab specimens and 98 percent with urine specimens when compared with culture; the specificity of NAAT was also similar with either sample, at 96 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-neisseria-gonorrhoeae-infection-in-adults-and-adolescents/abstract/55\" class=\"abstract_t\">55</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H790871072\"><span class=\"h3\">Performance on extragenital specimens</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>NAAT has superior sensitivity for the detection of <em>N. gonorrhoeae</em> at extragenital sites, such as the oropharynx and rectum. As with urine and vaginal swabs, patient-collected rectal and pharyngeal swabs have been shown to perform comparably to clinician-collected swabs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-neisseria-gonorrhoeae-infection-in-adults-and-adolescents/abstract/56-58\" class=\"abstract_t\">56-58</a>]. Although in the United States, NAAT has not been approved by the FDA for diagnosis of gonorrhea at such sites, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends that NAAT be used preferentially to diagnose rectal and pharyngeal infections [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-neisseria-gonorrhoeae-infection-in-adults-and-adolescents/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. Most large and medium-sized laboratories have established performance specifications (per CLIA standards) for NAAT testing on nongenital samples, thereby facilitating the use of these results for clinical management. </p><p>Several studies have demonstrated that NAAT has significantly higher sensitivity than culture-based testing at extragenital sites [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-neisseria-gonorrhoeae-infection-in-adults-and-adolescents/abstract/59-61\" class=\"abstract_t\">59-61</a>]. The main concern has been their specificity at detecting gonorrhea given the presence of nonpathogenic Neisserial species in extragenital sites. A study tested the specificity of six different NAATs using 450 characterized clinical culture isolates of <em>N. gonorrhoeae</em> (n = 216), nongonococcal <em>Neisseria</em> species (n = 218), and some closely related non-<em>Neisseria</em> species (n = 16) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-neisseria-gonorrhoeae-infection-in-adults-and-adolescents/abstract/62\" class=\"abstract_t\">62</a>]. All six assays tested displayed some false-positive results due to cross-reactions, but most demonstrated only sporadic low-level false positive results. A subsequent study performed on a subset of the assays did not demonstrate any cross-reactions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-neisseria-gonorrhoeae-infection-in-adults-and-adolescents/abstract/63\" class=\"abstract_t\">63</a>], suggesting that performance characteristics of these assays are dependent on the testing environment. As such, all laboratories that offer NAAT testing of extragenital specimens must establish performance specifications for NAAT testing on nongenital samples. As with all tests that lack perfect specificity, in low prevalence settings, there is an increased probability that a positive test may be a false positive (ie, a low positive predictive value for the test). </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H790871084\"><span class=\"h2\">Gram stain (microscopy)</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The main role of microscopy is in the diagnosis of urethritis in a symptomatic man. Due to its high specificity, a Gram stain of a male urethral specimen that demonstrates polymorphonuclear leukocytes with intracellular gram-negative diplococci can be considered diagnostic for infection with <em>N. gonorrhoeae</em> in men (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F50351\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef50351 \">picture 5</a>). </p><p>In one study, a Gram stain diagnosed 94 percent of cases in symptomatic men; the sensitivity dropped to 81 percent in asymptomatic subjects [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-neisseria-gonorrhoeae-infection-in-adults-and-adolescents/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. Older reports have shown that performance of Gram stain in a man is similar to that of culture, with sensitivities of 89 to 94 percent and specificities of 94 to 97 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-neisseria-gonorrhoeae-infection-in-adults-and-adolescents/abstract/64\" class=\"abstract_t\">64</a>]. Thus, in symptomatic men, urethral Gram stain is sensitive, specific, and cost effective. However, if the Gram stain is negative in an asymptomatic man, additional testing should be performed if gonorrhea is suspected due to risk factors. </p><p>A urethral Gram stain has low sensitivity in women compared with men due to the possible presence of other nonpathogenic Gram-negative diplococci in cervical secretions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-neisseria-gonorrhoeae-infection-in-adults-and-adolescents/abstract/65\" class=\"abstract_t\">65</a>]; thus, other diagnostic methods are generally preferred in women. </p><p>A Gram stain cannot be used reliably for extragenital infections since other nonpathogenic Gram-negative diplococci can be present; therefore, a Gram stain of pharyngeal or rectal specimens is not recommended. When Gram stain is used for the diagnosis of conjunctival infections, confirmation with culture should also be obtained. </p><p>An alternative to Gram stain, a <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methylene-blue-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">methylene blue</a><span class=\"nowrap\">/<a href=\"topic.htm?path=gentian-violet-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">gentian violet</a></span> stain can also identify WBC and gonococcal forms on urethral swab specimens, but can be performed more rapidly than the Gram stain. Results correlate with those of a Gram stain, although <em>N. gonorrhoeae</em> appear as dark purple on the methylene <span class=\"nowrap\">blue/gentian</span> violet stain [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-neisseria-gonorrhoeae-infection-in-adults-and-adolescents/abstract/66\" class=\"abstract_t\">66</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H790871090\"><span class=\"h2\">Culture</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The main advantage of culture is to assess antibiotic susceptibilities, which is of particular importance when antibiotic resistant infection is suspected. Resistance of the gonococcus to several classes of antibiotics and the emergence of gonococcal resistance to the currently recommended classes of antibiotics (cephalosporins and macrolides) has highlighted the importance of maintaining culture capacity. In the United States, the CDC currently recommends that a gonococcal culture be obtained and testing for antimicrobial susceptibility be performed whenever treatment failure is suspected [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-neisseria-gonorrhoeae-infection-in-adults-and-adolescents/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Most large commercial laboratories and most large public health laboratories have maintained culture capacity for gonorrhea.</p><p>The reported sensitivity of culture ranges from 72 to 95 percent, depending upon the comparison assay, site sampled, and patient population. The major disadvantage to culture is that results are not usually available until 48 hours, and the sensitivity of culture declines in asymptomatic infection to only 65 to 85 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-neisseria-gonorrhoeae-infection-in-adults-and-adolescents/abstract/67\" class=\"abstract_t\">67</a>]. In contrast, the sensitivity of NAAT is much higher. </p><p>Cultures for <em>N. gonorrhoeae</em> are processed on Thayer-Martin agar, which prevents the overgrowth of other endogenous flora. Culture specimens should be obtained with swabs that have plastic or wire shafts and rayon, Dacron, or calcium alginate tips, since other materials (eg, wooden shafts and cotton tips) may be toxic to <em>N. gonorrhoeae</em> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-neisseria-gonorrhoeae-infection-in-adults-and-adolescents/abstract/53\" class=\"abstract_t\">53</a>].

The organism should be incubated at 35&ordm; to 37&ordm;C in a CO<sub>2</sub>-enriched environment.</p><p>Costs are moderate compared with more expensive DNA amplification techniques. However, this must be weighed against need for a CO<sub>2</sub>-enriched environment for transport, personnel time to read the cultures at 48 hours, and the fastidious nature of the organism that can result in false negative results. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1235604586\"><span class=\"h2\">Other tests</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Other tests are used less commonly, generally when NAAT or culture are not available.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Rapid tests </strong>&mdash; Several point-of-care tests are available or being developed for the rapid diagnosis of gonorrhea. Although NAAT is considered the &quot;gold standard&quot;, same-day results for most NAAT are not usually available because they are classified as being of moderate to high complexity, usually requiring one to two days for results to become available. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">One rapid NAAT assay that uses a modular-cartridge based platform for testing each specimen using PCR can be performed on-site in laboratories [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-neisseria-gonorrhoeae-infection-in-adults-and-adolescents/abstract/68,69\" class=\"abstract_t\">68,69</a>]. It detects nucleic acid of <em>C. trachomatis</em> and <em>N. gonorrhoeae</em> and can process up to 96 specimens in less than two hours. The performance measures of this assay are comparable to those of other NAAT. Suitable specimens include vaginal, endocervical, and urethral swabs and urine. This assay, however, is currently too expensive for use in resource-limited settings. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Other basic point-of-care tests can also provide diagnostic information. The Gram stain is cheap, universally available, and has good sensitivity and specificity when used in symptomatic men (see <a href=\"#H790871084\" class=\"local\">'Gram stain (microscopy)'</a> above). The leukocyte esterase urine test detects an enzyme found in certain white blood cells and has been used for the diagnosis of gonorrhea in a number of countries for many years. In a meta-analysis of nine studies, the median sensitivity of this test was 71 percent and the median specificity was 70 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-neisseria-gonorrhoeae-infection-in-adults-and-adolescents/abstract/70\" class=\"abstract_t\">70</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Immunochromatographic tests to detect <em>N. gonorrhoeae</em> are also being developed as point-of-care tests. These immunoassays work via capillary action flow along a nitrocellulose membrane allowing an interaction between the antigen and a colorimetric particle. Depending on the assay, sensitivities ranged from 60 percent to 94 percent, and specificities ranged from 89 percent to 97 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-neisseria-gonorrhoeae-infection-in-adults-and-adolescents/abstract/70\" class=\"abstract_t\">70</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Nucleic acid hybridization (nucleic acid probe) tests</strong> &mdash; Because they do not involve amplification of genetic targets, available genetic probe methods require invasive testing using a direct swab from the endocervix or urethra [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-neisseria-gonorrhoeae-infection-in-adults-and-adolescents/abstract/71\" class=\"abstract_t\">71</a>]. The main advantage of these tests is their low cost; however, because their sensitivity is considerably lower than NAAT and because NAAT have become more cost-competitive, these tests are not used as frequently as in the past. Nucleic acid hybridization tests use DNA probes labeled with a chemiluminescent marker to identify a specific nucleic acid sequence of the organism. One advantage of the probe assays is that sample storage and transport are less critical than culture. Culture generally requires that the sample be sent to the laboratory within 24 hours, while sample stability for DNA probe assays is up to seven days at room temperature [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-neisseria-gonorrhoeae-infection-in-adults-and-adolescents/abstract/72\" class=\"abstract_t\">72</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Antigen detection</strong> &mdash; An enzyme immunoassay (EIA) was developed to detect gonococcal antigens from cervical swab or urine specimens but is not widely used because its positive predictive value is only acceptable in populations with a high prevalence of infection.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1235604554\"><span class=\"h1\">EVALUATION FOR COINFECTION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>It is important to note that <em>N. gonorrhoeae </em>not only causes similar clinical syndromes as <em>C. trachomatis</em> but also coexists in a significant proportion of patients with chlamydial infection.

(See <a href=\"#H790870921\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Most genital gonococcal infections in women are asymptomatic. The cervix is the most commonly infected mucosal site in women. When symptomatic, gonococcal cervical infection can present with the typical findings of cervicitis, including vaginal pruritus and a mucopurulent cervical discharge (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F94345\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef94345 \">picture 1</a>). Some women may also have symptomatic involvement of the urethra (dysuria) or Bartholin&rsquo;s glands (perilabial pain) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F79478\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef79478 \">picture 2</a>). Pelvic inflammatory disease is a complication of untreated urogenital gonococcal infection and can lead to infertility. (See <a href=\"#H790870927\" class=\"local\">'Urogenital infection in women'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Although genital gonococcal infections are more likely to be symptomatic in men than in women, many infections in men are asymptomatic. When symptomatic, gonococcal urethritis often manifests with dysuria and copious purulent discharge (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F68498\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef68498 \">picture 3</a>), although more subtle findings are not uncommon. Acute unilateral epididymitis, with testicular pain and swelling, can be a complication of genital gonococcal infection. (See <a href=\"#H790870981\" class=\"local\">'Urogenital infection in men'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Extragenital sites of infection include the rectum and pharynx. Most of these infections are asymptomatic although can rarely present as proctitis, with anorectal pain with defecation and discharge, or pharyngitis, with sore throat and pharyngeal exudate. (See <a href=\"#H790871011\" class=\"local\">'Extragenital infection'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Bacteremic spread of <em>N. gonorrhoeae</em> from the initial site of infection occurs in a small minority of patients. Disseminated infection often manifests as purulent arthritis or a triad of tenosynovitis, dermatitis, and polyarthralgia. This is discussed in detail elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=disseminated-gonococcal-infection#H6\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Disseminated gonococcal infection&quot;, section on 'Clinical manifestations'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The clinical syndromes caused <em>N. gonorrhoeae </em>cannot be reliably distinguished from those caused by other pathogens on the basis of signs and symptoms alone. Other sexually transmitted pathogens, including <em>Chlamydia trachomatis</em>, <em>Trichomonas vaginalis</em>, and <em>Mycoplasma genitalium</em>, as well as herpes simplex virus (HSV) and syphilis, can cause similar symptoms. (See <a href=\"#H46313565\" class=\"local\">'Differential diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Nucleic acid amplification testing (NAAT) is the preferred test for the microbiologic diagnosis of <em>N. gonorrhoeae</em> because of its superior accuracy and use with various specimen types. For urogenital infections, vaginal swabs in women (clinician-collected and self-collected) and first-catch urine in men are the preferred specimens for NAAT. For extragenital infections, NAAT, used on pharyngeal and rectal swabs, is also the preferred test. (See <a href=\"#H1235604960\" class=\"local\">'Diagnostic approach'</a> above and <a href=\"#H790871048\" class=\"local\">'Nucleic acid amplification'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In symptomatic men who have undergone urethral swab for microscopic evaluation for urethritis, the presence of polymorphonuclear leukocytes with intracellular gram-negative diplococci on Gram stain of the specimen (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F50351\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef50351 \">picture 5</a>) is sufficient to establish the diagnosis of <em>N. gonorrhoea</em>.

Patients with confirmed gonococcal infection who have persistent symptoms after appropriate therapy with good adherence and lack of re-exposure should be tested for antibiotic resistant <em>N. gonorrhoeae</em> with culture and susceptibility testing. Culture requires endocervical, urethral, pharyngeal, or rectal swabs with specific handling.
