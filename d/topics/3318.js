One subset is referred to as shaken baby syndrome, with a constellation of inflicted injuries in young children characterized by repeated acceleration-deceleration injury with or without blunt head impact [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/child-abuse-anatomy-and-pathogenesis-of-retinal-hemorrhages-after-abusive-head-trauma/abstract/1-5\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-5</a>]. Characteristic clinical features include retinal hemorrhages (often but not always bilateral, multilayered, and extensive), subdural hematoma, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> occult fractures (particularly of the ribs and long bone metaphyses). Multiple episodes of trauma may occur before the abuse is detected [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/child-abuse-anatomy-and-pathogenesis-of-retinal-hemorrhages-after-abusive-head-trauma/abstract/6-9\" class=\"abstract_t\">6-9</a>]. Early recognition can be lifesaving.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">ANATOMY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The retina is comprised of several layers (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F68854\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef68854 \">figure 1</a>). The retinal vessels are contained in the neural portion of the retina [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/child-abuse-anatomy-and-pathogenesis-of-retinal-hemorrhages-after-abusive-head-trauma/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. The large vessels course through the nerve fiber and ganglion cell layers. Smaller vessels are located between the nerve fiber and inner nuclear layers. There are three layers of retinal capillaries: those within the nerve fiber and ganglion cell layers, those in the inner nuclear layer, and the radial peripapillary capillaries.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">PATHOGENESIS</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Overview</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Several mechanisms have been proposed to play a role in the development of retinal hemorrhages, but none is universally accepted. Different types of retinal hemorrhages may have different mechanisms, and more than one mechanism may operate in any given instance (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F61192\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef61192 \">figure 2</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F68695\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef68695 \">figure 3</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F64277\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef64277 \">figure 4</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F54695\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef54695 \">figure 5</a>).</p><p>Autopsy studies demonstrate an increased rate of orbital hemorrhage in abusive head trauma (AHT) victims compared with victims of unintentional (accidental) head injury [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/child-abuse-anatomy-and-pathogenesis-of-retinal-hemorrhages-after-abusive-head-trauma/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. Repetitive acceleration-deceleration (shaking) forces appear to play a primary role in the development of orbital and subdural hemorrhage in AHT [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/child-abuse-anatomy-and-pathogenesis-of-retinal-hemorrhages-after-abusive-head-trauma/abstract/11-16\" class=\"abstract_t\">11-16</a>]. The role of repetitive acceleration-deceleration forces in the pathogenesis of subdural hemorrhage in AHT is discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=child-abuse-epidemiology-mechanisms-and-types-of-abusive-head-trauma-in-infants-and-children#H4\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Child abuse: Epidemiology, mechanisms, and types of abusive head trauma in infants and children&quot;, section on 'Mechanisms of injury'</a>.)</p><p>It is unknown how much force is necessary in AHT for ocular injuries to occur. Based upon the frequency of the types of eye injuries in 23 AHT fatalities, one group suggested that relatively less force is needed to cause intraretinal, subhyaloid, or optic nerve sheath hematoma than retinal detachment, choroidal hemorrhage, or vitreous hemorrhage [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/child-abuse-anatomy-and-pathogenesis-of-retinal-hemorrhages-after-abusive-head-trauma/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. However, given that these were fatal injuries, the involved forces for all injuries were likely to have been severe.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Repetitive acceleration-deceleration</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Repetitive acceleration-deceleration induces shearing forces at the vitreoretinal interface, directly damaging the retinal vessels. The shearing forces are applied to the retina at points of firm attachment (eg, the macula, retinal vessels, and the vitreous base) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F59910\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef59910 \">figure 6</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/child-abuse-anatomy-and-pathogenesis-of-retinal-hemorrhages-after-abusive-head-trauma/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. The high frequency of hemorrhages at the vitreous base (ie, peripheral retina) and the distinctive macular retinoschisis of AHT provide supportive evidence for the role of shaking and vitreoretinal traction in the pathogenesis of AHT [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/child-abuse-anatomy-and-pathogenesis-of-retinal-hemorrhages-after-abusive-head-trauma/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>].

The optic nerve and other intraorbital structures are firmly attached to the globe and to the apex of the orbit [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/child-abuse-anatomy-and-pathogenesis-of-retinal-hemorrhages-after-abusive-head-trauma/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. However, the optic nerve is longer than the distance between the apex of the orbit and the back of the globe. This allows the globe and orbital contents to move if a child is shaken. Injury may occur at the tethering locations as a result of translational and rotational movements of the globe. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=child-abuse-eye-findings-in-children-with-abusive-head-trauma-aht\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Child abuse: Eye findings in children with abusive head trauma (AHT)&quot;</a>.)</p><p>This mechanism of direct optic nerve injury within the orbit provides an explanation for the optic atrophy that is often seen in survivors of AHT [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/child-abuse-anatomy-and-pathogenesis-of-retinal-hemorrhages-after-abusive-head-trauma/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. It also provides an explanation for the anterior predominance of optic nerve sheath hemorrhage (a finding that argues against the continuous tracking of blood from the intracranial space, as described below). (See <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'Intracranial bleeding'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Increased intracranial pressure</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Increased intracranial pressure (ICP) is another proposed mechanism for retinal hemorrhages in AHT [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/child-abuse-anatomy-and-pathogenesis-of-retinal-hemorrhages-after-abusive-head-trauma/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. One theory postulates that increased ICP (secondary to cerebral edema and compressive subdural hemorrhage) causes increased venous pressure and obstruction in the retinal vasculature that ultimately leads to rupture of the retinal vessels. Another theory speculates that paroxysmal cough can progressively increase ICP to the point that retinal hemorrhage occurs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/child-abuse-anatomy-and-pathogenesis-of-retinal-hemorrhages-after-abusive-head-trauma/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>].</p><p>Several observations argue <strong>against</strong> a major role for increased intracranial pressure in the development of retinal hemorrhages in AHT.

For example, in a study of 100 children with elevated ICP caused by nontraumatic mechanisms, only 16 patients had retinal hemorrhages. These hemorrhages were intraretinal, limited to the peripapillary region, associated with papilledema, and occurred only with a very high ICP (mean 42 mmHg) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/child-abuse-anatomy-and-pathogenesis-of-retinal-hemorrhages-after-abusive-head-trauma/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>].

In adult patients with subarachnoid hemorrhage, Terson syndrome is associated with poor prognosis. Terson syndrome merely refers to the association between vitreous and occasionally retinal hemorrhage as well as subarachnoid bleeding and does not imply a specific etiology. Thus, it should not be misconstrued as an alternative explanation for retinal hemorrhage in children with AHT. The intraocular hemorrhage associated with aneurysmal rupture is more typically vitreous hemorrhage or preretinal hemorrhage, and typically fewer in number and not associated with numerous intraretinal hemorrhages, as in AHT.
