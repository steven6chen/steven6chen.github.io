Condyloma acuminatum may develop as a result of the acquisition of HPV infection via sexual or nonsexual means. In very young children, transmission of HPV via nonsexual contact may be the most common precipitator of these lesions.</p><p>The transmission, diagnosis, and management of condyloma acuminatum in children will be discussed here. Condyloma acuminatum in adults and cutaneous warts are reviewed separately.

Estimates of the average age at which children present with condyloma acuminatum range between 2.8 and 5.6 years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/condylomata-acuminata-anogenital-warts-in-children/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. A female predominance is suggested by several studies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/condylomata-acuminata-anogenital-warts-in-children/abstract/2-4\" class=\"abstract_t\">2-4</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H38933903\"><span class=\"h1\">ETIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Condyloma acuminatum is caused by infection with human papillomavirus (HPV), a double-stranded DNA virus with more than 100 serotypes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/condylomata-acuminata-anogenital-warts-in-children/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Although condyloma acuminatum in adults is commonly caused by HPV 6 and 11, the HPV types detected in lesions from children are more variable. HPV types associated with cutaneous warts (eg, HPV 1 to 4 and others) are frequently detected in anogenital lesions from children [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/condylomata-acuminata-anogenital-warts-in-children/abstract/2,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,5</a>]. In one review of approximately 200 pediatric cases of condylomata acuminata in which HPV DNA was detected, HPV 6 or 11 was detected in 56 percent, HPV 1 to 4 in 12 percent, and HPV 16 or 18 in 4 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/condylomata-acuminata-anogenital-warts-in-children/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. A separate series in which 40 children under the age of 12 with condyloma acuminatum underwent wart excision and HPV testing found that HPV types 6, 11, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> 16 were present in only one-third of cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/condylomata-acuminata-anogenital-warts-in-children/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].

However, other modes of viral transmission may account for the majority of pediatric cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/condylomata-acuminata-anogenital-warts-in-children/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. The potential methods for human papillomavirus (HPV) acquisition in children are described below: </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Heteroinoculation </strong>&ndash; Transmission of HPV may occur during nonsexual contact with a caregiver, such as bathing or diaper changing.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Autoinoculation </strong>&ndash; Children may acquire anogenital lesions from self due to transmission of HPV from other cutaneous or mucosal sites of infection.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Sexual abuse </strong>&ndash; Estimates of the proportion of children with condyloma acuminatum who have been sexually abused vary widely, ranging from &lt;10 percent to 90 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/condylomata-acuminata-anogenital-warts-in-children/abstract/4,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,6</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">The likelihood of sexual abuse as the cause of HPV infection increases as children age [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/condylomata-acuminata-anogenital-warts-in-children/abstract/2,6,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,6,7</a>]. In a retrospective study of 55 children under the age of 13 with condyloma acuminatum who were evaluated for sexual abuse, children between the ages of four and eight years were 2.9 times more likely than children under the age of four years to have been sexually abused (95% CI 0.7-12.4) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/condylomata-acuminata-anogenital-warts-in-children/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. In addition, children between the ages of 8 and 12 were 12.1 times more likely than the youngest group of children to have been sexually abused (95% CI 2.3-63.6).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Perinatal or prenatal transmission </strong>&ndash; HPV infection in newborn infants may occur during vaginal delivery through an infected maternal genital tract. In addition, HPV DNA has been detected in amniotic fluid and umbilical cord blood, suggesting that ascension of the infection into the uterus and hematogenous dissemination of the virus may be routes of prenatal HPV transmission [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/condylomata-acuminata-anogenital-warts-in-children/abstract/8,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,9</a>]. A report of perianal warts in a neonate supports the possibility of prenatal HPV transmission [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/condylomata-acuminata-anogenital-warts-in-children/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Transmission via fomites </strong>&ndash; Transmission of HPV via fomites, such as contaminated towels or underwear, has been proposed as a method of HPV infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/condylomata-acuminata-anogenital-warts-in-children/abstract/1,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,11</a>]. However, fomites are likely to account for very few cases of condyloma acuminatum in children.</p><p/><p>The identification of the route of virus acquisition in children with condyloma acuminatum is complicated by the variable incubation period of HPV. Data in adults indicate that a typical incubation period ranges from three weeks to eight months [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/condylomata-acuminata-anogenital-warts-in-children/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. The average duration of the incubation period is three months [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/condylomata-acuminata-anogenital-warts-in-children/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. </p><p>In addition, serotyping is not a reliable method for determining the mode of HPV acquisition in children. The detection of a primarily cutaneous subtype of HPV is insufficient to rule out sexual abuse. As an example, cutaneous HPV infection on the hand of a sexual perpetrator could be transmitted to the anogenital region of a child through manual-genital abuse. Moreover, the HPV serotypes most commonly associated with sexually transmitted condyloma acuminatum in adults (eg, HPV 6 and 11) are detected with variable frequency in condyloma acuminatum in children [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/condylomata-acuminata-anogenital-warts-in-children/abstract/2,5,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,5,7</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H276633452\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL MANIFESTATIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Condylomata acuminata initially appear as flesh-colored, pink, or brown soft moist papules that are a few millimeters in diameter (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F83496%7EDERM%2F83497\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef83496 graphicRef83497 \">picture 1A-B</a>). Over the course of weeks to months, the papules may coalesce into larger plaques that often demonstrate a &quot;cauliflower appearance&quot; (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F83498\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef83498 \">picture 2</a>). In boys, condylomata acuminata are most commonly detected in the perianal area and are less frequently found on the penile shaft. Girls may present with lesions on the perianal area, vulva, hymen, vaginal vestibule, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> periurethral areas. Anogenital warts may also occur on the internal mucosal surfaces of vagina or rectum.</p><p>Although occasional lesions are pruritic or painful, condyloma acuminatum is usually asymptomatic. Rarely, bleeding occurs.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H38934368\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL COURSE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Few data are available on the natural history of condyloma acuminatum in children, but there is evidence that many infections resolve spontaneously within a few years. In a retrospective and prospective study of 41 children with condyloma acuminatum, spontaneous resolution occurred within five years in six of eight children who never received treatment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/condylomata-acuminata-anogenital-warts-in-children/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. The average duration of these lesions prior to resolution was nine months (range 5 to 12 months). Among the 33 children who were treated, 9 (27 percent) had resolution that appeared attributable to treatment and 16 (48 percent) had resolution that appeared to be spontaneous (the disappearance of condylomata acuminata failed to correlate with the timing of treatment). The average duration of lesions in the group with apparent spontaneous resolution was 25 months (range 2 to 58 months). </p><p>Similar to many other infections, immunosuppression influences the course and prognosis of condyloma acuminatum. Immunosuppressed children may develop extensive lesions that are challenging to treat [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/condylomata-acuminata-anogenital-warts-in-children/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H38934039\"><span class=\"h1\">DIAGNOSIS AND EVALUATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The diagnosis of condyloma acuminatum is usually made via clinical examination. Biopsies are rarely required, and are usually reserved for patients in whom the diagnosis is uncertain or when the warts demonstrate atypical features, such as ulceration. Common histopathologic features of condyloma acuminatum include [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/condylomata-acuminata-anogenital-warts-in-children/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Marked acanthosis with some papillomatosis and hyperkeratosis</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Vacuolated koilocytes (less prominent than other viral warts)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Coarse keratohyaline granules </p><p/><p>Viral serotyping can be performed by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) or nucleic acid hybridization assays [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/condylomata-acuminata-anogenital-warts-in-children/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. However, viral serotyping is not routinely performed since it is not necessary for diagnosis and is not reliable for identifying the source of infection. (See <a href=\"#H38935885\" class=\"local\">'Transmission'</a> above.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H38936389\"><span class=\"h2\">Assessment for sexual abuse</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Although it is likely that many children with condyloma acuminatum acquire the disorder through nonsexual means, the possibility of sexual abuse warrants serious consideration during patient evaluation. Children under four years of age with condyloma acuminatum are less likely to be victims of sexual abuse than older children, but the possibility of sexual abuse cannot be definitively excluded based upon age. (See <a href=\"#H38935885\" class=\"local\">'Transmission'</a> above.)</p><p>Interviews with the caregivers and the child (if old enough to participate), as well as clinical or laboratory examination to evaluate for sexual abuse and other sexually transmitted infections are important components of the patient assessment. If any findings suggestive of sexual abuse are detected, reporting to child protective services or legal authorities in accordance with local policies is indicated. </p><p>Due to the greater likelihood of sexual abuse as a precipitator of condyloma acuminatum in older children, a higher level of suspicion should exist for children over the age of four [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/condylomata-acuminata-anogenital-warts-in-children/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Exceptions include adolescents who report consensual sexual activity and immunosuppressed children with multiple nongenital warts who lack other findings suggestive of abuse. </p><p>We agree with the following approach to the initial evaluation for sexual abuse in children with condyloma acuminatum [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/condylomata-acuminata-anogenital-warts-in-children/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Interview of primary caregivers to determine whether the child may be at risk for sexual abuse and to establish the presence of cutaneous or anogenital warts in the caregivers or other family members</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Interview of the child regarding sexual abuse by a professional trained in this field (provided the child is old enough to participate - usually three to four years of age)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Assessment for signs or symptoms that may accompany a history of sexual abuse (eg, nightmares, advanced sexual knowledge, sexual behavior with peers)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Physical examination for evidence of physical or sexual abuse, including magnified examination of genital and anal sites looking for signs of acute trauma (hymenal bruising, petechiae, anal tears) or chronic trauma (absent hymen at the posterior hymenal rim, anogenital scarring)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Screening for other sexually transmitted diseases as determined appropriate by the scenario (eg, gonorrhea, chlamydia, trichomoniasis, human immunodeficiency virus, hepatitis B and C, syphilis) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Referral to a child abuse specialist if the clinicians involved are not comfortable or adequately trained to perform this assessment</p><p/><p>The evaluation and reporting of sexual abuse in children is discussed in greater detail separately.

(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=human-papillomavirus-vaccination\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Human papillomavirus vaccination&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H38936913\"><span class=\"h1\">SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Condylomata acuminata (also known as anogenital warts or venereal warts) are cutaneous lesions caused by infection with human papillomavirus (HPV). Both mucosal and cutaneous HPV serotypes can lead to the development of condyloma acuminatum in children. (See <a href=\"#H38933903\" class=\"local\">'Etiology'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Condyloma acuminatum in children may arise from HPV transmission through a variety of mechanisms. Although the possibility of sexual abuse is a major concern, many children, particularly those under the age of four years, acquire HPV infection through nonsexual interactions. (See <a href=\"#H38935885\" class=\"local\">'Transmission'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Condyloma acuminatum usually begins as single or multiple flesh-colored, pink, or brown papules (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F83496%7EDERM%2F83497\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef83496 graphicRef83497 \">picture 1A-B</a>). As the infection progresses, lesions may develop into large verrucous plaques with a &quot;cauliflower-like&quot; appearance (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F83498\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef83498 \">picture 2</a>). (See <a href=\"#H276633452\" class=\"local\">'Clinical manifestations'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Spontaneous resolution of condyloma acuminatum is possible, and many infections resolve within a few years. Lesions that persist for more than two years or develop in immunosuppressed individuals may be less likely to resolve without treatment. (See <a href=\"#H38934368\" class=\"local\">'Clinical course'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The possibility of sexual abuse should be considered in all children who present with condyloma acuminatum. Children over the age of four years are more likely to have a history of sexual abuse than younger children. The evaluation for sexual abuse typically begins with interviews with the caregivers and child, a complete physical examination, and screening for other sexually transmitted diseases. (See <a href=\"#H38936389\" class=\"local\">'Assessment for sexual abuse'</a> above and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-of-sexual-abuse-in-children-and-adolescents\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation of sexual abuse in children and adolescents&quot;</a>.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Treatment is optional for children with condylomata acuminata since lesions may resolve spontaneously. Warts that persist for longer than two years may be less likely than earlier lesions to resolve without treatment. (See <a href=\"#H276633487\" class=\"local\">'Treatment'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Since most condylomata acuminata in children resolve within a few years, treatment is not required for most children with asymptomatic lesions. For children with symptomatic lesions, lesions that fail to spontaneously resolve, immunosuppression, or lesions that lead to emotional distress or social problems, we suggest treatment with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=imiquimod-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">imiquimod</a> 5% or 3.75% cream or podophyllotoxin 0.5% gel or solution (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=5\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2B</a>). Children with lesions recalcitrant to topical therapy may benefit from laser therapy or surgical procedures.
