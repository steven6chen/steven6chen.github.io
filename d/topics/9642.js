People have 2 kidneys, 1 on each side of the mid-back. The kidneys' job is to filter the blood and remove waste and excess salt and water. Urine is made up of these ingredients.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H539738323\"><span class=\"h1\">What are the symptoms of kidney cancer?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Smaller kidney tumors do not always cause symptoms. But larger tumors and tumors that have spread outside the kidney can cause symptoms, such as:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Blood in the urine</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pain on either side of your lower back, in your side, or in your stomach</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A lump in your belly or on the side of your back</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Weight loss that you cannot explain</p><p/><p>These symptoms can also be caused by conditions that are not cancer. But if you have these symptoms, you should be checked by a doctor or nurse.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H539738330\"><span class=\"h1\">Is there a test for kidney cancer?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Yes. If you have symptoms of kidney cancer, your doctor or nurse might order a test to check your kidneys. These tests can show tumors or abnormal growths. They create images of your kidneys in different ways, and they include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>CT scan (a type of X-ray)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>MRI (uses magnets to create images)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Ultrasound (uses sound waves to create images)</p><p/><p>Most people find out they have kidney cancer after having an imaging test for an unrelated symptom. For example, people sometimes have a CT scan because they have belly pain and then find out they have a tumor in a kidney.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H539738337\"><span class=\"h1\">What is kidney cancer staging?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Cancer staging is a way in which doctors find out how far a cancer has spread.</p><p>The right treatment for you will depend a lot on the stage of your cancer.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H539738344\"><span class=\"h1\">How is kidney cancer treated?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>People with kidney cancer often have one or both of the following treatments:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Surgery</strong> &ndash; When cancer is confined to the kidney, it is usually treated with surgery with the goal of taking out the entire tumor. This can involve removing all or part of the affected kidney. The decision about how much to remove depends on different things, including how well the other kidney works and how big the tumor is. In some cases, surgery can help even if the cancer has already spread to other parts of the body.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Medical treatment</strong> &ndash; Different medicines can also be used to treat kidney cancer, particularly if it cannot be removed or if there is evidence it has spread. This might include:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Targeted therapy &ndash; This includes medicines that block certain blood vessels or proteins in your body that help the cancer grow.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Immunotherapy &ndash; This is the term doctors use for medicines that work with the body's infection-fighting system (the &quot;immune system&quot;) to stop cancer growth.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H27223919\"><span class=\"h1\">What happens after treatment?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>After treatment, you will be checked every so often to see if the cancer comes back. Follow up tests can include exams, lab tests, and X-ray tests.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H27223936\"><span class=\"h1\">What happens if the cancer comes back or spreads?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>If the cancer comes back or spreads, you might have more surgery or medical treatment.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H539738365\"><span class=\"h1\">What else should I do?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>It is important to follow all your doctor's instructions about visits and tests. It's also important to talk to your doctor about any side effects or problems you have during treatment.</p><p>Getting treated for kidney cancer involves making many choices, such as which type of surgery to have or which medicine to take.</p><p>Always let your doctors and nurses know how you feel about a treatment. Any time you are offered a treatment, ask:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>What are the benefits of this treatment? Is it likely to help me live longer? Will it reduce or prevent symptoms?</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>What are the downsides to this treatment?</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Are there other options besides this treatment?</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>What happens if I do not have this treatment?</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H539738372\"><span class=\"h1\">More on this topic</span></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=what-are-clinical-trials-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: What are clinical trials?
