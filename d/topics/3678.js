The provision of medical care in correctional facilities has been strongly informed in the United States by the legal case of Estelle v. Gamble, 1976 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-care-of-incarcerated-adults/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>]. In this case, the Supreme Court deemed that deliberate indifference to serious illness or injury in a prisoner can be considered cruel and unusual punishment, in violation of the Eighth Amendment of the Constitution. Cases following this ruling have upheld three basic rights: the right to access to care, the right to care that has been ordered by a health professional, and the right to a professional medical judgment.</p><p>Correctional medicine provides an opportunity to promote public health in a targeted, high-risk population [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-care-of-incarcerated-adults/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Unfortunately, health care data sets intended to be nationally representative in the United States frequently exclude individuals who are incarcerated, so that health information for the incarcerated population is not complete [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-care-of-incarcerated-adults/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].</p><p>Specific medical conditions are of particular concern due to their high prevalence among incarcerated individuals and the increased risks for transmission of infection due to congregate living conditions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-care-of-incarcerated-adults/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. Since the disease burden is high, correctional medicine may be more demanding and costly than care for non-incarcerated populations of similar age.</p><p>In addition to the high-risk population served, the design of jails and prisons and correctional health services themselves may unintentionally facilitate the transmission of disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-care-of-incarcerated-adults/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. Correctional facilities often lack space for isolating people with communicable diseases, and overcrowding is a risk factor for communicable diseases. Infection control in correctional facilities may be adversely impacted by limited access to showers, a supply of clean clothes, and prohibitions against bleach and condoms. People in jails and prisons may be expected to wash their own laundry by hand, rather than use institutional laundry services, and this may be insufficient to disinfect clothing. Additionally, kitchen workers and barbers in correctional facilities may have inadequate training in infection control.</p><p>This topic addresses health issues of particular relevance to the adult incarcerated population. Issues related to care of children of incarcerated parents is discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=developmental-and-behavioral-implications-for-children-of-incarcerated-parents\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Developmental and behavioral implications for children of incarcerated parents&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">DEFINITIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In the United States, correctional facilities include both prisons and jails. Jails are generally local or county institutions, detaining individuals awaiting trial and sentencing, as well as some who have been sentenced to short prison terms or who are being transferred between facilities. Jails often have the added responsibility of managing acute health problems, such as alcohol or drug withdrawal, which are less likely to confront health care staff in prisons. Persons detained in jails generally have short stays, although jails may also house individuals when prisons are overcrowded.</p><p>Prisons in the United States generally house persons who have been sentenced to longer terms, including life sentences. State and federal prisons house individuals who have been convicted of a crime and sentenced either by a state or the federal government, respectively. People who have violated the terms of their parole or probation generally go directly to prisons, although this varies by state. A few states, and some other countries, including England and Wales, have combined jail and prison facilities that include individuals awaiting trial or sentencing and those serving sentences.</p><p>Individuals on parole (sometimes called community supervision) have been released from prison but are still under the supervision of the criminal justice system and may return to prison for violation of their parole terms. Probation refers to supervision of individuals as an alternative to incarceration.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">HEALTH SERVICES IN CORRECTIONAL FACILITIES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Health service availability and delivery in jails and prisons vary by country and region. There is wide variation in the size of jails and prisons, and facilities are often in rural locations and geographically isolated.</p><p>Financial and human resource constraints pose challenges for correctional systems in meeting the significant medical needs of the individuals housed in those facilities [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-care-of-incarcerated-adults/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. Prison medical spending was estimated at approximately $7.7 billion in the United States in 2011 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-care-of-incarcerated-adults/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. In Massachusetts, prison health care costs in 2011 ($100 million a year) were nearly double the cost in 2001 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-care-of-incarcerated-adults/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. Many individuals have not had adequate access to health care prior to their incarceration and have medical needs at the time of booking and intake. Furthermore, community resources to care for their needs after release may be lacking or difficult to procure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-care-of-incarcerated-adults/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. Thus, correctional providers face the complex task of addressing barriers to meeting the health needs of their patients while striving for quality goals. Groups have sought to identify appropriate quality and patient safety indicators for care in <span class=\"nowrap\">jail/prison</span> settings [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-care-of-incarcerated-adults/abstract/11,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,12</a>] and apply quality improvement and patient safety principles to correctional health care [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-care-of-incarcerated-adults/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>].</p><p>Health services in correctional facilities are provided in a variety of ways. Counties, territories, states, or the federal government may hire their own health providers and administer their own health care, as is the case in Washington State. Providers or the health care system may be managed using for-profit contractors. A university medical center may be involved in providing care for a correctional system, such as the University of Texas Medical Branch [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-care-of-incarcerated-adults/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. Local public health departments may provide care to those detained in jails. The San Francisco Department of Public Health, for example, provides the care for the San Francisco County jails. In Australia, health services are provided by the Department of Health in some areas and by the Department of Justice or Corrections in others [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-care-of-incarcerated-adults/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. Telemedicine is making inroads into correctional health care as a way to address the lack of availability of specialty services in some rural areas or in a geographically large US state such as Michigan [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-care-of-incarcerated-adults/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>].</p><p>In US prisons, patients may lose public insurance coverage they had prior to incarceration, although changes stemming from the Affordable Care Act and Medicaid expansion may improve coverage for many individuals with a history of prison involvement [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-care-of-incarcerated-adults/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. The burden of paying for medical services in correctional facilities has historically been the responsibility of the county, state, or federal government. Sometimes, patients in correctional facilities are charged copayments to access health care services [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-care-of-incarcerated-adults/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h1\">DEMOGRAPHICS (US DATA)</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Throughout the world, there are more than 10 million people in correctional (penal) facilities, although the number may be greater than 11 million given some underreporting of people on pretrial detention [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-care-of-incarcerated-adults/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. In the United States at year-end in 2014, 6.8 million people were under correctional supervision (eg, in jail, prison, on probation, or on parole) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-care-of-incarcerated-adults/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. Just under 3 percent of US adults were under correctional supervision at year-end 2013 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-care-of-incarcerated-adults/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. The number of people in prison in the United States has tripled since 1987 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-care-of-incarcerated-adults/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>], but growth has slowed since 2000 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-care-of-incarcerated-adults/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. There are approximately 11.4 million admissions jail and over 636,000 admissions to prison per year [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-care-of-incarcerated-adults/abstract/22-25\" class=\"abstract_t\">22-25</a>].</p><p>Minorities are disproportionately represented among incarcerated persons (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F52434\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef52434 \">figure 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-care-of-incarcerated-adults/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>].</p><p>In the World Health Organization (WHO) European Region, six million people are incarcerated yearly [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-care-of-incarcerated-adults/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h1\">GUIDELINES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Special challenges are posed by delivering health care in jails and prisons while maintaining security and safety for health care personnel and patients and adhering to appropriate ethical standards. Several organizations have created guidelines and standards for the delivery of health care in correctional facilities. For instance, the <a href=\"http://www.euro.who.int/__data/assets/pdf_file/0005/249188/Prisons-and-Health.pdf&amp;token=t41L4nn5DVtSK03LUcdBd59hJJbG8Q2Mn21p8DH7k0yQCnLYECfIvDq5xpzsi8p1ErCl050UeaUa3afNrpKLk9Un0mZG4DL8R7CnNZSHexoFueAN7PTuAPLSoIdxF28t&amp;TOPIC_ID=2776\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">World Health Organization (WHO) Regional Office for Europe</a> has published guidance on a wide range of issues related to provision of health care for incarcerated persons, including mental health, drug treatment, tuberculosis, and solitary confinement [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-care-of-incarcerated-adults/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. In the United States, the National Commission on Correctional Health Care has published a number of guidelines for health care in correctional settings (<a href=\"http://www.ncchc.org/&amp;token=ODIqmPyH03K5IrNHL4ooto+ddXjtMid6va+tTNG+4Q4=&amp;TOPIC_ID=2776\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">www.ncchc.org</a>) and standards for compliance with constitutionally acceptable health care in correctional facilities [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-care-of-incarcerated-adults/abstract/28-30\" class=\"abstract_t\">28-30</a>].</p><p>The Centers of Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) published guidelines for the Prevention and Control of Tuberculosis in Correctional Facilities in 2006 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-care-of-incarcerated-adults/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]. These guidelines include correctional-specific issues, such as avoiding housing new entrants with other people until TB screening is completed.</p><p>Accreditation of medical services in jails and prisons is voluntary.

Screening should include assessment for potential drug and alcohol withdrawal, injuries, conditions that may have an immediate flare or require uninterrupted medical treatment (eg, treatment for cancer or tuberculosis [TB]), continuing medication therapy, suicide risk, transmissible diseases, and pregnancy. The following conditions should be considered:</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Drug and alcohol withdrawal</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Based on the 2004 Survey of Inmates in State and Federal Correctional Facilities conducted by the Bureau of Justice, just over half of people in state and federal prisons reported the use of drugs or alcohol at the time they committed their offense. Fifty-six percent of state inmates reported using drugs during the month before the offense [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-care-of-incarcerated-adults/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>]. This is in comparison to the 8.7 percent of persons over 12 years of age in the United States who reported any illicit drug use in the past month [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-care-of-incarcerated-adults/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>]. In addition, 24 percent of state inmates reported three or more positive answers to the CAGE instrument, consistent with a history of alcohol abuse or dependence [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-care-of-incarcerated-adults/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=screening-for-unhealthy-use-of-alcohol-and-other-drugs-in-primary-care#H1272522\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Screening for unhealthy use of alcohol and other drugs in primary care&quot;, section on 'CAGE questions'</a>.)</p><p>In a systematic review of international studies on substance use disorders at reception into prison, estimates of alcohol use disorders <span class=\"nowrap\">(abuse/dependence)</span> was estimated at 17 to 30 percent for men and 10 to 24 percent for women; estimates of drug use disorders were 10 to 48 percent for men and 30 to 60 percent for women [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-care-of-incarcerated-adults/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>].</p><p>The high rates of drug and alcohol use, and potentially life-threatening complications from unrecognized withdrawal, make initial screening for alcohol, benzodiazepine, and barbiturate withdrawal crucial. Ongoing monitoring for use and withdrawal syndromes may be necessary, since alcohol and drug use may occur in jails and prisons [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-care-of-incarcerated-adults/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>]. Appropriate and effective treatment of withdrawal may decrease drug use and syringe-sharing during incarceration and improve the ability of people in jails and prisons to make informed legal decisions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-care-of-incarcerated-adults/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>].</p><p>The management of withdrawal syndromes is discussed elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-moderate-and-severe-alcohol-withdrawal-syndromes\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of moderate and severe alcohol withdrawal syndromes&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=benzodiazepine-poisoning-and-withdrawal\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Benzodiazepine poisoning and withdrawal&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Injuries</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Injuries from both accidents and violence are common during incarceration [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-care-of-incarcerated-adults/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>]. They are often related to altercations that led detainees to jail, skirmishes with police officers, sports in jail or prison, deliberate self-harm, attempted suicide, and conflicts with other individuals in jails and prisons. A study of people in Texas prisons demonstrated that 2.9 percent were treated for fractures during a one-year period [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-care-of-incarcerated-adults/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>]. Injuries were the most common cause of evaluation at a local Scottish emergency department near to a prison: 22 percent of injuries were due to deliberate self-harm, 18 percent due to injury resulting from violence, and 15 percent due to sports injury [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-care-of-incarcerated-adults/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>].</p><p>Acute intoxication may mask serious and potentially life-threatening injuries such as occult head or spine trauma. Cervical spine immobilization and evaluation with radiography is indicated if any doubt exists about the presence of occult injury.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h2\">Continuity of care for chronic conditions</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Many chronic medical problems require uninterrupted medication, even during short periods of incarceration. Inquiry into the possibility of these conditions, as well as inquiry into medications used, is essential at reception into jail. An evaluation by a health professional or a complete health assessment is often recommended within a 7- to 14-day time window from admission to the <span class=\"nowrap\">jail/prison</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-care-of-incarcerated-adults/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]; this delay should not result in interruption of maintenance medications. Medication changes in regimens at entry into prison can have untoward effects on the mental health of individuals with mental health disorders [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-care-of-incarcerated-adults/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>].</p><p>Uninterrupted medication is crucial for many medical conditions, including: HIV therapy, TB, psychotic conditions, asthma, seizure disorders, coronary artery disease, diabetes mellitus, deep venous thrombosis, arrhythmias, and rheumatologic conditions. Brief lapses in therapy can have significant untoward effects, such as diabetic ketoacidosis or the evolution of resistance for HIV therapy.</p><p>Obtaining an accurate list of medications and dosing from the patient's community provider should be a priority, especially if any doubt is present about dosing. This is particularly important for opioid pain medications, which can be the source of friction between patients and correctional facility providers; providers may fear that opioid pain medications will be misused, while patients fear inadequate pain relief.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h2\">Suicide prevention</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Suicide is an important issue in jails and prisons [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-care-of-incarcerated-adults/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>]. In the United States nationally, 29 percent of deaths in jails were due to suicide from 2000 to 2007, and suicide rates were higher in small facilities than large facilities. Men and whites were at higher risk of suicide than females, blacks, and Hispanics [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-care-of-incarcerated-adults/abstract/43\" class=\"abstract_t\">43</a>]. In an international study of suicides in 12 countries, the relative risk of suicide was three times higher in prisons than in the general population [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-care-of-incarcerated-adults/abstract/44\" class=\"abstract_t\">44</a>].</p><p>Heightened periods of suicide risk include the time of arrest, actual conviction, admission to prison from jail, and any significant life event such as the birth of a child on the outside or news that a spouse is seeking divorce [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-care-of-incarcerated-adults/abstract/45\" class=\"abstract_t\">45</a>]. The first week of admission is the highest risk period for suicide [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-care-of-incarcerated-adults/abstract/46,47\" class=\"abstract_t\">46,47</a>]. One study found that 48 percent of all jail suicides occurred within the first week [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-care-of-incarcerated-adults/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>]. An Italian study found that completed suicides occurred 10 times more frequently in overcrowded prisons than non-overcrowded prisons [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-care-of-incarcerated-adults/abstract/48\" class=\"abstract_t\">48</a>].</p><p>Hanging, generally using bedclothes and window bars, was the most common method of suicide in a British study [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-care-of-incarcerated-adults/abstract/47\" class=\"abstract_t\">47</a>]. Among people who had been admitted into inpatient prison health care, more than one-third of suicide deaths occurred within seven days of discharge from inpatient care; many had been discharged without a scheduled follow-up appointment. Over 50 percent of people who died from suicide in prison had symptoms of mental disorder at the time of admission into prison, including intoxication or withdrawal from drugs or alcohol, thoughts of self-harm or suicide, or anxiety. Just over half of those who died of suicide had a history of self-harm, as confirmed in other studies of prison and jail suicides [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-care-of-incarcerated-adults/abstract/49\" class=\"abstract_t\">49</a>], and a quarter were thought to be at particular risk of suicide at the time of death. Self-harm includes intentional self-poisoning or self-injury, regardless of underlying motive or suicidal intent. A study in United Kingdom prisons found that self-harm (mostly of low lethality) was reported for 5 to 6 percent of incarcerated males and 20 to 24 percent of females [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-care-of-incarcerated-adults/abstract/50\" class=\"abstract_t\">50</a>]. Among men, suicide rates for those who self-harmed were approximately four times the rates for those who did not self-harm; in women, rates of suicide were approximately 1.5-fold for those who self-harmed compared with those who did not.</p><p>An Austrian study found that a history of suicidality, psychiatric diagnosis, psychotropic medication, violent offense, and single-cell accommodation were risk factors for suicide [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-care-of-incarcerated-adults/abstract/51\" class=\"abstract_t\">51</a>]. In a review of suicides in New York State prisons, 95 percent of people had a history of substance abuse, 65 percent had received bad news from home or adverse information about their criminal cases, and 70 percent presented psychological distress such as anxiety or agitation just before suicide [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-care-of-incarcerated-adults/abstract/52\" class=\"abstract_t\">52</a>].</p><p>Several suicide screening instruments exist for correctional facilities, including the Suicide Risk Assessment Scale [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-care-of-incarcerated-adults/abstract/53\" class=\"abstract_t\">53</a>]; these instruments are generally implemented by correctional officers. Proactive efforts to prevent suicide include [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-care-of-incarcerated-adults/abstract/47\" class=\"abstract_t\">47</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Supervising people in dedicated facilities when screening reveals a suicide risk</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Providing cells without window bars and safer bed linens for people at high risk</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Providing drug and alcohol detoxification facilities</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Following up within 24 hours for people with a history of mental disorders</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Following up within seven days for people discharged from inpatient prison health care facilities</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Training correctional staff in recognizing, assessing, and managing suicide risk</p><p/><p>No large-scale trials have been performed to demonstrate the effectiveness of these measures at preventing suicides.

However, segregation with observation is common practice for those screened and found to be at suicidal risk, due to constraints related to staffing availability and costs.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h2\">Chlamydia, gonorrhea, syphilis, and Trichomonas vaginalis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Risk factors for sexually transmitted infections are common among people in jails and prisons. In one survey of female county jail detainees in Oregon, 43 percent of respondents had a history of trading sex for money [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-care-of-incarcerated-adults/abstract/54\" class=\"abstract_t\">54</a>]. In Australia, there were three notifications for sexually transmitted infections per 100 people entering prisons in 2014 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-care-of-incarcerated-adults/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>].

People should be specifically questioned about prior history of TB and symptoms of active TB, including prolonged cough, hemoptysis, or chest pain, using a systematic screening tool administered by trained staff. Individuals with symptoms should be placed in an airborne infection isolation room and evaluated for TB (chest radiograph, Mantoux <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tuberculin-skin-test-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">tuberculin skin test</a> or the QuantiFERON-TB Gold test, and sputum examination if indicated).</p><p>The CDC recommends a yearly assessment of each correctional environment for the risk of TB transmission and classifies the facility into minimal risk or non-minimal risk TB categories based on specific criteria.

The CDC recommends an &quot;opt-out&quot; policy for HIV screening in correctional health care settings (ie, the individual should be informed that HIV screening will be performed unless specifically declined) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-care-of-incarcerated-adults/abstract/69\" class=\"abstract_t\">69</a>]. In one state prison system, the rate of HIV screening among inmates increased with sequential changes over time in testing policy as follows: 5 percent for testing on request; 72 percent for opt-in; 90 percent for opt-out [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-care-of-incarcerated-adults/abstract/70\" class=\"abstract_t\">70</a>]. The CDC also recommends that patients at high risk for HIV infection be screened for HIV infection at least annually. A more general discussion of HIV screening is presented elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=screening-and-diagnostic-testing-for-hiv-infection\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Screening and diagnostic testing for HIV infection&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Based upon the CDC definition of high risk (people who inject drugs, persons who exchange sex for money or drugs, men who have sex with men, sex partners of individuals with HIV infection, and individuals who have had more than one sex partner or whose partners have had more than one sex partner since their last HIV test), many individuals in correctional facilities are high risk and therefore should be considered for annual HIV testing. Furthermore, since people in correctional facilities may be hesitant to report high-risk behavior in prison (ie, needle sharing, sexual contact, or rape) testing on demand is also offered in many settings.</p><p>It is paramount that plans be explicitly made at the time of testing to provide HIV test results to inmates who may be released before the results are available. Results from Rhode Island suggest that HIV testing within 24 hours of admission to a correctional facility resulted in greater identification of previously unknown cases of HIV than delayed testing at seven days [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-care-of-incarcerated-adults/abstract/71\" class=\"abstract_t\">71</a>]. The role of rapid HIV testing in corrections is growing [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-care-of-incarcerated-adults/abstract/72,73\" class=\"abstract_t\">72,73</a>].

The high prevalence of chronic conditions and opportunities for prevention among the incarcerated requires an approach that also incorporates routine scheduled follow-up visits and chronic disease management clinics. One review from Switzerland suggests targeting four high-risk conditions for preventive measures among the incarcerated population: tuberculosis, HIV, hepatitis, and sexually transmitted diseases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-care-of-incarcerated-adults/abstract/84\" class=\"abstract_t\">84</a>].

Self-management of diabetes (self-testing and administration of insulin) should be encouraged within the limits of individual facility policies. Other problems include the timing and type of food, limited exercise, and delays in accessing medical care. Efforts should be made to assess facility resources for diabetes management and transfer people with diabetes to facilities with 24-hour nursing care and better dietary resources, when appropriate.</p><p>The American Diabetes Association has issued guidelines for diabetes care in correctional settings [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-care-of-incarcerated-adults/abstract/91\" class=\"abstract_t\">91</a>]. Patients with risk factors for diabetes should be screened for diabetes, and pregnant women should be assessed for gestational diabetes. A team approach to diabetes management is emphasized, as is self-management education. Correctional staff should be trained to recognize and treat hypo- and hyperglycemia.</p><p>The Federal Bureau of Prisons also has guidelines for the treatment of diabetes in federal prisons.

Prisons are generally not prepared to address the aging prisoner with medical comorbidities, functional impairment, or cognitive impairments, or to provide palliative care services when needed. Designated facilities that meet the special needs of older incarcerated individuals identified with functional impairments or geriatric syndromes may be one way to manage this problem, in conjunction with evaluation of the older adults in prisons for functional and cognitive limitations. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=geriatric-health-maintenance#H94569618\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Geriatric health maintenance&quot;, section on 'Functional assessment and geriatric evaluation'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H30\"><span class=\"h2\">Health care maintenance</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Incarceration presents an opportunity to provide preventive services to a high-risk population who may otherwise have poor access to care. Routine health care maintenance, as would be offered to patients in the community, is indicated for the incarcerated, including age-appropriate cancer screening and vaccinations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-care-of-incarcerated-adults/abstract/157\" class=\"abstract_t\">157</a>]. Additionally, incarceration offers an opportunity to address lifestyle issues for a vulnerable population. In a systematic review of noncommunicable diseases among people in prisons in 15 countries, female prisoners in the United States and Australia had a greater likelihood of obesity compared with the general population, salt intake was more than twice recommended levels for prisoners in nine studies, and levels of physical activity for prisoners varied by country [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-care-of-incarcerated-adults/abstract/160\" class=\"abstract_t\">160</a>].</p><p>Incarceration itself has been associated with an increased risk for hypertension and left ventricular hypertrophy, after adjustment for other risk factors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-care-of-incarcerated-adults/abstract/161\" class=\"abstract_t\">161</a>]. This underscores the need to provide health care screening to incarcerated persons, a population more likely to be medically-underserved upon release. Additionally, incarcerated women are at high risk for sexually transmitted diseases and unplanned pregnancy, and attention to reproductive health needs in this population could benefit the women and their community outside the prison [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-care-of-incarcerated-adults/abstract/162\" class=\"abstract_t\">162</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=preventive-care-in-adults-recommendations\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Preventive care in adults: Recommendations&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H31\"><span class=\"h1\">SPECIFIC ETHICAL ISSUES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Ethical concerns arise frequently in any medical practice but have particular pertinence in providing care to the incarcerated patient. Specific issues to be addressed here are pain management, hunger strikes, and end-of-life care.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H32\"><span class=\"h2\">Pain management</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Pain management can be complex in the correctional setting. Providers fear prescription drug misuse and diversion in the setting of poor patient credibility and history of drug abuse in the correctional setting [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-care-of-incarcerated-adults/abstract/163\" class=\"abstract_t\">163</a>]. Patients may have difficulty trusting providers and fear inadequate pain control.</p><p>Institutional factors, including security protocols and formulation restrictions, often present barriers to adequate pain management for people in prisons and jails [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-care-of-incarcerated-adults/abstract/163\" class=\"abstract_t\">163</a>].</p><p>For new entrants into the correctional facility, communication with outside providers who prescribe chronic pain medications to patients in the community is paramount. In addition, follow-up medical visits to assess the adequacy of pain relief with prescribed therapy may be helpful to build trust between provider and patient.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H33\"><span class=\"h2\">Hunger strikes</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Complex practical and ethical concerns complicate the medical management in jails and prisons. A hunger strike, in which a patient who has the capacity to understand the potential medical impact of food refusal and who is not suicidal refuses food for a specific reason, is one example. The medical management of patients on hunger strike should include psychiatric consultation, a medical history and evaluation, assessment of motives for food refusal and the possibility of coercion, and the prisoner's understanding of the risks and benefits of the food refusal [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-care-of-incarcerated-adults/abstract/164\" class=\"abstract_t\">164</a>]. The person on hunger strike should finalize an advanced directive, to be followed in the event of their becoming incompetent, to express wishes.</p><p>Clinician assessment is often initiated after 72 hours of food refusal. In prison, people on hunger strike may accept water, salt, sugar, and vitamin B1. Some may accept liquid nutritional supplements. Refusal of both food and water is unusual, because a rapid death would not allow negotiation to meet demands.</p><p>Weight loss of approximately 18 percent of initial weight can result in serious medical problems; loss of more than 30 percent is life-threatening [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-care-of-incarcerated-adults/abstract/164\" class=\"abstract_t\">164</a>]. Force-feeding a malnourished individual can result in refeeding syndrome, characterized by electrolyte abnormalities including hypophosphatemia, fluid retention, and hyperglycemia.</p><p>The World Medical Association Declaration of Malta states that forced feeding is unethical. The 8th Amendment to the Constitution in the United States prohibits cruel and unusual punishment and has been variably interpreted to permit forced feeding in certain situations, often involving the court system. Clinicians in correctional environments may need to balance divergent ethical principles such as respecting the sanctity of life and respect for individual autonomy. Guidance on such issues has been provided by thoughtful articles in the literature [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-care-of-incarcerated-adults/abstract/164-166\" class=\"abstract_t\">164-166</a>]. Position statements from the World Medical Association [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-care-of-incarcerated-adults/abstract/167\" class=\"abstract_t\">167</a>] and other medical associations are also available to guide clinicians. Generally, states have been successful when they have argued that their responsibility to preserve life outweighs the individuals&rsquo; right to starve themselves.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H34\"><span class=\"h2\">End-of-life care</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The leading causes of death among inmates are heart disease, cancer, chronic liver disease, acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS), and suicide [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-care-of-incarcerated-adults/abstract/148\" class=\"abstract_t\">148</a>]. Challenges in caring for terminally ill individuals in the correctional system, compared with the already significant challenge of palliative care in the general population, are heightened by increased health illiteracy, distrust of medical caregivers, and isolation from family in the incarcerated population [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-care-of-incarcerated-adults/abstract/168\" class=\"abstract_t\">168</a>]. The system further poses constraints by formulary restrictions; limited access to medicines, and pain medication in particular, other than at fixed scheduled intervals; limited availability of trained hospice workers within the prison system; and issues related to promoting do-not-resuscitate and advanced directives. Participation by prisoners in clinical trials is impeded by laws enacted to protect prisoners from unethical research.</p><p>Ideally, an interdisciplinary team, involving the patient, family, medical staff, and custody staff, should be involved in developing and implementing a plan for hospice care [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-care-of-incarcerated-adults/abstract/169\" class=\"abstract_t\">169</a>]. Granting compassionate parole at the end of life requires a review process that is often slow; when granted, people are frequently in the final days of their life. Some have advocated to relax or redefine medical eligibility criteria for compassionate release, since principles of incarceration (retribution, rehabilitation, deterrence, and incapacitation) may no longer be applicable at the end of life [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-care-of-incarcerated-adults/abstract/170\" class=\"abstract_t\">170</a>].</p><p>Guidelines have been published with recommendations for palliative care in the prison setting [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-care-of-incarcerated-adults/abstract/171,172\" class=\"abstract_t\">171,172</a>]. The growing and aging prison population heightens the need for attention and resources dedicated to improving care for the terminally ill and implementing standards of care.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H35\"><span class=\"h1\">HEALTH RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH RELEASE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The immediate period following release from jail or prison can be a high-risk time for drug users and others [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-care-of-incarcerated-adults/abstract/156,173-177\" class=\"abstract_t\">156,173-177</a>]. Multiple studies have looked at the rate of death in the first two weeks following release. These were reviewed in an international meta-analysis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-care-of-incarcerated-adults/abstract/176\" class=\"abstract_t\">176</a>]. Selected studies include the following:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A study in Scotland found a strikingly high risk of death (relative risk [RR] 7.4; 95% CI 3.3-16.3) from drug-related events in the two weeks following release from prison relative to the subsequent two-week periods [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-care-of-incarcerated-adults/abstract/173\" class=\"abstract_t\">173</a>]. The risk of non-drug-related death in the two weeks following release was nearly five times the rate expected [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-care-of-incarcerated-adults/abstract/173\" class=\"abstract_t\">173</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a study from the state of Washington, the adjusted risk of death in the first two weeks following prison release was 12.7 (95% CI 9.2 to 17.4) times that of other state residents and was 3.5 times (95% CI 3.2 to 3.8) that of other state residents over a mean follow-up of 1.9 years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-care-of-incarcerated-adults/abstract/156\" class=\"abstract_t\">156</a>]. Drug overdose was the most common cause of death according to data from death certificates, with other deaths attributed to cardiovascular disease, homicide, suicide, cancer, motor vehicle accidents, and liver disease.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a study from New York City, the risk of drug-related death among people released from jail in the first two weeks following release was eight times the death rate of non-incarcerated individuals adjusted for age, sex, race, and neighborhood. Drug-related death rates were highest in persons who had a history of homelessness [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-care-of-incarcerated-adults/abstract/177\" class=\"abstract_t\">177</a>].</p><p/><p>Transitions of care and communication between medical providers in and out of correctional facilities, and between different correctional facilities, is critical to ensure that people do not have lapses in chronic medications and suffer health risks due to transitions of care at the time of release or transfer to a new facility. In a study of Medicare beneficiaries released from correctional facilities, rates of hospitalization within one week to three months post-release were twice the rates for matched controls [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-care-of-incarcerated-adults/abstract/178\" class=\"abstract_t\">178</a>]. A retrospective study of 1750 people with HIV released from prison in Texas found that only 20 percent had enrolled in an HIV clinic within 30 days of release; those who received enhanced discharge planning were more likely to seek care after release [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-care-of-incarcerated-adults/abstract/107\" class=\"abstract_t\">107</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'Initial screening and assessment'</a> above.)</p><p>Referrals to medical providers in the community should be made for people who do not have regular medical care. While 80 percent of released individuals have chronic medical, psychiatric, or substance use disorders, only 15 to 25 percent had a clinician visit (other than to an emergency department) in the first year after release [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-care-of-incarcerated-adults/abstract/178\" class=\"abstract_t\">178</a>]. Dually based providers in corrections and in community clinics can help address the lack of continuity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-care-of-incarcerated-adults/abstract/179\" class=\"abstract_t\">179</a>]. In most states (all but five), Medicaid and Medicare is terminated for people incarcerated for 12 months or more, so that they are uninsured upon release and need to reapply [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-care-of-incarcerated-adults/abstract/178\" class=\"abstract_t\">178</a>].</p><p>Whether programs to provide prerelease counseling or transitional support can help curb the risk of death upon release should be determined. Potential homelessness following prison release should be addressed, since homeless shelters are used by 6 to 11 percent of people after release, and homelessness increases risk for medical illness and mortality [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-care-of-incarcerated-adults/abstract/180\" class=\"abstract_t\">180</a>]. Appropriate discharge planning for people leaving prisons, including referral to community drug treatment programs and housing services, is indicated [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-care-of-incarcerated-adults/abstract/181\" class=\"abstract_t\">181</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2077620527\"><span class=\"h1\">SOCIETY GUIDELINE LINKS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Links to society and government-sponsored guidelines from selected countries and regions around the world are provided separately.

In concert with such evidence, treatment decisions may also reflect concerns for patient safety, optimal use of available resources, and public health considerations. (See <a href=\"#H1\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Screening when individuals enter a correctional facility should include assessment for potential drug and alcohol withdrawal, injuries, conditions that may have an immediate flare or require continuing medication therapy, suicide risk, transmissible diseases, and pregnancy.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Particular attention should be paid to screening for HIV infection, viral hepatitis, chlamydia, gonorrhea, syphilis, and tuberculosis. These infections are more prevalent among the incarcerated than in the general population and can be transmitted within correctional facilities if not detected and appropriately treated. (See <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'Initial screening and assessment'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Management of chronic disease in the incarcerated population should not be compromised by incarceration.
