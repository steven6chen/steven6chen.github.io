A meta-analysis of four family history studies (693 bipolar patients, including 146 with rapid cycling) found that rapid cycling did not aggregate within families [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/rapid-cycling-bipolar-disorder-epidemiology-pathogenesis-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]; a subsequent study (305 bipolar patients, including 46 with rapid cycling) also failed to find evidence that rapid cycling is a familial trait [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/rapid-cycling-bipolar-disorder-epidemiology-pathogenesis-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>].

As an example, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) studies have found that the ventral prefrontal cortex is significantly smaller in rapid cycling patients than in non-rapid cycling patients and healthy controls [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/rapid-cycling-bipolar-disorder-epidemiology-pathogenesis-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/23,24\" class=\"abstract_t\">23,24</a>].

As an example, a meta-analysis of eight studies (n &gt;3000 patients with bipolar disorder) found that the risk of rapid cycling was greater in bipolar patients with a history of childhood maltreatment (physical, sexual, or emotional abuse; neglect; or family conflict), compared with patients without a history of maltreatment (odds ratio 1.9, 95% CI 1.5-2.5) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/rapid-cycling-bipolar-disorder-epidemiology-pathogenesis-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H190200740\"><span class=\"h2\">Antidepressants</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Although some authorities think that antidepressants (particularly tricyclics) can trigger and prolong rapid cycling bipolar disorder [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/rapid-cycling-bipolar-disorder-epidemiology-pathogenesis-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/26,27\" class=\"abstract_t\">26,27</a>], this is not established and remains a point of contention [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/rapid-cycling-bipolar-disorder-epidemiology-pathogenesis-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/7,28-31\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,28-31</a>], due to the low quality, limited evidence that is available [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/rapid-cycling-bipolar-disorder-epidemiology-pathogenesis-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>]. A few prospective observational studies have found an association between antidepressants and rapid cycling; as an example, the Systematic Treatment Enhancement Program for Bipolar Disorder (STEP-BD) study followed 1191 bipolar patients for up to one year and found that rapid cycling occurred nearly four times more often in patients who received antidepressants compared with patients who did not [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/rapid-cycling-bipolar-disorder-epidemiology-pathogenesis-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>]. By contrast, other studies refute this association; in one study that followed 345 bipolar patients for a mean of 14 years, antidepressants were not associated with onset of rapid cycling and resolution of rapid cycling was not associated with discontinuation of antidepressants [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/rapid-cycling-bipolar-disorder-epidemiology-pathogenesis-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. Contrary to the idea that antidepressants precipitate rapid cycling, it has been suggested that it is frequent episodes of major depression that are associated with rapid cycling (as well as administration of an antidepressant) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/rapid-cycling-bipolar-disorder-epidemiology-pathogenesis-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>]. </p><p>Additional indirect evidence suggests that adjunctive antidepressants may not cause or exacerbate rapid cycling and are safe to use in many patients with rapid cycling [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/rapid-cycling-bipolar-disorder-epidemiology-pathogenesis-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>].

As an example, a patient with mania may remit and subsequently develop major depression.

In some cases the switch occurs suddenly. </p><p>Although there is no established definition for partial remission, most authorities define it as stabilization of the patient&rsquo;s safety and substantial improvement in the number, intensity, and frequency of psychotic and mood symptoms. Partial remission can be quantified with standardized rating scales that assess psychosis (eg, the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/rapid-cycling-bipolar-disorder-epidemiology-pathogenesis-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>]), mania (eg, the Young Mania Rating Scale [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/rapid-cycling-bipolar-disorder-epidemiology-pathogenesis-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>]), and depression (eg, the Patient Health Questionnaire &ndash; Nine Item (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F59307\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef59307 \">form 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/rapid-cycling-bipolar-disorder-epidemiology-pathogenesis-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>]), but this is not standard clinical practice.</p><p>Most authorities think it is arbitrary to use a cut-off of four mood episodes to define rapid cycling bipolar disorder [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/rapid-cycling-bipolar-disorder-epidemiology-pathogenesis-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/1,9,12,28,33,34,42,43\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,9,12,28,33,34,42,43</a>].

(See <a href=\"#H87172591\" class=\"local\">'Definitions'</a> above and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=bipolar-disorder-in-adults-clinical-features#H11685824\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Bipolar disorder in adults: Clinical features&quot;, section on 'Clinical presentation'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=bipolar-disorder-in-adults-assessment-and-diagnosis#H4503550\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Bipolar disorder in adults: Assessment and diagnosis&quot;, section on 'Diagnosis'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Rapid cycling bipolar disorder is diagnosed in patients with four or more mood episodes during a 12-month period. These episodes can occur in any order or combination, and are no different from episodes that occur as part of a non-rapid cycling pattern. Separate mood episodes are demarcated from each other either by a switch from one pole to the other (eg, major depression to mania), or by full or partial remission for at least two months. (See <a href=\"#H16495348\" class=\"local\">'Diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The estimated 12-month prevalence of rapid cycling bipolar disorder in the general population is 0.3 percent. Among bipolar patients seen in clinical settings, approximately 16 to 17 percent have rapid cycling. (See <a href=\"#H5068109\" class=\"local\">'Epidemiology'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The pathogenesis of rapid cycling bipolar disorder is not known. Although some authorities maintain that antidepressants can trigger and prolong rapid cycling bipolar disorder, this is not established. (See <a href=\"#H190200718\" class=\"local\">'Pathogenesis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Most authorities think it is arbitrary to use a cut-off of four mood episodes to define rapid cycling bipolar disorder, and conceptualize rapid cycling as one extreme on the spectrum of episode frequency that occurs in bipolar disorder. (See <a href=\"#H173673175\" class=\"local\">'Number of mood episodes'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Rapid cycling bipolar disorder is generally a transient phenomenon that can occur at any point in the bipolar patient&rsquo;s course of illness. However, some patients in clinical settings may experience rapid cycling for many years. The sequence of mood episodes observed during rapid cycling varies greatly (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PSYCH%2F72619\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef72619 \">figure 1</a>), and the predominant psychopathology is generally depression. Rapid cycling patients are significantly more likely than non-rapid cycling patients to have a lifetime history of comorbid psychopathology. (See <a href=\"#H173673501\" class=\"local\">'Duration'</a> above and <a href=\"#H173673637\" class=\"local\">'Other features'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Bipolar patients who suffer rapid cycling at some point in their course of illness have a poorer long-term course of illness, compared with non-rapid cycling patients. (See <a href=\"#H92694551\" class=\"local\">'Course of illness'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The initial clinical evaluation of patients with a possible diagnosis of rapid cycling bipolar disorder includes a psychiatric and general medical history, mental status and physical examination, and focused laboratory tests. The psychiatric history should emphasize the number of mood episodes during the previous 12 months, as well as any previous 12-month period. (See <a href=\"#H81537325\" class=\"local\">'Assessment'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Rapid cycling bipolar disorder needs to be distinguished from borderline personality disorder.
