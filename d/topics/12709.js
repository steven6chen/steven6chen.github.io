It is caused by either alternating or synchronous contractions of antagonistic muscles. Tremor is the most common of all movement disorders, occurring from time to time in most normal individuals in the form of exaggerated physiologic tremor [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-tremor/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p>This topic will provide an overview of the classification, clinical features, diagnostic evaluation, and treatment of tremor, including essential tremor (ET), which also is discussed in greater detail separately.

The most common distinction is based on the activating conditions (ie, rest versus action), but other clinical characteristics, such as frequency and body distribution, also guide the evaluation and etiologic diagnosis. </p><p>A clinical and etiologic classification scheme has been proposed by the International Parkinson and Movement Disorder Society [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-tremor/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].

Kinetic tremors include:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Simple kinetic tremor, in which tremor is roughly the same throughout the course of a voluntary movement</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Intention tremor, characterized by a crescendo increase in tremor as the affected body part approaches its target</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Task-specific kinetic tremor, which occurs during a specific task such as writing</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Postural tremor occurs when a specific posture or position, such as holding the arms outstretched or while standing, is voluntarily maintained.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Isometric tremor occurs during muscle contraction against a stationary object, such as making a fist or squeezing an object.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3332699010\"><span class=\"h3\">Tremor frequency and body distribution</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Tremor frequency (oscillations per second) is used to describe tremor, although it is not particularly helpful in diagnosis as most pathologic tremors have a frequency of 4 to 8 Hertz (Hz) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-tremor/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. The most common subdivisions used for descriptive purposes are &lt;4, 4 to 8, 8 to 12, and &gt;12 Hz. Tremor frequency is typically estimated clinically but can be accurately measured using a motion transducer or electromyography (EMG).</p><p>The anatomic distribution of tremor can be classified as:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Focal (only one body region is affected, such as voice, head, jaw, or one limb)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Segmental (two or more contiguous body parts in the upper or lower body are affected, such as head and arm)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Hemitremor (one side of the body is affected)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Generalized (upper and lower body are affected)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3800391812\"><span class=\"h3\">Isolated versus combined</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Tremor syndromes are specific combinations of clinical signs and symptoms that commonly coexist. Syndromes can help narrow the search for an etiologic diagnosis. Syndromes may be <strong>isolated</strong>, when tremor is the only neurologic manifestation, or <strong>combined</strong>, when other systemic or neurologic signs coexist with the tremor [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-tremor/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Importantly, syndromes may have multiple etiologies, and a particular etiology may produce multiple clinical syndromes.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2844201041\"><span class=\"h2\">Etiology</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A vast number of diseases, disorders, medications, toxins, and substances cause tremor. Etiologies can be broadly classified as genetic, acquired, and idiopathic.</p><p>Some of the more common etiologies of resting and action tremors are listed in the table (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F68810\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef68810 \">table 2</a>). In addition to these, there are many uncommon or rare conditions that may be associated with tremor; most are action tremors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-tremor/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">REST TREMORS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Parkinson disease (PD) and other parkinsonian syndromes are the most common causes of rest tremor.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2334249582\"><span class=\"h2\">General features</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Rest tremor is evident with the affected body part fully supported against gravity, completely at rest, and temporarily dampened or abolished during voluntary activity. Rest tremors usually fluctuate in amplitude and may appear and disappear depending upon the degree of patient repose, whether the patient feels he or she is under observation, and other factors, including stress, excitement, or recent exercise.</p><p>Rest tremor is typically less disabling than postural or kinetic tremors because of its absence during voluntary activity. However, a rest tremor may quickly reappear as soon as the body part assumes a new resting or antigravity posture (a phenomenon referred to as &quot;re-emergent tremor&quot;), and in this case will interfere with the use of eating utensils, handwriting, typing, and other purposeful postures or movements. Rest tremor with these postural features is more of a handicap or disability than pure rest tremor, which is of mainly cosmetic concern.</p><p>Dystonic tremor is usually postural or task specific but it can occur at rest, in which state it tends to be jerky and irregular, unlike the smoother, more rhythmic pattern of the tremor of parkinsonism. (See <a href=\"#H1459912444\" class=\"local\">'Dystonic tremor'</a> below.)</p><p>On examination, when rest tremor is absent or minimally apparent, it usually can be activated or enhanced by having the patient walk or perform repetitive movements of the opposite limb.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Idiopathic Parkinson disease</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The rest tremor in PD typically appears first in one hand or less commonly in one leg. As the disease progresses, tremor may or may not spread from one hand to involve the ipsilateral leg <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> the contralateral arm. Tremor of the leg or foot is more commonly due to PD than to essential tremor (ET). The face, lips, and jaw may be involved but, unlike ET or cerebellar disease, PD only occasionally produces tremor of the entire head. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-of-parkinson-disease#H3\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations of Parkinson disease&quot;, section on 'Tremor'</a>.)</p><p>When the tremor is limited to distal muscles of the hand, it may produce a characteristic &quot;pill-rolling&quot; tremor, with a frequency of 4 to 6 Hertz (Hz). With increasing severity, the tremor may become more continuous, larger in amplitude, and more proximal in distribution, but the frequency remains constant.</p><p>Postural tremor may coexist with rest tremor or may be present by itself in some patients with PD, sometimes leading to an incorrect diagnosis of ET. (See <a href=\"#H9\" class=\"local\">'Essential tremor'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Tremor-dominant Parkinson disease</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A low-amplitude rest tremor of the hand or jaw, unaccompanied by other manifestations of parkinsonism, sometimes occurs as an isolated finding and may not progress to more generalized PD. However, tremor is such a common first sign of PD that it just as often leads the way to progressive and more disabling symptoms such as generalized bradykinesia, gait disturbance, and postural instability.</p><p>Patients can go years into their disease with tremor as the only or the most prominent sign of their illness. When this happens, this is referred to as &quot;tremor-dominant PD,&quot; although this designation is most reliably applied in retrospect, when the relatively benign course has already been charted.</p><p>Other disorders associated with rest tremor include Wilson disease, non-Wilsonian hepatocerebral degeneration, and thalamic or midbrain injury due to stroke, trauma, or demyelinating disease. Rest tremor may also occur as a &quot;spillover&quot; phenomenon in a variety of disorders in which very severe action tremors predominate, such as Wilson disease, severe forms of ET [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-tremor/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>], and other cerebellar or extrapyramidal syndromes.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H17610950\"><span class=\"h2\">Isolated rest tremor (SWEDD)</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The radiographic term &quot;SWEDD&quot; (Scans Without Evidence of Dopaminergic Deficit) has been used to designate patients with relatively isolated rest and action tremors of the arms, resembling early PD that failed to evolve over time into more generalized PD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-tremor/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. Unlike patients with PD, these individuals lack evidence for nigrostriatal dopamine deficiency on dopamine transporter imaging (DaTscan). Patients with SWEDD sometimes exhibit reduced arm swing and mild focal dystonia on the affected side, and may have jaw or head tremor or facial hypomimia, but no signs of parkinsonian bradykinesia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-tremor/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. They are therefore to be distinguished from individuals with tremor-dominant PD.

They include postural tremors, elicited during examination with the arms suspended against gravity in a fixed posture, and kinetic tremors, which emerge during the course of goal-directed activity (eg, drinking from a glass of water, pouring water from one cup into another, writing, and drawing of a spiral).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Physiologic tremor</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Normal individuals have a very low-amplitude, high-frequency physiologic tremor of approximately 10 to 12 Hertz (Hz). Physiologic tremor is usually not visible under ordinary circumstances, although some people have a natural proclivity to demonstrate mild, nondisabling physiologic tremulousness. Many factors can enhance the tremor to the point of detection, most often by increasing sympathetic activity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-tremor/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Common drugs that increase adrenergic activity include beta-adrenergic agonists such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=terbutaline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">terbutaline</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=isoproterenol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">isoproterenol</a>, epinephrine, amphetamines, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and tricyclic antidepressants, levodopa, nicotine, and xanthines such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=theophylline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">theophylline</a> and caffeine.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Anxiety, excitement, fright, muscle fatigue, hypoglycemia, alcohol and opioid withdrawal, thyrotoxicosis, fever, and pheochromocytoma also enhance adrenergic activity.

Thus, a medical rather than primary neurologic cause for action tremor should be considered in most cases.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h2\">Essential tremor</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Essential tremor (ET) is reviewed here briefly and is discussed in detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=essential-tremor-clinical-features-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Essential tremor: Clinical features and diagnosis&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=essential-tremor-treatment-and-prognosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Essential tremor: Treatment and prognosis&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=surgical-treatment-of-essential-tremor\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Surgical treatment of essential tremor&quot;</a>.)</p><p>ET is the most common neurologic disorder that causes action tremor, with an estimated prevalence worldwide of up to 5 percent of the population. The incidence of ET increases with age, although it often affects young individuals, especially when it is familial. A family history is present in 30 to 70 percent of cases, and evidence suggests an autosomal dominant pattern of inheritance with reduced penetrance. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=essential-tremor-clinical-features-and-diagnosis#H3607744139\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Essential tremor: Clinical features and diagnosis&quot;, section on 'Pathogenesis'</a>.)</p><p>ET varies from a low-amplitude, high-frequency postural tremor of the hands to a much larger amplitude postural and action tremor that is activated by particular postures and actions. ET most often affects the hands and arms and can be asymmetric. Less often, it may involve the head, voice, trunk, and legs. ET becomes immediately apparent in the arms when they are held outstretched; it typically increases at the very end of goal-directed movements such as drinking from a glass or finger-to-nose testing. Tremor in the legs is unusual in ET. Tremor of the head may be vertical (&quot;yes-yes&quot;) or horizontal (&quot;no-no&quot;) and is usually associated with tremor of the hand or voice. Rarely, ET manifests as an isolated tremor of the head. ET is typically relieved by small amounts of alcohol but, in contrast with physiologic tremor, is not usually aggravated by caffeine.</p><p>The diagnosis of ET is based upon clinical features (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F62078\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef62078 \">table 3</a>). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=essential-tremor-clinical-features-and-diagnosis#H2265415702\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Essential tremor: Clinical features and diagnosis&quot;, section on 'Evaluation and diagnosis'</a>.)</p><p>The main considerations in the differential diagnosis of ET are parkinsonian tremor, tremor caused by cerebellar disorders, and dystonic tremor. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=essential-tremor-clinical-features-and-diagnosis#H3715139944\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Essential tremor: Clinical features and diagnosis&quot;, section on 'Differential diagnosis'</a>.)</p><p>The most common differential diagnosis is with parkinsonian tremor (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F60694\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef60694 \">table 4</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F54735\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef54735 \">table 5</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F77497\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef77497 \">table 6</a>). Differentiation from classic resting tremor should be straightforward; however, some patients with Parkinson disease (PD) also have an action tremor indistinguishable from ET. In fact, it is not unusual for patients with PD to present with a postural tremor shortly before they display other signs of PD. Likewise, patients with severe ET may have a rest component to their tremor.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h2\">Primary writing tremor</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Many action tremors are particularly severe during the act of writing. Tremor that occurs exclusively while writing, and not during other voluntary motor activities, is referred to as &quot;primary writing tremor&quot; [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-tremor/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. This tremor is limited to the hand and causes relatively large-amplitude supination-pronation movements at a frequency of 5 to 6 Hz. The low frequency and large amplitude of the tremor, its frequent occurrence in writer's &quot;cramp&quot; or writer's dystonia, its relative resistance to <a href=\"topic.htm?path=propranolol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">propranolol</a>, and its occasional response to anticholinergic drugs suggest a closer relationship to dystonia than to ET. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=classification-and-evaluation-of-dystonia#H14\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Classification and evaluation of dystonia&quot;, section on 'Task-specific dystonia'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h2\">Orthostatic tremor</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Orthostatic tremor is a postural tremor limited to the legs and trunk, and occurs exclusively while standing [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-tremor/abstract/7-10\" class=\"abstract_t\">7-10</a>]. In two reports of 184 and 68 patients, there was a female predominance (64 and 77 percent, respectively) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-tremor/abstract/11,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,12</a>]. The mean age of onset was 54 and 59 years (range 13 to 85 years). Both high- and low-frequency orthostatic tremors have been described; their relationship to ET is uncertain. In cases of high-frequency tremor, movements of the legs may be so low in amplitude that they initially escape clinical detection. Orthostatic tremor is uniquely, but not always, responsive to treatment with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clonazepam-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">clonazepam</a>. (See <a href=\"#H22\" class=\"local\">'Treatment'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1715311942\"><span class=\"h2\">Intention tremor</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Intention tremor is a type of kinetic tremor that worsens over the course of goal-directed movement. Intention tremor is one of the more common tremors and is always associated with additional neurologic signs.</p><p>Intention tremor is due to disturbances anywhere along the path of the cerebellar outflow projection system from the dentate nucleus of the cerebellum to the motor division (ventral lateral nucleus) of the thalamus. The most common causes are multiple sclerosis, midbrain trauma, and stroke (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F68810\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef68810 \">table 2</a>). Heredodegenerative diseases of the cerebellum, severe forms of ET, Wilson disease, hepatocerebral degeneration, and mercury poisoning may also produce this tremor.</p><p>The tremor typically increases in severity as the hand moves closer to its target, in contrast to postural and other forms of kinetic tremor, which either remain constant throughout the range of motion or abruptly increase at terminal fixation. Intention tremors are usually very large in amplitude due to involvement of proximal muscles and are sometimes difficult to distinguish from severe cerebellar ataxia. The frequent association with ataxia, dysmetria, titubation, and other cerebellar signs serves to identify the cerebellar origin of intention tremor.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14\"><span class=\"h2\">Cerebellar tremor</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Cerebellar tremor is used to describe tremors that are caused by known cerebellar pathology. They can be postural, simple kinetic, or intention. In severe cases, they can spill over to also occur at rest. Tremor frequency is typically low (3 to 4 Hz) and can be associated with ataxia and dysmetria.</p><p>Titubation of the head and neck (&quot;to and fro&quot; movements) may be associated with cerebellar tremor; it is distinguished from essential head tremor by the presence of other cerebellar findings.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1904952248\"><span class=\"h2\">Rubral tremor</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Rubral tremor, sometimes called Holmes tremor after the early 20<sup>th</sup> century English neurologist who described it, is caused by midbrain, thalamic, cerebellar, or pontine injury [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-tremor/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. In many cases of rubral tremor, there are combined lesions that interrupt the outflow pathway from the cerebellum to the motor thalamus, often involving the superior cerebellar peduncle, substantia nigra, or red nucleus.</p><p>Rubral tremor is present at rest but tends to have a slower frequency (3 to 5 Hz) than typical Parkinson tremor (5 to 7 Hz). It also persists unchanged or increases with postural changes or goal-directed activity. It may produce a combination of rest, postural, simple kinetic, and intention tremors.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15\"><span class=\"h2\">Neuropathic tremor</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Postural or kinetic tremors are sometimes associated with large fiber peripheral neuropathy. This association is most commonly observed in hereditary neuropathies, during the recovery phase of some cases of Guillain-Barr&eacute; syndrome, and in chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy (CIDP). Muscle weakness and loss of proprioceptive or muscle spindle inputs may account for the tremor. The frequency and amplitude of neuropathic tremor may vary greatly when associated with a proprioceptive deficit. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-polyneuropathy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of polyneuropathy&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1459912444\"><span class=\"h2\">Dystonic tremor</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Dystonic tremor refers to tremor in a body part that is affected by dystonia. Because of the association with dystonia, dystonic tremor is an example of a combined tremor syndrome [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-tremor/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Common examples include dystonic head tremor and segmental tremulous dystonia of the head and upper limbs, which occur due to cervical dystonia. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=classification-and-evaluation-of-dystonia\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Classification and evaluation of dystonia&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Dystonic tremors are usually postural or task specific but sometimes occur at rest, in which state they tend to be jerky and irregular. The use of an alleviating maneuver (geste antagoniste, sensory trick) can be helpful in distinguishing dystonic tremor from other tremor syndromes, such as ET. In dystonic head tremor, for example, moving an arm to the face or head in a specific plane can alleviate the cervical dystonia symptoms, including head tremor. Exacerbation of dystonic tremor by an attempt to maintain certain postures can also be helpful in the examination.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H17\"><span class=\"h1\">FUNCTIONAL TREMORS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Functional tremor, also known as psychogenic tremor, is typically characterized by complex rest, postural, and kinetic tremor with abrupt onset, a static course, changeable features, functional disability out of proportion to tremor magnitude, and resistance to treatment. Any body part may be involved, but, remarkably, the fingers are often spared, with much of the tremor of the arm occurring at the wrist.</p><p>Other features of psychogenic movement disorders are often present, such as inconsistent display of symptoms and clinical features that are incongruous with known tremor syndromes. Examination usually shows variable tremor frequency or tremor entrainment (ie, shift of tremor frequency to the speed of contralateral finger tapping), especially with distraction maneuvers such as repetitive tapping tasks with an uninvolved opposite hand or foot. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=functional-movement-disorders#H398881631\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Functional movement disorders&quot;, section on 'Functional tremor'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H18\"><span class=\"h1\">EVALUATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The diagnostic approach to patients with tremor involves the history, physical examination, and selected laboratory studies. Action tremor is most common and, of these, essential tremor (ET) and enhanced physiologic tremor are the most frequent diagnoses [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-tremor/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. Patients with tremor due to other disorders such as hyperthyroidism, Parkinson disease (PD), dystonia, Wilson disease, or drugs frequently have additional signs or symptoms that help point to the diagnosis, although this is not always the case. The criteria for ET (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F62078\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef62078 \">table 3</a>) and methods for distinguishing it from other tremors are shown in the tables (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F72091\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef72091 \">table 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F68810\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef68810 \">table 2</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F60694\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef60694 \">table 4</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F54735\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef54735 \">table 5</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F77497\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef77497 \">table 6</a>).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H19\"><span class=\"h2\">History</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The history concerning the age of onset and evolution of tremor is usually straightforward, since it is a highly visible symptom that is readily evident to the patient and family members. Examination of previous handwriting samples may be useful in determining the precise time of onset.</p><p>Precipitating, aggravating, or relieving factors such as caffeine, alcohol, medications, exercise, fatigue, or stress should be elicited; a complete list of all medications should be reviewed to exclude the possibility of enhanced physiologic tremor. (See <a href=\"#H8\" class=\"local\">'Physiologic tremor'</a> above.)</p><p>Family history in ET reflects an autosomal dominant pattern of inheritance in approximately half of all patients. Parkinsonian tremor is usually sporadic, but a family history of PD is present in approximately 15 percent of cases; the disease affects first-degree relatives (parents, siblings, or offspring) in approximately half of the familial cases. Autosomal PD affecting three or more generations is rare.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H20\"><span class=\"h2\">Examination</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A detailed neurologic examination is important to identify specific features of the tremor (including its frequency, amplitude, pattern, and body distribution), activating conditions, and other neurologic findings, if present [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-tremor/abstract/1,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,15</a>].</p><p>Examination begins with observations of the tremor during the interview. Due to stress, many patients with tremor are more symptomatic during the early part of the examination than after they become acclimated to the doctor-patient encounter. Patients should be observed sitting, lying down (with the affected body part fully supported), and walking. Horizontal or vertical head tremor is usually associated with tremor elsewhere. Isolated head tremor should raise the possibility of cervical dystonia or midline cerebellar syndromes. Localized face, jaw, and lip tremors are more commonly a manifestation of parkinsonism. Essential voice tremor is readily audible and may be further enhanced by having the patient hold a prolonged note.</p><p>Tremor in the arm is observed with the affected limb fully supported on the patient's lap or the arm of a chair, with the limb elevated against gravity, and during goal-directed movements. Most resting tremors cease with changes in limb posture but may reappear following repositioning to another fixed posture, especially when held outstretched against gravity, referred to as &quot;re-emergent tremor.&quot; Parkinsonian tremor, in contrast with ET, is usually activated by repetitive movements of the opposite hand, during walking, and during mental distraction such as reciting the months of the year backwards.</p><p>Postural and kinetic tremors are best elicited with the arms held outstretched; with the shoulders abducted, elbows flexed, and index fingers held an inch apart in front of the face; during finger-to-nose maneuvers; and while drinking or pouring from a paper cup. Writing and drawing may demonstrate the large, tremulous, angulated loops of ET or the micrographia of parkinsonism. A drawing sample of a spiral is commonly used to evaluate ET severity and can be repeated and compared over time. Having the patient draw a spiral with the hand suspended above the table increases the sensitivity of this test.</p><p>Tremor of the leg should be assessed with the limb at rest, during heel-to-shin testing, and while standing and walking. Leg tremor is more commonly due to parkinsonism than ET.</p><p>The gait is almost always normal in patients with ET, while it is characteristically narrow-based and shuffling in PD and wide-based and ataxic in cerebellar disorders. The gait may have histrionic qualities in patients with psychogenic tremor.</p><p>Frequency of tremor should be estimated at rest and during postural and action maneuvers. Frequency varies depending on cause:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>High for enhanced physiologic tremor (10 to 12 Hertz [Hz]) and orthostatic tremor (14 to 20 Hz)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Medium to high for ET (6 to 12 Hz)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Low to medium for the resting tremor of parkinsonism (4 to 6 Hz)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Low for rubral (Holmes) tremor (3 to 5 Hz)</p><p/><p>Functional tremors tend to vary in frequency as well as amplitude from moment to moment and either become more irregular or subside entirely when the patient is distracted by performing a complex, repetitive motor task with the contralateral limb. (See <a href=\"#H17\" class=\"local\">'Functional tremors'</a> above.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H21\"><span class=\"h2\">Laboratory studies</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The routine laboratory evaluation of tremor should include tests of thyroid function, diagnostic studies to exclude Wilson disease, and screening for heavy metal poisoning such as mercury or arsenic if an environmental cause is suspected. Wilson disease should be suspected in anyone under age 40 who has tremor or other involuntary movement or posture [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-tremor/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>] (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=wilson-disease-diagnostic-tests\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Wilson disease: Diagnostic tests&quot;</a>). Hypoglycemia and pheochromocytoma may need to be ruled out in patients with enhanced physiologic tremor.</p><p>Brain imaging can be useful in patients suspected clinically of having a structural cause for tremor, such as Wilson disease, brain trauma, stroke, or mass lesion, but is otherwise usually not indicated.</p><p>Quantitative computerized analysis of tremor is available in some tertiary care facilities, but its ability to reliably distinguish between tremor types has not been established.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H22\"><span class=\"h1\">TREATMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The treatment of tremor is symptomatic, and some forms lack any useful pharmacologic therapy. Even medications known to have some benefit for certain tremor syndromes usually have only partial effect. For combined tremor syndromes, treatment of the underlying disorder is the primary approach.</p><p>Physical and occupational therapy may be of benefit to help identify coping mechanisms and compensatory strategies. In patients with refractory or disabling tremor, the approach should be individualized according to the underlying cause. In addition to medications, some patients may be candidates for surgical therapies.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Rest tremor, such as that associated with Parkinson disease (PD) or other parkinsonian disorders, is managed by treatment of the underlying disorder, typically with antiparkinson agents such as anticholinergic drugs, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=amantadine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">amantadine</a>, dopamine agonists, levodopa, and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=zonisamide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">zonisamide</a>. Deep brain stimulation (DBS) is an option for some patients with refractory tremor due to advanced PD. This topic is discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pharmacologic-treatment-of-parkinson-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pharmacologic treatment of Parkinson disease&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=device-assisted-and-surgical-treatments-for-parkinson-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Device-assisted and surgical treatments for Parkinson disease&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Enhanced physiologic tremor is best managed by reduction or removal of the responsible offending medication or toxin; diagnosis and treatment of possible associated endocrine disorders; and dealing with stress, anxiety, or fatigue (see <a href=\"#H8\" class=\"local\">'Physiologic tremor'</a> above). Single doses of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=propranolol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">propranolol</a>, a short-acting beta blocker, taken in anticipation of social situations that are likely to exacerbate tremor (eg, as with tremor associated with public speaking) are useful in some patients.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Essential tremor (ET) can be treated pharmacologically. <a href=\"topic.htm?path=propranolol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Propranolol</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=primidone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">primidone</a> are the most effective and well-studied medications for the treatment of ET, and when used together they sometimes have an additive effect. Both DBS and unilateral thalamotomy are effective for the treatment of medically refractory ET. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=essential-tremor-treatment-and-prognosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Essential tremor: Treatment and prognosis&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=surgical-treatment-of-essential-tremor\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Surgical treatment of essential tremor&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Orthostatic tremor is limited to the legs and trunk and occurs exclusively while standing (see <a href=\"#H13\" class=\"local\">'Orthostatic tremor'</a> above). In one retrospective case series of 184 patients with orthostatic tremor, treatment with benzodiazepines, mainly <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clonazepam-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">clonazepam</a>, was associated with moderate or marked relief in approximately one-third of the patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-tremor/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. Other medications, such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=gabapentin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">gabapentin</a>, were associated with even lower rates of improvement. Limited evidence suggests that some patients with medically refractory orthostatic tremor show modest improvement with DBS of the ventral intermediate nucleus of the thalamus [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-tremor/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Cerebellar tremor lacks any useful pharmacotherapy. The rare patient with severe intention tremor and little or no ataxia, such as sometimes occurs in multiple sclerosis, may be helped by DBS of the ventral intermediate nucleus of the thalamus.
