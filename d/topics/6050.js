Endosalpingiosis may occur in pelvic organs, including ovaries, fallopian tube serosa, uterine serosa, myometrium, or pelvic peritoneum. It may also occur in the bladder or in a retroperitoneal or axillary lymph node [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endosalpingiosis/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p>Endosalpingiosis is not well-studied, and the clinical features remain uncertain. It has been reported to be associated with pelvic pain, infertility, pelvic mass, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> urinary symptoms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endosalpingiosis/abstract/3-6\" class=\"abstract_t\">3-6</a>]. However, the diagnosis is made only after surgical biopsy. A key challenge regarding this condition is to differentiate it clinically from endometriosis.</p><p>Another notable feature of endosalpingiosis is its histologic relationship to pelvic serous neoplasms (eg, lesions of low malignant potential, low-grade pelvic serous carcinoma). However, the role of endosalpingiosis as a risk factor or as part of the pathogenesis of these conditions is unknown.</p><p>The pathology, diagnosis, and management of endosalpingiosis will be reviewed here. Topics regarding endometriosis are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=endometriosis-pathogenesis-clinical-features-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Endometriosis: Pathogenesis, clinical features, and diagnosis&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=endometriosis-treatment-of-pelvic-pain\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Endometriosis: Treatment of pelvic pain&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H111310458\"><span class=\"h1\">EPIDEMIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The prevalence of endosalpingiosis is difficult to establish. There are few data regarding this condition. In addition, endosalpingiosis is diagnosed only through surgical biopsy, so it is unknown if there are asymptomatic cases. It appears that in approximately one-third of cases, patient have coexisting endosalpingiosis and endometriosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endosalpingiosis/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. </p><p>In one series of 110 cases of endosalpingiosis, the median age at diagnosis was 50 years; 40 percent of women were postmenopausal [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endosalpingiosis/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. Thirty-one percent of the women were nulliparous, and 34 percent had a history of tubal disease. In 65 percent of the cases, endosalpingiosis occurred without endometriosis, and in 35 percent of cases, both endosalpingiosis and endometriosis were present. </p><p>In another series of 838 patients with endosalpingiosis, the median age was 52 years; 59 percent were postmenopausal. Twenty-seven percent were nulliparous, and 37 percent had two or more risk factors for tubal insult or inflammation. In 313 (37 percent) cases, there was evidence of concurrent endosalpingiosis and endometriosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endosalpingiosis/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].</p><p>In this same study, the 838 patients with endosalpingiosis were compared with the patients without endosalpingiosis (n = 57,323), who all underwent gynecologic surgery at the same institution in the same time period, and concurrent endometriosis was observed more frequently in women with endosalpingiosis than without (37.4 versus 13.4 percent, p &lt;0.0001). Women with endosalpingiosis were also more likely to be diagnosed with ovarian cancer (21 versus 8.4 percent, p &lt;0.0001) and uterine cancer (17.7 versus 10.4 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endosalpingiosis/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15244750\"><span class=\"h1\">HISTOPATHOLOGY AND PATHOGENESIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Endosalpingiosis is the presence at ectopic sites of ciliated cells, secretory cells, and intercalated cells similar to those seen in the normal fallopian tube epithelium [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endosalpingiosis/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. Endosalpingiosis lesions and normal fallopian tube epithelium express similar biomarkers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endosalpingiosis/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].</p><p>As noted above, endosalpingiosis may occur in female reproductive organs, including ovaries, fallopian tube serosa, uterine serosa, myometrium, or pelvic peritoneum. It may also occur in the bladder or in a retroperitoneal or axillary lymph node [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endosalpingiosis/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p>Similar to endometriosis, endosalpingiosis is thought to arise in ectopic locations either through metaplasia or ectopic transport. In addition, transplantation of ciliated fallopian tube cells to peritoneal surfaces may occur as a result of surgical intervention on the tubes or ovary [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endosalpingiosis/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. Interestingly, in one series, three women with endosalpingiosis alone at time of initial diagnosis were found to also have endometriosis at a subsequent surgery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endosalpingiosis/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].</p><p>Endosalpingiosis can occur as an isolated pathologic finding, or it can be associated with foci of endometriosis or endocervicosis. Some experts have proposed the term &ldquo;Mullerianosis&rdquo; to describe the co-occurrence of endosalpingiosis, endometriosis, and endocervicosis (cells resembling the endocervical cells on the peritoneal surface) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endosalpingiosis/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p>Endosalpingiosis differs from endometriosis in that it has ciliated glandular elements and no endometrial stroma. Small vesicles of endometriosis and endosalpingiosis can have a similar surgical appearance, presenting as small vesicular cystic lesions that are clear, white, or tan in color.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H894865808\"><span class=\"h2\">Relationship to pelvic serous neoplasms</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Endosalpingiosis is one of a group of peritoneal serous lesions that include peritoneal borderline serous tumors and low-grade serous neoplasms. It can be challenging to differentiate between the three lesions when only a small biopsy is provided or a large specimen is under-sampled [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endosalpingiosis/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].</p><p>Some data suggest that endosalpingiosis is more common in women with <em>BRCA</em> mutations. This was reported in one study that found endosalpingiosis in 86 percent of <em>BRCA </em>carriers undergoing risk-reducing salpingo-oophorectomy compared with 56 percent of women at low risk of ovarian cancer undergoing salpingo-oophorectomy for other indications [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endosalpingiosis/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>].</p><p>Endosalpingiosis has been found concurrently with pelvic serous neoplasms. In a series of 110 cases of endosalpingiosis, endometrial adenocarcinoma was also present in 16 percent and serous borderline ovarian tumors in 7 percent of cases. Among the women with borderline ovarian tumors, concurrent endosalpingiosis was identified on the ovary (37 percent), fallopian tube (21 percent), omentum (9 percent) and uterine serosa (7 percent), and other sites including the uterovesical reflection, lymph nodes, cervix, bladder, peritoneum, and appendix [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endosalpingiosis/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. A large series of endosalpingiosis cases (n = 838) reported that patients with endosalpingiosis were more likely to have serous borderline tumors (odds ratio [OR] 10.2, 95% CI 5.1-20.7) as compared to a population control group of ovarian cancer cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endosalpingiosis/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. Interestingly, we also found that patients with endosalpingiosis also had an increased odds of clear cell (OR 3.0, 95% CI 1.1-8.0) and invasive mucinous tumors (OR 5.0, 95% CI 1.5-6.6) compared to the control group even after accounting for age, race, menopausal status, parity, tubal ligation, and endometriosis.</p><p>If endosalpingiosis is found or suspected at surgery, the pelvic organs should be inspected for other lesions, as is routine at time of pelvic surgery and with the detection of a new lesions. It doesn&rsquo;t appear that women diagnosed with endometriosis require further postoperative evaluation or malignancy or are at a higher risk for malignancy. There have been no reports of peritoneal serous carcinomas in patients previously diagnosed with endosalpingiosis.</p><p>The histopathology of pelvic serous neoplasms is discussed in detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epithelial-carcinoma-of-the-ovary-fallopian-tube-and-peritoneum-histopathology\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Epithelial carcinoma of the ovary, fallopian tube, and peritoneum: Histopathology&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H894865660\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL FEATURES AND EVALUATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Endosalpingiosis is seldom suspected preoperatively and is typically diagnosed incidentally in women undergoing surgery for pelvic pain, infertility, urinary symptoms, or a pelvic mass. This is for several reasons: (1) the incidence is unclear; (2) preoperative symptoms and findings have not been well-studied; (3) many clinicians are not familiar with it; and (4) it is often found concurrently with endometriosis, so it is unclear which symptoms are caused by endosalpingiosis alone.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H894866105\"><span class=\"h2\">Clinical manifestations</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Endosalpingiosis has been associated with pelvic pain, infertility, urinary symptoms, and, rarely, cystic pelvic masses.</p><p>It is not clear if endosalpingiosis causes pelvic pain or is an incidental histologic finding in women with pelvic pain [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endosalpingiosis/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. The observation that some women with chronic pelvic pain have endosalpingiosis in the absence of endometriosis suggests that endosalpingiosis may be a cause of pelvic pain.</p><p>In several case series, endosalpingiosis was identified at laparoscopy performed for the diagnosis and treatment of pelvic pain [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endosalpingiosis/abstract/3-5\" class=\"abstract_t\">3-5</a>]. The largest comparative study to evaluate the clinical presentation of endosalpingiosis was a retrospective series that compared 72 women with endosalpingiosis alone (without concurrent endometriosis) with two other groups, those with endometriosis alone and general gynecology patients (no endosalpingiosis or endometriosis) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endosalpingiosis/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. Endosalpingiosis was significantly associated with dysmenorrhea, but not with chronic pelvic pain or infertility.</p><p>Women with bladder endosalpingiosis may present with hematuria, dysuria, pelvic pain [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endosalpingiosis/abstract/12-15\" class=\"abstract_t\">12-15</a>]. Hematuria is typically what brings the patient to medical attention.</p><p>Rarely, endosalpingiosis presents as large, tumor-like cystic masses involving the uterine serosa (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F97898\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef97898 \">figure 1</a>) or bladder epithelium (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F97900\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef97900 \">picture 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endosalpingiosis/abstract/9,16\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,16</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H894866111\"><span class=\"h2\">Evaluation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The preoperative evaluation for endosalpingiosis has not been established. Based upon the current understanding of the condition, the evaluation should be the same as for endometriosis or other conditions associated with pelvic pain, urinary symptoms, or pelvic mass. This should include a medical history, pelvic examination, and pelvic imaging. However, as noted, the diagnosis is made with surgical biopsy. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-of-chronic-pelvic-pain-in-women\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation of chronic pelvic pain in women&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=endometriosis-pathogenesis-clinical-features-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Endometriosis: Pathogenesis, clinical features, and diagnosis&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=endometriosis-of-the-bladder-and-ureter\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Endometriosis of the bladder and ureter&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=approach-to-the-patient-with-an-adnexal-mass\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Approach to the patient with an adnexal mass&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Imaging findings that are specific for pelvic endosalpingiosis have not been identified. On bladder ultrasound, the bladder lesions are often 1 to 4 cm in size and have prominent vascular signals on Doppler imaging [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endosalpingiosis/abstract/12-15,17-19\" class=\"abstract_t\">12-15,17-19</a>]. Urinalysis or cystoscopy may be performed if indicated for evaluation of dysuria or hematuria. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=etiology-and-evaluation-of-hematuria-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Etiology and evaluation of hematuria in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Surgical exploration and biopsy are the key diagnostic procedures. Endosalpingiosis lesions vary in size [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endosalpingiosis/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. A large lesion is shown in the image (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F97898\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef97898 \">figure 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F111825\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef111825 \">picture 2</a>). Endosalpingiosis can also appear as smaller, cystic blebs on the peritoneum and on pelvic and abdominal surfaces that are clear to white in color.</p><p>Endosalpingiosis is a difficult pathologic diagnosis, and the specimen is often sent to a consultant pathologist who has expertise in this diagnosis.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H894864981\"><span class=\"h1\">DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Endosalpingiosis is a histologic diagnosis based upon tissue biopsies obtained during surgery for pelvic pain, infertility, or the evaluation of a pelvic cystic lesion identified on an imaging study. Typically, this is at time of laparoscopy for endometriosis, oophorectomy, salpingectomy, or hysterectomy.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15244871\"><span class=\"h1\">DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The differential diagnosis of endosalpingiosis includes primarily endometriosis, but also other conditions associated with pelvic pain, infertility, urinary symptoms, or pelvic mass. This includes vesicles or tumor-like lesions of the peritoneum including endometriosis, ovarian cortical inclusion cysts, peritoneal inclusion cysts, peritoneal borderline serous tumors, and low-grade serous ovarian tumors. The differentiation is made solely based upon the histologic diagnosis, since the clinical characteristics of endosalpingiosis may overlap with other peritoneal lesions.</p><p>In addition, endosalpingiosis must be differentiated from mesothelioma. The diagnosis is by histology, and on histology, the two entities are easy to differentiate, particularly with use of immunohistochemistry. Mesothelioma will stain positive for calretinin and negative for PAX8, while endosalpingiosis will stain positive for PAX8 and negative for calretinin [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endosalpingiosis/abstract/21,22\" class=\"abstract_t\">21,22</a>].</p><p>These conditions are discussed in detail separately.

The clinical profile of the condition and the frequency with which these lesions are found concurrent with endometriosis suggests that the treatment should be the same as endometriosis.</p><p>In general, for all sites, there appears to be a high recurrence rate unless the endosalpingiosis tissue is completely removed. In some cases, this may result in an extensive resection. The surgeon needs to balance the goal of complete excision against the risks of surgical morbidity, particularly as the link to pelvic pain, infertility, and its relationship to pelvic neoplasms is not well understood.</p><p>Regarding pelvic pain, the only study to evaluate treatment was a series of 15 women with pelvic pain found to have endosalpingiosis (with no endometriosis), in whom symptoms were controlled with treatments used for endometriosis, including hormonal treatment (oral contraceptives, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=danazol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">danazol</a>, gonadotropin releasing hormone agonist) and repeat surgery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endosalpingiosis/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].</p><p>For women with pelvic pain and endosalpingiosis alone or with concurrent endometriosis lesions, we suggest management with the standard treatments for endometriosis, such as estrogen-progestin contraceptive treatment or progestin treatment with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=norethindrone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">norethindrone</a> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=medroxyprogesterone-acetate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">medroxyprogesterone acetate</a>. Before initiating therapy with an endocrine treatment that has considerable side effects, such as a gonadotropin releasing hormone analogue, a careful review of other possible causes of pain should be made. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=endometriosis-treatment-of-pelvic-pain\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Endometriosis: Treatment of pelvic pain&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Regarding infertility, the association with endosalpingiosis is uncertain and there are no studies regarding treatment in this clinical context. In our practice, we treat infertility and endosalpingiosis alone (without endometriosis) with standard fertility interventions for women with unexplained infertility. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatments-for-female-infertility\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatments for female infertility&quot;</a>.)</p><p>For women with a bladder tumor proven to be endosalpingiosis, removal of the mass in its entirety will typically be curative. Partial removal of the tumor will often result in continued growth. Small vesicular lesions of endosalpingiosis on the peritoneum often do not grow significantly over long-term follow-up.</p><p>If endosalpingiosis is identified in a woman with a gynecologic malignancy, appropriate treatment should be given for the malignancy and no changes in treatment are made based upon the presence of the endosalpingiosis.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"PATIENT_INFORMATION\"><span class=\"h1\">INFORMATION FOR PATIENTS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>UpToDate offers two types of patient education materials, &quot;The Basics&quot; and &quot;Beyond the Basics.&quot; The Basics patient education pieces are written in plain language, at the 5<sup>th</sup> to 6<sup>th</sup> grade reading level, and they answer the four or five key questions a patient might have about a given condition.
