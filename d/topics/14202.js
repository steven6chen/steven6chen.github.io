The type of surgery depends on tumor stage and location within the rectum. Superficially invasive, small cancers may be effectively managed with limited surgery, such as local excision. However, most patients have more deeply invasive tumors that require low anterior resection (LAR) or, in some cases, if located distally, abdominoperineal resection (APR). Locally advanced tumors that are adherent or fixed to adjoining structures (eg, sacrum, pelvic sidewalls, prostate, or bladder) require more extensive surgery. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=rectal-cancer-surgical-principles#H87588997\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Rectal cancer: Surgical principles&quot;, section on 'Selecting a surgical treatment'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-locally-recurrent-rectal-adenocarcinoma\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of locally recurrent rectal adenocarcinoma&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=rectal-cancer-surgical-techniques\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Rectal cancer: Surgical techniques&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The combination of adjuvant radiation therapy (RT) plus chemotherapy can enhance local control and cure rates in patients with either transmural invasion <span class=\"nowrap\">(T3/T4)</span> or metastatic lymph nodes (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F72913\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef72913 \">table 1</a>). Such therapy is often administered preoperatively. The more favorable long-term toxicity profile and better local control of preoperative as compared with postoperative chemoradiotherapy for transmural or node-positive rectal cancer was shown in the seminal German Rectal Cancer Study Group Trial. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=adjuvant-therapy-for-resected-rectal-adenocarcinoma\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Adjuvant therapy for resected rectal adenocarcinoma&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=neoadjuvant-chemoradiotherapy-and-radiotherapy-for-rectal-adenocarcinoma#H13\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy and radiotherapy for rectal adenocarcinoma&quot;, section on 'German Rectal Cancer Study'</a>.)</p><p>Although there is not universal agreement, neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy is generally considered for <span class=\"nowrap\">T3/4</span> and clinically node-positive <span class=\"nowrap\">T1/2</span> tumors (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F72913\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef72913 \">table 1</a>), distal rectal tumors (ie, tumors within 5 cm of the anal verge (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F62539\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef62539 \">figure 1</a>)) for which an abdominoperineal resection is thought to be necessary, and tumors that appear to invade or are in close proximity to the mesorectal fascia on preoperative imaging because of the decreased likelihood of achieving a tumor-free circumferential resection margin with upfront surgery.

Locoregional tumor staging is mainly accomplished through physical examination, endoscopy, computed tomography (CT) scans, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and transrectal ultrasound (TRUS).</p><p>This topic review will cover the preoperative local staging evaluation of patients with rectal cancer. The clinical presentation, diagnosis, and staging evaluation of patients with newly diagnosed colorectal cancer, the surgical treatment of rectal cancer, neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy and RT for rectal cancer, adjuvant therapy following resection for rectal cancer, management of locally advanced unresectable disease, and recommendations for posttreatment surveillance are discussed elsewhere.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-presentation-diagnosis-and-staging-of-colorectal-cancer\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical presentation, diagnosis, and staging of colorectal cancer&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=rectal-cancer-surgical-techniques\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Rectal cancer: Surgical techniques&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=neoadjuvant-chemoradiotherapy-and-radiotherapy-for-rectal-adenocarcinoma\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy and radiotherapy for rectal adenocarcinoma&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=adjuvant-therapy-for-resected-rectal-adenocarcinoma\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Adjuvant therapy for resected rectal adenocarcinoma&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-locally-recurrent-rectal-adenocarcinoma\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of locally recurrent rectal adenocarcinoma&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=surveillance-after-colorectal-cancer-resection\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Surveillance after colorectal cancer resection&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H624796\"><span class=\"h1\">SURGICAL ANATOMY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Many surgical descriptions refer to the distance of a rectal cancer from the anal verge. The upper extent of the rectum is typically defined as 12 cm from the anal verge (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F62539\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef62539 \">figure 1</a>). However, the anal verge is a nonreproducible landmark; a more reliable landmark is the dentate line, the point at which the squamous mucosa of the anus transitions to the columnar mucosa of the rectum. The dentate line is usually located in the middle of the anorectal ring (the muscles of which are responsible for fecal continence). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=rectal-cancer-surgical-principles#H87588311\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Rectal cancer: Surgical principles&quot;, section on 'Surgical anatomy'</a>.) </p><p>If sphincter preservation is to be achieved, the tumor has to be located high enough above the top of the anorectal ring to allow for an adequate distal margin. This is more likely with midrectal and upper rectal tumors than for distal tumors, particularly those that impinge upon or invade the sphincter complex. Preoperative chemoradiotherapy may enhance the ability to perform sphincter preservation in some patients with low-lying tumors. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=rectal-cancer-surgical-techniques#H1845484\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Rectal cancer: Surgical techniques&quot;, section on 'Sphincter-sparing procedures'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=neoadjuvant-chemoradiotherapy-and-radiotherapy-for-rectal-adenocarcinoma#H6\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy and radiotherapy for rectal adenocarcinoma&quot;, section on 'Distal tumors'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">HISTORY, PHYSICAL EXAMINATION, AND ENDOSCOPY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The initial history should include the status of rectal and urinary function, as well as sexual function in males [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pretreatment-local-staging-evaluation-for-rectal-cancer/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p>When present, specific symptoms may assist in localizing the tumor and predicting its local extent. Tenesmus, the constant sensation of needing to move the bowels, usually indicates a large and possibly fixed stage II or III cancer (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F72913\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef72913 \">table 1</a>). Pain with defecation suggests involvement of the distal lower third of the rectum; most cancers located above the sphincters are painless. Very painful cancers growing directly into the anal sphincter that affect the very sensitive anal mucosa are usually not amenable to sphincter-sparing surgery. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-presentation-diagnosis-and-staging-of-colorectal-cancer#H2\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical presentation, diagnosis, and staging of colorectal cancer&quot;, section on 'Clinical presentation'</a>.)</p><p>On digital rectal examination (DRE), fixation of the lesion to the anal sphincter, its relationship to the anorectal ring (the collection of muscles that make up the sphincters), and fixation to both the rectal wall and the pelvic wall muscles (levators) can be assessed.</p><p>Rigid rather than flexible sigmoidoscopy can most accurately determine the distance between the distal tumor margin, the top of the anorectal ring, and the dentate line as well as the orientation within the rectum (eg, anterior, posterior, left, and right).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8260590\"><span class=\"h2\">Complete colonoscopy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Because of the incidence of synchronous second primary colorectal cancers (approximately 3 to 5 percent), all patients should undergo complete colonoscopy prior to surgical resection, whenever feasible. If malignant obstruction precludes a full colonoscopy preoperatively, it should be performed at a later time. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=surveillance-after-colorectal-cancer-resection#H21\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Surveillance after colorectal cancer resection&quot;, section on 'Diagnosing second cancers and polyps'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h1\">IMAGING EVALUATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Following the initial history and physical examination, digital rectal examination (DRE), rigid sigmoidoscopy, and colonoscopy, preoperative imaging studies assist in determining the optimal surgical approach and in identifying patients who are candidates for preoperative radiation therapy (RT) or chemoradiotherapy. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=neoadjuvant-chemoradiotherapy-and-radiotherapy-for-rectal-adenocarcinoma#H2\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy and radiotherapy for rectal adenocarcinoma&quot;, section on 'Indications for neoadjuvant treatment'</a>.)</p><p>Rectal cancer imaging has become more critical in staging since the order and types of treatment are often based upon pretreatment staging as determined by imaging. However, some modalities may confuse the decision-making and treatment process if they overstage a significant number of patients. The following sections will focus on available locoregional staging modalities. The pretreatment clinical staging evaluation to evaluate for distant disease (ie, chest computed tomography [CT], liver magnetic resonance imaging [MRI], positron emission tomography [PET] scan), and the role of serum tumor markers are discussed elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-presentation-diagnosis-and-staging-of-colorectal-cancer#H14\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical presentation, diagnosis, and staging of colorectal cancer&quot;, section on 'Clinical staging evaluation'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-presentation-diagnosis-and-staging-of-colorectal-cancer#H109741268\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical presentation, diagnosis, and staging of colorectal cancer&quot;, section on 'Tumor markers'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">CT scans</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>computed tomography (CT) scanning is a helpful modality for staging distant metastatic spread and for identifying tumor-related complications (eg, perforation, fistula formation) but provides only limited local tumor (T) stage and nodal (N) staging information [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pretreatment-local-staging-evaluation-for-rectal-cancer/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>].</p><p>When examining advanced disease, CT determines T stage with an accuracy of 79 to 94 percent; this falls to 52 to 74 percent when less advanced smaller tumors are analyzed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pretreatment-local-staging-evaluation-for-rectal-cancer/abstract/3-6\" class=\"abstract_t\">3-6</a>]. The sensitivity of CT for detecting perirectal nodal involvement depends on the size criteria used to define a node as potentially malignant. In one study, at a minor axis length cutoff level of 6 mm, the sensitivity of multidetector row CT for mesorectal lymph nodes was only 49 percent, although specificity was 92 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pretreatment-local-staging-evaluation-for-rectal-cancer/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. Sensitivity was higher (78 percent) for lateral pelvic lymph node metastases using the same cutoff of 6 mm. The positive and negative predictive values using 6 mm for the short axis cutoff were 100 and 94 percent for the lateral lymph nodes; they were less (86 and 64 percent, respectively) for mesorectal nodes.</p><p>While sensitivity for perirectal nodal disease is less for CT than for transrectal endoscopic ultrasound or MRI, the sensitivity of CT for detection of malignant lymph nodes is higher for rectal than it is for colon cancers. Any perirectal adenopathy is presumed to be malignant since benign adenopathy is not seen in this area. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-presentation-diagnosis-and-staging-of-colorectal-cancer#H14\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical presentation, diagnosis, and staging of colorectal cancer&quot;, section on 'Clinical staging evaluation'</a> and <a href=\"#H10\" class=\"local\">'MRI scan'</a> below and <a href=\"#H6103151\" class=\"local\">'Assessing T and N stage, and the status of the CRM'</a> below.)</p><p>The finding of limited liver metastases does not necessarily alter the surgical approach to the primary, particularly in symptomatic patients (eg, bleeding, impending obstruction). Although the optimal timing is debated for patients who present with synchronous metastases, hepatic resection may be curative, with five-year relapse-free survival rates of up to 40 percent. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-potentially-resectable-colorectal-cancer-liver-metastases#H18\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of potentially resectable colorectal cancer liver metastases&quot;, section on 'Timing of hepatectomy in patients presenting with metastases'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=locoregional-methods-for-management-and-palliation-in-patients-who-present-with-stage-iv-colorectal-cancer#H5\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Locoregional methods for management and palliation in patients who present with stage IV colorectal cancer&quot;, section on 'Management of the primary cancer'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6103151\"><span class=\"h2\">Assessing T and N stage, and the status of the CRM</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The two imaging modalities that are most useful for locoregional tumor staging are transrectal ultrasound (TRUS) and MRI. Both are more accurate than axial CT scans for assessing the depth of tumor invasion, nodal (N) staging, and predicting the circumferential resection margin (CRM).</p><p>The regional lymph nodes for rectal cancer are outlined in the table (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F51172\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef51172 \">table 2</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pretreatment-local-staging-evaluation-for-rectal-cancer/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. Extraregional lymph nodes are staged as metastatic disease. However, there is some confusion about the way the American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) defines regional nodes for rectal cancers. Lateral sacral nodes probably refer to obturator nodes that are just outside the hypogastric plexus; these nodes are positive in approximately 8 percent of distal rectal cancers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pretreatment-local-staging-evaluation-for-rectal-cancer/abstract/9,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,10</a>]. It is our impression that iliac, presacral, and sacral promontory nodes refer to nodes in the mesorectum but close to the lateral pelvic sidewall or sacrum, respectively, and not separate nodal groups outside of the mesorectum. There are rare exceptions in very advanced tumors. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=rectal-cancer-surgical-principles#H87588332\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Rectal cancer: Surgical principles&quot;, section on 'Venous and lymphatic drainage'</a>.)</p><p>Involvement of the CRM, also called the lateral or radial margin, is an important independent prognostic factor in rectal cancer. Tumors that involve the CRM have a higher rate of pelvic recurrence after surgery alone, even after a total mesorectal excision (TME), and are at a higher risk for distant metastases and inferior survival [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pretreatment-local-staging-evaluation-for-rectal-cancer/abstract/11-15\" class=\"abstract_t\">11-15</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=rectal-cancer-surgical-principles#H87590296\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Rectal cancer: Surgical principles&quot;, section on 'Total mesorectal excision'</a>.)</p><p>The mesorectal fascia is the potential CRM in patients undergoing TME. If the mesorectal fascia is involved or if the tumor extends to a point that is within 1 to 2 mm of the mesorectal fascia (ie, a &quot;threatened&quot; CRM), there is a clear risk that the CRM will be involved with upfront surgery. These patients are appropriate candidates for preoperative chemoradiotherapy in an attempt to downstage the tumor. One of the main benefits for preoperative as compared with postoperative chemoradiotherapy in the German Rectal Cancer Study (which did not focus on patients with evidence of mesorectal fascia involvement) was a reduction in the rate of local recurrence. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=neoadjuvant-chemoradiotherapy-and-radiotherapy-for-rectal-adenocarcinoma#H13\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy and radiotherapy for rectal adenocarcinoma&quot;, section on 'German Rectal Cancer Study'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h3\">TRUS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>By transrectal ultrasound (TRUS), localized cancers involving only the mucosa and submucosa can usually be distinguished from those that penetrate the muscularis propria (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F50261\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef50261 \">image 1</a>) or extend transmurally into perirectal fat (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F65054\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef65054 \">image 2</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pretreatment-local-staging-evaluation-for-rectal-cancer/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. The technique of transrectal endoscopic ultrasound (TEUS) is discussed in detail elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=endoscopic-ultrasound-in-rectal-cancer#H2\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Endoscopic ultrasound in rectal cancer&quot;, section on 'Technique'</a>.)</p><p>Several studies comparing the accuracy of TRUS with CT and MRI suggest that TRUS is superior to both for primary tumor (T) staging of rectal cancer. The accuracy of TRUS ranges from 80 to 95 percent, compared to 75 to 85 percent for MRI, 65 to 75 percent for CT, and 62 percent for DRE. In one systematic review, the accuracy of TRUS was greatest (95 percent) in distinguishing whether a tumor was confined to the rectal wall or invaded through it (ie, <span class=\"nowrap\">T1/2</span> versus T3 or greater) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F72913\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef72913 \">table 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pretreatment-local-staging-evaluation-for-rectal-cancer/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. This is an important distinction as patients with T3 or T4 rectal cancer are typically offered neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy rather than upfront surgery. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=endoscopic-ultrasound-in-rectal-cancer#H3\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Endoscopic ultrasound in rectal cancer&quot;, section on 'Staging'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=neoadjuvant-chemoradiotherapy-and-radiotherapy-for-rectal-adenocarcinoma#H2\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy and radiotherapy for rectal adenocarcinoma&quot;, section on 'Indications for neoadjuvant treatment'</a>.)</p><p>Despite these data, there is considerable interobserver variability and a significant learning curve associated with performing TRUS [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pretreatment-local-staging-evaluation-for-rectal-cancer/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. TRUS more frequently understages than overstages the primary tumor. However, TRUS understages the cancer less often than does CT. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=endoscopic-ultrasound-in-rectal-cancer#H1067157148\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Endoscopic ultrasound in rectal cancer&quot;, section on 'T stage'</a>.)</p><p>In comparative studies, the accuracy of TRUS for defining the status of the regional lymph nodes (approximately 70 to 75 percent) is similar to that of CT (55 to 65 percent) and MRI (60 to 65 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pretreatment-local-staging-evaluation-for-rectal-cancer/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. The contribution of TRUS-guided fine needle aspiration biopsy (FNA) to N staging accuracy is controversial. These issues are discussed in detail elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=endoscopic-ultrasound-in-rectal-cancer#H4\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Endoscopic ultrasound in rectal cancer&quot;, section on 'N stage'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=endoscopic-ultrasound-in-rectal-cancer#H5\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Endoscopic ultrasound in rectal cancer&quot;, section on 'Fine-needle aspiration biopsy'</a>.)</p><p>In patients with anterior tumors, TRUS can assess the extent of tumor involvement of the mesorectal fascia (the lateral margin), which predicts the distance of the tumor to the circumferential resection plane after rectal cancer surgery. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=endoscopic-ultrasound-in-rectal-cancer#H1067157171\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Endoscopic ultrasound in rectal cancer&quot;, section on 'Circumferential resection margin'</a>.) </p><p>However, for posterior or posterolateral tumors, the distance to the CRM cannot be estimated using TRUS, because neighboring structures that allow assessment of the CRM are lacking. In such cases, the distance to the CRM is best estimated using MRI.

MRI staging of rectal cancer can be performed using an endorectal surface coil (ecMRI); however, with the advent of gradient coil systems and high-resolution surface coils, the use of endorectal coils is declining. Currently, it is our practice to stage rectal cancer patients using a 3.0Tesla (3-T) MRI (a 3-T field strength is the maximum for full-body MRI). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=principles-of-magnetic-resonance-imaging#H3\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Principles of magnetic resonance imaging&quot;, section on 'MR imaging technology and pulse sequences'</a>.)</p><p>In general, MRI tends to have a higher sensitivity than EUS for the assessment of perirectal nodal involvement because MRI can identify involved nodes on the basis of characteristics other than size [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pretreatment-local-staging-evaluation-for-rectal-cancer/abstract/3,20-23\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,20-23</a>]. Most centers rely on size to determine whether a node is malignant or benign. However, there is considerable overlap in size between normal reactive nodes and those containing tumor.

Lymph node size &ge;5 mm, irregular borders, and mixed signal intensity were used in different combinations across studies to define &quot;involved&quot; nodes. CRM was also variably defined, ranging from direct contiguity of tumor with mesorectal fascia to tumor extension &le;5 mm from the mesorectal fascia.</p><p>A number of studies have shown that T3 tumors with &gt;5 mm of extramural invasion have a cancer-specific survival rate of approximately 54 percent, compared to 85 percent when the depth is 5 mm or less [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pretreatment-local-staging-evaluation-for-rectal-cancer/abstract/26,27\" class=\"abstract_t\">26,27</a>]. Furthermore, with increasing spread of tumor into perirectal fat, there is an increase in nodal involvement [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pretreatment-local-staging-evaluation-for-rectal-cancer/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. These findings have led some to suggest that it is not necessarily the distinction between T2 and T3 tumors that may potentially govern treatment decisions but the identification of high-risk T3 tumors with a &gt;5 mm depth of extramural tumor invasion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pretreatment-local-staging-evaluation-for-rectal-cancer/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>].</p><p>The utility of preoperative high-resolution MRI in identifying those patients with &gt;5 mm of extramural tumor invasion was shown in an analysis from the prospective MERCURY trial [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pretreatment-local-staging-evaluation-for-rectal-cancer/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. &quot;Good prognosis&quot; MRI characteristics included an MRI-predicted safe CRM and MRI-predicted T2, T3a, or T3b disease with &lt;5 mm spread from the muscularis propria, regardless of MRI-predicted N stage. No patient received preoperative or postoperative RT.</p><p>Of the 374 patients with complete data and follow-up, 122 had &quot;good prognosis&quot; stage III or less disease; five-year disease-free survival was 85 percent, and the local recurrence rate was 3 percent. However, 57 of the patients in this group had MRI-staged T2N0 tumors, and only 22 had node-positive disease. The final pathology demonstrated four patients with a positive CRM, all of whom had node-positive tumors on preoperative MRI and would have been considered for a neoadjuvant approach to therapy, at least in the United States. Whether these results can be extrapolated to populations with more advanced disease is unclear. This approach of selecting patients with T3 disease for preoperative therapy based upon the depth of extramural tumor invasion is not yet standard, at least in the United States.

MRI offers some advantages over TRUS: it permits a larger field of view and can visualize more proximal tumors, it tends to be less operator and technique dependent, it allows the study of stenotic tumors, and as noted above, it can characterize perirectal lymph nodes on the basis of morphology as well as size [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pretreatment-local-staging-evaluation-for-rectal-cancer/abstract/20,30-32\" class=\"abstract_t\">20,30-32</a>].</p><p>A meta-analysis of 90 articles published between 1985 and 2002 comparing the staging accuracy of MRI, TRUS, and CT, with histopathologic findings as the reference standard, came to the following conclusions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pretreatment-local-staging-evaluation-for-rectal-cancer/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For muscularis propria invasion (ie, T1 versus T2 (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F72913\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef72913 \">table 1</a>)), TRUS and MRI had similar sensitivity; specificity of TRUS was significantly higher (86 versus 69 percent).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For perirectal tissue invasion (T3 disease), the sensitivity of TRUS was significantly higher than either MRI or CT (90 versus 82 and 79 percent, respectively). The results of a subgroup analysis for MRI techniques (use of a body coil versus a body coil with an addition coil, unenhanced versus gadolinium-enhanced MRI, low versus high magnetic field strength) disclosed no significant differences among these techniques in terms of sensitivity or specificity.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For invasion of adjacent organs (T4 disease) and lymph node involvement, estimates for TRUS, CT, and MRI were comparable.</p><p/><p>The authors concluded that TRUS was the most accurate method to determine local tumor stage. However, the MERCURY study was not included in this analysis. The increasing use of newer MRI techniques, such as were used in the MERCURY, study may change this outlook.</p><p>A second meta-analysis of seven studies of imaging studies to assess the CRM and status of the perirectal lymph nodes concluded that TRUS was slightly, though not significantly, better than MRI for identification of nodal disease, but MRI was the only modality that predicted the CRM with good accuracy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pretreatment-local-staging-evaluation-for-rectal-cancer/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. The MERCURY study was not included in this analysis.</p><p>Technologic advances have led to considerable improvements in MRI of the abdomen and pelvis. Specifically, the use of phased array coils and rapid gradient echo techniques have allowed imaging during the dynamic administration of intravenous (IV) paramagnetic contrast agents, such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=gadopentetate-dimeglumine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">gadopentetate dimeglumine</a>. This improves the characterization of the tumor from the surrounding normal structures and permits identification of enhancing malignant lymph nodes. As these advances become more widespread and migrate from academic practices to the community, MRI will likely be seen as advantageous compared with TRUS.</p><p>At present, either TRUS or high-resolution MRI are acceptable radiographic methods to determine preoperative local tumor stage. Local expertise may influence the choice of modality. If available, optimal thin-section (high-resolution) MRI using a surface pelvic phased-array coil MRI is generally preferred when patients are being evaluated for neoadjuvant therapy approaches because of its utility in assessing the CRM.</p><p>In practice, the information obtained with TRUS and MRI is often complementary [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pretreatment-local-staging-evaluation-for-rectal-cancer/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>], and at many institutions, both procedures are done preoperatively, particularly for patients whose tumors extend beyond the muscularis propria. For early staging of T1 and T2 lesions, TRUS offers excellent delineation of the relationship between a tumor, the mucosa, the muscularis propria, and tumor extension beyond the muscularis propria. However, TRUS is clearly limited in terms of tumors that extend deeply into the pelvic side wall or into additional pelvic structures, or for the detection and characterization of adenopathy in the internal and external iliac (lateral pelvic nodal) distribution. Nodes are rarely involved along the internal iliac. The radiologist will sometimes read that the internal iliac nodes are involved, but usually they are nodes in the lateral mesorectum that appear near the artery and its branches but are not actually associated with the artery and its branches. The prognostic impact of lateral pelvic nodal involvement is addressed elsewhere.

The type of surgery depends on disease extent and location within the rectum. Superficially invasive, small cancers may be effectively managed with limited surgery, such as local excision. However, most patients have more deeply invasive tumors that require low anterior resection (LAR) or, in some cases, if located distally, abdominoperineal resection (APR). Locally advanced tumors that are adherent or fixed to adjoining structure (eg, sacrum, pelvic sidewalls, prostate, or bladder) require more extensive surgery. (See <a href=\"#H1\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The addition of adjuvant radiation therapy (RT) and chemotherapy can enhance both local control and cure rates in patients with either transmural invasion or positive perirectal lymph nodes. Such therapy is often administered preoperatively. (See <a href=\"#H1\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Neoadjuvant therapy is generally considered in the following circumstances (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=neoadjuvant-chemoradiotherapy-and-radiotherapy-for-rectal-adenocarcinoma#H2\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy and radiotherapy for rectal adenocarcinoma&quot;, section on 'Indications for neoadjuvant treatment'</a>):</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span><span class=\"nowrap\">T3/4</span> tumors (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F72913\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef72913 \">table 1</a>).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Clinically node-positive <span class=\"nowrap\">T1/2</span> tumors.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Distal rectal tumors (ie, tumors within 5 cm of the anal verge (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F62539\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef62539 \">figure 1</a>)) for which an abdominoperineal resection is thought to be necessary.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Tumors that appear to invade or are in close proximity to the mesorectal fascia on preoperative imaging. The mesorectal fascia is the circumferential resection margin (CRM) in patients undergoing total mesorectal excision.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The selection of the operative approach and appropriate patients for initial RT or chemoradiotherapy rather than surgery is heavily dependent on accurate preoperative locoregional staging. Digital rectal examination (DRE), rigid sigmoidoscopy, and preoperative imaging studies assist in determining the need for radical resection versus local excision, and whether the patient is a candidate for preoperative chemoradiotherapy. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'History, physical examination, and endoscopy'</a> above and <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Imaging evaluation'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>On DRE, fixation of the lesion to the anal sphincter, its relationship to the anorectal ring (the collection of muscles that make up the sphincters), and fixation to both the rectal wall and the pelvic wall muscles (levators) can be assessed. Rigid rather than flexible sigmoidoscopy can most accurately determine the distance between the distal tumor margin, the top of the anorectal ring, and the dentate line, as well as the orientation within the rectum (eg, anterior, posterior, left, and right). (See <a href=\"#H624796\" class=\"local\">'Surgical anatomy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>All patients should undergo complete colonoscopy to assess for a possible synchronous second primary colorectal cancer or other polyps. (See <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Imaging evaluation'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>All patients should undergo a staging computed tomography (CT) of the abdomen, chest, and pelvis. CT scanning is a helpful modality for staging distant metastatic spread and for identifying tumor-related complications (eg, perforation, fistula formation). (See <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'CT scans'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For some patients, CT alone may provide sufficient information about local staging to permit the selection of treatment. However, in most cases, transrectal ultrasound (TRUS) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) with or without an endorectal coil provides more accuracy than CT for assessing the depth of tumor invasion, the presence of perirectal nodal metastases, and the likelihood of a positive circumferential resection margin at the time of surgery, all of which may influence the choice of initial surgery versus chemoradiotherapy. (See <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'TRUS'</a> above and <a href=\"#H10\" class=\"local\">'MRI scan'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Either TRUS or high-resolution MRI is an acceptable radiographic method to determine preoperative local tumor stage. Local expertise may influence the choice of modality. If available, optimal thin section (high-resolution) MRI using a surface pelvic phased-array coil MRI is generally preferred when patients are being evaluated for neoadjuvant therapy approaches because of its greater utility in assessing the CRM. However, in practice, the information obtained with TRUS and MRI is often complementary, and at some institutions, both procedures are done preoperatively. (See <a href=\"#H623938\" class=\"local\">'TRUS versus MRI'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The operating surgeon should ensure that the TRUS or MRI study is performed at an experienced center. A poor-quality MRI that is done in an inexperienced center without surface coils, without a high field strength magnet, or without a rectal protocol leads to mismanagement. The same is true for TRUS, which is highly dependent on operator experience.</p><p/></div><div id=\"topicAgreement\">Use of UpToDate is subject to the <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/legal/license\" class=\"licenseLink\" id=\"sla_in_page\">Subscription and License Agreement</a>.</div><div id=\"references\" class=\"headingAnchor\"><h1>REFERENCES</h1><ol id=\"reference\"><li><a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pretreatment-local-staging-evaluation-for-rectal-cancer/abstract/1\" class=\"nounderline abstract_t\">McGory ML, Shekelle PG, Ko CY.
