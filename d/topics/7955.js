If not recognized in a timely fashion, ischemia occurs. With progressive swelling, the constricting agent may become embedded in the soft tissue or cut through the skin and underlying tissues. If not promptly removed, then permanent tissue necrosis can develop. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1704670712\"><span class=\"h1\">ETIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The source of the tourniquet varies by the site of constriction: </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Hair tourniquet</strong> &ndash; In young infants, hair or thread entrapment of digits (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F50150\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef50150 \">picture 1</a>) or genitalia arises from the presence of a loose hair or fiber that wraps around the appendage because of movement of the digit or genitalia in a confined area (eg, feet-in pajamas, socks, mittens, or diaper). Discomfort from the hair or thread leads to additional movement, which encourages further entrapment of the appendage over the course of hours or days. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">In infants, the hair is frequently the mother&rsquo;s because of increased maternal hair loss during the postpartum period (telogen effluvium). When her hair falls unnoticed into the bath water during routine care, it may become attached to the patient&rsquo;s toe, finger, or genitalia (penis, labia, or clitoris) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hair-tourniquet-and-other-narrow-constricting-bands-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-treatment/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].

Strangulation injuries of the digits are usually considered to be unintentional.</p><p>Although most commonly unintentional in young infants, tourniquets of the penis should raise the question of self-application by the patient in older children, adolescents, and adults or child abuse in toddlers who are toilet training.

Older patients frequently report pain and swelling at the site of constriction.</p><p>Among prepubertal girls and older males with genital tourniquets, some patients will admit that they applied the constricting band. However, this history is not always forthcoming. Furthermore, if the genital tourniquet was applied as punishment or a means to prevent nocturnal enuresis in a toddler or young child by the caregiver, a history may be absent.

Due to deep penetration into the soft tissue, the constricting hair, thread, or other tourniquet usually cannot be seen without probing the wound or manipulating the digit which may be too painful to accomplish without sedation. However, a deep, encircling, and narrow indentation of the appendage is highly suggestive of a tourniquet (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F112577\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef112577 \">picture 3</a>).

If this method is unsuccessful or a chemical depilatory is not available, the physician should proceed to mechanical removal (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F112609\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef112609 \">algorithm 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hair-tourniquet-and-other-narrow-constricting-bands-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-treatment/abstract/13,18,19\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,18,19</a>]:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span><strong>Dissolve the hair with a chemical depilatory agent</strong> &ndash; The technique for use of a depilatory agent to remove a hair tourniquet is as follows: </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent3\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#45;</span>Apply chemical depilatory lotion, spray, or cream (eg, Nair, Magic Shave, or Veet) for 3 to 6 minutes according to specific product package instructions.

Intentional application by a caregiver to discourage urination at night in young boys has also been described. (See <a href=\"#H1861076690\" class=\"local\">'Terminology'</a> above and <a href=\"#H1704670712\" class=\"local\">'Etiology'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The infant with a hair or thread tourniquet usually presents with irritability. Parents may also report a swelling and discoloration at the site of strangulation. However, the tourniquet frequently has not been discovered when the infant presents. Older patients typically report pain and swelling at the site of constriction but often do <strong>not</strong> admit to intentional application of the tourniquet. (See <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'History'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Infants who present with fussiness or irritability should be carefully examined for evidence of a hair or thread tourniquet as well as other etiologies of prolonged or excessive crying (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F79185\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef79185 \">table 1</a>).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The diagnosis of hair tourniquet is usually made on physical examination (see <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Physical examination'</a> above and <a href=\"#H119275528\" class=\"local\">'Diagnosis'</a> above):</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Superficial tourniquets &ndash; Superficial tourniquets are typically visible with magnification and the type of material (hair, thread, or other substance) can often be identified (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F50150\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef50150 \">picture 1</a>). On the fingers or toes, the physician can more easily see the hair on the dorsal surface where it usually penetrates less deeply. Swelling may be significant but discoloration or large amounts of skin breakdown associated with ischemia is <strong>not</strong> present. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Deeply embedded tourniquets &ndash; Deeply embedded tourniquets present with significant edema and often have tissue ischemia with distal color change (purple, blue, or black). Due to deep penetration into the soft tissue, the constricting hair or other material usually <strong>cannot</strong> be seen, but the physician can appreciate a characteristic narrow, encircling constriction of the digit or external genitalia (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F112577\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef112577 \">picture 3</a>). </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The management of a hair or thread tourniquet depends upon whether it is superficial or deeply embedded and whether strangulation is caused by hair or other material (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F112609\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef112609 \">algorithm 1</a>):</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>We suggest that patients with superficial hair tourniquets of the digit or penis initially have a chemical depilatory agent (eg, Nair, Magic Shave, or Veet), if available, applied to dissolve the hair (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). If this method is unsuccessful or a chemical depilatory is not available, the physician should proceed to mechanical removal. Because chemical depilatory agents should <strong>not</strong> be applied near mucosa, superficial hair tourniquets of the labia or clitoris must <strong>always</strong> undergo mechanical removal. (See <a href=\"#H18434003\" class=\"local\">'Superficial tourniquet'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Superficially constricting strings or other band located on the digit or external genitalia require direct excision under magnification. (See <a href=\"#H1453975010\" class=\"local\">'Thread or other constricting band'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Deeply embedded tourniquets with ischemia or necrosis require excision and warrant consultation with a surgical specialist. The patient must have proper pain control or sedation for removal. In some patients, especially children with deep tourniquets of the genitalia, general anesthesia may be most appropriate. Alternatively, regional anesthesia (digital or dorsal penile block) and procedural sedation may suffice. (See <a href=\"#H2570606781\" class=\"local\">'Indications for specialty consultation'</a> above and <a href=\"#H18434010\" class=\"local\">'Deeply embedded tourniquet'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Reperfusion and pain relief is usually evident within a few minutes of tourniquet release.
