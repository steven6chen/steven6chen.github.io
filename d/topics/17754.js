Over 95 percent of hypopharyngeal cancers are squamous cell carcinomas. Other less common histologies include basaloid squamous carcinomas, spindle cell carcinomas, and minor salivary gland carcinomas.</p><p>At diagnosis, less than 15 percent of hypopharyngeal cancers are confined to the hypopharynx. Most have spread to the regional lymph nodes (65 percent) or distantly (20 percent). Presenting symptoms can include dysphagia, odynophagia, otalgia, hoarseness, <span class=\"nowrap\">dyspnea/stridor,</span> <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> a painless neck mass. Diagnosis at an early stage is uncommon due to a lack of alarming symptoms until local progression or a neck metastasis is present. Countries that have introduced national diagnostic screening programs for early gastrointestinal malignancies are more likely to detect hypopharyngeal malignancy at an earlier stage.</p><p>The treatment of early hypopharyngeal cancer is presented here.

Hypopharyngeal cancers tend to spread within the mucosa beneath intact epithelium and can involve multiple adjacent mucosal areas [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-early-stage-i-and-ii-head-and-neck-cancer-the-hypopharynx/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-the-diagnosis-and-staging-of-head-and-neck-cancer\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of the diagnosis and staging of head and neck cancer&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Routes of primary tumor spread are influenced by hypopharyngeal subsite:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Cancers of the pyriform sinus can invade the laryngeal paraglottic space anteriorly, the thyroid cartilage laterally, the postcricoid area and cervical esophagus inferiorly, the oropharynx superiorly, and the constrictor muscles and prevertebral fascia posteriorly.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Cancers of the posterior pharyngeal wall extend into the lower oropharynx, while cancers of the postcricoid space can spread superiorly within the hypopharynx and extrapharyngeally.

Early pyriform sinus tumors may be very subtle, and examination with a modified Valsalva maneuver during office fiberoptic endoscopy while letting the patient blow against closed lips may be helpful since a normal pyriform sinus mucosa will distend. Evaluation under anesthesia is desirable. Direct laryngoscopy, performed in the operating room, allows an accurate evaluation of superficial tumor spread and extent.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H430870946\"><span class=\"h2\">Imaging</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The degree of deep tumor spread (preepiglottic space, paraglottic space, laryngeal framework, and direct neck extension) cannot be evaluated by endoscopy and thus requires additional radiologic examination.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) is typically used as the initial imaging modality to assess local tumor extent and evaluate for pathologic lymphadenopathy. CT is generally the most useful single modality for staging hypopharyngeal cancers since it can accurately identify gross cartilage invasion. However, CT may not identify minor invasion.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) provides improved soft-tissue imaging and is complementary to CT. MRI can distinguish pharyngeal muscles from the mucosa and lymphoid tissue lining the inner wall of the hypopharynx and has a higher sensitivity for the detection of early cartilage invasion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-early-stage-i-and-ii-head-and-neck-cancer-the-hypopharynx/abstract/15,16\" class=\"abstract_t\">15,16</a>]. In addition, MRI is superior for assessing carotid involvement in cases with neck extension or nodal disease with extracapsular spread. However, motion artifacts are particularly frequent at the <span class=\"nowrap\">laryngeal/hypopharyngeal</span> level, which may limit the utility of MRI [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-early-stage-i-and-ii-head-and-neck-cancer-the-hypopharynx/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Combined positron emission tomography (PET) and CT <span class=\"nowrap\">(PET/CT)</span> scans appear to be more accurate than CT or PET alone for the depiction of malignancy in the head and neck.

In one series that included 50 patients with previously untreated head and neck squamous cell carcinoma, the positive and negative predictive values for staging clinically N0 neck by <span class=\"nowrap\">PET/CT</span> were determined to be 58 and 89 percent, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-early-stage-i-and-ii-head-and-neck-cancer-the-hypopharynx/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h1\">TREATMENT OF PRIMARY TUMOR</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In general, radiation therapy (RT) is the treatment of choice for early stage hypopharyngeal cancer. RT results in high rates of laryngeal preservation and can treat both the primary tumor site and all elective nodal stations as a single modality. With the development of transoral robotic and laser techniques and better endoscopic visualization, carefully selected cases of early hypopharynx cancer can be surgically treated; this should be combined with surgical treatment of the neck because of the high propensity for occult spread to cervical lymph nodes and for accurate pathologic staging.</p><p>The choice of RT or surgical resection for a specific patient is based upon a number of factors, including patient preference; geographic distance to an RT or surgical center; patient fitness, especially pulmonary function; surgeon and radiation oncologist experience; and technology available to the radiation oncologist and surgeon.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H122611852\"><span class=\"h2\">General principles</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The goal of treatment for early hypopharyngeal cancer is to achieve locoregional tumor control and long-term survival while maintaining functional (respiration, swallowing, and speech) organ preservation. Whenever possible, preservation of laryngeal function with a conservative surgical procedure or definitive RT is preferred over total laryngectomy or laryngopharyngectomy, which are usually reserved for more-advanced disease. A multidisciplinary approach with input from head and neck surgeons, radiation oncologists, and medical oncologists is recommended.</p><p>In patients with early stage hypopharyngeal cancer, overall and disease-specific survival following definitive RT are comparable with those for radical surgery (total laryngectomy) or larynx-conserving surgery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-early-stage-i-and-ii-head-and-neck-cancer-the-hypopharynx/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. Several studies have demonstrated that transoral approaches in carefully selected patients can preserve function while achieving equivalent outcomes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-early-stage-i-and-ii-head-and-neck-cancer-the-hypopharynx/abstract/28-32\" class=\"abstract_t\">28-32</a>]. Surgery and RT have not been directly compared in randomized trials in patients with early hypopharyngeal cancer.</p><p>As an example, in one retrospective population-based study limited to potentially resectable hypopharyngeal cancer patients who received definitive treatment from 1990 to 2000, there was no significant difference in overall or disease-specific survival between those treated with RT and those treated surgically [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-early-stage-i-and-ii-head-and-neck-cancer-the-hypopharynx/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>]. In both groups, the five-year disease-specific survival rate for early stage patients was approximately 75 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-early-stage-i-and-ii-head-and-neck-cancer-the-hypopharynx/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>]. Five-year overall survival is lower for early stage hypopharyngeal cancer compared with early stage cancers arising in other head and neck sites. In a representative series of RT alone for hypopharyngeal cancer, the actuarial overall five-year survival was 52 percent, reflecting the frequency of deaths from other causes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-early-stage-i-and-ii-head-and-neck-cancer-the-hypopharynx/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>].</p><p>Local recurrences are the most frequent pattern of progression after definitive RT. In contrast, distant metastases are more common with surgery. The incidence of neck recurrences is similar with both RT and surgery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-early-stage-i-and-ii-head-and-neck-cancer-the-hypopharynx/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Surgery</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In early stage hypopharyngeal cancer, surgery is a treatment option for patients who have disease that is technically resectable for a laryngeal-sparing approach. This includes patients with upper pyriform sinus and posterior pharyngeal wall tumors. A wide range of larynx-sparing (conservative) surgical approaches that aim to preserve speech and swallowing have been used in appropriately selected patients with early (T stage) hypopharyngeal cancer (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F83099\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef83099 \">table 3</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-early-stage-i-and-ii-head-and-neck-cancer-the-hypopharynx/abstract/36-42\" class=\"abstract_t\">36-42</a>].</p><p>Conservative approaches are generally not indicated for early stage patients with transglottic tumor extension, postcricoid invasion, and deep pyriform sinus invasion. Although excellent local control (70 to 90 percent) and functional outcome are reported, most of the series using conservative surgical procedures include the use of induction chemotherapy <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> adjuvant RT (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F83099\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef83099 \">table 3</a>). It is unclear if conservative surgery alone would achieve a comparable outcome [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-early-stage-i-and-ii-head-and-neck-cancer-the-hypopharynx/abstract/28,41-43\" class=\"abstract_t\">28,41-43</a>]. </p><p>Transoral approaches have the potential to decrease patient morbidity and increase quality of life in carefully selected patients. Both transoral robotic surgery (TORS) and transoral laser microsurgery (TLM) can have accessibility issues and are contraindicated for extensive lesions with extensive arytenoid involvement, posterior cricoarytenoid involvement, significant esophageal or base of tongue disease, or neck extension with carotid involvement. TORS may offer several advantages over transoral laser-based strategies, including en bloc resection for pathologic evaluation, but its role in early stage hypopharyngeal cancer treatment is only just beginning to be defined [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-early-stage-i-and-ii-head-and-neck-cancer-the-hypopharynx/abstract/44-46\" class=\"abstract_t\">44-46</a>].</p><p>TORS was successfully utilized to treat 10 patients with early stage (T1 to T2) hypopharyngeal cancer, with only five patients requiring adjuvant RT. Four patients required additional margin resection based on frozen section analysis, and one patient had a positive margin on permanent section analysis. There were no local recurrences, and all larynxes were preserved after a mean follow-up of 26 months. None of the patients required a permanent gastrostomy tube or tracheostomy, and voice and swallow were deemed adequate in all patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-early-stage-i-and-ii-head-and-neck-cancer-the-hypopharynx/abstract/46\" class=\"abstract_t\">46</a>]. </p><p>In a contemporary study using TLM, the five-year local control rates for pT1 and pT2 tumors were 88.1 and 74.8 percent, respectively. The five-year estimates of overall survival, disease-specific survival, and recurrence-free survival for&nbsp;early&nbsp;stage I and II disease were 68.2, 96.7, and 74.6 percent, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-early-stage-i-and-ii-head-and-neck-cancer-the-hypopharynx/abstract/47\" class=\"abstract_t\">47</a>]. Importantly, a high percentage of patients (95.7 percent) maintained gastrostomy tube independence with a rapid return to oral alimentation, even with 85 percent of the cohort being of advanced stage.</p><p>The most common complication was a postoperative bleeding rate of 10.4 percent, which was readily managed. In addition, the pharyngeal fistula rate of 0.9 percent was well below that historically observed in open procedures. Total laryngectomy or laryngopharyngectomy, procedures that are typically reserved for T3 and T4 tumors, may also be required for small lesions that involve the pyriform sinus apex or postcricoid region if surgery is the only modality used.</p><p>Adjuvant RT or chemoradiotherapy is indicated following surgery for patients who have positive resection margins, lymphovascular or perineural invasion, extranodal extension, or pathologically positive lymph nodes identified after neck dissection. Patients with close margins may also need additional treatment.

Definitive RT has resulted in variable rates of laryngeal preservation, ranging from 41 to 100 percent for T1 tumors and from 41 to 86 percent for T2 tumors (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F51464\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef51464 \">table 4</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-early-stage-i-and-ii-head-and-neck-cancer-the-hypopharynx/abstract/48\" class=\"abstract_t\">48</a>].

Additionally, tumors extending to or arising from the posterior hypopharyngeal wall require a more-posterior border, splitting the vertebral body when using conventional non-conformal fields. Contemporary RT techniques, as well as the dose and schedule of RT, are discussed elsewhere. (See <a href=\"#H9\" class=\"local\">'Management of the neck'</a> below.)</p><p>Acute toxicities from RT commonly include mucositis, dysphagia, aspiration, skin hyperpigmentation, and desquamation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-early-stage-i-and-ii-head-and-neck-cancer-the-hypopharynx/abstract/49\" class=\"abstract_t\">49</a>]. Chronic dysphagia of various degrees may be seen in the majority of patients after treatment, although it is not well reported. Serious late toxicities can include chondritis of the larynx, prolonged dysphagia requiring chronic enteral tube feedings, persistent mucosal ulceration, webbing of the pharynx requiring dilatation, and laryngeal edema requiring tracheostomy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-early-stage-i-and-ii-head-and-neck-cancer-the-hypopharynx/abstract/48\" class=\"abstract_t\">48</a>]. Myelitis is an extremely rare complication with properly planned RT, occurring in less than 1 percent of cases.

Often, however, salvage may not be feasible due to prevertebral or carotid involvement with <span class=\"nowrap\">residual/recurrent</span> disease, unlike laryngeal cancers that undergo initial nonsurgical therapy.

The pyriform sinus drains to levels II through IV (jugulodigastric chain), level V (posterior triangle), and the retropharyngeal lymph nodes (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F54099\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef54099 \">figure 2</a>). The posterior pharyngeal wall drains to levels II and III, and the retropharyngeal lymph nodes. The postcricoid space drains to levels III and V, and the paratracheal nodes.</p><p>The most commonly involved lymph nodes in the clinical N0 neck are level II (relative frequency 67 to 75 percent), followed by level III (33 to 75 percent) and level IV (0 to 7 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-early-stage-i-and-ii-head-and-neck-cancer-the-hypopharynx/abstract/52-54\" class=\"abstract_t\">52-54</a>]. In the clinical N0 neck, retropharyngeal lymph nodes are involved in up to 15 percent (0 to 15 percent) of cases and are more common with primary tumors of the posterior pharyngeal wall [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-early-stage-i-and-ii-head-and-neck-cancer-the-hypopharynx/abstract/55-57\" class=\"abstract_t\">55-57</a>].</p><p>If surgery is used to treat the primary tumor, bilateral selective neck dissection of levels II, III, and IV should be performed for N0 presentations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-early-stage-i-and-ii-head-and-neck-cancer-the-hypopharynx/abstract/58\" class=\"abstract_t\">58</a>]. </p><p>For patients who undergo definitive RT to the primary tumor, the neck is treated with RT. The entire bilateral neck, including the retropharyngeal and supraclavicular nodes, generally should be part of the treatment volume, even in patients with early tumors and clinically negative neck nodes. </p><p>The standard dose for clinically uninvolved nodal regions is usually 50 Gy delivered in 2 Gy daily fractions. Either three-dimensional conformal RT or intensity-modulated RT is routinely used. Given the need to electively irradiate multiple lymph node levels bilaterally, intensity-modulated RT is preferable as it can be used to minimize the radiation dose to the parotid glands.

Survival also declines with older age, male gender, lower socioeconomic status, and Black race [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-early-stage-i-and-ii-head-and-neck-cancer-the-hypopharynx/abstract/61,62\" class=\"abstract_t\">61,62</a>]. Comorbidities have also been shown to correlate with worse outcomes and prognosis, and the hypopharynx subsite, compared with other head and neck cancer subsites, has increased competing mortality from death resulting from non-cancer causes and second malignances [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-early-stage-i-and-ii-head-and-neck-cancer-the-hypopharynx/abstract/63,64\" class=\"abstract_t\">63,64</a>].</p><p>Patients previously treated for early stage hypopharyngeal primaries are at increased risk for second primary tumors at an annual average rate of 2.1 percent in one series. Such second primary tumors adversely affect overall survival for patients with early hypopharyngeal cancer [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-early-stage-i-and-ii-head-and-neck-cancer-the-hypopharynx/abstract/34,58,65\" class=\"abstract_t\">34,58,65</a>]. As an example, in one series of 115 patients with stage I and II hypopharyngeal cancer, 65 patients (57 percent) had synchronous or metachronous cancers, and of the 115 patients, 19 died of hypopharyngeal cancer, 10 died of second primary cancers, and 14 died of other causes during the study (median follow-up of 47 months) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-early-stage-i-and-ii-head-and-neck-cancer-the-hypopharynx/abstract/58\" class=\"abstract_t\">58</a>].</p><p>Second primary tumors most commonly occur in the upper aerodigestive tract, including the oral cavity, esophagus, and lung. Alcohol consumption strongly increases the risk of developing another malignancy after treatment for laryngeal or hypopharyngeal cancer, and a history of heavy cumulative cigarette smoking increases the risk of developing lung cancer [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-early-stage-i-and-ii-head-and-neck-cancer-the-hypopharynx/abstract/66\" class=\"abstract_t\">66</a>].

Patients should be educated about possible signs and symptoms of tumor recurrence, including hoarseness, pain, dysphagia, bleeding, and enlarged lymph nodes. In some situations, operative endoscopy is necessary to determine pathologic disease status due to treatment-related edema and anatomic distortion in the months following chemoradiation.</p><p>In general, the intensity of follow-up is greatest in the first two to four years, as approximately 80 to 90 percent of all recurrences occur within this timeframe. Several groups have developed guidelines. As an example, the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) recommends a history and physical exam every one to three months year 1, every two to four months year 2, every four to six months years 3 to 5, and every 6 to 12 months beyond five years. Posttreatment baseline imaging of the primary tumor site with computed tomography (CT) scan is recommended within six months of treatment, with further imaging indicated based on signs <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> symptoms. There is no role for routine positron emission tomography <span class=\"nowrap\">(PET)/CT</span> scan following the completion of therapy for early stage hypopharyngeal cancer.</p><p>Following baseline reassessment, direct visualization on clinical exam is the appropriate evaluation of the primary tumor. Continued follow-up beyond five years is generally suggested to assess these patients for late toxicity as well as to evaluate for a second primary malignancy. Because of the higher risk of recurrence and second primary malignancy in those who continue tobacco use, many schedule more-frequent surveillance visits for these patients and continue for longer duration (ie, beyond five years). The specific recommendations concerning follow-up and controversies in this area are reviewed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=posttreatment-surveillance-of-squamous-cell-carcinoma-of-the-head-and-neck\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Posttreatment surveillance of squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck&quot;</a>.) </p><p>Irradiated patients are at risk of developing hypothyroidism; thus, monitoring of serum thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) levels is routine in irradiated patients. Dental follow-up should be twice yearly at a minimum for dentate patients who have received radiation. Patients should also have periodic assessment for other treatment-related toxicity (eg, neck fibrosis, carotid stenosis, trismus, and speech and swallowing function).</p><p>An important aspect of posttreatment follow-up is to evaluate and address any functional problems that might be associated with the diagnosis <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> treatment of the disease. Following irradiation of the hypopharynx, treatment-related edema can result in dysphagia and aspiration. Therefore, patients with hypopharyngeal tumors often benefit from prospective evaluation and surveillance by speech-language pathologists, with swallowing exercises and serial evaluation of the efficiency and safety for oral alimentation. These interventions must begin before and continue throughout nonsurgical therapy to maintain swallowing function and avoid permanent gastrostomy use.

For appropriately selected patients, both conservative surgery (minimally invasive and open larynx-sparing surgical approaches) and definitive radiation therapy (RT) have been shown to offer good local tumor control and survival.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Surgery and RT have not been compared in a randomized trial, and the decision to choose one modality over the other depends upon a number of factors, including tumor accessibility, predicted functional outcome, patient health and preference, and the availability of treatment expertise.

For patients who undergo definitive RT, we recommend elective RT to the bilateral neck as the treatment volume, including the retropharyngeal and supraclavicular nodes (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=3\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1C</a>).

Patients with positive margins or extracapsular extension of a positive lymph node benefit from postoperative concurrent chemoradiation.
