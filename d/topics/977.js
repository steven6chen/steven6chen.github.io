caused by starvation.</p><p>In addition, neuropsychological function appears to be impaired in anorexia nervosa. A study compared patients with anorexia nervosa (n = 40) with healthy controls (n = 40) who were matched for sex and were comparable in age and education; patients were nutritionally and medically stable, but many had comorbid illnesses (eg, depression) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anorexia-nervosa-in-adults-clinical-features-course-of-illness-assessment-and-diagnosis/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. Cognitive functioning was worse in patients than controls in multiple domains (eg, executive functioning [planning, decision making, and response inhibition], visuospatial ability, and motor function).</p><p>One aspect of neurocognitive functioning is decision making, which is also impaired in patients who are actively ill with anorexia nervosa. A meta-analysis of 16 studies assessed decision making in symptomatic patients (n = 507) and healthy controls (n = 633), using the Iowa Gambling Test (which measures the ability to make advantageous and disadvantageous choices) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anorexia-nervosa-in-adults-clinical-features-course-of-illness-assessment-and-diagnosis/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. Decision making was moderately to substantially worse in symptomatic patients, and the effect was independent of the lower body mass index and increased depressive symptoms observed in patients. By contrast, decision making in patients who had recovered from anorexia nervosa and in healthy controls was comparable. &#160; &#160;</p><p>Anorexia nervosa is often accompanied by comorbid psychopathology and general medical disorders, as well as suicidality.

However, many comorbid disorders are secondary to the eating disorder and resolve with weight restoration [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anorexia-nervosa-in-adults-clinical-features-course-of-illness-assessment-and-diagnosis/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. This is especially true for comorbid major depression, which is frequent but rarely accompanied by melancholia or psychosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anorexia-nervosa-in-adults-clinical-features-course-of-illness-assessment-and-diagnosis/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Thus, treatment should initially focus upon anorexia nervosa and suicidality. Following remission, the patient should be reassessed for any comorbidities requiring treatment. Severe substance use disorder is the one exception, which should be prioritized to manage withdrawal phenomena [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anorexia-nervosa-in-adults-clinical-features-course-of-illness-assessment-and-diagnosis/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>].</p><p>Although the specific rate of comorbid disorders differs between epidemiologic surveys and studies in clinical settings, there is general agreement that patients with anorexia nervosa often suffer from [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anorexia-nervosa-in-adults-clinical-features-course-of-illness-assessment-and-diagnosis/abstract/12-17\" class=\"abstract_t\">12-17</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Anxiety disorders</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Obsessive-compulsive disorder</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Body dysmorphic disorder</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Posttraumatic stress disorder </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Depressive disorders</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Substance use disorders</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Disruptive, impulse control, and conduct disorders</p><p/><p>Screening for these comorbid disorders and their diagnostic criteria are discussed in separate topics. </p><p>A current comorbid disorder is diagnosed if it clearly preceded onset of the episode of anorexia nervosa or if the symptoms are not explained by starvation and not related to the eating disorder [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anorexia-nervosa-in-adults-clinical-features-course-of-illness-assessment-and-diagnosis/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. As an example, compulsive counting of caloric intake and expenditure is better conceptualized as a feature of anorexia nervosa, whereas compulsive checking of locks is better thought of as a feature of comorbid obsessive-compulsive disorder. </p><p>Most patients with anorexia nervosa have a lifetime history of at least one comorbid mental disorder (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PSYCH%2F57877\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef57877 \">table 1</a>). A nationally representative survey in the United States estimated that 56 percent of patients with anorexia nervosa had a lifetime history of at least one comorbid mental disorder and that 34 percent had three or more comorbid disorders [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anorexia-nervosa-in-adults-clinical-features-course-of-illness-assessment-and-diagnosis/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. The survey found that unipolar major depression was the most prevalent comorbid disorder; the lifetime prevalence in patients with anorexia nervosa was 39 percent. In addition, the lifetime rates for these comorbidities in patients with anorexia nervosa exceed the rates in the general population. As an example, the estimated lifetime prevalence of unipolar major depression in the general population is 23 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anorexia-nervosa-in-adults-clinical-features-course-of-illness-assessment-and-diagnosis/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. Shared etiologic factors may account for some of the observed comorbidity involving anxiety and depressive disorders [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anorexia-nervosa-in-adults-clinical-features-course-of-illness-assessment-and-diagnosis/abstract/11,19\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,19</a>].</p><p>Lifetime onset of anorexia nervosa often begins prior to the lifetime onset of comorbid mood or substance use disorders [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anorexia-nervosa-in-adults-clinical-features-course-of-illness-assessment-and-diagnosis/abstract/12,20\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,20</a>]. Conversely, comorbid anxiety or impulse control disorders usually predate anorexia nervosa [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anorexia-nervosa-in-adults-clinical-features-course-of-illness-assessment-and-diagnosis/abstract/12,21\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,21</a>]. &#160;</p><p>The association between comorbid mental disorders and the prognosis for anorexia nervosa depends upon the specific comorbid disorder [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anorexia-nervosa-in-adults-clinical-features-course-of-illness-assessment-and-diagnosis/abstract/22,23\" class=\"abstract_t\">22,23</a>]. Comorbid substance use disorder can adversely affect treatment outcome for eating disorders [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anorexia-nervosa-in-adults-clinical-features-course-of-illness-assessment-and-diagnosis/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. In addition, increased severity of comorbid alcohol use disorder is associated with increased mortality in anorexia nervosa [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anorexia-nervosa-in-adults-clinical-features-course-of-illness-assessment-and-diagnosis/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. By contrast, the relationship between comorbid depressive or anxiety disorders and prognosis for anorexia nervosa is not clear [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anorexia-nervosa-in-adults-clinical-features-course-of-illness-assessment-and-diagnosis/abstract/9,25\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,25</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H89473505\"><span class=\"h3\">Personality disorders and traits</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A variety of comorbid personality disorders and traits can occur in anorexia nervosa [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anorexia-nervosa-in-adults-clinical-features-course-of-illness-assessment-and-diagnosis/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>], and more than one disorder or trait can occur in the same patient.

Patients may also fast for a day or longer and exercise excessively such that it interferes with important activities, or occurs at inappropriate times, in inappropriate settings, or despite injury. In addition, patients may purge, ie, induce vomiting or misuse laxatives, diuretics, or enemas. Purging with laxatives, diuretics, or enemas does not rid the body of unwanted calories, but does cause a temporary loss of bodily fluids that may result in a lower measured weight and feeling of relief [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anorexia-nervosa-in-adults-clinical-features-course-of-illness-assessment-and-diagnosis/abstract/67\" class=\"abstract_t\">67</a>].

Some patients believe they are overweight, while others are concerned that specific body parts are fat. As a result, patients may excessively weigh themselves, measure body parts, or view themselves in a mirror. In addition, self-esteem depends upon body weight and shape; weight loss is viewed as an achievement and sign of self-discipline, whereas weight gain is a failure of self-control. Patients may concede that they are emaciated, but usually deny the medical complications of starvation. Some authorities view distorted body image as an overvalued idea rather than a delusion, even when the distortion is expressed as a false, fixed belief [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anorexia-nervosa-in-adults-clinical-features-course-of-illness-assessment-and-diagnosis/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].</p><p>Anorexia nervosa usually causes a functional hypothalamic amenorrhea in postmenarchal females, characterized by low levels of luteinizing hormone and follicle-stimulating hormone (despite low estrogen levels) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anorexia-nervosa-in-adults-clinical-features-course-of-illness-assessment-and-diagnosis/abstract/68,69\" class=\"abstract_t\">68,69</a>].

However, specific symptoms of anorexia nervosa (eg, weight loss) may overlap with symptoms of other psychiatric and medical illnesses [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anorexia-nervosa-in-adults-clinical-features-course-of-illness-assessment-and-diagnosis/abstract/1,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,11</a>]. Patients with these other illnesses are generally concerned about their weight loss and do not restrict their diet or exercise excessively; in addition, body image is usually not distorted. Some of the illnesses that resemble anorexia nervosa can also occur in conjunction with anorexia nervosa (eg, unipolar major depression).

In addition, patients with bulimia nervosa binge eat and purge, as do many patients with anorexia nervosa. Making the correct diagnosis is essential for treatment. </p><p>The key distinguishing feature of anorexia nervosa is an abnormally low body weight (body mass index &lt;18.5 <span class=\"nowrap\">kg/m<sup>2</sup>),</span> given the patient&rsquo;s age, sex, developmental trajectory, and physical health.

Secondarily, the low weight that occurs in anorexia nervosa is accompanied by structural and physiologic sequelae (eg, reduced cardiac mass and bone density) that are not found in bulimia nervosa.

However, restriction of energy intake in <span class=\"nowrap\">avoidant/restrictive</span> food intake disorder is due a lack of interest in food, aversion to the sensory characteristics (eg, appearance, smell, or taste) of food, or concern about aversive consequences of eating (eg, choking or vomiting). By contrast, restricted energy intake in anorexia nervosa is accompanied by fear of gaining weight or becoming fat, and disturbance in the way that body weight and shape are perceived and experienced.

Other features include perfectionism, cognitive and behavioral rigidity, feelings of ineffectiveness, inhibited expression of emotions, social withdrawal, poor insight, resistance to treatment, restlessness or hyperactivity, as well as symptoms and signs related to food and eating, such as preoccupation with food and rituals related to meals. (See <a href=\"#H29336301\" class=\"local\">'Clinical features'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients with anorexia nervosa frequently have a lifetime history of comorbid psychiatric disorders, including anxiety, depressive, impulse control, substance use, and personality disorders. In addition, patients are at increased risk for general medical complications and disorders.

Anorexia nervosa is associated with increased rates of all-cause mortality, and suicide deaths occur more often in patients than the general population.

Patients with suicidality should be seen more frequently and perhaps hospitalized, depending upon the estimated level of risk. A specific suicide plan of high lethality or intent indicates the need for hospitalization (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F73092\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef73092 \">table 4</a>).
