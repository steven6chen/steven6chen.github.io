Procedural risks are considerably higher in these patients compared with those without PAH. In addition, PDA closure does not appear to improve survival, and right-to-left ductal shunting may be necessary to maintain cardiac output during episodes of increasing pulmonary vascular resistance [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-patent-ductus-arteriosus-in-term-infants-children-and-adults/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>].

Closure eliminates the potential complications of PDA, particularly bacterial endocarditis, a rare but recognized complication of small PDA. An alternative approach is to defer closure and routinely follow the patient. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-patent-ductus-arteriosus-in-term-infants-children-and-adults#H9\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of patent ductus arteriosus in term infants, children, and adults&quot;, section on 'Small PDA'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-patent-ductus-arteriosus-in-term-infants-children-and-adults#H24\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of patent ductus arteriosus in term infants, children, and adults&quot;, section on 'Infective endocarditis'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Due to technologic advancements (eg, percutaneous occlusion and video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery for PDA ligation), PDA closure can be accomplished with minimal risks in children. (See <a href=\"#H9\" class=\"local\">'Percutaneous closure'</a> below and <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'Surgery'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">In adults with a small PDA, the American College of <span class=\"nowrap\">Cardiology/American</span> Heart Association Task Force on Practice Guidelines suggests percutaneous occlusion as a reasonable option even in the absence of left heart volume overload. If the PDA is left untreated, then routine follow-up every three to five years is recommended [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-patent-ductus-arteriosus-in-term-infants-children-and-adults/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Small silent PDA</strong> &mdash; The management of the &quot;silent ductus,&quot; which has no audible murmur, is controversial. Until more data are available, we suggest that the decision to close a silent PDA be individualized and based upon the clinician and the <span class=\"nowrap\">patient/family's</span> preference after a discussion reviewing the risks and theoretical benefits of the procedure.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">The silent PDA is detected incidentally by imaging studies (usually echocardiography, magnetic resonance imaging, or computed tomography) performed for other indications. As the sensitivity of two-dimensional and Doppler echocardiography has improved, this finding is encountered more frequently. Several studies have suggested that 0.5 to 1 percent of the population has a silent PDA [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-patent-ductus-arteriosus-in-term-infants-children-and-adults/abstract/6,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,7</a>], though these studies may underestimate the true incidence.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Silent PDAs do not have hemodynamic consequences, and, thus, the only impetus for closure is a theoretical increased risk of bacterial endocarditis. While there are case reports of bacterial endocarditis associated with a silent PDA [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-patent-ductus-arteriosus-in-term-infants-children-and-adults/abstract/8-11\" class=\"abstract_t\">8-11</a>], it is not possible to estimate the risk of endocarditis without first knowing the true incidence of silent PDA. Some experts advocate for closure of silent PDAs to prevent endocarditis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-patent-ductus-arteriosus-in-term-infants-children-and-adults/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. In contrast, others believe that the risk of endocarditis is not increased in patients with silent PDAs compared with the general population and therefore believe routine closure is not warranted [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-patent-ductus-arteriosus-in-term-infants-children-and-adults/abstract/6,12-14\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,12-14</a>].

Management decisions are dependent upon the size of the left-to-right shunt, the age and size of the patient, and the family's choice regarding the benefits (ie, prevention of long-term complications associated with PDA) versus the risks of intervention. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Indications for closure'</a> above.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Observation</strong> &minus; If elective closure is deferred, antibiotic prophylaxis is not necessary for medical or dental procedures. Patients need to be evaluated on a regular basis to monitor for signs of increased cardiac workload <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> pulmonary vascular changes. If these occur, PDA closure is recommended. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-patent-ductus-arteriosus-in-term-infants-children-and-adults#H24\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of patent ductus arteriosus in term infants, children, and adults&quot;, section on 'Infective endocarditis'</a> and <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Indications for closure'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>PDA closure</strong> &minus; Once the decision is made to proceed with PDA closure, the choice of therapeutic interventions is dependent upon the size and age of the patient, the size and morphology of the PDA, and the degree of shunting and symptomatology.</p><p/><p>Given the number of factors affecting the therapeutic choice for PDA closure, it is difficult to provide a simplified algorithm for management. Nonetheless, generalizations can be made to help simplify treatment decisions. In the following sections, the choice of treatment is based upon the age and size of the patient.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2975781514\"><span class=\"h2\">Premature infants</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In preterm infants, inhibitors of prostaglandin synthesis, such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=indomethacin-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">indomethacin</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ibuprofen-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">ibuprofen</a>, are used as the initial interventions for PDA closure. The management of PDA in premature infants is discussed in greater detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-patent-ductus-arteriosus-in-preterm-infants\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of patent ductus arteriosus in preterm infants&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2248455888\"><span class=\"h2\">Term infants &lt;6 kg</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In term neonates and older infants, inhibitors of prostaglandin synthesis (ie, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=indomethacin-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">indomethacin</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ibuprofen-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">ibuprofen</a>) are not effective for PDA closure and thus are not recommended. We suggest delaying closure if possible in infants &lt;6 kg since the risk of complications with percutaneous closure appears to be greater compared with larger infants and children [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-patent-ductus-arteriosus-in-term-infants-children-and-adults/abstract/15-17\" class=\"abstract_t\">15-17</a>]. At our institutions, we approach PDA management based upon symptoms as follows:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Asymptomatic</strong> &mdash;Infants without heart failure are observed with frequent monitoring of their cardiorespiratory status and growth until they are large enough to undergo percutaneous closure. If cardiorespiratory symptoms or growth impairment develop, medical management is initiated as described in the following section.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Symptomati</strong>c &mdash; In infants with large PDAs and symptomatic left-to-right shunting that results in heart failure (eg, poor feeding, failure to thrive, respiratory distress, and sweating), medical management is initiated with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=digoxin-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">digoxin</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=furosemide-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">furosemide</a>. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=heart-failure-in-children-management\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Heart failure in children: Management&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">If medical management fails, closure of the ductus is warranted. Surgical ligation is generally the preferred approach in infants &lt;6 kg, but percutaneous closure can be considered in select cases if ductal anatomy is favorable. Studies directly comparing percutaneous closure to surgical ligation in infants &lt;6 kg are lacking. In a report from the Improving Pediatric and Adult Congenital Treatments (IMPACT) registry that included data on 747 infants &lt;6 kg who underwent percutaneous PDA closure, the procedure was successful in 94.7 percent; however, the rate of major adverse events was 12.6 percent, which is 5- to 10-fold greater than that of children &gt;6 kg [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-patent-ductus-arteriosus-in-term-infants-children-and-adults/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. Similar success and adverse event rates were noted in a multicenter study from the United Kingdom [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-patent-ductus-arteriosus-in-term-infants-children-and-adults/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. In a meta-analysis of 38 uncontrolled studies evaluating percutaneous PDA closure in children &lt;1 year old, the pooled success rate was 92.2 percent; 76.7 percent had immediate ductal occlusion, and the majority closed within 24 hours [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-patent-ductus-arteriosus-in-term-infants-children-and-adults/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. However, the adverse event rate was 23.3 percent, and 12 of 13 major or catastrophic events occurred in infants &lt;6 kg.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">These data suggest that the risk of complications in percutaneous PDA closure in infants &lt;6 kg is higher than in larger infants and children. Thus, when choosing between a percutaneous versus surgical approach in an infant this size, clinicians should carefully weigh the individual risks and benefits, including consideration of ductal morphology, patient comorbidities, institutional expertise, and parental preferences.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2085421925\"><span class=\"h2\">Infants and children &gt;6 kg</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Percutaneous occlusion (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F93748\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef93748 \">image 1</a>) is generally preferred over surgical ligation in infants and children who weigh &ge;6 kg because it is less invasive, does not result in a surgical scar, and is at least as cost-effective, if not less expensive [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-patent-ductus-arteriosus-in-term-infants-children-and-adults/abstract/12,18-20\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,18-20</a>]. Surgical ligation is also a safe and effective option. As stated above, inhibitors of prostaglandin synthesis (ie, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=indomethacin-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">indomethacin</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ibuprofen-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">ibuprofen</a>) are ineffective in children and should not be used.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3144295451\"><span class=\"h3\">Occluder choice</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The choice of occluder (coil versus the various devices) is dependent upon ductal morphology and size, and the size of the patient.</p><p>Numerous studies have documented the safety and efficacy of coil occlusion for a small PDA (&lt;3 mm in diameter) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-patent-ductus-arteriosus-in-term-infants-children-and-adults/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. Although residual shunts are sometimes present immediately following coil occlusion, these shunts typically resolve after a few months [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-patent-ductus-arteriosus-in-term-infants-children-and-adults/abstract/21,22\" class=\"abstract_t\">21,22</a>].

(See <a href=\"#H10\" class=\"local\">'Coil occlusion'</a> below.)</p><p>As a result of the limitations of coil occlusion of larger PDAs, device occlusion is increasingly being utilized (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F93748\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef93748 \">image 1</a>). The Amplatzer ductal occluder (ADO) is the most commonly used device (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F73178\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef73178 \">picture 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F93728\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef93728 \">picture 2</a>). However, it is not recommended for use in infants who weigh less than 6 kg, or who are less than six months of age, as the rate of major adverse events and failure of the device is high in these patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-patent-ductus-arteriosus-in-term-infants-children-and-adults/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. In addition, the ductal ampulla must be able to accommodate the aortic retention disk, which can cause coarctation of the aorta if it is too large for the child's vasculature or is improperly situated. (See <a href=\"#H11\" class=\"local\">'Device occlusion'</a> below.)</p><p>In a multicenter case series of 496 PDA closures, device occluders were used in two-thirds and coils in the remaining one-third [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-patent-ductus-arteriosus-in-term-infants-children-and-adults/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. A device was used more frequently in younger patients (ie, &lt;3 years of age), patients &lt;11 kg, and patients with a minimum PDA diameter &gt;1.5 mm.

Importantly, there were no deaths among the patients who underwent PDA closure.</p><p>In a similar report of 29 adults (mean age 31.1, range 18 to 58 years) with PDAs and PAH (mean pulmonary vascular resistance 9.1 Wood units), 20 patients underwent successful PDA occlusion after demonstrating PAH reversibility during temporary PDA occlusion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-patent-ductus-arteriosus-in-term-infants-children-and-adults/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. Short-term follow-up (three to six months after PDA occlusion) demonstrated improvement in symptomatology and decreases in the sizes of the left atrium, left ventricular diastolic dimension, and pulmonary artery. Notably, an editorial accompanying this report raised concerns about such a strategy because of the potential of long-term morbidity and mortality associated with the removal of a potential right-to-left shunt, which may be needed to maintain cardiac output during episodes of increasing pulmonary vascular resistance due to progressive pulmonary vascular changes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-patent-ductus-arteriosus-in-term-infants-children-and-adults/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p>Until prospective data are available, decisions regarding PDA closure in patients with PAH should be individualized with careful consideration of the risks and benefits.

These patients have or are likely to develop Eisenmenger syndrome (PAH, right-to-left shunting, and cyanosis) and may need the shunt to maintain cardiac output. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-eisenmenger-syndrome\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of Eisenmenger syndrome&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Interventions for ductal closure include percutaneous catheter occlusion and surgical ligation. Once the decision is made for PDA closure, the age and size of the patient, and the availability of experienced clinicians to perform the procedure, dictate the choice of intervention. The general approach is as follows (see <a href=\"#H1612159580\" class=\"local\">'Management approach'</a> above and <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Therapeutic interventions'</a> above):</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Premature infants are discussed separately.

If the patient fails medical therapy and the PDA is not suitable for device closure, surgical ligation is indicated. (See <a href=\"#H2248455888\" class=\"local\">'Term infants &lt;6 kg'</a> above and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=heart-failure-in-children-management#H10100864\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Heart failure in children: Management&quot;, section on 'Pharmacologic therapy'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>In infants and children &gt;6 kg with indications for PDA closure, we suggest percutaneous PDA closure (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F93748\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef93748 \">image 1</a>) rather than surgical ligation (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=5\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2B</a>). Percutaneous PDA closure should be performed in centers with experienced pediatric interventional cardiologists. Surgical ligation is a reasonable alternative if experienced interventional services are not available.

Percutaneous PDA closure performed should be performed by experienced interventional cardiologists. (See <a href=\"#H677009823\" class=\"local\">'Adolescents and adults'</a> above and <a href=\"#H9\" class=\"local\">'Percutaneous closure'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In patients who undergo percutaneous PDA closure, the choice of occluders (coil versus device) is dependent upon the ductal morphology and size, and the size of the patient. (See <a href=\"#H3144295451\" class=\"local\">'Occluder choice'</a> above and <a href=\"#H9\" class=\"local\">'Percutaneous closure'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Follow-up is recommended at least every five years for adults who have undergone percutaneous PDA occlusion. Children who have undergone PDA closure are typically discharged from pediatric cardiology follow-up care after 6 to 12 months if there is no residual shunt, no pulmonary artery distortion or stenosis, and no aortic obstruction. For patients in whom elective closure is deferred, follow-up evaluations should occur on a regular basis to monitor for signs of increased cardiac workload <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> pulmonary vascular changes. If these occur, PDA closure is recommended.
