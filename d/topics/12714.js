Vaso-occlusion results in recurrent painful episodes and a variety of serious organ system complications that can lead to life-long disabilities and even death.</p><p>Hemoglobin S (HbS) results from the substitution of a valine for glutamic acid as the sixth amino acid of the beta-globin chain, which produces a hemoglobin tetramer <span class=\"nowrap\">(alpha2/betaS2)</span> that is poorly soluble when deoxygenated [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-variant-sickle-cell-syndromes/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. The polymerization of deoxy HbS is essential to vaso-occlusive phenomena [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-variant-sickle-cell-syndromes/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. The polymer assumes the form of an elongated rope-like fiber which usually aligns with other fibers, resulting in distortion of the affected red blood cell into the classic crescent or sickle shape and a marked decrease in red cell deformability. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sickle-hemoglobin-polymer-structure-and-functional-properties\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Sickle hemoglobin polymer: Structure and functional properties&quot;</a>.)</p><p>However, polymerization alone does not account for the pathophysiology of SCD. Subsequent changes in red cell membrane structure and function, disordered cell volume control, and increased adherence to vascular endothelium also play an important role [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-variant-sickle-cell-syndromes/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>].</p><p>Disease manifestations are most severe in patients with homozygous HbSS. There are a variety of other sickle cell syndromes that result from inheritance of the sickle cell gene in compound heterozygosity with other mutant beta globin genes, leading to disorders such as HbSC disease and sickle cell-beta thalassemia. The clinical characteristic of these variant sickle cell syndromes will be reviewed here. The clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and treatment of homozygous SCD are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-the-clinical-manifestations-of-sickle-cell-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of the clinical manifestations of sickle cell disease&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diagnosis-of-sickle-cell-disorders\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Diagnosis of sickle cell disorders&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-the-management-and-prognosis-of-sickle-cell-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of the management and prognosis of sickle cell disease&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Sickle cell trait (HbAS) in which one sickle cell beta-globin gene has been inherited along with a normal beta-globin gene (ie, <span class=\"nowrap\">alpha2/betaS1beta1)</span> is discussed separately.

Although oxygenated HbC forms crystals, HbC does not participate in polymerization with deoxy HbS [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-variant-sickle-cell-syndromes/abstract/4,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,5</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sickle-hemoglobin-polymer-structure-and-functional-properties\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Sickle hemoglobin polymer: Structure and functional properties&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The presence of HbC within the cell leads to enhanced and sustained potassium and chloride cotransport. The loss of K+ produces red cell dehydration and an increase in the intraerythrocytic concentration of HbS to levels that may support polymerization, sickling, and clinical symptoms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-variant-sickle-cell-syndromes/abstract/4,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,6</a>]. In vitro studies have found that, at the same total Hb concentration, a 50:50 HbS and HbC mixture undergoes polymerization 15 times more rapidly than a 40:60 HbS and HbA mixture; this difference is presumably due to the higher HbS concentration [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-variant-sickle-cell-syndromes/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].</p><p>The net effect is that compound heterozygosity for HbS and C results in a disease (HbSC) that is less severe than sickle cell disease (SCD) but more severe than sickle cell trait [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-variant-sickle-cell-syndromes/abstract/7,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,8</a>]. Anemia and reticulocytosis are frequently mild, with the majority of patients having a milder degree of anemia (hematocrit &gt;28 percent) than is usually seen in SCD. This difference is due to the longer survival of HbSC compared with HbSS red cells in the circulation (27 versus 17 days) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-variant-sickle-cell-syndromes/abstract/9,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,10</a>]. Splenomegaly may be the only physical finding.</p><p>The predominant red cell abnormality on the peripheral smear is an abundance of target cells. Folded (pita bread, clam-shell) cells, irreversibly sickled cells, &quot;billiard ball&quot; cells, and crystal-containing cells also may be seen (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F71393\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef71393 \">picture 1</a>)&nbsp;[<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-variant-sickle-cell-syndromes/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. There are approximately equal amounts of HbS and HbC on hemoglobin electrophoresis, although the proportion of HbS may be 10 to 15 percent higher than in cells from individuals with sickle cell trait, due to charge considerations that affect hemoglobin subunit assembly [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-variant-sickle-cell-syndromes/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Clinical course</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Individuals with HbSC disease are at risk for the same life-threatening complications as HbSS but at a decreased frequency. A small subset of HbSC patients have a clinical phenotype similar to HbSS.

However, it does not occur prior to age four, and routine administration of prophylactic penicillin may not be necessary in infants and young children.

It is important to remember that if cellulose acetate electrophoresis is used, HbC may migrate with Hbs E, O-Arab, and C-Harlem. Thus, two independent hemoglobin electrophoresis techniques are necessary in order to distinguish HbSC from HbSC Harlem and other compound heterozygotes. Target cells predominate on the peripheral blood smear and sickled cells are relatively uncommon; rare sickled cells may be canoe-shaped (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F71393\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef71393 \">picture 1</a>).

Beta thalassemia is due to impaired production of beta globin chains, which leads to a relative excess of alpha globin chains. These excess alpha globin chains are unstable, incapable of forming soluble tetramers on their own, and precipitate within the cell, leading to a variety of clinical manifestations. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pathophysiology-of-beta-thalassemia\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pathophysiology of beta thalassemia&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3290041\"><span class=\"h2\">Incidence and classification</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The gene frequency of beta thalassemia among African-Americans is 0.004, one-tenth that of the sickle cell gene [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-variant-sickle-cell-syndromes/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. As a result, the prevalence of compound heterozygous sickle cell-beta thalassemia is one-tenth that of sickle cell anemia (HbSS) in this population. In addition to the African-American population, people of Hispanic descent are at risk for sickle-beta thalassemia. In California, 12.5 percent of newborns with sickle-beta thalassemia have Hispanic origin [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-variant-sickle-cell-syndromes/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>].</p><p>Sickle cell-beta thalassemia is divided into sickle cell-beta<sup>0</sup> thalassemia and sickle cell-beta<sup>+</sup> thalassemia, based upon the complete absence beta globin or the presence of reduced amounts of beta globin, respectively, which in turn determines the level of HbA [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-variant-sickle-cell-syndromes/abstract/35,36\" class=\"abstract_t\">35,36</a>]. Most beta thalassemia mutations among African-Americans result in beta<sup>+</sup> thalassemia. The percentage of HbA produced in individuals with beta<sup>+</sup> thalassemia varies from 5 to 30 percent, depending upon the molecular defect of the mutation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-variant-sickle-cell-syndromes/abstract/37-39\" class=\"abstract_t\">37-39</a>]. As an example, those with a beta thalassemia mutation of -29(A--&gt;G) have a high hemoglobin A level and a mild clinical course.</p><p>Eighty percent of African-American beta thalassemia mutations are due to promoter region mutations that result in a mild phenotype in which HbA accounts for 18 to 25 percent of total hemoglobin [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-variant-sickle-cell-syndromes/abstract/37,38\" class=\"abstract_t\">37,38</a>]. Compound heterozygous sickle cell-beta<sup>0</sup> thalassemia, which results in the production of no normal beta chains and therefore no HbA, occurs infrequently in the African-American population, but more commonly in the Greek, Middle Eastern, and Mediterranean regions.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3290054\"><span class=\"h2\">Clinical manifestations</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The hematologic and clinical severity of sickle cell-beta thalassemia is an inverse function of the quantity of HbA [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-variant-sickle-cell-syndromes/abstract/39,40\" class=\"abstract_t\">39,40</a>].</p><p>Patients with sickle cell-beta<sup>0</sup> thalassemia (ie, no HbA production) have a clinical course as severe as homozygous sickle cell disease (SCD; ie, HbSS, sickle cell anemia) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-variant-sickle-cell-syndromes/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>]. As examples:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The Cooperative Study of Sickle Cell Disease (over 3000 patients) found that the incidence and severity of painful events and acute chest syndrome were similar between individuals with HbSS and hemoglobin S-beta<sup>0</sup> disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-variant-sickle-cell-syndromes/abstract/13,41\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,41</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A review of 84 patients suggested that pulmonary hypertension is also comparable between sickle beta<sup>0</sup> thalassemia and HbSS [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-variant-sickle-cell-syndromes/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Individuals with sickle beta<sup>0</sup> thalassemia were found in some studies to have a high rate of ischemic brain injury [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-variant-sickle-cell-syndromes/abstract/15,43\" class=\"abstract_t\">15,43</a>]. In neurologically asymptomatic sickle beta<sup>0 </sup>patients, transcranial Doppler and MRI abnormalities are found [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-variant-sickle-cell-syndromes/abstract/44\" class=\"abstract_t\">44</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Sickle beta<sup>0</sup> thalassemia patients typically develop functional asplenia in early infancy, have an increased rate of sepsis, and have an associated increased risk of pneumococcal sepsis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-variant-sickle-cell-syndromes/abstract/45\" class=\"abstract_t\">45</a>]. Those with sickle cell beta<sup>0</sup> thalassemia, however, do not undergo the rapid splenic infarction seen in HbSS and continue to have splenic enlargement, often into adulthood. This results in these patients having a continued risk of acute sequestration crisis and hypersplenism.</p><p/><p>In sickle beta<sup>0</sup> thalassemia, hemoglobin analysis is similar to that in HbSS disease. Nearly all the hemoglobin consists of HbS, and there is no HbA present. Differences in the HbF and HbA2 levels may be useful in distinguishing these syndromes (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F116210\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef116210 \">table 1</a>), but these differences are not consistent and reliable. The HbA2 and HbF levels may overlap among sickle variants. In addition, the presence of microcytosis or of one parent without sickle cell trait are useful indicators of sickle cell-beta<sup>0</sup> thalassemia. One needs to keep in mind, however, that alpha thalassemia trait is a common finding in sickle cell anemia and may cause microcytosis without a beta thalassemia mutation.</p><p>Individuals with sickle cell-beta<sup>+</sup> thalassemia (ie, low HbA production) generally have a more benign clinical course than those with sickle cell-beta<sup>0</sup> thalassemia or HbSS because individuals with sickle cell-beta<sup>+</sup> thalassemia have more HbA. Acute painful events do occur, but are less than half those seen in HbSS [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-variant-sickle-cell-syndromes/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. Similarly, central nervous system (CNS) events are much less common, but do occur.</p><p>The lesser severity of sickle cell-beta<sup>+</sup> thalassemia was illustrated in the following studies:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>One study compared clinical findings in 27 patients with sickle cell-beta<sup>+</sup> thalassemia and 28 patients with sickle cell-beta<sup>0</sup> thalassemia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-variant-sickle-cell-syndromes/abstract/46\" class=\"abstract_t\">46</a>].

There was a higher incidence of proliferative retinopathy in individuals with sickle cell-beta<sup>+</sup> thalassemia (18 versus 10 percent), consistent with an association of higher hematocrits (and blood viscosity) with ocular complications.
