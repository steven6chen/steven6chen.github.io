MRI also has a role as a noninvasive means of imaging the biliary tree.

During realignment of the protons, energy is released and sampled at different time intervals. The measured signal intensity from this energy depends upon the degree and rate of realignment within a very specific time period, which in turn depends upon the water and fat content of the different tissues. These signals are then converted into grayscale cross-sectional images that can be depicted in multiple planes or in three dimensions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/magnetic-resonance-imaging-of-the-hepatobiliary-tract/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p>The T1 and T2 relaxation times are important parameters determining image and lesion contrast with reference to normal liver parenchyma.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The T1 relaxation time (and the resulting T1-weighted image) refers to the time required for protons to fully realign within an external magnetic field following exposure to a radio wave pulse of specific strength and duration</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The T2 relaxation time (and the resulting T2-weighted image) describes the rate at which protons are put out of phase with respect to adjacent protons</p><p/><p>These two measurements affect the signal intensities of tissues being imaged and are therefore crucial for creation of the final images. As an example, water has low signal intensity (dark) on T1-weighted images but high intensity (bright) on T2-weighted images, with the reverse being true for fat. Each tissue in the body has characteristic T1- and T2-weighted signal intensities. In particular, abnormal tissue such as tumor will differ from adjacent normal tissue because of a variety of factors including tissue water content, different contrast enhancement properties, and vascularity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/magnetic-resonance-imaging-of-the-hepatobiliary-tract/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">T1 sequences</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Breath-hold spoiled gradient echo (SGE) is a T1-weighted sequence in which the entire liver can be imaged during a single suspended respiration in &lt;6 seconds. The advantages of this technique also include strong T1 weighting and a good signal-to-noise ratio. In&ndash;phase and out-of-phase T1-weighted SGE sequences are used to detect fatty liver. Three-dimensional gradient echo (GRE) imaging is a T1-weighted modality that provides good segmental and vascular anatomy for surgical planning.</p><p>A non-contrast T1&ndash;weighted sequence is of foremost importance in lesion detection and characterization. Hemorrhagic lesions, those with high <span class=\"nowrap\">protein/fat</span> content, and those with melanin are high in signal on T1 sequences. Lesions with a high fluid content (such as simple cyst and hemangioma) are very low in signal. Hypovascular and fibrotic lesions (such as colon cancer metastases) are moderately low in signal.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">T2 sequences</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The most commonly used T2-weighted sequence is breathing averaged, conventional or accelerated spin echo featuring a train of echoes, combined with fat suppression. Fat suppression improves visualization of regions bordered by fat, as in the subcapsular parenchyma, in addition to decreasing the motion artifact from subcutaneous and intra-abdominal fat. Breathing independent sequences are used in patients who are incapable of breathing regularly. The main value of these images is in distinguishing cysts and hemangiomas (which have high fluid content) from hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and metastases (which have low fluid content). Heavily T2-weighted sequences are sensitive for exposing the super paramagnetic effects of intracellular ferritin and hemosiderin. Thus, they can be useful for diagnosing hemochromatosis (see <a href=\"#H13\" class=\"local\">'Iron overload'</a> below). They can also be valuable for detecting metastases, and in differentiating siderotic nodules from HCC in the cirrhotic liver [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/magnetic-resonance-imaging-of-the-hepatobiliary-tract/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">MR angiography</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Techniques have been developed whereby the signal arising from blood (arterial or venous) flowing into a region of interest is detected and depicted as an angiographic image in multiple planes. Unlike conventional angiography, no intravenous or arterial contrast material is required and the direction of flow is easily determined.</p><p>Within the hepatobiliary tract, MR angiography is useful for determining portal vein patency, the direction of flow in the intrahepatic and extrahepatic portal venous system, and for identifying nonocclusive thrombus or cavernous transformation of the portal vein. These are important parameters in the work-up of patients prior to liver transplantation. Furthermore, MR angiography plays a role in the staging of patients with hepatobiliary malignancy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/magnetic-resonance-imaging-of-the-hepatobiliary-tract/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].</p><p>Metal clips and stents produce artifact and signal void on MRI. As a result, MR angiography is not useful for evaluating TIPS stent patency [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/magnetic-resonance-imaging-of-the-hepatobiliary-tract/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">MR contrast agents</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Dynamic contrast-enhanced MR uses paramagnetic contrast agents (such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=gadopentetate-dimeglumine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">gadopentetate dimeglumine</a>) that act in a similar manner to the CT iodinated contrast agents. The use of contrast agents improves the characterization of liver tumors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/magnetic-resonance-imaging-of-the-hepatobiliary-tract/abstract/4-7\" class=\"abstract_t\">4-7</a>]. The contrast agents are hyperintense on T1-weighted images and can help determine lesion vascularity and characterize both benign and malignant liver lesions. Allergic reactions are extremely rare following intravenous administration of these drugs. However, there have been cases of nephrogenic systemic fibrosis related to the use of gadolinium in patients with renal disease. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nephrogenic-systemic-fibrosis-nephrogenic-fibrosing-dermopathy-in-advanced-renal-failure#H4\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Nephrogenic systemic fibrosis/nephrogenic fibrosing dermopathy in advanced renal failure&quot;, section on 'Gadolinium'</a>.)</p><p>A variety of newer contrast agents are now being used that are distinguished by their functional properties and unique biodistributions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/magnetic-resonance-imaging-of-the-hepatobiliary-tract/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. The broader categories include intravascular agents that remain within the blood pool (also called blood pool agents), contrast agents that are excreted into the bile and are used for delineating the biliary system, and agents that target the reticuloendothelial system. The hepatobiliary agents are taken up by functioning hepatocytes and are excreted into the bile, increasing conspicuity of the liver, the bile ducts, and liver lesions that contain bile ducts such as focal nodular hyperplasia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/magnetic-resonance-imaging-of-the-hepatobiliary-tract/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. Ferumoxides are reticuloendothelial cell-specific iron particles used for detecting hepatic tumors, but are not commercially available everywhere (including the United States) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/magnetic-resonance-imaging-of-the-hepatobiliary-tract/abstract/4-7\" class=\"abstract_t\">4-7</a>]. Since these contrast agents are phagocytosed by the reticuloendothelial system (Kupffer cells) in the liver and spleen, normal liver parenchyma has a decreased signal on T2-weighted images whereas no signal loss is seen where these cells are absent, as in tumors.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL ROLE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The advantages of MRI include excellent contrast resolution, multiplanar imaging, and avoidance of radiation exposure. The major disadvantages of MRI are motion artifacts, high cost, availability, and claustrophobia, which is experienced by some patients. These are being improved with the development of open MR magnets and software that reduces motion artifact. This section will briefly describe some of the major clinical uses of MRI in patients with suspected hepatobiliary disease. The use of MRI and other imaging studies in the individual disorders and for imaging of the pancreas and biliary tract (ie, magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography) are discussed in detail in the appropriate topic reviews. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=magnetic-resonance-cholangiopancreatography\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography&quot;</a>.)</p><p>MRI and computerized tomography (CT) are both powerful imaging techniques for the detection and characterization of liver lesions (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=computed-tomography-of-the-hepatobiliary-tract\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Computed tomography of the hepatobiliary tract&quot;</a>). CT has been considered to be superior to MRI for evaluating extrahepatic organs and calcifications [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/magnetic-resonance-imaging-of-the-hepatobiliary-tract/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>], although this paradigm has been challenged in more recent studies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/magnetic-resonance-imaging-of-the-hepatobiliary-tract/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. MRI is more specific than CT for characterizing cavernous hemangiomas, diffuse hepatic steatosis, and focal fatty infiltration, where fat suppression techniques can be used to confirm the presence of fat within tissue being imaged [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/magnetic-resonance-imaging-of-the-hepatobiliary-tract/abstract/1,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,12</a>]. MRI is also useful for identifying, hypervascular metastases, such as islet cell carcinoma, carcinoid tumors, thyroid tumors, renal cell carcinoma, and melanoma.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Hemangiomas</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>MRI can differentiate hemangiomas from other hypervascular liver lesions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/magnetic-resonance-imaging-of-the-hepatobiliary-tract/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. Hemangiomas are well circumscribed homogeneous masses with high signal intensity on T2-weighted images. However, a giant cavernous hemangioma may be more irregular and inhomogeneous. After gadolinium injection, a hemangioma demonstrates enhancement similar to that seen on bolus contrast CT with early peripheral enhancement and late complete filling. Persistent hyperintensity on T1-weighted delayed images is very specific for hemangioma, and helps differentiate it from other vascular hepatic lesions. Hepatic cysts may have similar characteristics to hemangiomas but do not enhance following gadolinium administration.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h2\">Focal nodular hyperplasia and hepatic adenomas</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>MRI can be useful for identifying focal nodular hyperplasia (FNH) and distinguishing it from hepatic adenomas. FNH characteristically shows a well-circumscribed mass that is isointense on both T1- and T2- weighted images. Unfortunately, the characteristic hyperintense central scar on the T2-weighted images is seen in only one-half of cases (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=focal-nodular-hyperplasia\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Focal nodular hyperplasia&quot;</a>). With the increasing use of hepatobiliary contrast agents, the capacity for distinguishing FNH from hepatic adenoma on MRI has been strengthened, with FNH typically demonstrating increased retention of this contrast agent when compared with hepatic adenoma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/magnetic-resonance-imaging-of-the-hepatobiliary-tract/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h2\">Hepatocellular carcinoma</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Hepatocellular carcinomas (HCCs) are generally hypointense on T1-weighted images and hyperintense on T2-weighted images, although variations to this rule have been increasingly reported. MRI is of value in identifying and definitely characterizing HCCs, as well as defining the relationship of tumor to blood vessels and in distinguishing small HCCs from small hemangiomas. Following intravenous contrast administration, HCCs demonstrate typical enhancement characteristics, appearing hyperintense on arterial-phase imaging and demonstrating &quot;wash-out&quot; or relative hypointensity on subsequent phases. More recently, diffusion-weighted imaging and the use of hepatobiliary contrast agents have been found to further improve the diagnostic utility of MRI in the application to HCC imaging [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/magnetic-resonance-imaging-of-the-hepatobiliary-tract/abstract/15,16\" class=\"abstract_t\">15,16</a>]. </p><p>The fibrolamellar variant of HCC, while rare, is homogenous and hypointense on T1 sequences, and heterogeneous and hyperintense on T2 sequences. The central scar is hypointense on both T1 and T2 images as a result of its fibrous composition. This helps in distinguishing this lesion from the hyperintense scar associated with focal nodular hyperplasia. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-treatment-of-fibrolamellar-carcinoma#H3607601815\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Epidemiology, clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and treatment of fibrolamellar carcinoma&quot;, section on 'Imaging'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h2\">Metastases</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Metastatic lesions are typically hypointense on T1 sequences and are mildly hyperintense on T2 images. The characteristic feature of metastases is a ring of enhancement on hepatic arterial dominant&ndash;phase images. They may also show peripheral or heterogeneous washout of contrast in the hepatic venous phase and washout to hypointensity with liver in hypervascular metastatic lesions. Two situations where MRI is most useful in evaluation of metastatic liver lesions are in the patient with suspected diffuse metastatic disease in whom CT or US might underestimate tumor burden and in the patient with fatty infiltration [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/magnetic-resonance-imaging-of-the-hepatobiliary-tract/abstract/17-20\" class=\"abstract_t\">17-20</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h2\">Imaging the cirrhotic liver</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>MRI has an important role in characterizing masses in a cirrhotic liver [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/magnetic-resonance-imaging-of-the-hepatobiliary-tract/abstract/1,5-7,10,21\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,5-7,10,21</a>]. In this setting, a mass may be caused by a hepatocellular carcinoma (hepatoma), a regenerative nodule, or focal fatty infiltration, among other etiologies. Dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI appears to be more sensitive for the detection of hepatoma than standard MRI.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A dysplastic nodule refers to a nodular region of hepatocytes 1 mm or greater in diameter with dysplasia but without definite histologic features of malignancy. The combination of iso- or hyperintensity on T1 sequences and hypointensity on T2 images strongly suggests a dysplastic nodule. The reasons for the high intensity on T1 images include fatty change, intratumoral copper, and increased zinc in the surrounding parenchyma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/magnetic-resonance-imaging-of-the-hepatobiliary-tract/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. Dysplastic nodules with foci of hepatocellular carcinoma may show enhancement in the arterial phase-images of dynamic MRI, and have a high intensity on T2-weighted images.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Malignant degeneration within a cirrhotic liver should be suspected when a nodule or a mass is hyperintense (or heterogeneous with zones of hyperintense signal) on T2-weighted images. Almost one-half of malignant tumors also have a homogeneously increased signal intensity on T1-weighted images. The increased signal is thought to be caused by steatosis, hemorrhage, or possibly deposition of copper in the tumor. MRI may also show evidence of vascular invasion by large hepatic tumors.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Regenerative nodules usually remain low in signal intensity on T2-weighted images, mimicking the signal intensity of normal hepatic parenchyma. Low signal intensity in the center of regenerative nodules may be due to iron deposition.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Focal fatty infiltration can be differentiated from true hepatic masses using the difference in procession frequency between fat and water protons.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h2\">Iron overload</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Iron overload can be detected by MRI and the degree of iron deposition can be estimated [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/magnetic-resonance-imaging-of-the-hepatobiliary-tract/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. Patients with hereditary hemochromatosis have generalized decreased signal intensity throughout the liver and pancreas, whereas those with secondary iron overloading (reticuloendothelial deposition) have decreased signal in the liver, spleen, and bone marrow.</p><p>However, these features may overlap and there are important limitations in the use of MRI to measure hepatic iron. In particular, the presence of concomitant fibrosis, fat, or inflammation makes accurate estimates of hepatic iron derived from magnetic resonance imaging more challenging [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/magnetic-resonance-imaging-of-the-hepatobiliary-tract/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. This is an important issue in patients with suspected hereditary hemochromatosis, since accurate assessment of hepatic iron (usually estimated from the hepatic iron index) and the response to quantitative phlebotomy are, in the absence of genetic testing, the major methods used to distinguish homozygotes at risk for the complications of hereditary hemochromatosis from heterozygotes who typically follow a benign course. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=approach-to-the-patient-with-suspected-iron-overload#H3417843\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Approach to the patient with suspected iron overload&quot;, section on 'Response to phlebotomy'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14\"><span class=\"h2\">Pancreatic cancer</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Obstructing lesions of the hepatobiliary system are usually evaluated by ultrasonography and endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography. MRI can visualize both the bile and pancreatic ducts and, in patients with pancreatic cancer, it may be useful when attempted ERCP is either totally unsuccessful or provides incomplete information because of pancreatic duct obstruction (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F76159\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef76159 \">image 1</a>)&nbsp;[<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/magnetic-resonance-imaging-of-the-hepatobiliary-tract/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. In a prospective single-center study 193 patients with a pancreatic mass and no obvious distant metastasis were subjected to six imaging procedures; Ultrasound, endoscopic ultrasound, ERCP, helical CT, MRI including MRCP and MRA and FDG-PET. Confirmation of a suspected neoplastic process was best achieved with CT and MRI (positive likelihood ratio &gt;5) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/magnetic-resonance-imaging-of-the-hepatobiliary-tract/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>].
