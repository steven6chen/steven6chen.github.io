According to the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES III), over 20 million Americans are estimated to have gallbladder disease (defined as the presence of gallstones on transabdominal ultrasound or a history of cholecystectomy) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/choledocholithiasis-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-management/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Among those with gallbladder disease, the exact incidence and prevalence of choledocholithiasis are not known, but it has been estimated that 5 to 20 percent of patients have choledocholithiasis at the time of cholecystectomy, with the incidence increasing with age [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/choledocholithiasis-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-management/abstract/2-8\" class=\"abstract_t\">2-8</a>].</p><p>In Western countries, most cases of choledocholithiasis are secondary to the passage of gallstones from the gallbladder into the common bile duct. Primary choledocholithiasis (ie, formation of stones within the common bile duct) is less common. Primary choledocholithiasis typically occurs in the setting of bile stasis (eg, patients with cystic fibrosis), resulting in a higher propensity for intraductal stone formation. Older adults with large bile ducts and periampullary diverticular are at elevated risk for the formation of primary bile duct stones. Patients with recurrent or persistent infection involving the biliary system are also at risk, a phenomenon seen most commonly in populations from East Asia. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=recurrent-pyogenic-cholangitis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Recurrent pyogenic cholangitis&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The causes of primary choledocholithiasis often affect the biliary tract diffusely, so patients may have both extrahepatic and intrahepatic biliary stones. Intrahepatic stones may be complicated by recurrent pyogenic cholangitis.</p><p>This topic will review the clinical manifestations and diagnosis of choledocholithiasis. The treatment of choledocholithiasis, as well as the epidemiology and the general management of patients with gallstones, are discussed separately:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=endoscopic-management-of-bile-duct-stones-standard-techniques-and-mechanical-lithotripsy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Endoscopic management of bile duct stones: Standard techniques and mechanical lithotripsy&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epidemiology-of-and-risk-factors-for-gallstones\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Epidemiology of and risk factors for gallstones&quot;</a>.) </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=approach-to-the-patient-with-incidental-gallstones\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Approach to the patient with incidental gallstones&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=uncomplicated-gallstone-disease-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Uncomplicated gallstone disease in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=patient-selection-for-the-nonsurgical-treatment-of-gallstone-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Patient selection for the nonsurgical treatment of gallstone disease&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nonsurgical-treatment-of-gallstones\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Nonsurgical treatment of gallstones&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H972627859\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL MANIFESTATIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients with choledocholithiasis typically present with biliary-type pain and laboratory testing that reveals a cholestatic pattern of liver test abnormalities (ie, elevated bilirubin and alkaline phosphatase). Patients with uncomplicated choledocholithiasis are typically afebrile and have a normal complete blood count and pancreatic enzyme levels. Occasionally, patients are asymptomatic. In such patients, the diagnosis may be suspected because of abnormal liver blood tests, abnormalities seen on imaging studies obtained for unrelated reasons, or when an intraoperative cholangiogram obtained during cholecystectomy suggests the presence of a common bile duct stone. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=approach-to-the-patient-with-abnormal-liver-biochemical-and-function-tests#H19408712\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Approach to the patient with abnormal liver biochemical and function tests&quot;, section on 'Patterns of liver test abnormalities'</a>.)</p><p>Complications of choledocholithiasis include acute pancreatitis and acute cholangitis. Patients with acute pancreatitis typically have elevated serum pancreatic enzyme levels, and patients with acute cholangitis are often febrile with a leukocytosis. Rarely, patients with long-standing biliary obstruction develop secondary biliary cirrhosis. (See <a href=\"#H972627896\" class=\"local\">'Complicated choledocholithiasis'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H29487625\"><span class=\"h2\">Uncomplicated choledocholithiasis</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H972627867\"><span class=\"h3\">Symptoms</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Most patients with choledocholithiasis are symptomatic, although occasional patients are asymptomatic. Symptoms associated with choledocholithiasis include right upper quadrant or epigastric pain, nausea, and vomiting. The pain is often more prolonged than is seen with typical biliary colic (which typically resolves within six hours). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=uncomplicated-gallstone-disease-in-adults#H8995491\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Uncomplicated gallstone disease in adults&quot;, section on 'Biliary colic'</a>.)</p><p>The pain from choledocholithiasis resolves when the stone either passes spontaneously or is removed. Some patients have intermittent pain due to transient blockage of the common bile duct. Transient blockage occurs when there is retention and floating of stones or debris within the bile duct, a phenomenon referred to as a &quot;ball-valve&quot; effect.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H17163900\"><span class=\"h3\">Physical examination</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>On physical examination, patients with choledocholithiasis often have right upper quadrant or epigastric tenderness. Patients may also appear jaundiced. Courvoisier's sign (a palpable gallbladder on physical examination) may be seen when gallbladder dilation develops because of an obstruction of the common bile duct. It is more often associated with malignant common bile duct obstruction, but has been reported with choledocholithiasis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/choledocholithiasis-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-management/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H17163700\"><span class=\"h3\">Laboratory tests</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) concentrations are typically elevated early in the course of biliary obstruction. Later, liver tests are typically elevated in a cholestatic pattern, with increases in serum bilirubin, alkaline phosphatase, and gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase (GGT) exceeding the elevations in serum ALT and AST. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=approach-to-the-patient-with-abnormal-liver-biochemical-and-function-tests#H19408712\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Approach to the patient with abnormal liver biochemical and function tests&quot;, section on 'Patterns of liver test abnormalities'</a>.)</p><p>Studies have attempted to estimate the predictive value of liver chemistry tests for choledocholithiasis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/choledocholithiasis-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-management/abstract/8,10-12\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,10-12</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A meta-analysis of 22 studies<strong> </strong>evaluated the predictive role of multiple examination findings and tests used in the diagnosis of choledocholithiasis, including serum bilirubin and alkaline phosphatase [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/choledocholithiasis-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-management/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. An elevation in serum bilirubin had a sensitivity of 69 percent and a specificity of 88 percent for diagnosing a common bile duct stone. For elevations in serum alkaline phosphatase, the values were 57 and 86 percent, respectively.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A study of 1002 patients who underwent laparoscopic cholecystectomy for cholelithiasis evaluated five liver-related biochemical tests for predicting choledocholithiasis: serum GGT, alkaline phosphatase, total bilirubin, ALT, and AST [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/choledocholithiasis-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-management/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. The sensitivities ranged from 64 percent for AST to 84 percent for GGT, and the specificities ranged from 68 percent for ALT to 88 percent for bilirubin. Elevated serum GGT, alkaline phosphatase, and bilirubin levels were independent predictors of a common bile duct stone on multivariable analysis (odds ratios of 3.2, 2.0, and 1.4, respectively).</p><p/><p>Since liver tests may be elevated due to a wide variety of etiologies, the positive predictive value of elevated liver tests is poor. On the other hand, the negative predictive value of normal liver tests is high. Thus, normal liver tests play a greater role in excluding choledocholithiasis than elevated liver tests play in diagnosing stones.</p><p>Improving liver blood tests combined with symptom resolution suggests that a patient with choledocholithiasis has spontaneously passed the gallstone.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H972627896\"><span class=\"h2\">Complicated choledocholithiasis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The two major complications associated with choledocholithiasis are pancreatitis and acute cholangitis. In addition to the findings associated with uncomplicated choledocholithiasis, patients with biliary pancreatitis typically present with nausea, vomiting, elevations in serum amylase and lipase (by definition greater than three times the upper limit of normal), <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> imaging findings suggestive of acute pancreatitis. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-acute-pancreatitis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of acute pancreatitis&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Patients with acute cholangitis often present with Charcot's triad (fever, right upper quadrant pain, and jaundice) and leukocytosis. In severe cases, bacteremia and sepsis may lead to hypotension and altered mental status (Reynolds' pentad). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acute-cholangitis#H5\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Acute cholangitis&quot;, section on 'Clinical manifestations'</a>.)</p><p>Long-standing biliary obstruction from various causes, including common bile duct stones, may result in liver disease that may progress to cirrhosis, a phenomenon referred to as secondary biliary cirrhosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/choledocholithiasis-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-management/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>]. Although rare in the setting of bile duct stones, secondary biliary cirrhosis may eventually result in the same cirrhosis-related complications that occur with other etiologies. Relief of biliary obstruction has been shown to result in regression of liver fibrosis in patients with secondary biliary cirrhosis in the setting of chronic pancreatitis and choledochal cysts [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/choledocholithiasis-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-management/abstract/3,4\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,4</a>]. It is likely, but not known, whether stone removal results in similar improvement in liver disease in patients with choledocholithiasis-induced secondary biliary cirrhosis.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H17164061\"><span class=\"h1\">DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients suspected of having choledocholithiasis are diagnosed with a combination of laboratory tests and imaging studies. The first imaging study obtained is typically a transabdominal ultrasound. Additional testing may include magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography (MRCP), endoscopic ultrasound (EUS), <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP). </p><p>The aim of the diagnostic evaluation is to confirm or exclude the presence of common bile duct stones using the least invasive, most accurate, and most cost-effective imaging modality [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/choledocholithiasis-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-management/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. The specific approach is determined by the level of clinical suspicion, availability of imaging modalities, and patient factors (eg, contraindications to a particular test) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F66945\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef66945 \">algorithm 1</a>). (See <a href=\"#H17164458\" class=\"local\">'Diagnostic approach'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H17164458\"><span class=\"h2\">Diagnostic approach</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients are often suspected of having choledocholithiasis when they present with right upper quadrant pain with elevated liver enzymes in a primarily cholestatic pattern (disproportionate elevation of the alkaline phosphatase, gamma-glutamyl transferase, and bilirubin). In a patient suspected of having choledocholithiasis based on the history, physical exam, and laboratory testing, we start by obtaining a transabdominal ultrasound. If not already done, we also obtain a complete blood count to look for leukocytosis (which may suggest acute cholangitis has developed) and pancreatic enzyme levels. (See <a href=\"#H972627986\" class=\"local\">'Transabdominal ultrasound'</a> below.)</p><p>We then use the results of laboratory tests and transabdominal ultrasound to stratify a patient as high risk, intermediate risk, or low risk for having choledocholithiasis. Subsequent management varies depending on the patient's level of risk (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F66945\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef66945 \">algorithm 1</a>).

In such patients, the appropriate first step in treatment is ERCP with removal of any common bile duct stones, followed by elective cholecystectomy. (See <a href=\"#H972628121\" class=\"local\">'Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography'</a> below and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=endoscopic-management-of-bile-duct-stones-standard-techniques-and-mechanical-lithotripsy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Endoscopic management of bile duct stones: Standard techniques and mechanical lithotripsy&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H17164114\"><span class=\"h3\">Intermediate-risk patients</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Intermediate-risk patients have an estimated 10 to 50 percent probability of having a common bile duct stone. Such patients require evaluation to rule out choledocholithiasis, but the risk is not high enough to warrant going directly to ERCP [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/choledocholithiasis-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-management/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. Less invasive options for detecting choledocholithiasis include EUS and MRCP. Deciding which test should be performed first depends on various factors such as ease of availability, cost, patient-related factors, and the suspicion for a small stone (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F73388\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef73388 \">table 1</a>). (See <a href=\"#H972628153\" class=\"local\">'EUS and MRCP'</a> below.)</p><p>Because it is noninvasive, MRCP is often the first test performed to look for stones. If positive, patients should undergo ERCP. In most cases, if the MRCP is negative the patient can proceed to elective cholecystectomy (provided gallstones or biliary sludge were demonstrated on preoperative imaging). However, if the MRCP is negative, but the suspicion for a common bile duct stone remains moderate to high (eg, in a patient whose laboratory tests are not improving), EUS is an appropriate next step. In many centers, the endoscopist performing the EUS can perform an ERCP during the same session if a stone is found. </p><p>An alternative to preoperative imaging is to proceed to laparoscopic cholecystectomy with intraoperative cholangiography or ultrasonography, provided a surgeon who is experienced with the techniques is available. This approach was examined in a randomized trial with 100 patients at intermediate risk of having a common bile duct stone [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/choledocholithiasis-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-management/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. Patients were assigned to either proceed directly to laparoscopic cholecystectomy with intraoperative cholangiography or to initial EUS followed by ERCP if positive, and subsequent laparoscopic cholecystectomy. Patients who proceeded directly to surgery had a shorter median length of stay than those who underwent EUS first (5 versus 8 days) and overall had fewer EUSs, MRCPs, and ERCPs (25 versus 71). There were no differences between the groups with regard to conversion to laparotomy, time in the operating room, complications, or death. (See <a href=\"#H972628315\" class=\"local\">'Intraoperative cholangiography'</a> below and <a href=\"#H972628573\" class=\"local\">'Intraoperative ultrasonography'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H17164120\"><span class=\"h3\">Low-risk patients</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Low-risk patients are estimated to have a &lt;10 percent probability of having a common bile duct stone [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/choledocholithiasis-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-management/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. If gallstones or sludge are present within the gallbladder on transabdominal ultrasound and the patient is a good surgical candidate, the patient should proceed to cholecystectomy without imaging of the common bile duct preoperatively or intraoperatively. Alternative therapies, such as medical gallstone dissolution, may be considered for patients who are not surgical candidates. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nonsurgical-treatment-of-gallstones\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Nonsurgical treatment of gallstones&quot;</a>.)</p><p>If there is no evidence of gallstones on imaging, alternative explanations for the patient's pain should be sought.

Current evidence supports early ERCP in patients with ongoing evidence of biliary obstruction, but it no longer supports early ERCP in patients with severe pancreatitis alone [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/choledocholithiasis-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-management/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>].</p><p>In patients with acute pancreatitis but equivocal evidence of bile duct stones (eg, improving liver enzyme tests <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> improvement or resolution of pain), MRCP or EUS followed by ERCP only if the <span class=\"nowrap\">EUS/MRCP</span> reveals a common bile duct stone is an attractive option because it can detect common bile duct stones, but is not associated with pancreatitis.</p><p>Issues related to ERCP in patients with acute biliary pancreatitis are discussed elsewhere.

Choledocholithiasis can occur in this setting if a gallstone escapes from the gallbladder during cholecystectomy or if there is de novo stone formation within the common bile duct. (See <a href=\"#H972627641\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=laparoscopic-cholecystectomy#H689178094\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Laparoscopic cholecystectomy&quot;, section on 'Postcholecystectomy syndrome'</a>.)</p><p>In such patients, transabdominal ultrasound is less helpful because a dilated common bile duct seen on ultrasound may be the result of a common bile duct stone, or it may be the result of the cholecystectomy. Following cholecystectomy, the common bile duct may dilate to 10 mm. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ultrasonography-of-the-hepatobiliary-tract#H3\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Ultrasonography of the hepatobiliary tract&quot;, section on 'Normal measurements on ultrasound'</a>.)</p><p>One approach to patients who have undergone a prior cholecystectomy and who present with biliary-type pain and liver test abnormalities, but in whom there is uncertainty as to presence of a bile duct stone, is to proceed with an MRCP or EUS to confirm the presence of a stone.

Symptoms associated with choledocholithiasis include right upper quadrant or epigastric pain, nausea, and vomiting. The pain is often more prolonged than is seen with typical biliary colic (which typically resolves within six hours).

Patients with acute pancreatitis typically have elevated serum pancreatic enzyme levels, and patients with acute cholangitis are often febrile with a leukocytosis.

Pre-cholecystectomy ERCP with postponed cholecystectomy is appropriate in patients with acute cholangitis, in those with ongoing evidence of biliary obstruction and acute pancreatitis, and in patients who are poor surgical candidates. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Patients at intermediate risk either undergo preoperative endoscopic ultrasound or magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography, or they proceed to laparoscopic cholecystectomy with intraoperative cholangiography or ultrasonography.
