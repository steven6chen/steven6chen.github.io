The adhesions that form in the abdomen following abdominal or pelvic surgery are a normal response to injury of the peritoneal surfaces during surgery, and although adhesions have some beneficial effects, they also cause significant morbidity, including adhesive small bowel obstruction, female infertility, chronic abdominal pain, and increased difficulty with subsequent surgery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/postoperative-peritoneal-adhesions-in-adults-and-their-prevention/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>]. These issues have refocused attention on our understanding of adhesions, their clinical consequences, and methods of prevention. A number of animal studies and human interventional trials have evaluated a variety of techniques and materials designed to reduce and prevent postsurgical adhesions. Only a handful of agents have been proven safe and effective in humans, and fewer have an evidence base that justifies routine use. </p><p>The epidemiology, pathogenesis, approach, and importance of preventing postoperative peritoneal adhesions in adults are reviewed here. The diagnosis and management of small bowel obstruction and infertility are discussed elsewhere.

The incidence varies widely with the nature of the index surgery and the duration of follow-up [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/postoperative-peritoneal-adhesions-in-adults-and-their-prevention/abstract/7,10-13\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,10-13</a>]. Open gynecologic procedures, ileal pouch-anal anastomosis, and open colectomy are associated with the highest risk of adhesive small-bowel obstruction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/postoperative-peritoneal-adhesions-in-adults-and-their-prevention/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. The incidence of small bowel obstruction resulting from postoperative adhesions increases with each subsequent procedure performed in the management of bowel obstruction. In one national study 5.7 percent of 21,347 readmissions were classified as relating directly to adhesions, and 3.8 percent required operation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/postoperative-peritoneal-adhesions-in-adults-and-their-prevention/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. The risk factors associated with small bowel obstruction due to adhesions are discussed separately.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Infertility &ndash; Infertility in women can result from pelvic adhesions, which can interfere with ovum capture and transport or from tubal or intrauterine adhesions that hinder sperm transport or embryo implantation. Whereas pelvic peritoneal adhesions and tubal abnormalities are each responsible for approximately 10 percent of cases of female infertility, intrauterine adhesions are a relatively rare cause of infertility.

Data from the medical defense union in the United Kingdom identified 77 claims related to adhesions over a six-year interval [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/postoperative-peritoneal-adhesions-in-adults-and-their-prevention/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. Allegations included a failure to warn of the risk during the consent process, visceral injuries that occurred during laparoscopy or laparotomy, the failure to use specific measures to prevent adhesions, the failure to diagnose or delays in diagnosis of complications, and chronic pain and infertility. </p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">PATHOGENESIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>At the molecular level, adhesion formation involves a complex interaction of cytokines, growth factors, cell adhesion molecules, neuropeptides, and numerous other factors secreted by cells in or near the area of trauma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/postoperative-peritoneal-adhesions-in-adults-and-their-prevention/abstract/24,25\" class=\"abstract_t\">24,25</a>]. The early balance between fibrin deposition and degradation (ie, fibrinolysis) appears to be a critical factor in the pathogenesis of adhesions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/postoperative-peritoneal-adhesions-in-adults-and-their-prevention/abstract/26-30\" class=\"abstract_t\">26-30</a>]. Peritoneal healing differs from wound healing in that it heals as a surface rather than from edge to edge (like skin). Healing involves a uniform, relatively rapid re-epithelialization, regardless of the size of the injury. </p><p>Injury to peritoneal surfaces induces a repair response, which consists of an inflammatory reaction involving cellular elements, and also tissue and coagulation factors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/postoperative-peritoneal-adhesions-in-adults-and-their-prevention/abstract/29,31\" class=\"abstract_t\">29,31</a>]. The inflammatory response results in fibrin deposition at the site of injury within three hours after tissue trauma and peaks on postoperative day four to five. Postsurgical peritoneal repair begins with coagulation, which triggers the release of a variety of chemical messengers that mediate a cascade of events. Some of the principal cellular elements involved include leukocytes (polymorphonuclear neutrophils and macrophages) and mesothelial cells. Macrophages, which exhibit increased phagocytic, respiratory burst, and secretory activities, comprise the majority of the local leukocyte population five days after injury. Macrophages also recruit new mesothelial cells onto the surface of the injury, which first aggregate to form small islands across the injured area and then proliferate into sheets of cells that eventually re-epithelialize the entire surface, usually by five to seven days after surgical injury. </p><p>The progenitor to adhesions is the fibrin gel matrix, which develops in several steps, which include the formation and degradation of fibrin polymer and its interaction with fibronectin and a series of amino acids. Protective fibrinolytic enzyme systems in the peritoneal mesothelium, such as the tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) system, can remove the fibrin gel matrix. The pivotal events that determine the path of healing are the opposition of two damaged surfaces and the extent of fibrinolysis. If complete fibrinolysis and resorption of degradation products occurs, reepithelialization will result in a smooth tissue surface, but if that process is disturbed and fibrinolysis does not occur, connective tissue scar and adhesions develop from the ingrowth of fibroblasts, capillaries, and nerves. Surgery diminishes fibrinolytic activity dramatically by increasing levels of plasminogen activator inhibitors and by reducing tissue oxygenation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/postoperative-peritoneal-adhesions-in-adults-and-their-prevention/abstract/30,31\" class=\"abstract_t\">30,31</a>]. Fibrinolysis also can be impaired by thermal injury, desiccation, ischemia, foreign bodies, blood, bacteria, and some drugs; genetic polymorphisms also may play a role in the host's inflammatory and healing response.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H295552710\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL PRESENTATIONS AND DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Most adhesions are clinically silent. More than 75 percent of patients with symptomatic adhesions have a history of prior surgery, and the remainder has a history of an intraabdominal or pelvic inflammatory process. When symptoms occur, adhesions may manifest as intestinal obstruction, chronic pain, and, in women, as infertility. The risk factors and clinical features for each of these are described in the linked topics.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Adhesions are the most common cause of intestinal obstruction in Western countries, and should be suspected in any patient with a history of prior abdominal or pelvic surgery who presents with signs and symptoms of obstruction.

Computed tomography (CT) of the abdomen (with oral contrast) and gastrointestinal follow-through studies are less useful in the diagnosis of adhesions, but can play a role in the management of patients with suspected small bowel obstruction relating to adhesions.

Given that no specific pharmacologic therapy has been approved for clinical use in the United States, the discussion below focuses on technical measures and physical barriers.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Technical measures limit or prevent the initial peritoneal injury. (See <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Surgical techniques'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Barrier agents act primarily as a physical separation between the fibrin-coated peritoneal surfaces predisposed to adherence. Barrier agents may be solid or liquid materials. (See <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'Physical barriers'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pharmacologic therapies may be administered locally or systemically and interfere with or modify the peritoneal response to injury.

Damage to the serosa can be prevented by minimizing trauma, bleeding, and ischemia, and by keeping the surgical field moist with frequent irrigation to prevent tissues from drying out. </p><p>Traditional laparotomy sponges can be abrasive and should be avoided. Many pelvic surgeons place these sponges in sterile plastic bags, thus preventing the braided cloth from touching the peritoneum when packing is required. </p><p>Removing the talc or starch from gloves before entering the peritoneal cavity is a simple, but often neglected, measure that eliminates a source of irritation that predisposes can lead to adhesion formation. The introduction of potentially reactive foreign bodies (eg, excess suture material, lint, talc) should be minimized to reduce the number of nidi for fibrin deposition. Fine, nonreactive suture material should be used wherever possible; silk sutures, which are fibrogenic, should be avoided in the abdomen. </p><p>The incidence of adhesions is similar regardless of whether the peritoneum is reapproximated after laparotomy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/postoperative-peritoneal-adhesions-in-adults-and-their-prevention/abstract/13,33,34\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,33,34</a>]. Although closing the parietal peritoneum is usually unnecessary, when circumstances require, fine absorbable suture should be used. Suture materials like polyglactin stimulate little tissue reactivity and are thus preferred over more reactive materials such as chromic catgut sutures, or silk.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H90682180\"><span class=\"h3\">Laparoscopic surgery</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Laparoscopy offers certain advantages over open abdominal surgery with respect to adhesion formation. The abdominal incisions are small and there is less handling of tissue and exposure to foreign bodies, all of which may help to decrease tissue trauma, compared with laparotomy, and thus to reduce the risk for adhesion formation, especially to the abdominal wall [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/postoperative-peritoneal-adhesions-in-adults-and-their-prevention/abstract/35-37\" class=\"abstract_t\">35-37</a>]. Other relative advantages and disadvantages of laparoscopic surgery are discussed in separate topic reviews for specific procedures.</p><p>Laparoscopic surgery certainly does not guarantee the prevention of adhesions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/postoperative-peritoneal-adhesions-in-adults-and-their-prevention/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>]; longer durations of surgery and high insufflation pressures can even increase the risk for adhesion formation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/postoperative-peritoneal-adhesions-in-adults-and-their-prevention/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>]. In one study, the Scottish National Health Service Medical Record Linkage Database was used to select a cohort of 8849 women who had open gynecological surgery in 1986 and all readmissions in the subsequent 10 years were reviewed for potential adhesion-related disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/postoperative-peritoneal-adhesions-in-adults-and-their-prevention/abstract/10,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,11</a>]. The overall rate of readmission directly related to adhesions was 2.<span class=\"nowrap\">9/100</span> initial operations. When laparoscopic sterilization procedures were excluded, the risk for adhesion-related readmission was comparable for open and laparoscopic gynecological surgery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/postoperative-peritoneal-adhesions-in-adults-and-their-prevention/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Physical barriers</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Physical barriers include solid materials (absorbable sheets, nonabsorbable prosthetic materials), and viscous fluids introduced into the abdomen. All are aimed at keeping damaged peritoneal surfaces separated during the first five to seven days after surgery, until after re-epithelialization has occurred. Although barriers do appear to limit the extent of adhesion formation, whether they improve clinically important outcomes by reducing the risks for intestinal obstruction, infertility, and chronic abdominal or pelvic pain is less clear [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/postoperative-peritoneal-adhesions-in-adults-and-their-prevention/abstract/1,40\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,40</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H355417239\" class=\"local\">'Effectiveness of physical barriers'</a> below.)</p><p>The addition of physical barriers is not without risk or cost. The use of the barriers described below prolongs operative time, which increases hospital costs, which is compounded further by the cost of the product itself, for an estimated total of $400 to $700 per procedure. However, when these barriers accomplish what they are designed to do, the benefit of avoiding future surgery outweighs these issues.</p><p>Concerns that some barrier agents may predispose to an increase in the incidence of septic complications [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/postoperative-peritoneal-adhesions-in-adults-and-their-prevention/abstract/41-43\" class=\"abstract_t\">41-43</a>] have not been proven, but barriers should <strong>not</strong> be used to wrap intestinal anastomoses because the practice may increase the risk for leak [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/postoperative-peritoneal-adhesions-in-adults-and-their-prevention/abstract/44,45\" class=\"abstract_t\">44,45</a>].

There was no significant difference between the groups in the incidence of abscess (4 versus 3 percent, respectively) or pulmonary embolism (&lt;1 percent in both groups). However, a subpopulation of patients in whom the adhesion barrier was wrapped around a fresh bowel anastomosis more frequently developed anastomotic leak and leak-related events, such as fistula formation, peritonitis, abscess formation, and sepsis. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H166926421\"><span class=\"h3\">Solid barriers (sheets)</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Two absorbable membrane sheets are commercially available.
