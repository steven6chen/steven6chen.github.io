In the United States, lung cancer is estimated to be diagnosed in approximately 234,000 people annually and causes approximately 154,000 deaths [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-approach-to-lung-cancer-survivors/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Similarly, in the European Union in 2012, there were approximately 310,000 new cases and 265,000 deaths due to lung cancer [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-approach-to-lung-cancer-survivors/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Currently, there are an estimated 384,000 survivors of lung cancer in the US, accounting for 4 percent of the adult cancer survivor population, and this number is increasing [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-approach-to-lung-cancer-survivors/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>], attributable to advances in early detection (low-dose computed tomography scanning) and treatment.

Within this broad definition, a long-term cancer survivor has been defined as a person who is living five years after diagnosis with or without disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-approach-to-lung-cancer-survivors/abstract/4,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,5</a>].</p><p>For purposes of this discussion, lung cancer survivors are characterized as individuals who have been diagnosed with lung cancer and have completed all of their treatment for lung cancer. This topic will discuss the approach to lung cancer survivors and is focused on patients seen in a coordinated care setting between their primary care and oncology providers as well as those exclusively cared for by their primary care providers following treatment for lung cancer. These patients predominantly have had non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), since prolonged disease-free survival of patients with small cell lung cancer is much less common.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H76145289\"><span class=\"h1\">EPIDEMIOLOGY AND STAGING</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The term &quot;lung cancer&quot; refers to malignancies that originate in the airways or pulmonary parenchyma. Approximately 80 percent of all lung cancers are classified as non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), and most of the remainder are small cell lung cancer (SCLC). This distinction is required for proper staging, treatment, and prognosis. Smoking tobacco products is the primary cause of lung cancer; approximately 85 percent of lung cancer cases occur in current or former smokers. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cigarette-smoking-and-other-possible-risk-factors-for-lung-cancer\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Cigarette smoking and other possible risk factors for lung cancer&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pathology-of-lung-malignancies\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pathology of lung malignancies&quot;</a>.)</p><p>For patients with NSCLC, the Tumor, Node, Metastasis (TNM) staging system is used (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F109805\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef109805 \">table 1</a>). Although the TNM system can also be applied to SCLC, a simplified version that separates these patients into those with limited versus extensive disease is more widely used. The details of the staging system and the initial approach to establishing the diagnosis and extent of disease are discussed in detail separately.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-the-initial-evaluation-treatment-and-prognosis-of-lung-cancer\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of the initial evaluation, treatment and prognosis of lung cancer&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tumor-node-metastasis-tnm-staging-system-for-lung-cancer\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Tumor, Node, Metastasis (TNM) staging system for lung cancer&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pathobiology-and-staging-of-small-cell-carcinoma-of-the-lung#H8\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pathobiology and staging of small cell carcinoma of the lung&quot;, section on 'Staging'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13357326\"><span class=\"h1\">ONCOLOGIC MANAGEMENT</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H91769064\"><span class=\"h2\">Initial treatment</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The initial management of a patient with lung cancer depends heavily upon whether the tumor is a small cell or non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). For patients with NSCLC, management is based upon the extent of disease, as well as the patient's age, treatment preferences, and comorbid conditions. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-the-initial-evaluation-treatment-and-prognosis-of-lung-cancer#H3\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of the initial evaluation, treatment and prognosis of lung cancer&quot;, section on 'NSCLC'</a>.) </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients who present with localized disease and without evidence of mediastinal lymph node involvement (stage I and stage II (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F109805\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef109805 \">table 1</a>)), surgical resection offers the best opportunity for long-term survival and cure in patients with resectable NSCLC. Local ablative therapy, particularly stereotactic radiation therapy (RT) techniques, may be an appropriate alternative for patients who are not surgical candidates. Postoperative adjuvant chemotherapy may improve overall survival in patients at increased risk of disease recurrence. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-stage-i-and-stage-ii-non-small-cell-lung-cancer\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of stage I and stage II non-small cell lung cancer&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients with mediastinal lymph node involvement (stage III disease) at presentation, a combined-modality approach using chemotherapy and RT with or without surgery is generally preferred. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-stage-iii-non-small-cell-lung-cancer\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of stage III non-small cell lung cancer&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients with distant metastases (stage IV disease) at presentation or who subsequently have a recurrence with disseminated disease following definitive therapy are generally treated with systemic therapy. This may include chemotherapy, molecularly targeted therapy, or immunotherapy depending upon the characteristics of the individual patient's tumor. In appropriately selected patients, these approaches may prolong survival or decrease disease symptoms without sacrificing quality of life. RT and surgery may also be useful for symptom palliation in some patients. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-the-treatment-of-advanced-non-small-cell-lung-cancer\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of the treatment of advanced non-small cell lung cancer&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p>Small cell lung cancer (SCLC) is a disseminated disease in most patients, even at presentation, and prolonged survival is achieved in only a small minority of patients. Thus, systemic chemotherapy is an integral part of the initial treatment; management may also include RT to the thorax or to the brain, depending upon the initial extent of disease. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-the-initial-evaluation-treatment-and-prognosis-of-lung-cancer#H11\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of the initial evaluation, treatment and prognosis of lung cancer&quot;, section on 'SCLC'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13357333\"><span class=\"h1\">SURVEILLANCE AFTER TREATMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Close surveillance is required for survivors of lung cancer who have received definitive therapy but are at risk for recurrence of their disease and for the development of second primary lung cancers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-approach-to-lung-cancer-survivors/abstract/4-6\" class=\"abstract_t\">4-6</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H74793774\"><span class=\"h2\">Approach</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The rationale for oncologic surveillance following initial treatment of lung cancer is to detect recurrent disease or a second primary lung cancer early enough so that an intervention can increase survival <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> improve quality of life.</p><p>Even with completely resected early-stage lung cancer, recurrence rates are high. Unfortunately, the majority of recurrences present at distant sites and have a poor prognosis, but a small proportion of patients do present with localized and potentially salvageable relapses. The majority of locoregional and distant recurrences occur within the first two years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-approach-to-lung-cancer-survivors/abstract/6,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,7</a>].</p><p>The approach to post-therapy surveillance, the efficacy of surveillance, and the management of recurrences are discussed in detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-stage-i-and-stage-ii-non-small-cell-lung-cancer#H29\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of stage I and stage II non-small cell lung cancer&quot;, section on 'Post-therapy surveillance'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-the-treatment-of-advanced-non-small-cell-lung-cancer\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of the treatment of advanced non-small cell lung cancer&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The following approach is consistent with recommendations from multiple guideline-setting groups [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-approach-to-lung-cancer-survivors/abstract/8-11\" class=\"abstract_t\">8-11</a>]. The staging system set forth in the eighth edition of the American Joint Committee on Cancer Staging Manual is used (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F109805\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef109805 \">table 1</a>); however, it is recognized that the studies cited in this topic may have used previous editions of the staging system, which is a limitation of existing data.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A history, physical examination, and chest computed tomography (CT) are indicated every six months for at least the first two years, and annually thereafter; some guidelines have even recommended every-six-month follow-up for up to four years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-approach-to-lung-cancer-survivors/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. The majority of recurrences are at distant sites; patients who do have an isolated thoracic recurrence will in most cases subsequently develop more widespread disease.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Patients who have had lung cancer are also at increased risk of a second primary, particularly of the lung, and may benefit from early detection of a second primary as well as from detection of a local recurrence. Thus, annual low-dose CT may be continued beyond five years for patients who have no evidence of disease, since these individuals are at risk for a second primary lung cancer as well as for recurrence. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=screening-for-lung-cancer\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Screening for lung cancer&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=multiple-primary-lung-cancers\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Multiple primary lung cancers&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">The risk of a second primary lung cancer appears to be greater in smokers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-approach-to-lung-cancer-survivors/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>], although the data are conflicting. In a study of 2151 stage I adenocarcinomas, a second primary lung cancer developed in 10 percent of non-smokers and 8 percent of smokers. There was no difference in the cumulative incidence rate of a second primary lung cancer between smokers and non-smokers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-approach-to-lung-cancer-survivors/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. The vast majority of second primary lung cancers were detected at a curable stage. In a smaller study examining 569 patients with stage I non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), a second primary lung cancer developed in 9 percent of patients, although no second primaries occurred in the 44 patients who were never-smokers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-approach-to-lung-cancer-survivors/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients are also at risk for the development of second smoking-related malignancies at other sites. These cancers may arise at a wide range of primary sites [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-approach-to-lung-cancer-survivors/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>], and the primary care provider must remain vigilant to this possibility. Survivors of stage I lung cancers who were current smokers at the time of diagnosis have a greater than threefold risk of developing second smoking-related malignancies (eg, head and neck, bladder), underscoring the critical importance of smoking cessation in these patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-approach-to-lung-cancer-survivors/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>].

Given the lack of proven survival benefit, it is important to consider the proposed benefits from surveillance in the context of potential harms arising from surveillance.</p><p>When planning the posttreatment surveillance strategy, care should be taken to limit the number of CT scans if possible, particularly in younger individuals, given concerns about second malignancies induced by radiation exposure. The specific follow-up schedule for CT imaging for an individual patient may be more or less frequent, depending upon risk factors for recurrence (eg, stage, histological features, positron emission tomography [PET] characteristics). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=radiation-related-risks-of-imaging\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Radiation-related risks of imaging&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>While patients undergoing diagnostic imaging are not generally monitored for radiation exposure, guidelines for health care workers provide some context. Health care workers are generally recommended not to exceed 50 millisievert (mSv) of radiation exposure in any given year [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-approach-to-lung-cancer-survivors/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. In one study of 94 patients with stage IA NSCLC, 17 percent of patients received more than 50 mSv during postoperative year 1, and 27 percent of patients in postoperative year 2 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-approach-to-lung-cancer-survivors/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">However, the theoretical risk from radiation exposure, particularly from low-dose scans as has been recommended for surveillance, is generally accepted given the potential for identification of second malignancies at a curable state in this high-risk population [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-approach-to-lung-cancer-survivors/abstract/8,13,16,19\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,13,16,19</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>False-positive results led to additional testing in 25 percent of patients in an observational study of 1294 stage I to II NSCLC patients undergoing routine CT surveillance every six months. However, only four (0.3 percent) patients experienced complications, and no patients died as result of subsequent invasive diagnostic procedures [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-approach-to-lung-cancer-survivors/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. Similar findings were noted in the lung cancer screening setting, in a large systematic review of CT screening, where approximately 20 percent of patients had positive results requiring additional testing, but only 0.36 percent had major complications arising from the workup of ultimately benign nodules [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-approach-to-lung-cancer-survivors/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In the general population, no significant differences in health-related quality of life (HRQOL) and anxiety were observed at one and six months after lung cancer screening among participants with a normal scan compared with those who had a false-positive scan or significant incidental findings. Those who were found to have lung cancer (true positive scan results) reported lower HRQOL and higher anxiety at follow-up. Overall, the findings provide reassurance that undergoing lung cancer screening in the context of a well-designed screening and follow-up protocol poses little or no psychosocial harm to screening participants [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-approach-to-lung-cancer-survivors/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. However, the higher anxiety reported at follow-up among patients with lung cancer underscores the psychosocial sequelae of surveillance among the lung cancer survivor population.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H76146736\"><span class=\"h1\">COMPLICATIONS OF TREATMENT AND LATE EFFECTS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Long-term effects of treatment in lung cancer survivors revolve around complications from surgery, chemotherapy, immunotherapy, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> radiation.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Sequelae from surgery most commonly can include chronic pain (including post-thoracotomy pain syndrome), dyspnea, and, less frequently, the need for supplemental oxygen.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Common long-term sequelae from chemotherapy include neuropathy and hearing loss, as well as neurocognitive changes.

Stigma is more strongly associated with lung cancer than other cancers. Stigma can have a negative effect on lung cancer patients' psychological well-being and has been associated with anxiety and depression.

Given the demands of treatment, many patients diagnosed and treated for lung cancer will not return to work.

Distressed family&nbsp;caregivers&nbsp;of&nbsp;lung cancer&nbsp;patients typically underuse mental health services, yet a sizable minority are interested in receiving professional assistance with psychosocial and practical needs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-approach-to-lung-cancer-survivors/abstract/61\" class=\"abstract_t\">61</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13357481\"><span class=\"h2\">Persistent tobacco use</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In NSCLC survivors, persistent smoking after diagnosis is associated with poor outcomes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-approach-to-lung-cancer-survivors/abstract/3,62-64\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,62-64</a>], including treatment complications, treatment-related toxicity, decreased overall quality of life, and decreased adherence to treatment. Along with advanced tumor stage, current smoking is a poor prognostic factor for lung cancer patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-approach-to-lung-cancer-survivors/abstract/65\" class=\"abstract_t\">65</a>].</p><p>Patients who continue to smoke after diagnosis are more likely to develop secondary cancers and have higher rates of cancer and non-cancer related mortality [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-approach-to-lung-cancer-survivors/abstract/66,67\" class=\"abstract_t\">66,67</a>]. After surgical resection with curative intent, second tumors are 2.3 times more common and recurrent tumors are 1.9 times more common in patients who continue to smoke. Overall mortality in smokers is 2.9 times higher [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-approach-to-lung-cancer-survivors/abstract/63\" class=\"abstract_t\">63</a>]. Drug metabolism can also be affected by current smoking. Finally, lung cancer patients who quit at the time of initial diagnosis report improved quality of life compared with those patients who continue smoking [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-approach-to-lung-cancer-survivors/abstract/63\" class=\"abstract_t\">63</a>].</p><p>Despite the known health risks, smoking is prevalent among survivors of lung cancer. Based on a large population-based survey, 39 percent of lung cancer patients reported smoking at the time of diagnosis, and 14 percent reported smoking at five months post-diagnosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-approach-to-lung-cancer-survivors/abstract/68\" class=\"abstract_t\">68</a>].</p><p>Unfortunately, long-term cessation is not an easy goal to achieve. Even patients who quit prior to surgery can have high relapse rates. For example, in one study, nearly 40 percent of smokers who quit before surgery relapsed during the postoperative period [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-approach-to-lung-cancer-survivors/abstract/69\" class=\"abstract_t\">69</a>]. Lung cancer patients who are significantly more likely to be persistent smokers include those who have Medicare or other public insurance, are not having chemotherapy, are not having surgery, have prior cardiovascular disease, have lower body mass index, have less emotional support, and have higher daily smoking rates [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-approach-to-lung-cancer-survivors/abstract/68\" class=\"abstract_t\">68</a>].</p><p>As lung cancer patients are diagnosed at earlier, more curable stages, smoking cessation will be even more relevant and critical. All health care providers treating lung cancer survivors should adhere to the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) Guidelines for Smoking Cessation including assessment of current tobacco use, advising current smokers to quit, and providing or referring current smokers to evidence-based, pharmacologic, and behavioral tobacco treatment. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-smoking-cessation-management-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of smoking cessation management in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Although clinicians who care for lung cancer patients recognize the importance of tobacco cessation as a necessary part of clinical care, many still do not routinely provide assistance to their patients. A contemporary survey of thoracic oncology care providers showed that over 90 percent believe that current smoking affects clinical outcomes and that cessation should be a standard part of clinical care [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-approach-to-lung-cancer-survivors/abstract/70\" class=\"abstract_t\">70</a>]. Although 90 percent of thoracic oncology providers asked patients about tobacco use and 81 percent advised patients to quit, only 40 percent discussed cessation medication options and 39 percent actively provided cessation assistance. Increasing tobacco cessation will require increased assessment and cessation at diagnosis and during follow-up, increased clinician education, and improved tobacco cessation methods.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H76145191\"><span class=\"h1\">COORDINATION OF CARE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The care of lung cancer survivors requires coordination among various providers, which include oncology specialists (surgeon, medical oncologist, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> radiation oncologist) and primary care specialists. Access to mental health clinicians with expertise in the psychosocial support of cancer survivors is also likely to promote adaptation to the challenges associated with lung cancer survivorship. Lung cancer survivors are likely to have comorbid chronic medical conditions, largely attributable to their older age and the high prevalence of smoking history in this group. The most common comorbid conditions are cardiovascular and pulmonary diseases, and survivors with comorbid pulmonary disease are likely to report a sedentary lifestyle and impairment in posttreatment quality of life [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-approach-to-lung-cancer-survivors/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>].</p><p>The care of the lung cancer survivor must take into account multiple concerns. Management of treatment-related symptoms, side effects, and sequelae from surgery, radiation therapy, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> chemotherapy are generally best handled by the treating clinician. However, lung cancer survivors are often older and many have chronic comorbid conditions. These may be more suitably managed by their primary care providers (PCPs), who may have long-standing relationships with their patients. Cancer surveillance can be conducted by either the PCP or the treating cancer specialist, as long as one adheres to the recommended regimens and timely consultations are sought if suspicious findings develop.</p><p>The coordination of care between those responsible for the original lung cancer treatment and the PCP, therefore, is of the utmost importance. While the surgeon, radiation oncologist, or medical oncologist may be particularly attuned to the issues of treatment and cancer surveillance, they may not be capable of providing sufficient attention to health behavior modification or chronic symptom management. On the other hand, the PCP may provide better preventative care but not be familiar with the management of lung cancer and the sequelae of cancer therapy. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-cancer-survivorship-care-for-primary-care-and-oncology-providers\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of cancer survivorship care for primary care and oncology providers&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H76145210\"><span class=\"h2\">Nurse practitioner model</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Some have advocated bridging the divide with dedicated nurses or nurse practitioners (NPs). A randomized trial of nurse-led follow-up of lung cancer patients versus conventional medical follow-up found that nurse-led follow-up was feasible and reported higher patient satisfaction with the nurse care model. Patient acceptability of nurse-led follow-up was high (75 percent), and there were no differences in survival or disease progression in the two groups [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-approach-to-lung-cancer-survivors/abstract/71\" class=\"abstract_t\">71</a>].</p><p>Similar acceptance was found among 655 patients in a NP-led survivorship program at a large cancer center, where 92 percent of patients in the program elected to remain in the care of the NP rather than return to their thoracic surgeon [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-approach-to-lung-cancer-survivors/abstract/72\" class=\"abstract_t\">72</a>]. An important feature of this model is the close coordination between the survivorship NP and the thoracic surgeon. The importance of surgeon input in the interpretation of surveillance imaging was highlighted in one study demonstrating an accuracy rate of 88 percent when scans reported as abnormal by the radiologist were evaluated by the surgeon [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-approach-to-lung-cancer-survivors/abstract/73\" class=\"abstract_t\">73</a>]. This NP-based model has been shown to have high satisfaction as well as being cost-effective in other cancer populations, such as breast cancer [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-approach-to-lung-cancer-survivors/abstract/74\" class=\"abstract_t\">74</a>].</p><p>Indicating need for greater continuing education, a survey examined awareness of long-term effects of chemotherapy across 1130 oncologists and 1072 PCPs and found that only 6 percent of PCPs were aware of the major long-term effects of four common chemotherapy agents compared with 65 percent of oncologists [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-approach-to-lung-cancer-survivors/abstract/75\" class=\"abstract_t\">75</a>].</p><p>Regardless of the follow-up model used, close attention to treatment-related symptoms, chronic comorbidities, and cancer surveillance for both recurrence and the development of second malignancies must be paid to provide optimal care for the lung cancer survivor.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13357488\"><span class=\"h1\">SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Lung cancer survivors are at risk for recurrence of their original cancer, for the development of second primary lung cancers, and for the development of other cancers, particularly those related to smoking.
