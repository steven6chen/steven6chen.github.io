The decision to use an instrument to deliver the fetus balances the maternal, fetal, and neonatal impact of the procedure against the alternative options of cesarean birth or expectant management.</p><p>This topic will discuss issues related to operative vaginal delivery. The technique for vacuum assisted operative delivery is reviewed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=procedure-for-vacuum-assisted-operative-vaginal-delivery\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Procedure for vacuum-assisted operative vaginal delivery&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">PREVALENCE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In the United States, 3.1 percent of all deliveries in 2015 were accomplished via an operative vaginal approach [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/operative-vaginal-delivery/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Forceps deliveries accounted for 0.56 percent of vaginal births and vacuum deliveries accounted for 2.58 percent of vaginal births. However, there is a wide range in the prevalence of operative vaginal delivery both across and within geographic regions in the United States (1 to 23 percent) which suggests that evidence-based guidelines for operative vaginal delivery are either inadequate or randomly applied, or familiarity and expertise with the technique is declining [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/operative-vaginal-delivery/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. </p><p>Prevalence rates vary worldwide depending on local practice patterns and availability of trained clinicians and other necessary resources [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/operative-vaginal-delivery/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. A nonscientific survey from 111 countries showed that knowledge, training, and use of vacuum extraction range widely in different countries, and in certain regions, instrumental deliveries are not taught or performed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/operative-vaginal-delivery/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">INDICATIONS</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3084715063\"><span class=\"h2\">Overview</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Use of forceps or vacuum is reasonable when an operative intervention to terminate labor is indicated and operative vaginal delivery can be safely and readily accomplished; otherwise, cesarean delivery is the better option.</p><p>We agree with an American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) practice bulletin that considers &quot;prolonged second stage of labor, suspicion of immediate or potential fetal compromise, and shortening the second stage for maternal benefit&quot; appropriate indications for operative vaginal delivery (forceps or vacuum) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/operative-vaginal-delivery/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. However, no indication is absolute, and cesarean delivery is also an option in these clinical settings.</p><p>Although one can never be certain of a successful outcome, we attempt an operative vaginal delivery when we believe success is likely, since the rate of birth trauma may be higher after failed attempts at operative delivery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/operative-vaginal-delivery/abstract/6,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,7</a>]. The decision to proceed with operative vaginal delivery is iterative based on assessment of the success of sequential steps in the procedure. Preprocedure risk factors do not accurately predict whether an operative vaginal delivery attempt will succeed or fail [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/operative-vaginal-delivery/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1152334511\"><span class=\"h2\">Prolonged second stage of labor</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>To reduce the rate of cesarean delivery for failure to progress in the second stage, the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists and Society for Maternal-Fetal Medicine recommend allowing three hours of pushing for nulliparous women and two hours of pushing for multiparous women before diagnosing arrest of labor, when maternal and fetal conditions permit [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/operative-vaginal-delivery/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. They also opined that longer durations may be appropriate on an individual basis (eg, epidural anesthesia, fetal malposition) as long as progress is being documented, but did not provide specific criteria for the upper limit of the second stage. Many obstetric providers allow an extra hour of pushing for women with epidural anesthesia when there is reassuring fetal testing. These criteria are also useful for deciding when to perform an operative vaginal delivery. </p><p>For patients whose second stage is prolonged by these criteria and who have a normal fetal heart tracing and no other indication for expediting delivery, we evaluate the relative value of an operative delivery versus expectant management. We favor expectant management when we believe a spontaneous delivery is likely because fetal descent is progressing, albeit slowly, or because there has been a recent favorable change in the clinical situation, such as rotation from occiput posterior to occiput anterior, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=oxytocin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">oxytocin</a> augmentation, or more effective pushing. We favor operative vaginal delivery when further progress seems unlikely, and we believe operative vaginal delivery is the least morbid operative strategy, given the fetal station, position, and estimated size. Many of these cases appear to be related to ineffective pushing due to maternal exhaustion or, less commonly, to a maternal neurologic or muscular disease. Women with a prolonged second stage who are not good candidates for operative vaginal delivery are delivered by cesarean.

As discussed above, maternal neurologic or muscular disease can impair effective pushing and can be a reason to shorten the second stage.

Multiple maternal factors (eg, diabetes, body mass index [BMI], prior infant size in successful vaginal deliveries, clinical pelvimetry, progress in the second stage) and fetal factors (eg, head position and station, caput and molding, estimated abdominal circumference compared with head circumference) can influence the decision to attempt an operative delivery.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">In general, patients with severe obesity (defined as a BMI &gt;40), diabetes, slow progress in the second stage of labor with significant <span class=\"nowrap\">caput/molding,</span> or an infant estimated to be over 4000 g are not ideal candidates for operative vaginal delivery, but these cases must be individualized. An example of a case with estimated fetal weight 4000 g where we would consider operative vaginal delivery might be a patient with fetal compromise at +3 station who has a normal BMI, no gestational or other diabetes mellitus, and a history of a prior spontaneous vaginal delivery of an infant of similar size. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=shoulder-dystocia-risk-factors-and-planning-delivery-of-high-risk-pregnancies\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Shoulder dystocia: Risk factors and planning delivery of high-risk pregnancies&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Instrumental delivery of the macrosomic infant may be associated with an increased risk of injury. As an example, in a study including almost 3000 newborns &ge;4000 g, the risk of persistent significant injury at six months of age was 1.5 percent <span class=\"nowrap\">(4/261)</span> after forceps delivery, 0.24 percent <span class=\"nowrap\">(4/1666)</span> after spontaneous delivery, and 0 <span class=\"nowrap\">(0/862)</span> after cesarean delivery or vacuum delivery <span class=\"nowrap\">(0/135)</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/operative-vaginal-delivery/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. The authors estimated that a policy of elective cesarean birth for macrosomia would necessitate 148 to 258 cesarean deliveries to prevent a single persistent injury; avoidance of operative vaginal delivery would require 50 to 99 cesarean births per injury prevented. However, these estimates are imprecise because of the small number of observed injuries and the poor performance of intrapartum identification of macrosomic fetuses.

We were unable to identify any studies or manufacturer guidelines regarding prerequisites for estimated fetal weight or gestational age for use of these instruments. When clinically indicated, we would generally consider using forceps for fetuses estimated to weigh at least 2000 g. We apply standard forceps if the head size is near or at the size of a term infant, and baby forceps for smaller heads.

Pudendal block may be adequate for vacuum extraction because, unlike forceps blades, the vacuum cup does not significantly displace the walls of the birth canal or increase the cephalic diameter.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H667214829\"><span class=\"h2\">Ancillary procedures</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H896560068\"><span class=\"h3\">Ultrasound</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Ultrasound has been studied as a way to more accurately determine both fetal position and station prior to operative vaginal delivery. Multiple studies comparing ultrasound to digital vaginal examination of head position have shown digital examination is incorrect in 20 to 40 percent of cases, regardless of the experience of the person doing the examination [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/operative-vaginal-delivery/abstract/18-20\" class=\"abstract_t\">18-20</a>]. Ultrasound measurements of fetal station using perineum to skull distance or angle of progression appear to be reproducible, can diagnose lack of engagement, and are predictive of difficult operative vaginal deliveries [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/operative-vaginal-delivery/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. If fetal presentation or position is uncertain, intrapartum sonographic visualization of fetal intracranial structures, including the cerebellum, orbits, and midline falx, can be used to determine fetal head position and may reduce morbidity of improperly placed instruments at the time of an operative vaginal delivery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/operative-vaginal-delivery/abstract/18,19\" class=\"abstract_t\">18,19</a>].</p><p>Use of ultrasound to determine fetal position during late labor when cervical dilation is &ge;8 cm may have unanticipated consequences.

Observational studies suggest that episiotomy increases, rather than decreases, the risk of perineal trauma in operative vaginal deliveries [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/operative-vaginal-delivery/abstract/24-28\" class=\"abstract_t\">24-28</a>]. The only randomized trial comparing routine versus restrictive episiotomy at operative vaginal delivery found no significant differences between groups in the rate of anal sphincter tear, postpartum hemorrhage, neonatal trauma, or pelvic floor symptoms until 10 days postpartum; however, this was a pilot study with only 200 participants [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/operative-vaginal-delivery/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. If episiotomy is performed, observational data show that a mediolateral or lateral episiotomy is preferable as it protects against anal sphincter injury [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/operative-vaginal-delivery/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>], although initial postpartum discomfort is greater than with a midline incision [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/operative-vaginal-delivery/abstract/31-34\" class=\"abstract_t\">31-34</a>].

Because success is likely, the primary consideration in these cases is to minimize the risk of maternal and fetal injury. If a difficult extraction is anticipated, we choose forceps despite a slightly higher risk of maternal injury because vacuum extraction is likely to fail [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/operative-vaginal-delivery/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>].</p><p>The choice of instrument is determined by the clinician's expertise with the various forceps and vacuum devices, availability of the instrument, level of maternal anesthesia, and knowledge of the risks and benefits associated with each instrument in various clinical settings. Vacuum delivery is generally less traumatic for the mother than forceps delivery. Vacuum devices are easier to apply and require less maternal anesthesia than forceps. Fetal head rotation may occur passively during fetal extraction. The advantages of forceps are that they have a significantly higher success rate, are unlikely to detach from the head during a difficult extraction, can be used on premature fetuses or to actively rotate the fetal head, and do not aggravate bleeding from scalp lacerations. It is not clear which procedure is safer for the fetus; the complication profiles for the two procedures are different.

A soft vacuum cup is appropriate for most deliveries. Rigid cups may be preferable for occiput posterior, occiput transverse, and difficult occiput anterior deliveries because they are less likely to detach.

Traction is applied in the axis of the pelvis, which is curved in most women.

The shanks do not articulate; thus, each branch acts as an independent lever and the head is not compressed between the blades.

They are also associated with higher rates maternal trauma. (See <a href=\"#H566466073\" class=\"local\">'Complications of midpelvic deliveries'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">However, clinicians highly experienced with forceps deliveries may choose to attempt a midforceps delivery in select circumstances, such as sudden severe fetal or maternal compromise, if the clinician believes that <span class=\"nowrap\">he/she</span> can safely expedite and effect a safe operative vaginal delivery. Simultaneous preparation for cesarean delivery should be underway. We suggest performing midforceps deliveries in the operating room so that cesarean delivery can be performed promptly, if necessary.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">When attempting a midforceps delivery, the leading point of the skull should be at or just beyond the ischial spines (0 to <span class=\"nowrap\">+1/5</span> station) to ensure the head is engaged. It would be rare to have an engaged head when the leading point is at <span class=\"nowrap\">-1/5</span> cm station and extraordinarily unlikely at -4 or -5 station.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Rotation</strong> &ndash; A rotational delivery is an appropriate option in select clinical circumstances [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/operative-vaginal-delivery/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>], as neonatal morbidity is not increased compared with appropriate controls when intervention is indicated and when performed by experienced clinicians [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/operative-vaginal-delivery/abstract/40-43\" class=\"abstract_t\">40-43</a>]. Rotation, when needed, is performed between contractions. Rotation followed by extraction is more difficult and associated with a higher risk of maternal and fetal complications than simple traction applied to the non- or minimally-rotated head. Forceps application and rotation when the fetal head is not directly OA is beyond the scope of this topic review.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Traction</strong> &ndash; Traction should be steady (not rocking) and in the line of the birth canal. It should be exerted with each contraction and in conjunction with maternal expulsive efforts. In most cases, progress is noted with the first or second pull and delivery occurs by the third or fourth pull [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/operative-vaginal-delivery/abstract/44\" class=\"abstract_t\">44</a>]. The procedure should be abandoned if descent does not occur with appropriate application and traction.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Forceps can be relaxed between contractions to reduce fetal cranial compression.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Removal</strong> &ndash; To reduce the risk of laceration, forceps are disarticulated and removed when expulsion is certain, but before the widest diameter of the fetal head passes through the introitus. The head can then be delivered with no or minimal maternal assistance.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15\"><span class=\"h2\">Vacuum</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The procedure for vacuum extraction is reviewed separately.

Some experts suggest abandoning the procedure if delivery has not occurred within 15 to 20 minutes or after three pulls. A cohort study found that 82 percent of completed operative deliveries (vacuum or forceps) occurred with one to three pulls, and that pulling more than three times was associated with infant trauma in 45 percent of such deliveries [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/operative-vaginal-delivery/abstract/45\" class=\"abstract_t\">45</a>]. Based on these data, we believe it is prudent to abandon the procedure if good instrument placement is followed by no progress in descent over three attempts. If descent has occurred and delivery is clearly imminent, then proceeding with instrumental delivery after three pulls may be appropriate and less morbid than a cesarean delivery of an infant with its head on the perineum.</p><p>The operator should not be fixated on achieving a vaginal delivery. It is essential that the operator be willing to abandon a planned or attempted operative delivery and have the ability to perform a cesarean birth if evaluation or re-evaluation of the clinical status shows that an instrumental delivery is contraindicated (eg, the fetal head is not engaged, the position is uncertain, the procedure is not succeeding).</p><p>The most common clinical factors associated with failed operative vaginal delivery are occiput posterior position and macrosomia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/operative-vaginal-delivery/abstract/6,46-52\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,46-52</a>] (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=occiput-posterior-position#H5\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Occiput posterior position&quot;, section on 'Management'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=shoulder-dystocia-risk-factors-and-planning-delivery-of-high-risk-pregnancies#H1000006244\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Shoulder dystocia: Risk factors and planning delivery of high-risk pregnancies&quot;, section on 'Planning delivery in high-risk pregnancies'</a>). Other characteristics that have been associated with failure include nulliparity, higher station, excessive molding of the fetal head, abnormal labor progress, and maternal obesity.</p><p>Higher rates of neonatal morbidity have been observed when cesarean delivery was performed after a failed operative vaginal delivery than when performed during labor without such attempts (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F69438\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef69438 \">table 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/operative-vaginal-delivery/abstract/53,54\" class=\"abstract_t\">53,54</a>]; there are many limitations to these observational data, including confounding by indication for intervention and lack of appropriate controls.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H17\"><span class=\"h1\">SECOND ATTEMPT WITH A DIFFERENT INSTRUMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>For a procedure to be considered sequential, traction is applied sequentially by two different instruments. Situations where proper placement of forceps cannot be achieved or a vacuum device fails to achieve suction and no traction has been applied followed by application and traction using a second instrument should not be considered a sequential attempt.</p><p>The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists recommends against routinely performing sequential attempts at operative vaginal delivery using different instruments due to the greater potential for maternal <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> fetal injury [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/operative-vaginal-delivery/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. Population-based data have reported increased maternal and neonatal morbidity from sequential application of vacuum and forceps [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/operative-vaginal-delivery/abstract/53,55,56\" class=\"abstract_t\">53,55,56</a>]. Although a few studies have not demonstrated adverse effects from sequential use of vacuum and forceps, even when vaginal delivery was not achieved, a type II error may have resulted from the small number of participants and events in these studies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/operative-vaginal-delivery/abstract/57,58\" class=\"abstract_t\">57,58</a>].</p><p>For the mother, sequential use of vacuum and forceps has been associated with increased rates of <span class=\"nowrap\">third-/fourth-degree</span> lacerations and postpartum hemorrhage [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/operative-vaginal-delivery/abstract/56\" class=\"abstract_t\">56</a>]. For the neonate, sequential use of these instruments has been associated with increased rates of subdural hematomas and intracranial hemorrhage. In one large study, the incidence of subdural or cerebral hemorrhage in infants delivered by vacuum and forceps, vacuum alone, or forceps alone was approximately 21, 10, and 8 per 10,000 births, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/operative-vaginal-delivery/abstract/53\" class=\"abstract_t\">53</a>]. These findings were corroborated by another analysis based upon state-wide birth certificate data [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/operative-vaginal-delivery/abstract/55\" class=\"abstract_t\">55</a>] and a small study of asymptomatic term infants who underwent routine magnetic resonance imaging within 48 hours of birth [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/operative-vaginal-delivery/abstract/59\" class=\"abstract_t\">59</a>]. In the latter, 9 of 111 asymptomatic infants had a subdural hematoma, and the highest proportion was in the group exposed to failed vacuum followed by successful forceps delivery (five subdural hematomas among 18 infants [28 percent]) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/operative-vaginal-delivery/abstract/59\" class=\"abstract_t\">59</a>]. By comparison, 3 subdural hematomas occurred in 49 infants spontaneously delivered from vertex presentation (6 percent), 1 subdural hemorrhage occurred among 13 successful vacuum deliveries (8 percent), and 0 subdurals occurred among 4 successful forceps deliveries. All hematomas had resolved without clinical sequelae when reevaluated four weeks later.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H19\"><span class=\"h1\">SUCCESS RATE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In a systematic review of randomized trials, failed delivery occurred in about 9 percent of forceps deliveries and 14 percent of vacuum deliveries (relative risk 0.65, 95% CI 0.45-0.94; seven trials, n = 2419 deliveries) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/operative-vaginal-delivery/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>]. Birth certificate data including over two million deliveries in the United States suggest that attempted operative vaginal delivery (forceps, vacuum) failed in about 18 percent of cases in which an instrument was applied [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/operative-vaginal-delivery/abstract/60\" class=\"abstract_t\">60</a>]. When unsuccessful, 60 percent of women went on to have a vaginal delivery and 40 percent had a cesarean delivery.</p><p>Failed forceps is more likely to lead to cesarean delivery than failed vacuum. Failed vacuum extraction may be followed by a successful trial of forceps, but the converse rarely occurs. Midforceps delivery is more likely to fail than low forceps delivery; failure rates were 8.9 and 0.3 percent, respectively, in one large prospective study [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/operative-vaginal-delivery/abstract/61\" class=\"abstract_t\">61</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H20\"><span class=\"h1\">COMPLICATIONS</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3245750740\"><span class=\"h2\">Overview</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Maternal and <span class=\"nowrap\">fetal/neonatal</span> complication rates vary widely in published series and depend on a number of factors, which are not independent. These factors include type of instrument, head position at application, station, indication for intervention, and operator experience. Rotation, higher station, longer active second stage of labor, and operator inexperience variably increase the risk of complications. However, complications can occur even when instruments are correctly applied and used. Virtually all complications associated with operative vaginal delivery can also occur in the course of a spontaneous vaginal delivery, but the incidence is lower in the latter.</p><p>Birth trauma is the major potential complication of operative vaginal delivery. A population-based analysis of over 11 million singleton births in the United States provided crude comparative <span class=\"nowrap\">morbidity/mortality</span> data for unassisted (spontaneous), forceps-assisted, and vacuum-assisted births (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F70509\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef70509 \">table 2</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/operative-vaginal-delivery/abstract/62\" class=\"abstract_t\">62</a>]. Although based on far fewer births, state-based data for California and New Jersey provide a more detailed description of the specific types of injuries associated with different instruments and modes of delivery (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F63989\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef63989 \">table 3</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F50159\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef50159 \">table 4</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F50481\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef50481 \">table 5</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/operative-vaginal-delivery/abstract/53,62\" class=\"abstract_t\">53,62</a>]. These data should be interpreted with respect to appropriate control groups and reasonable alternative procedures. For example, second stage cesarean delivery is an alternative to operative vaginal delivery, but prelabor cesarean delivery and spontaneous vaginal delivery are not realistic alternatives in the setting of second stage labor complications. Bias in patient selection is also an important factor; the vacuum approach is often favored over forceps in patients most likely to delivery readily. When considering the morbidity of operative vaginal versus cesarean delivery, it should be noted that second stage cesarean delivery is associated with greater maternal morbidity than first stage or prelabor cesarean delivery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/operative-vaginal-delivery/abstract/63\" class=\"abstract_t\">63</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2218396368\"><span class=\"h2\">Neonatal complications</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1226640345\"><span class=\"h3\">Vacuum-assisted deliveries</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Torsion and traction by the vacuum cup can cause life-threatening complications following use of vacuum-assisted devices [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/operative-vaginal-delivery/abstract/64\" class=\"abstract_t\">64</a>].

In a prospective study of retinal hemorrhage in healthy newborns, the incidence was higher for vacuum-assisted than for spontaneous vaginal or cesarean deliveries (75, 33, and 7 percent, respectively) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/operative-vaginal-delivery/abstract/69\" class=\"abstract_t\">69</a>]. The hemorrhages typically resolved without sequelae within four weeks of birth. Cephalohematoma was almost twice as common after vacuum-assisted extraction than forceps delivery (9.4 versus 5.2 percent) in a systematic review, but the difference was not statistically significant [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/operative-vaginal-delivery/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>]. The majority of cephalohematomas resolve spontaneously over the course of a few weeks without any intervention.

Use of forceps or vacuum is reasonable when an intervention to terminate labor is indicated and operative vaginal delivery can be safely and readily accomplished; otherwise, cesarean delivery is the better option. Situations where operative vaginal delivery may be preferable to cesarean delivery or less invasive interventions include prolonged second stage when maternal exhaustion impedes further progress, fetal compromise where expeditious delivery is desirable, and maternal medical disorders where pushing (Valsalva) needs to be avoided or minimized. Non-medically indicated shortening of the second stage is not an indication for operative vaginal delivery. (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Indications'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Before resorting to an operative vaginal delivery, the clinician should ensure that prerequisites are met (eg, head is engaged, membranes ruptured, presentation and position known, anesthesia is satisfactory, the fetus is of appropriate gestational age and size, maternal bladder is empty) and there are no contraindications. (See <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Prerequisites'</a> above and <a href=\"#H1152335739\" class=\"local\">'Contraindications'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Forceps deliveries are classified as outlet, low, or mid, depending on the fetal station and degree of head rotation. (See <a href=\"#H1167398736\" class=\"local\">'Classification'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Midforceps deliveries are generally avoided because they are associated with a higher rate of severe perinatal <span class=\"nowrap\">morbidity/mortality</span> compared with cesarean deliveries performed in the second stage, especially when the indication for delivery is dystocia. They are also associated with higher rates maternal trauma. However, clinicians highly experienced with forceps deliveries may choose to attempt a midforceps delivery in select circumstances, such as sudden severe fetal or maternal compromise, if the clinician believes that <span class=\"nowrap\">he/she</span> can safely expedite and effect a safe operative vaginal delivery. Simultaneous preparation for cesarean delivery should be underway. (See <a href=\"#H14\" class=\"local\">'Forceps'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In general, vacuum extraction is generally less traumatic for the mother than forceps delivery and the devices are easier to apply and require less maternal anesthesia than forceps. The advantages of forceps are that they are associated with a higher success rate, are unlikely to detach from the head, can be sized to a premature cranium, may be used for a rotation, and do not aggravate bleeding from scalp lacerations. (See <a href=\"#H1167402558\" class=\"local\">'When to choose vacuum versus forceps'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The maternal bladder is emptied before operative delivery and prophylactic antibiotics are not administered. We recommend not performing an episiotomy routinely (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=2\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1B</a>). If fetal presentation or position is uncertain, intrapartum sonographic visualization of fetal intracranial structures can be used to determine fetal head position and is more accurate than digital examination. (See <a href=\"#H1152334753\" class=\"local\">'Patient preparation'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For women who are to undergo an operative vaginal delivery at &gt;34 weeks and have a high likelihood of success (eg, outlet procedure), we suggest use of vacuum over forceps (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). Maternal morbidity is lower with vacuum than forceps and neonatal morbidity is likely to be low in this setting with either approach. When success is uncertain, primary use of forceps may reduce the morbidity associated with combined sequential instrumental delivery. (See <a href=\"#H10\" class=\"local\">'Choice of instrument'</a> above and <a href=\"#H17\" class=\"local\">'Second attempt with a different instrument'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The decision to proceed with operative vaginal delivery is ongoing and decided moment by moment based on assessment of the success of the various steps in the procedure. Operative vaginal delivery should be abandoned if it is difficult to apply the instrument, descent does not easily proceed with traction, or the baby has not been delivered within a reasonable time (eg, 15 to 20 minutes) or after three pulls with no progress. (See <a href=\"#H1226631424\" class=\"local\">'When to abandon the procedure'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Maternal and <span class=\"nowrap\">fetal/neonatal</span> complication rates vary widely and depend on a number of factors, which are not independent. Virtually all complications associated with operative vaginal delivery can also occur in the course of a spontaneous vaginal delivery, but the incidence is lower in the latter. (See <a href=\"#H20\" class=\"local\">'Complications'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Vacuum-assisted deliveries are associated with an increased risk of neonatal cephalohematomata and retinal hemorrhage compared with forceps or spontaneous deliveries. These complications generally resolve without sequelae. Forceps-assisted deliveries cause more acute maternal injury and fetal facial nerve injury than vacuum-assisted operative deliveries or spontaneous deliveries. (See <a href=\"#H1226640345\" class=\"local\">'Vacuum-assisted deliveries'</a> above and <a href=\"#H1226640370\" class=\"local\">'Forceps-assisted deliveries'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Although short-term neonatal morbidity varies between procedures, developmental outcome appears to be equivalent for both forceps and vacuum assisted births. (See <a href=\"#H3119622172\" class=\"local\">'Neurodevelopmental outcome'</a> above.)</p><p/></div><div id=\"topicAgreement\">Use of UpToDate is subject to the <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/legal/license\" class=\"licenseLink\" id=\"sla_in_page\">Subscription and License Agreement</a>.</div><div id=\"references\" class=\"headingAnchor\"><h1>REFERENCES</h1><ol id=\"reference\"><li><a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/operative-vaginal-delivery/abstract/1\" class=\"nounderline abstract_t\">Martin JA, Hamilton BE, Osterman MJ, et al.
