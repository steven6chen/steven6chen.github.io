Less frequently, AIN is secondary to infection or sarcoidosis. Signs of systemic allergy, such as a maculopapular rash, peripheral eosinophilia, and eosinophiluria, are present in some patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-acute-interstitial-nephritis/abstract/5,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,6</a>].</p><p>Proteinuria is common, but excretion is usually &lt;1 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/day</span>. However, nephrotic-range proteinuria may occur and presumably reflects cytokine-induced injury to the glomerulus. It is most often seen with AIN caused by nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-acute-interstitial-nephritis/abstract/7,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,8</a>]. Histologically, AIN is characterized by the infiltration of T cells, macrophages, and plasma cells in the interstitial compartment.</p><p>The treatment of AIN due to drugs will be reviewed here. The manifestations and diagnosis of AIN and the approach to the management of patients diagnosed with infection-induced AIN, tubulointerstitial nephritis and uveitis, and renal sarcoidosis are presented separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-acute-interstitial-nephritis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of acute interstitial nephritis&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tubulointerstitial-nephritis-and-uveitis-tinu-syndrome\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Tubulointerstitial nephritis and uveitis (TINU syndrome)&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=renal-disease-in-sarcoidosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Renal disease in sarcoidosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">PROGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>For drug-induced AIN, prognostic data are most available for methicillin, which is no longer available because it was estimated to cause AIN in up to 17 percent of patients who were treated for more than 10 days [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-acute-interstitial-nephritis/abstract/2,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,9</a>].</p><p>Recovery of renal function was observed in the great majority of cases of AIN due to methicillin, either with discontinuation of the offending drug or with glucocorticoid therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-acute-interstitial-nephritis/abstract/2,9,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,9,10</a>]. The proportion recovering kidney function appears to be lower in AIN due to drugs other than methicillin [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-acute-interstitial-nephritis/abstract/2,10-12\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,10-12</a>]. The prognosis of AIN due to other inciting factors (eg, sarcoidosis, infection) is not well described. Acute dialysis is often required [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-acute-interstitial-nephritis/abstract/13-15\" class=\"abstract_t\">13-15</a>], but only approximately 10 percent of patients remain dialysis dependent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-acute-interstitial-nephritis/abstract/3,4,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,4,11</a>].</p><p>Recovery of kidney function is often incomplete, with persistent elevation of the serum creatinine concentration in up to 40 percent of patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-acute-interstitial-nephritis/abstract/2,3\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,3</a>]. As an example, in a review of published series of AIN in which many patients had a peak serum creatinine &gt;5.5 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> (500 <span class=\"nowrap\">micromol/L),</span> the serum creatinine at the end of follow-up was less than 1.2 and 1.7 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> (110 and 150 <span class=\"nowrap\">micromol/L)</span> in 49 and 68 percent, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-acute-interstitial-nephritis/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. The final serum creatinine concentration did not correlate with the maximum value during AIN.</p><p>Clinical indicators of a decreased likelihood of recovery include prolonged renal failure (greater than three weeks), AIN associated with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) use, and certain histologic findings (including interstitial granulomas, interstitial fibrosis, and tubular atrophy) on kidney biopsy.</p><p>Biomarkers for acute kidney injury (AKI), such as kidney injury molecule-1 (KIM-1) and urinary neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin (NGAL), may provide additional prognostic information but are not used clinically for this purpose at this time [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-acute-interstitial-nephritis/abstract/16,17\" class=\"abstract_t\">16,17</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">TREATMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Discontinuation of the potential causative agent is a mainstay of therapy, and immunosuppressive therapy has been employed if there is no subsequent improvement in kidney function by three to seven days. The optimal therapy of AIN is unknown since there are no randomized, controlled trials or large, observational studies. Conclusions cannot be readily drawn from available reports, as patient populations differ and results are discordant.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">General issues</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The following theoretical considerations provide a context for the approach to the management of AIN:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Most cases of AIN are allergic reactions, as suggested by the following: the majority of the immune reactions are directly to drugs or drug-induced antigens; systemic manifestations of hypersensitivity are often present; AIN is not a dose-dependent phenomenon, and only a small percentage of patients develop the condition; AIN typically improves following cessation of the drug; and AIN may rapidly recur with accidental re-exposure to the drug or a closely related antigen.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>T cells may have an important pathogenetic role in the development of AIN, as suggested from the following observations: the timeframe of illness presentation, 10 to 14 days after exposure to the drug, is typical of a T-cell-mediated syndrome; the interstitial infiltrate in the kidney is composed primarily of lymphocytes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-acute-interstitial-nephritis/abstract/9,18\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,18</a>]; and most patients demonstrate activation of lymphocytes against drug haptens [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-acute-interstitial-nephritis/abstract/19-21\" class=\"abstract_t\">19-21</a>].</p><p/><p>Given these considerations, the most important aspect of therapy of AIN is cessation of the potentially offending agent (or treatment of the underlying infection).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Glucocorticoid therapy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Immunosuppressive therapy has been employed to treat AIN that persists despite discontinuation of the offending agent. However, the benefits of therapy are inconclusive since the available data are conflicting and there are no randomized, controlled trials.</p><p>Improvement in kidney function following glucocorticoid therapy for AIN has been suggested by several uncontrolled reports [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-acute-interstitial-nephritis/abstract/2,9,13,22\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,9,13,22</a>]. The following illustrate these findings:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>One series evaluated 14 patients with methicillin-induced AIN who had an average peak serum creatinine of 8 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> (704 <span class=\"nowrap\">micromol/L)</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-acute-interstitial-nephritis/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. The eight patients treated with glucocorticoids recovered more quickly (9 versus 54 days) and had a lower final plasma creatinine concentration (1.4 versus 1.9 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> [123 versus 167 <span class=\"nowrap\">micromol/L])</span> than the six who received no therapy.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>One series evaluated 27 patients with biopsy-proven AIN: 15 were drug induced (one methicillin, two <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ampicillin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ampicillin</a>, three nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug [NSAID], three <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cimetidine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cimetidine</a>, rest other), nine were associated with infection, and three were idiopathic [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-acute-interstitial-nephritis/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. The 10 patients who did not improve following discontinuation of the drug or treatment of the infection (cause of AIN not specified) were given glucocorticoids within 5 to 20 days of biopsy (intravenous [IV] <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methylprednisolone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">methylprednisolone</a> 3 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/day</span> for three days or oral <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prednisone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">prednisone</a> 40 to 60 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day</span> for three to four weeks). In six patients, serum creatinine normalized within approximately one month, and the remaining four had partial improvement in kidney function.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A retrospective, multicenter study examined the effects of steroids on the recovery of renal function in 52 patients with biopsy-proven drug-induced AIN compared with nine untreated patients with AIN [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-acute-interstitial-nephritis/abstract/23,24\" class=\"abstract_t\">23,24</a>]. Despite the low number of control patients, significant benefits with steroids included a lower percentage of dialysis by 18 months (4 versus 44 percent) and lower serum creatinine level (2.1 versus 3.7 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> [186 and 327 <span class=\"nowrap\">micromol/L])</span>. Among treated patients, those who started steroids within seven days of withdrawal of the offending drug were significantly more likely to recover renal function than those who received steroids after this period (odds ratio [OR] 6.6, 95% CI 1.3-33.6).</p><p/><p>Other retrospective series demonstrated no benefit from glucocorticoid therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-acute-interstitial-nephritis/abstract/2,4,10,14,15,25\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,4,10,14,15,25</a>].</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>One report included 42 cases of biopsy-proven AIN (44, 33, and 7 percent due to NSAIDs, antibiotics, and proton pump inhibitors, respectively) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-acute-interstitial-nephritis/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. Twenty-six patients were treated with IV <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methylprednisolone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">methylprednisolone</a> for three days, followed by oral <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prednisone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">prednisone</a> (initial dose 0.75 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> per day, tapered over three to six weeks), and the remaining 16 were not treated. Baseline serum creatinine was somewhat higher in the glucocorticoid group (7.9 versus 6.2 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> [700 versus 545 <span class=\"nowrap\">micromol/L])</span>. There was no difference in serum creatinine between the two groups at 1, 6, and 12 months (at one year, the mean serum creatinine was 1.60 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> [144 <span class=\"nowrap\">micromol/L]</span> in both groups).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>One retrospective analysis of 95 patients with biopsy-proven, drug-induced AIN showed no benefit of glucocorticoids at six months or at long-term follow-up [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-acute-interstitial-nephritis/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. Eighty-three of the 95 patients received steroids (initial oral dose 60 mg daily, with an average duration five weeks), and 12 did not. At six months, there was no difference in the probability of recovery of renal function between the group given steroids and the group not given steroids.</p><p/><p>There are several possible explanations for a lack of effect from glucocorticoids in the negative studies: The patients treated with steroids had more severe disease, as manifested by higher maximum serum creatinine concentrations; a significant proportion of the patients had NSAID-associated AIN, which is less likely to respond to glucocorticoid therapy; and steroids are not effective in the treatment of AIN [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-acute-interstitial-nephritis/abstract/2,4,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,4,8</a>].</p><p>Given the potential for benefit and the relative safety of short-term therapy, it seems reasonable to treat patients with corticosteroids if they do not have significant improvement in the serum creatinine within three to seven days after discontinuation of the offending agent.</p><p>In such cases, a renal biopsy is preferred to confirm AIN, as well as to exclude other possible diseases or interstitial nephritis with significant chronic damage (eg, marked interstitial fibrosis, tubular atrophy, and minimal or no acute inflammation), in which case immunosuppressive therapy might not be indicated. An empiric trial of glucocorticoid therapy is a reasonable alternative in patients with a strongly suggestive history of acute drug-induced AIN when kidney biopsy is not feasible.</p><p>The optimal dose and duration of therapy are unclear. One approach is to administer <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prednisone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">prednisone</a> at a dose of 1 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> per day (to a maximum of 40 to 60 mg) for a minimum of one to two weeks, beginning a gradual taper after the serum creatinine has returned to or near baseline, for a total therapy duration of two to three months. Most patients will improve in the first one to two weeks.</p><p>In patients with more severe acute renal failure (ARF), therapy may be initiated with IV <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methylprednisolone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">methylprednisolone</a> (0.5 to 1 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/day</span> for three days).</p><p>The duration of glucocorticoid therapy varies widely among the many (cohort) studies in the literature, from days to 12 weeks [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-acute-interstitial-nephritis/abstract/2,9,13,22\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,9,13,22</a>]. There are no controlled intervention trials on the subject. Assuming that the agent inciting allergic interstitial nephritis has been discontinued, it is reasonable to shorten the duration of therapy if the kidney function returns to normal before the 12-week endpoint, especially if the patient is experiencing side effects from the therapy, such as elevated blood glucose levels.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Other agents</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There is limited experience with treating AIN in patients who are glucocorticoid dependent (ie, relapse during the <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prednisone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">prednisone</a> taper), glucocorticoid resistant (as with NSAID-induced disease), or cannot tolerate glucocorticoids.

All were able to discontinue corticosteroids, and only two patients had no improvement in serum creatinine (one who was antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody [ANCA] positive and one with AIN of unknown etiology). The applicability of these results to drug-induced AIN is limited since only two patients had AIN known to be due to drugs.</p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=mycophenolate-mofetil-cellcept-and-enteric-coated-mycophenolate-sodium-myfortic-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Mycophenolate</a> mofetil may be considered only in patients who are glucocorticoid dependent, glucocorticoid resistant, or unable to tolerate glucocorticoid therapy and have biopsy-proven AIN.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1333645623\"><span class=\"h1\">SOCIETY GUIDELINE LINKS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Links to society and government-sponsored guidelines from selected countries and regions around the world are provided separately.

No additional intervention is required in patients who have minimal elevations in the serum creatinine or those who begin to recover within three to seven days. For patients who do not fulfill these criteria, we recommend obtaining a kidney biopsy (unless already done) to confirm the diagnosis and to help guide subsequent therapeutic decisions.

Therapy may also be instituted in patients with a strongly suggestive history of drug-induced AIN in whom a biopsy cannot be performed. An exception to this general recommendation is AIN due to nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) therapy, which appears to be much less likely to respond to glucocorticoid therapy.
