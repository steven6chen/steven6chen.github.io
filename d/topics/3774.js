The management of radiation injury in children and clinical features and management in adults are discussed separately.

Radiation is the transfer of energy through space; it occurs in ionizing and nonionizing forms.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Nonionizing radiation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Nonionizing radiation lacks the energy to facilitate the release of electrons from target tissues [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-of-radiation-exposure-in-children/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Examples of nonionizing radiation include radio waves, microwaves, infrared light, visible light, and ultraviolet rays. Nonionizing radiation does not penetrate human tissue, poses no risk of contamination, and is easily shielded by sunscreens, glasses, clothing, or any other barrier. Nonionizing radiation causes damage to the cells it contacts through direct transfer of thermal energy; sunburn is a classic example [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-of-radiation-exposure-in-children/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Ionizing radiation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Ionizing radiation is released by atoms that have an excess of energy, mass, or both (unstable atoms). These atoms emit the excess energy (eg, gamma rays) or mass (eg, alpha particles) to become stable [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-of-radiation-exposure-in-children/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Ionizing radiation damages human tissue in several ways. It interacts directly with targets such as mRNA, DNA, and proteins, breaks their covalent bonds, and irreversibly destroys their structure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-of-radiation-exposure-in-children/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Ionizing radiation also bombards free water to remove an electron and generate H<sub>2</sub>O<sup>+</sup> cations, which quickly decay to highly reactive free radicals that disrupt adjacent cellular architecture and genomic information [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-of-radiation-exposure-in-children/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. Ionizing radiation causes severe cellular disruption that usually results in cell death. However, most cell types do not manifest evidence of damage until mitosis occurs, and several divisions may ensue before actual cell death.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h3\">Particulate</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Ionizing radiation is characterized as particulate or nonparticulate. Particulate ionizing radiation has mass and can be classified as charged (alpha and beta particles) or uncharged (neutrons) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-of-radiation-exposure-in-children/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Alpha particles</strong> &ndash; Alpha particles are helium nuclei that have been stripped of their electrons and emit significant amounts of radiation. They can travel centimeters through air but cannot penetrate intact barriers or skin [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-of-radiation-exposure-in-children/abstract/1,5,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,5,6</a>]. External coverings, such as scrub suits or clothing, can effectively block their emitted radiation. Alpha particles are most harmful if they are inhaled, ingested, or absorbed through open wounds [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-of-radiation-exposure-in-children/abstract/1,5,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,5,6</a>]. They can penetrate epithelial tissue to a depth of 50 micrometers, deep enough to cause cellular damage [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-of-radiation-exposure-in-children/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. Alpha particles cannot be detected with standard Geiger counters. Plutonium, radium, and uranium are examples of radioisotopes that emit alpha radiation (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F82388\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef82388 \">table 1</a>).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Beta particles</strong> &ndash; Beta particles are high-energy electrons that are emitted from the nuclei of unstable atoms (eg, cesium-137, iodine-131). The major sources of beta particles are radionuclides used in medicine and fallout radiation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-of-radiation-exposure-in-children/abstract/7,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,8</a>]. Beta particles can travel several meters through air and can penetrate to the germinal layer of the skin where they can cause damage (similar to a thermal burn), particularly if they are permitted to remain on the skin [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-of-radiation-exposure-in-children/abstract/5,8,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,8,9</a>]. Children, who have less keratinized epithelium, are at greater risk than adults. External coverings provide some protection against most beta radiation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-of-radiation-exposure-in-children/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. Similar to alpha particles, beta particles are most harmful if they are inhaled, ingested, or absorbed through open wounds [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-of-radiation-exposure-in-children/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. Most beta emission can be detected with routine survey instruments (eg, Geiger counters).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Neutrons</strong> &ndash; Neutrons are particles that have a mass of one atomic Dalton but are electrically neutral. The lack of charge permits deep penetration into tissue. Neutrons are emitted only after nuclear detonation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-of-radiation-exposure-in-children/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. After they collide with stable atoms, they cause the release of additional alpha and beta particles, as well as increased amounts of gamma radiation. Sources of neutrons include nuclear reactors, linear accelerators, and nuclear weapon detonation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-of-radiation-exposure-in-children/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h3\">Nonparticulate</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Nonparticulate ionizing radiation has no mass; x-rays and gamma rays are examples.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Gamma and x-rays &ndash; Gamma radiation and x-rays are high-energy, penetrating forms of electromagnetic radiation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-of-radiation-exposure-in-children/abstract/1,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,5</a>]. These nonparticulate forms of ionizing radiation, which are able to travel many meters in air and many centimeters in human tissue, cause radiation sickness [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-of-radiation-exposure-in-children/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. Because gamma and x-rays readily penetrate most materials, a thickness of several centimeters of dense material, such as lead, is required to shield their radiation. Gamma and x-rays frequently accompany alpha and beta particles (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F82388\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef82388 \">table 1</a>) and can be detected with Geiger counters and dosimeters [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-of-radiation-exposure-in-children/abstract/5,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,10</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Measures of radiation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Various units describe radiation exposure, dose, and quantity. The roentgen (R) is the unit used to describe radiation exposure; it measures radioactivity per unit of air.</p><p>The dose of absorbed radiation is expressed in rads (radiation absorbed dose) or grays (Gy); 100 rads equals one Gy. One Gy is defined as the absorption of one joule per kilogram.</p><p>The biologic damage per unit of radiation varies depending upon the radiation type. The dose-equivalent quantification is expressed in rems (roentgen equivalent man) or sieverts (Sv); 100 rems equal one Sv. The dose-equivalent quantification is calculated by multiplying the dose in rads by a &quot;quality factor&quot; that describes biologic damage. The quality factor for x-ray, gamma radiation, and beta particles is one, whereas for alpha particles and neutrons it is 20. Thus, one rad (0.01 Gy or 1 cGy) of gamma radiation is equal to one rem; and one rad of alpha radiation equals 20 rem. It is estimated that for every 100,000 people exposed to a one-time dose of 10 rems (0.1 Sv), an excess of 790 cancer deaths would occur [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-of-radiation-exposure-in-children/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].</p><p>The quantity of radiation in a given source is measured by the activity, or the number of atomic disintegrations per unit time. The units for this measure are the curie (Ci) and Becquerel (bQ). One curie equals 3.7 x 10(10) transformations per second; one Becquerel is one transformation per second; and 1mCi equals 37MBq [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-of-radiation-exposure-in-children/abstract/2,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,11</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h1\">LAWS OF RADIOSENSITIVITY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Three laws of radiosensitivity have been derived through observation of the effects of ionizing radiation on human tissue:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Radiosensitivity varies directly with the rate of cell proliferation: rapidly dividing cells (eg, of the gastrointestinal tract) are more profoundly affected.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Radiosensitivity varies directly with the number of future divisions. Gonadal cells and hematopoietic stem cells fall in this category.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Radiosensitivity varies indirectly with the degree of morphologic and functional differentiation. As an example, cells at the physeal growth plate, which have not yet developed into bone or cartilage, are more sensitive than those in the diaphysis (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F76662\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef76662 \">figure 1</a>). Growth arrest is common after radiation exposure to the growth plate, as may occur in the treatment of malignancy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-of-radiation-exposure-in-children/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].</p><p/><p>The precise dose at which toxic effects occur depends upon the dose, schedule, and route of exposure, as well as the type of radiation. Different types of radiation produce different patterns of injury, with beta particles causing local injury (usually burns), alpha particles and neutrons causing tissue damage, and gamma radiation causing both local injury and acute radiation syndrome [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-of-radiation-exposure-in-children/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h1\">SOURCES OF RADIATION EXPOSURE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Radiation injury is a rare occurrence. Since 1944, there have been 411 radiation accidents worldwide, resulting in the exposure of more than 133,000 people; the number of exposed children is not known [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-of-radiation-exposure-in-children/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. Most of the exposures (88 percent) occurred in the Chernobyl accident of 1986, which also resulted in 28 immediate deaths [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-of-radiation-exposure-in-children/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. More than one-half of the accidents (59 percent) meeting criteria for &quot;serious exposure&quot; as defined by the Radiation Emergency Assistance Center and Training Site <span class=\"nowrap\">(REAC/TS)</span> have occurred in the United States [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-of-radiation-exposure-in-children/abstract/5,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,13</a>]. More recently, on March 11, 2011, the Fukushima Dai-ichi nuclear power plant in Japan released a large amount of radioactive iodide and cesium into the environment after the core meltdown from the earthquakes and subsequent tsunamis. While no deaths have been directly attributed to that of radiation injury, long term studies are continuing [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-of-radiation-exposure-in-children/abstract/15,16\" class=\"abstract_t\">15,16</a>]. The Fukushima Health Management Survey, established after the Fukushima Daiichi accident, includes comprehensive thyroid screening of all individuals who were 18 years old or younger on April 1, 2011 (including fetuses) and will continue for the lifetime of all participants. At 20 to 30 months following the accident, no discernible increase in thyroid cancer or other pathology has been identified [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-of-radiation-exposure-in-children/abstract/17,18\" class=\"abstract_t\">17,18</a>]. It should be noted, however, that childhood thyroid cancer rates increased four to five years after the Chernobyl accident in 1986.</p><p>Exposure to radiation can occur in a variety of ways: background radiation, medical exposure, accidental industrial exposure, nuclear reactor accidents, and detonation of nuclear weapons. Regardless of the exposure source, children are more likely than are adults to have greater exposure for several reasons [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-of-radiation-exposure-in-children/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The relatively greater minute ventilation of children puts them at greater risk for exposure to radioactive gases.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Nuclear fallout rapidly falls to the ground, increasing the concentration of radioactive material in the space where children live and breathe.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h2\">Background radiation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The population receives background radiation from numerous sources including cosmic and terrestrial radiation (60 <span class=\"nowrap\">mrem/year),</span> natural radioactivity in body tissue (40 <span class=\"nowrap\">mrem/year),</span> and radon (variable, but approximately 200 <span class=\"nowrap\">mrem/year)</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-of-radiation-exposure-in-children/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>].

Chest radiographs (10 mrem), cardiac catheterization (16 rems), the administration of radioactive elements such as technetium, brachytherapy (the provision of local radiation therapy through the placement of a radioactive source within or in close proximity to a malignancy), and radiation therapy are examples [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-of-radiation-exposure-in-children/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p>Tremendous safeguards exist to prevent inadvertent overexposure of patients and medical personnel to radiation (eg, lead aprons worn by radiology personnel to protect against low-energy scattered radiation). Nonetheless, radiation injury can result from incorrect dose <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> exposure time in patients, inadvertent exposure of ancillary personnel, or inappropriate storage, handling, or disposal of radioactive materials. Even at appropriate doses (eg, as in radiation therapy for malignancy), adverse effects of radiation may occur.

As an example, in 1987, in Goiana, Brazil, an abandoned teletherapy source had its cesium-137 core breached. Hundreds of people were exposed to gamma and beta radiation, 48 were hospitalized for radiation injuries, and four died [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-of-radiation-exposure-in-children/abstract/20,21\" class=\"abstract_t\">20,21</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h2\">Industrial exposure</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In industry, radiation is used to examine high-pressure pipe welds, valves, and vessels.

The radiation may pass through the body or be absorbed by it. The individuals are not radioactive (ie, do not emit radiation) and pose no risk to healthcare workers as long as they are not contaminated with radioactive particulate matter as well.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The signs and symptoms of acute radiation syndrome are related to the whole-body absorbed dose of radiation. Doses less than 50 rad (0.5 Gy) are not expected to cause acute symptoms, whereas doses of 450 rad (4.5 Gy) are lethal to 50 percent of exposed persons. The onset, duration, and dominant manifestation of the syndrome depend upon the dose of radiation received. (See <a href=\"#H24\" class=\"local\">'Acute radiation syndrome'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Overt illness from radiation exposure includes hematopoietic failure, gastrointestinal symptoms, and with lethal exposure, central nervous system effects. The fall in the lymphocyte count after radiation exposure can be used to determine the dose of radiation received if time from exposure is known. (See <a href=\"#H27\" class=\"local\">'Overt illness phase'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The management of radiation injury in children is discussed separately.
