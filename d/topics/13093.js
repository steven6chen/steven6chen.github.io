For this reason, the pathogenic processes leading to PTB and development of preventive interventions are major targets of obstetric research.</p><p>This topic will discuss the major pathogenic mechanisms that lead to PTB. Risk factors for PTB and risk reduction interventions are reviewed separately.

The four primary processes are:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Premature activation of the maternal or fetal hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Exaggerated inflammatory <span class=\"nowrap\">response/infection</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Abruption (decidual hemorrhage)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pathological uterine distention</p><p/><p>These processes may lead to cervical shortening [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-spontaneous-preterm-birth/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>] and may be initiated long before PTL or preterm premature rupture of membranes (PPROM) are clinically evident.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">ACTIVATION OF THE HPA AXIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Stress is a common element activating a series of physiologic adaptive responses in the maternal and fetal compartments. From this perspective, premature activation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis can initiate PTB (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F59393\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef59393 \">algorithm 1</a>). Major maternal physical or psychological stressors, including anxiety and depression, can activate the maternal HPA axis and have been associated with a slightly higher rate of PTB [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-spontaneous-preterm-birth/abstract/2-9\" class=\"abstract_t\">2-9</a>]. As an example, a prospective cohort study of women with depressive symptoms early in pregnancy found that these women had almost twice the PTB risk of women without such symptoms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-spontaneous-preterm-birth/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. The risk of PTB increased with increasing severity of depression, suggesting a &quot;dose-response&quot; effect. In addition, data derived from a large New York database provided evidence that mothers with posttraumatic stress disorder were more likely to deliver preterm (OR 2.48, 95% CI 1.05&ndash;5.84) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-spontaneous-preterm-birth/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>].</p><p>Premature fetal HPA activation can result from the stress of uteroplacental vasculopathy and has a higher correlation with subsequent PTB than maternal stress [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-spontaneous-preterm-birth/abstract/12-14\" class=\"abstract_t\">12-14</a>]. In one study, spontaneous PTB &le;35 to 36 weeks of gestation was associated with a four- to seven-fold increased risk of placental pathological evidence of vascular damage, bleeding, fetal vascular disruption, or lack of normal physiologic conversion of maternal spiral arteries [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-spontaneous-preterm-birth/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. In another report, severe preeclampsia was associated with a threefold increase in the risk of spontaneous PTB [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-spontaneous-preterm-birth/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. In contrast to women with uncomplicated first pregnancies, a third study found that women whose first pregnancy ended in spontaneous PTB were at increased risk of PTB, preeclampsia, and fetal growth restriction in their second pregnancy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-spontaneous-preterm-birth/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. The earlier the PTB occurred, the higher the risk of one of these complications in the second pregnancy.</p><p>The mechanisms by which HPA activation are thought to cause spontaneous PTB include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Increased placental production and release of corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH), which appears to program a &quot;placental clock&quot; [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-spontaneous-preterm-birth/abstract/18,19\" class=\"abstract_t\">18,19</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Increased release of fetal pituitary adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) secretion, which stimulates production of placental estrogenic compounds and prostaglandins that may activate the myometrium and initiate labor [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-spontaneous-preterm-birth/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Corticotropin-releasing hormone</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH) appears to play a role in both term and preterm birth. CRH is released by the hypothalamus but, during pregnancy, is also expressed by placental and chorionic trophoblast, amniochorion, and decidual cells [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-spontaneous-preterm-birth/abstract/21-23\" class=\"abstract_t\">21-23</a>]. It stimulates the secretion of ACTH from the pituitary, which then promotes the release of cortisol from the adrenal. In the maternal HPA axis, cortisol inhibits hypothalamic CRH and pituitary ACTH release, creating a negative feedback loop. In contrast, cortisol stimulates CRH release in the decidua-trophoblast-membrane compartment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-spontaneous-preterm-birth/abstract/23,24\" class=\"abstract_t\">23,24</a>]. CRH, in turn, further drives maternal and fetal HPA activation, establishing a potent positive feedback loop.</p><p>CRH also enhances prostaglandin production by amnion, chorion, and decidua [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-spontaneous-preterm-birth/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. In turn, prostaglandins stimulate CRH release from the placenta [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-spontaneous-preterm-birth/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>], creating a second positive feedback loop for CRH secretion.</p><p>In a normal pregnancy, it is hypothesized that maturation of the fetal HPA axis and development of the fetal zone of the fetal adrenal gland beginning in midgestation cause a physiologic increase in fetal cortisol secretion and enhancing CRH release from the placenta [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-spontaneous-preterm-birth/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. The effects of CRH are augmented near term by a reduction in maternal plasma CRH-binding protein [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-spontaneous-preterm-birth/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. As noted above, the CRH-induced increases in maternal and fetal adrenal cortisol synthesis and placental prostaglandin production promote positive feedback loops that lead to even higher levels of CRH, cortisol, and prostaglandins [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-spontaneous-preterm-birth/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. There is also some evidence that CRH can directly augment myometrial activation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-spontaneous-preterm-birth/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>].</p><p>The rise in prostaglandins ultimately results in parturition via the elaboration of genital tract proteases (eg, matrix metalloproteinases [MMPs]) and enhanced myometrial contractility [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-spontaneous-preterm-birth/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. In vitro studies in human myometrial cells suggest that prostaglandins act to increase the progesterone receptor (PR)-A to B expression ratio [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-spontaneous-preterm-birth/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]. In vitro studies of human decidual cells suggest that prostaglandin F2-alpha can inhibit PR mRNA and protein expression [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-spontaneous-preterm-birth/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>]. Since the PR-A isoform can antagonize the antiparturition effects of the PR-B isoform, these findings suggest that prostaglandins can induce functional progesterone withdrawal. Indeed, since prostaglandins can induce labor at virtually any point in gestation, their generation is an integral part of the common final pathway of PTB.</p><p>If the sequence of events outlined above occurs too early in gestation, PTL and PTB may result. This was illustrated in a prospective cohort study that measured serum CRH concentrations between 17 and 30 weeks of gestation in 860 unselected pregnant women [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-spontaneous-preterm-birth/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>]. The median serum CRH in pregnancies that subsequently spontaneously delivered preterm (37 women) was twice the median value of women of the same gestational age who went on to deliver at term.</p><p>Increased fetal adrenal zone size correlates with enhanced adrenal activity and increased fetal adrenal gland volume, as measured by three-dimensional ultrasound, is a potential predictor of stress associated prematurity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-spontaneous-preterm-birth/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>]. However, since the fetal adrenal zone is not well developed until the third trimester, fetal stress-associated PTB is more likely to account for later PTBs. </p><p>Maternal <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> fetal stress may also enhance steroid-induced immunophilin cochaperone FKBP51 expression in decidual cells, which may lead to functional progesterone withdrawal from inhibition of progesterone receptor <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> glucocorticoid receptor mediated transcription [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-spontaneous-preterm-birth/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Estrogens</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Activation of the fetal HPA axis also leads to PTB through a pathway involving estrogens. Fetal pituitary ACTH secretion stimulates adrenal synthesis of dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate (DHEA), which is converted to 16-hydroxy-DHEA-S in the fetal liver. Placental CRH can also augment fetal adrenal DHEA production directly [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-spontaneous-preterm-birth/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>]. The placenta converts these androgen precursors to <a href=\"topic.htm?path=estrone-united-states-not-available-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">estrone</a> (E1), estradiol (E2), and estriol (E3), which, in the presence of estrogen receptor-alpha (ER-alpha), activate the myometrium by increasing gap junction formation, oxytocin receptors, prostaglandin activity, and enzymes responsible for muscle contraction (myosin light chain kinase, calmodulin) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-spontaneous-preterm-birth/abstract/37-41\" class=\"abstract_t\">37-41</a>]. Moreover, the functional progesterone withdrawal noted above is expected to be accompanied by rising concentrations of myometrial ER-alpha, thereby mediating this estrogen-induced myometrial activation.</p><p>In the setting of infection-induced fetal stress, the fetal cortisol-to-DHEA ratio remains low, with no direct correlation between the fetal adrenal gland volume and either cortisol or DHEA levels [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-spontaneous-preterm-birth/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>]. This suggests that infection-mediated PTB may act via alternative pathways.</p><p>The potential predictive value of estrogenic compounds was suggested by a prospective study in which serial measurements of salivary E3 were obtained [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-spontaneous-preterm-birth/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>]. Mean salivary estriol was higher from 24 to 34 weeks of gestation in women with singleton pregnancies delivering preterm than in those delivering at term. A surge in salivary E3 occurred three to four weeks before the onset of labor in both groups. The predictive value of salivary estriol measurements was greatest for later PTBs (&ge;34 weeks). The precise mechanism for this limitation remains unknown; however, it likely reflects the requirement for development of the fetal zone of the fetal adrenal, which is responsible for the bulk of DHEA production and enlarges rapidly in the last six weeks of gestation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-spontaneous-preterm-birth/abstract/43\" class=\"abstract_t\">43</a>]. In turn, sonographic measurement of fetal adrenal size appears to be predictive of PTB risk, with relatively high sensitivity and specificity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-spontaneous-preterm-birth/abstract/44\" class=\"abstract_t\">44</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h1\">INFECTION AND INFLAMMATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Inflammation is a highly coordinated process set in place to protect the host [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-spontaneous-preterm-birth/abstract/45\" class=\"abstract_t\">45</a>]. When properly controlled, inflammation is beneficial, but when dysregulated, it becomes harmful [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-spontaneous-preterm-birth/abstract/46\" class=\"abstract_t\">46</a>].</p><p>Laboratory and clinical data show a link between spontaneous PTB and the presence of both systemic and genitourinary tract pathogens [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-spontaneous-preterm-birth/abstract/47-53\" class=\"abstract_t\">47-53</a>]. For example,</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a large retrospective population-based study of 199,093 deliveries, 2.5 percent of patients had asymptomatic bacteriuria, which was independently associated with PTB (adjusted OR 1.6, 95% CI 1.5-1.7) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-spontaneous-preterm-birth/abstract/47\" class=\"abstract_t\">47</a>]. Conversely, the diagnosis and treatment of asymptomatic bacteriuria appears to reduce the risk of PTB [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-spontaneous-preterm-birth/abstract/48\" class=\"abstract_t\">48</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In another study of 759 women who underwent first trimester assessment of their vaginal flora, those with normal vaginal flora had a 75 percent lower risk of delivery before 35 weeks than women with abnormal vaginal flora [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-spontaneous-preterm-birth/abstract/49\" class=\"abstract_t\">49</a>]. Absence of lactobacilli and the presence of bacterial vaginosis (BV) were both associated with a twofold increased risk of PTB, while gram positive coccus-associated aerobic vaginitis was associated with a three-fold increase in risk of PTB. Others have reported that <em>Lactobacillus</em> are the predominant flora of the microbial community in normal pregnancy and the prevalence of a <em>Lactobacillus</em>-poor vaginal community state type (CST 4) is inversely correlated with gestational age at delivery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-spontaneous-preterm-birth/abstract/54\" class=\"abstract_t\">54</a>]. In addition, the risk for PTB is more pronounced for women with CST 4 and elevated <em>Gardnerella </em>or <em>Ureaplasma</em>. However, treatment of BV does not appear to consistently reduce PTB rates in low-risk patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-spontaneous-preterm-birth/abstract/55\" class=\"abstract_t\">55</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Similarly, periodontal disease and subsequent systemic inflammation may play a role in triggering PTB [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-spontaneous-preterm-birth/abstract/56\" class=\"abstract_t\">56</a>]. Intervention studies have not consistently demonstrated a benefit to treatment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-spontaneous-preterm-birth/abstract/50,51,57\" class=\"abstract_t\">50,51,57</a>]. However, it remains possible that the putative beneficial effects of periodontal treatment may be dependent on time of initiation and success of therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-spontaneous-preterm-birth/abstract/58\" class=\"abstract_t\">58</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=preterm-birth-risk-factors-and-interventions-for-risk-reduction\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Preterm birth: Risk factors and interventions for risk reduction&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Lastly, both clinical and subclinical chorioamnionitis are much more common in preterm than term deliveries, and may account for 50 percent of PTB before 30 weeks of gestation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-spontaneous-preterm-birth/abstract/59\" class=\"abstract_t\">59</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=preterm-birth-risk-factors-and-interventions-for-risk-reduction#H1559370150\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Preterm birth: Risk factors and interventions for risk reduction&quot;, section on 'Infection'</a>.)</p><p/><p>These studies, and others, suggest that disorders of maternal innate or acquired immunity, rather than the mere presence of certain genital tract bacteria, are the primary causes of inflammation-associated PTB.</p><p>There is a significant racial disparity in inflammation-associated PTB, with African-Americans disproportionately affected [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-spontaneous-preterm-birth/abstract/60\" class=\"abstract_t\">60</a>]. This may be explained by the observation that multiple maternal and fetal inflammatory pathway genetic polymorphisms linked to inflammation-associated PTB have been found in greater prevalence among African-American mothers <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> fetuses than among Caucasians [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-spontaneous-preterm-birth/abstract/61,62\" class=\"abstract_t\">61,62</a>]. For example, African-American mothers harboring both a polymorphism of the tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF) gene and bacterial vaginosis are at significantly greater risk of PTB (OR 6.1; 95% CI 1.9&ndash;21.0) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-spontaneous-preterm-birth/abstract/63\" class=\"abstract_t\">63</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=preterm-birth-risk-factors-and-interventions-for-risk-reduction#H1613249247\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Preterm birth: Risk factors and interventions for risk reduction&quot;, section on 'Genetic factors'</a>.)</p><p>Binding of bacterial ligands to toll-like receptors (TLRs) in decidual, amnion-chorion and cervical and placental cells and resident leucocytes induce the transcription factor NFkappaB which, in turn, triggers a maternal <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> fetal inflammatory response in susceptible individuals that is linked to PTB (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F50691\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef50691 \">algorithm 2</a>). Activation of the TLRs is dependent not only on the presence of bacterial molecular wall motifs, but also on a palette of intracellular signaling adaptors (eg, MyD88), co-receptor molecules (eg, CD14<em>) </em>[<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-spontaneous-preterm-birth/abstract/64\" class=\"abstract_t\">64</a>]<em>, </em>and soluble receptor modulators (soluble TLR2, soluble TNF receptor-1, soluble IL-6 receptor, soluble gp130 and soluble RAGE) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-spontaneous-preterm-birth/abstract/65-68\" class=\"abstract_t\">65-68</a>].</p><p>This TLR-mediated response is ultimately characterized by the presence of activated neutrophils and, to a lesser extent, activated macrophages and various proinflammatory mediators (eg, interleukins [IL] 1,6, and 8; TNF, granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF), colony stimulating factor-2 (CSF-2), and MMPs). The key initial mediators of this response are IL-1beta and TNF, which enhance prostaglandin production by inducing COX-2 expression in the amnion and decidua while inhibiting the prostaglandin metabolizing enzyme, 15-hydroxy-prostaglandin dehydrogenase (PGDH) in the chorion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-spontaneous-preterm-birth/abstract/69,70\" class=\"abstract_t\">69,70</a>]. Moreover, IL-1beta <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> TNF directly enhance the expression of various MMPs in the amnio-chorion, decidua, and cervix to degrade the extracellular matrix of the fetal membranes and cervix [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-spontaneous-preterm-birth/abstract/71-73\" class=\"abstract_t\">71-73</a>]. </p><p>Furthermore, chorioamnionitis is associated with intense decidual immunostaining for IL-8 and CSF-2, which recruit neutrophils capable of releasing additional PPROM-causing MMPs and IL-1beta <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> TNF greatly augment the output of IL-8 and CSF-2 in term decidual cells [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-spontaneous-preterm-birth/abstract/74,75\" class=\"abstract_t\">74,75</a>]. TNF-alpha plays an additional role, since it can induce apoptosis (physiologic cell death). Elevated levels of TNF and increased apoptosis in amnion epithelial cells have been associated with PPROM [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-spontaneous-preterm-birth/abstract/76\" class=\"abstract_t\">76</a>]. Chorioamnionitis is also linked to increased decidual and membrane IL-6 production [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-spontaneous-preterm-birth/abstract/77,78\" class=\"abstract_t\">77,78</a>], which further enhances decidual and fetal membrane prostaglandin production, and G-CSF expression, which recruits and activates neutrophils [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-spontaneous-preterm-birth/abstract/79,80\" class=\"abstract_t\">79,80</a>]. Complement activation also appears to play a role [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-spontaneous-preterm-birth/abstract/81\" class=\"abstract_t\">81</a>]. Thus, both maternal and fetal inflammatory responses to infection are processes that can lead to PTL and PPROM. In contrast, the presence of bacteria, without a host response, does not always cause an adverse outcome (see below) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-spontaneous-preterm-birth/abstract/82\" class=\"abstract_t\">82</a>].</p><p>Immunohistochemical staining of placentas from patients with chorioamnionitis-associated PTB demonstrated significantly lower PR levels in decidual cells [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-spontaneous-preterm-birth/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>]. Moreover, treatment of cultured term decidual cells with IL-1beta decreased PR-B and A isoform expression as well as PR mRNA levels and significantly increased PGE2 and PGF2alpha production and COX-2 expression. While addition of PGF2alpha to these cultures also suppressed PR expression, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=indomethacin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">indomethacin</a> did not reverse IL-1beta inhibition of PR levels, suggesting a direct inhibitory effect by this cytokine on PR expression. Taken together these studies suggest that infection-associated PTB is, at least in part, caused by IL-1beta-mediated functional progesterone withdrawal.</p><p>Elevated proinflammatory mediator levels have been demonstrated in the amniotic fluid of women with PTL with intact membranes and these levels correlated well with positive results from culture of the amniotic fluid and fetal membranes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-spontaneous-preterm-birth/abstract/83\" class=\"abstract_t\">83</a>]. In a review of 17 primary studies compromising 6270 asymptomatic women, elevated cervicovaginal and amniotic fluid IL-6 levels at mid-gestation predicted PTB with odds ratios (OR) of 3.05 (95% CI 2.00-4.67; number needed to treat = 7) and 4.52 (95% CI 2.67-7.65; number needed to treat = 7), respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-spontaneous-preterm-birth/abstract/84\" class=\"abstract_t\">84</a>]. In addition, patients with intraamniotic inflammation destined to deliver preterm appear to present unique amniotic fluid, vaginal-cervical secretion, and serum proteomic profiles [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-spontaneous-preterm-birth/abstract/85-89\" class=\"abstract_t\">85-89</a>]. In one study, 104 amniotic fluid samples of patients at risk for PTB were analyzed using surface-enhanced laser desorption ionization (SELDI) proteomic profiling [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-spontaneous-preterm-birth/abstract/85\" class=\"abstract_t\">85</a>]. Patients with intraamniotic inflammation that delivered preterm were found to display neutrophil defensins-1 and -2, and calgranulins A and C. The presence of more than two of these proteins had greater than 90 percent sensitivity and specificity for detection of intraamniotic inflammation. Although the measurement of proinflammatory mediators is possible, these tests have not been sufficiently studied to be clinically useful at this time.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Bacteria</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In addition to inducing an inflammatory response, bacteria may also have a direct role in the pathogenesis of PTB. Some organisms (eg, Pseudomonas, Staphylococcus, Streptococcus, Bacteroides, and Enterobacter) produce proteases, collagenases, and elastases that can degrade the fetal membranes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-spontaneous-preterm-birth/abstract/90,91\" class=\"abstract_t\">90,91</a>]. Bacteria also produce phospholipase A2 (which leads to prostaglandin synthesis) and endotoxin, substances that stimulate uterine contractions and can cause PTL [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-spontaneous-preterm-birth/abstract/92\" class=\"abstract_t\">92</a>].</p><p>Metagenomic techniques, including surveillance of the 16S-rRNA gene, have increased understanding of the spectrum of cultivated and uncultivated human microbial agents involved in the pathogenesis of PTB [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-spontaneous-preterm-birth/abstract/93\" class=\"abstract_t\">93</a>]. By using metagenomic tools, several groups of investigators reported that in pregnancies complicated by PTB secondary to infection approximately two thirds of the amniotic fluid bacteria detected by culture-independent methods were not isolated in cultures [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-spontaneous-preterm-birth/abstract/94,95\" class=\"abstract_t\">94,95</a>]. These included both uncultivated and difficult-to-cultivate species, such as Fusobacterium nucleatum, Leptotrichia (Sneathia), Bergeyella, Peptostreptococcus, Bacteroides, and a species of the order Clostridials. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Proinflammatory mediators unrelated to infection</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Noninfectious etiologies, such as placental hypoperfusion, also appear to increase production of proinflammatory mediators [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-spontaneous-preterm-birth/abstract/96\" class=\"abstract_t\">96</a>]. This may be another mechanism accounting for the slightly higher rate of spontaneous PTB among growth restricted infants [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-spontaneous-preterm-birth/abstract/97\" class=\"abstract_t\">97</a>].</p><p>In addition, there is increasing evidence that psychological stress and distress (ie, depressive symptoms) can cause dysregulation of inflammatory processes leading to elevations in circulating inflammatory cytokines and exaggerated inflammatory responses [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-spontaneous-preterm-birth/abstract/98\" class=\"abstract_t\">98</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h1\">DECIDUAL HEMORRHAGE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Vaginal bleeding from decidual hemorrhage is associated with a high risk of PTL and PPROM [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-spontaneous-preterm-birth/abstract/99-101\" class=\"abstract_t\">99-101</a>]. Decidual hemorrhage (placental abruption) originates in damaged decidual blood vessels and presents clinically as vaginal bleeding or retroplacental hematoma formation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-spontaneous-preterm-birth/abstract/102\" class=\"abstract_t\">102</a>]. In a case-control study of 341 patients, vaginal bleeding in more than one trimester increased the risk of PPROM sevenfold [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-spontaneous-preterm-birth/abstract/99\" class=\"abstract_t\">99</a>]. In another series, occult decidual hemorrhage (manifested by hemosiderin deposition and retro-chorionic hematoma formation) was present in 38 percent of patients with PTB between 22 and 32 weeks of gestation due to PPROM and 36 percent of patients experiencing PTB after PTL; these placental findings were present in only 0.8 percent of term deliveries (p &lt;0.01) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-spontaneous-preterm-birth/abstract/101\" class=\"abstract_t\">101</a>]. </p><p>As noted above, PTB is strongly linked to histological evidence of maternal spiral artery hemorrhage and damage [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-spontaneous-preterm-birth/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. In a prospective cohort analysis of maternal genotypes, pregnancy outcomes, and placental pathology among 560 Caucasian and 399 black women, the factor V Leiden and angiotensinogen-6G&gt;A mutations were positively linked to abruption-associated PTBs (OR 4.8; 95% CI:1.6-14.2 and OR 3.8; 95% CI, 1.3-10.5, respectively), but not with other causes of preterm delivery and only among Caucasians [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-spontaneous-preterm-birth/abstract/103\" class=\"abstract_t\">103</a>]. This suggests that polymorphisms predisposing to decidual vasculopathy, thrombosis, and abruption also predispose to PTB. This finding helps account for the predominance of abruption-associated PTB in European populations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-spontaneous-preterm-birth/abstract/104\" class=\"abstract_t\">104</a>].</p><p>The development of PPROM in the setting of abruption may be related to the high decidual concentration of tissue factor, the primary cellular mediator of hemostasis. Following intrauterine hemorrhage from placental abruption, decidual tissue factor combines with factor Vlla to activate factor Xa, which in turn complexes with its cofactor, Va, to generate thrombin (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F80402\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef80402 \">figure 1</a>). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-hemostasis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of hemostasis&quot;</a>.) In addition to its hemostatic properties, thrombin binds to decidual protease-activated receptors (PAR1 and 3) that up-regulate the expression of proteases such as MMPs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-spontaneous-preterm-birth/abstract/105-107\" class=\"abstract_t\">105-107</a>]. </p><p>Abruption can be accompanied by an inflammatory process in the absence of infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-spontaneous-preterm-birth/abstract/108\" class=\"abstract_t\">108</a>]. Proteomics studies provided evidence that proteases and free hemoglobin chains activate innate immunity and a feed-forward mechanism that reinforces the inflammatory process, leading to PPROM and PTB. In addition, thrombin is a potent inducer of IL-8 in decidual cells, accounting for the dense neutrophil infiltrate observed in abruption-associated PPROM in the absence of infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-spontaneous-preterm-birth/abstract/109\" class=\"abstract_t\">109</a>]. The interactive effects of thrombin-enhanced MMPs with neutrophil-derived proteases promote degradation of the fetal membrane extracellular matrix, which can result in PPROM (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F54338\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef54338 \">algorithm 3</a>).</p><p>Decidual hemorrhage results in intense local thrombin generation. Hormonal factors such as progesterone play an important modulator role [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-spontaneous-preterm-birth/abstract/110\" class=\"abstract_t\">110</a>]. Thrombin also induces synthesis of elements of the fibrinolytic system in decidual cells [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-spontaneous-preterm-birth/abstract/111\" class=\"abstract_t\">111</a>]. However, the primary effect of thrombin is to inhibit fibrinolysis via generation of type-1 plasminogen inhibitor (PAI-1) to avoid hemorrhage in the setting of abruption, suggesting that abruption-associated decidual proteolysis and PPROM are mediated primarily by thrombin-enhanced MMP expression.</p><p>In laboratory studies, small quantities of thrombin produced during coagulation increased the frequency, intensity, and tone of myometrial contractions; an effect that is suppressed by blood containing thrombin inhibitors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-spontaneous-preterm-birth/abstract/112,113\" class=\"abstract_t\">112,113</a>]. Interactions of thrombin with PARs lead to activation of the phosphatidylinositol pathway. Abruption-associated generation of thrombin also appears to initiate functional progestin withdrawal in the decidua by inhibiting expression of progesterone receptors in decidual cells [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-spontaneous-preterm-birth/abstract/114\" class=\"abstract_t\">114</a>]. As with IL-1beta mediated inhibition of decidual cell PR expression, thrombin inhibition of PR protein and mRNA expression is also mediated by <span class=\"nowrap\">ERK1/2</span> MAPK signaling. This may be a mechanism for PTL in pregnancies complicated by antepartum bleeding. However, the main effect of thrombin released at the site of decidual hemorrhage is to maintain hemostasis, rather than to stimulate uterine contractions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-spontaneous-preterm-birth/abstract/111\" class=\"abstract_t\">111</a>].</p><p>Thrombin activation (measured by serum thrombin-antithrombin complex levels [TAT]) has been noted in women with PTL and in asymptomatic women who subsequently delivered preterm. A pilot study of 23 gravidas at 24.0 to 32.9 weeks of gestation hospitalized with PTL found significantly higher blood TAT levels in those who subsequently delivered within three weeks compared to gestational-age matched nonlaboring controls or PTL patients who did not deliver within three weeks (TAT levels 7.8 &plusmn; 2.86 <span class=\"nowrap\">ng/mL,</span> 5.77 &plusmn; 1.43 <span class=\"nowrap\">ng/mL,</span> and 5.57 &plusmn; 1.69 <span class=\"nowrap\">ng/mL,</span> respectively) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-spontaneous-preterm-birth/abstract/115\" class=\"abstract_t\">115</a>]. A TAT level of greater than 8.0 <span class=\"nowrap\">ng/mL</span> in symptomatic women had sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative predictive values of 50, 91, 80, and 71 percent, respectively, for delivery within three weeks. A TAT level greater than 6.3 <span class=\"nowrap\">ng/mL</span> had sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative predictive values of 75, 73, 67, and 73 percent, respectively. In another study of women undergoing second trimester genetic amniocentesis, amniotic fluid TAT concentration was statistically higher in women who subsequently had a spontaneous or indicated preterm birth (median 87.6 and 117.7 <span class=\"nowrap\">mcg/L,</span> respectively) than those who delivered at term (66.3 <span class=\"nowrap\">mcg/L)</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-spontaneous-preterm-birth/abstract/116\" class=\"abstract_t\">116</a>].</p><p>These results should be validated before TAT levels are used to manage patients.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h1\">PATHOLOGIC UTERINE DISTENTION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Multiple gestation, polyhydramnios, and other causes of excessive uterine distention are well described risk factors for PTB. Enhanced stretching of the myometrium induces formation of gap junctions, upregulation of oxytocin receptors, and production of inflammatory cytokines and prostaglandins, and myosin light chain kinase, which are critical events preceding uterine contractions and cervical dilation (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F55323\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef55323 \">figure 2</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-spontaneous-preterm-birth/abstract/117-119\" class=\"abstract_t\">117-119</a>].

(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=physiology-of-parturition\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Physiology of parturition&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Distention of the fetal membranes also contributes to myometrial activation. Cytokines, prostaglandins, and collagenase are produced from excess membrane stretch [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-spontaneous-preterm-birth/abstract/121-123\" class=\"abstract_t\">121-123</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h1\">PATHOLOGIC CERVICAL CHANGE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Cervical insufficiency refers to pathological dilatation <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> effacement of the uterine cervix unrelated to labor and leading to previable pregnancy loss, as well as PTB.

(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cervical-insufficiency\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Cervical insufficiency&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Cervical insufficiency due to intrinsic cervical factors is probably a rare event. It is more likely that progressive cervical shortening prior to viability results from activation of the inflammatory of hemorrhagic pathways at a point in gestation when both myometrial quiescence, as well as amniotic fluid, fetal membrane, and decidual antiprotease activity are maximal. Thus, cervical change occurs without apparent antecedent PTL and PPROM.</p><p>Genetic factors may also play a role in the PTB phenotype. For example, the enhancing G13 allele in the anti-inflammatory IL-10.G microsatellite occurs more frequently in women with cervical insufficiency compared with controls, suggesting that constitutively increased anti-inflammatory modulators may produce cervical insufficiency rather than PTL or PPROM phenotype in the face of inflammatory or hemorrhagic stimuli [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-spontaneous-preterm-birth/abstract/125\" class=\"abstract_t\">125</a>].</p><p>Even putative mechanical causes of cervical insufficiency may have other etiologies. In a retrospective cohort study of 624 women who delivered after a loop electrosurgical excision procedure (LEEP), the risk of PTB was increased two-fold and the risk was even higher following repeated procedures or larger biopsies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-spontaneous-preterm-birth/abstract/126\" class=\"abstract_t\">126</a>]. However, this apparent effect may reflect ascertainment bias since another retrospective cohort analysis of women with CIN3 compared to women with no record of CIN found the former were significantly more likely to have spontaneous PTB (OR of 1.52; 95% CI: 1.29-1.80) and that LEEP did not alter these pregnancy complication rates [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-spontaneous-preterm-birth/abstract/127\" class=\"abstract_t\">127</a>]. This suggests that immunological, clinical or social risk factors associated with the development CIN rather than cervical surgery alone may increase PTB rates in women who have undergone LEEP.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1074481179\"><span class=\"h1\">GENETICS OF PRETERM BIRTH</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Preterm birth (PTB) demonstrates familial aggregation.

In a genome-wide association study among 43,568 women of European ancestry that used gestational duration as a continuous variable and either term or preterm birth (&lt;37 weeks) as a dichotomous outcome, four genetic loci (<em>EBF1</em>, <em>EEFSEC</em>, <em>AGTR2</em>, and <em>WNT4</em>) were significantly associated with gestational duration in both the discovery and replication data sets [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-spontaneous-preterm-birth/abstract/129\" class=\"abstract_t\">129</a>]. Functional analysis suggested that a variant in the <em>WNT4</em> gene altered the binding of the estrogen receptor. Common variants in <em>EBF1</em>, <em>EEFSEC</em>, and <em>AGTR2</em> showed association with PTB with genome-wide significance, and analysis of mother-infant dyads indicated that they act at the level of the maternal genome.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h1\">SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>There are four discrete mechanisms for the pathogenesis of preterm birth (see <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Overview'</a> above):</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Premature activation of the maternal or fetal hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Exaggerated inflammatory <span class=\"nowrap\">response/infection</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Decidual hemorrhage</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Pathological uterine distention</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Although each mechanism has distinct epidemiological, genetic, and clinical characteristics, they are not mutually exclusive.
