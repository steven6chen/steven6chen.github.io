Chronic daily headache types of long duration (ie, four hours or more) include chronic migraine, chronic tension-type headache, medication overuse headache, hemicrania continua, and new daily persistent headache.</p><p>Medication overuse headache (MOH) is a common problem in clinical practice that needs to be properly managed in order to increase the likelihood of successful chronic daily headache treatment.</p><p>This topic will review the treatment and prognosis of MOH. Other clinical aspects of MOH are discussed elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=medication-overuse-headache-etiology-clinical-features-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Medication overuse headache: Etiology, clinical features, and diagnosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The remaining subtypes of chronic daily headache are reviewed separately.

It is also important to educate patients about the detrimental effects of analgesic overuse. Bridge (transitional) therapy may be useful during the immediate post-discontinuation phase to provide symptomatic relief, although there are only limited supportive data. For most patients, preventive (prophylactic) therapy aimed at the suspected background primary headache disorder (eg, migraine) should be included in the treatment strategy for MOH [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/medication-overuse-headache-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Screening and intervening for comorbid psychiatric and substance use disorders is also recommended [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/medication-overuse-headache-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/2,3\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,3</a>].</p><p>Once the overused medications have been discontinued, an ongoing headache treatment regimen is needed for acute and preventive therapy, since most patients will continue to have intermittent headaches. Close follow-up after discontinuation of the overused medications is imperative to evaluate progress and prevent relapse.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">PATIENT EDUCATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Clinicians must educate patients about the detrimental effects of analgesic overuse [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/medication-overuse-headache-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Patients need to understand that analgesics have the potential to cause medication overuse headache (MOH), and that analgesic overuse can potentially negate or reduce the effectiveness of headache preventive measures [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/medication-overuse-headache-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].</p><p>Although data are limited, adequate patient education and support play a major role in withdrawal therapy of MOH. A prospective, unblinded trial of 120 patients with migraine plus MOH randomly assigned patients to either strong advice to discontinue the overused medication, or to a structured inpatient or outpatient detoxification program [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/medication-overuse-headache-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. Patients in all three groups were instructed to stop the overused medication, and all were permitted to use nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) or triptans not more than two days a week for symptomatic relief. Approximately 75 percent of patients in all groups successfully discontinued the overused medications. The trial excluded patients who overused agents containing opioids, benzodiazepines, and barbiturates, and those with coexisting medical or psychiatric illness, and the results may not be generalizable to all patients with MOH.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h1\">DISCONTINUATION OF THE OVERUSED MEDICATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The range of short-term benefit following medication discontinuation for patients with medication overuse headache (MOH) is suggested by the following observations:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A meta-analysis of 17 studies and 1101 patients with MOH defined treatment success as either no headache at all or a reduction in headache days of &gt;50 percent following withdrawal therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/medication-overuse-headache-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. The mean success rate within one to six months after withdrawal was 72 percent.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>An uncontrolled prospective study evaluated 175 patients with probable MOH, all of whom complied with abrupt discontinuation of acute headache medication and a two month medication-free period [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/medication-overuse-headache-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. After the medication-free period, prophylactic treatment was started and follow-up continued for a mean time of 228 days. Approximately one-half of patients had a significant reduction in headache frequency with discontinuation of the offending drug. In the remaining 50 percent of patients, who showed no improvement at two months after drug discontinuation, there was a significant 26 percent decrease in headache frequency after the end of the medication-free period until the end of the study. The authors concluded that acute medication discontinuation resulted in a responsive state amenable to prophylactic intervention.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Results from an early observational study suggested that daily concomitant use of analgesic medications might reduce the effect of prophylactic medications, while discontinuing daily analgesic medications enhanced the beneficial effect of prophylactic medications [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/medication-overuse-headache-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].

Most patients can be managed as outpatients. Outpatient discontinuation is particularly appropriate for patients who are highly motivated and do not take barbiturates or tranquilizers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/medication-overuse-headache-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>].</p><p>Significant complications may occur as a consequence of drug dependency when withdrawing from opioids, benzodiazepines and barbiturates, and the choice between outpatient and inpatient withdrawal of these agents remains an area of debate [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/medication-overuse-headache-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. Some experts favor inpatient withdrawal with close observation and medical monitoring in the first several days [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/medication-overuse-headache-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. However, it is often reasonable to try outpatient treatment first unless serious withdrawal problems develop or are considered likely.</p><p>In addition to the number and type of overused substances, variables influencing the choice between outpatient and inpatient management include family support structure, patient motivation, medical stability, presence of coexisting medical illness, psychological and psychiatric comorbidities, and need for patient monitoring during administration of medical therapies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/medication-overuse-headache-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/3,17\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,17</a>].</p><p>The suggested outpatient approach for discontinuation of overused medications other than barbiturates, opioids, or benzodiazepines is straightforward [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/medication-overuse-headache-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Discontinue the overused medication abruptly</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Provide rescue abortive therapy that can be used no more than two days per week and is from a medication class that is different than the overused medication</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Start preventive therapy or optimize existing preventive therapy</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients who are expected to be unsuccessful with the strategy of abrupt discontinuation of the overused medication combined with rescue abortive therapy and preventive therapy, bridge therapy with a long-acting nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) or steroid can be added to the treatment regimen</p><p/><p>With overuse of barbiturates, opioids, or benzodiazepines, the pace of withdrawal depends on the amount and frequency of usage. Abrupt outpatient withdrawal is routinely done in clinical practice if intake of the offending agent is not very high.

Our suggested regimen is 30 mg of phenobarbital per day for every 100 mg of butalbital that was being used, given that each 100 mg of butalbital is pharmacologically equivalent to 30 mg of phenobarbital.

Bridge therapy is recommended for patients who, in the clinician's opinion, are unlikely to be successful with a treatment plan consisting of discontinuing the overused medication along with rescue therapy and preventive therapy. Although there are inadequate published data to confirm that bridge therapy is effective, strategies that may have some merit include the short-term use of certain oral (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=naproxen-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">naproxen</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tizanidine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">tizanidine</a>, glucocorticoids) and intravenous (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=dihydroergotamine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">dihydroergotamine</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prochlorperazine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">prochlorperazine</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lidocaine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">lidocaine</a>, valproic acid, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aspirin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">aspirin</a>) medications.</p><p>The data supporting these strategies are largely from case series, retrospective chart reviews, prospective uncontrolled studies, and expert opinion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/medication-overuse-headache-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. No high-quality comparative studies exist regarding the different options for analgesic discontinuation. Given the available data, reviewed below, when bridge therapy is used, we suggest use of either long-acting nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prednisone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">prednisone</a>, or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dihydroergotamine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">dihydroergotamine</a> (DHE).

Ten patients were given symptomatic medication (antiemetics, analgesics, and hydration) as needed, while 12 patients were treated with naproxen (500 mg twice daily) starting one day before the ergotamine withdrawal was initiated and continuing until the withdrawal was complete. By the eighth day after withdrawal, those on naproxen had significantly less pain, nausea, vomiting, and restlessness.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A second study with 30 subjects treated medication overuse headache (MOH) on an outpatient basis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/medication-overuse-headache-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>].

Improvement with a &gt;75 percent reduction in headache frequency and intensity was observed in 20 patients (67 percent), all of whom remained off analgesics entirely. Improvement with a 50 to 75 percent reduction in headache frequency and intensity was reported in nine patients (30 percent). The results, however, were obtained at 2.5 months of treatment. It is therefore impossible to attribute the benefit to naproxen alone since it is likely that prophylaxis contributed to improved outcomes.</p><p/><p>One suggested bridge therapy regimen is <a href=\"topic.htm?path=naproxen-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">naproxen</a> 550 mg twice daily for two to four weeks while the overused acute medication is withdrawn [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/medication-overuse-headache-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].

Tizanidine was titrated up by 2 mg every three to five days until a therapeutic effect or sedation occurred. The mean daily tizanidine dose was 3.6 mg (range 2 to 16 mg). At six weeks, the number of responders (ie, those with no or trivial analgesic use) was 36 patients (65 percent). The treatment protocol was well tolerated.

At one month after withdrawal of analgesics, the proportion of children with a &ge;90 percent reduction in headache was similar for those treated or not treated with daily preventive medication (57 and 50 percent, respectively).

Headache frequency was reduced by &gt;50 percent in similar proportions of participants (approximately 49 percent) in both groups.</p><p/><p>Some experts argue and evidence suggests that early discontinuation of the overused medication, prior to starting preventive medication or at the same time as starting preventive medication, is unnecessary [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/medication-overuse-headache-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>]. This argument is based on the notion that once preventive therapy results in reduced headache frequency, patients will naturally reduce the frequency with which they are using abortive medications. Supporting evidence comes from a prospective, open-label investigation of 56 adults with MOH who were randomly assigned to either immediate prophylactic treatment without instructions to stop the overused medication (the prophylaxis group), outpatient discontinuation of the overused medication without prophylactic treatment (the withdrawal group), or no specific treatment (the control group) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/medication-overuse-headache-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>]. By intention-to-treat analysis at three months, the prophylaxis group averaged 7.2 fewer headache days per month (95% CI -2.7 to -11.8), the withdrawal group 4.2 fewer headache days per month (95% CI -3.3 to -7.4), and the control group 1.6 fewer headache days per month (95% CI 1.8 to -5.1). Although the reduction in headache days was most pronounced for the prophylaxis group, the difference between the prophylaxis and withdrawal groups for this outcome measure did not achieve statistical significance. In a subsequent study reporting one- and four-year follow-up data for 50 of these subjects, those in both the prophylaxis and withdrawal groups had sustained reductions in headache frequency compared with baseline, again with no significant differences between the two groups [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/medication-overuse-headache-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>]. Although these studies provide low quality evidence, they suggest that both discontinuation of the overused medication (without prophylaxis therapy) and prophylaxis therapy (without discontinuation) are associated with short- and long-term improvements in headache frequency, and that both treatment methods are better than no intervention [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/medication-overuse-headache-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/41,42\" class=\"abstract_t\">41,42</a>].</p><p>Furthermore, data from randomized controlled trials investigating <a href=\"topic.htm?path=topiramate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">topiramate</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=onabotulinumtoxina-botox-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">onabotulinumtoxinA</a> therapy for chronic migraine have demonstrated that patients have improvements in migraine patterns even when they are not instructed to discontinue the overused medication [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/medication-overuse-headache-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/8-14\" class=\"abstract_t\">8-14</a>].

This can usually be managed in the outpatient setting. (See <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Outpatient and inpatient strategies'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>With overuse of barbiturates, opioids, or benzodiazepines, the pace of withdrawal depends on the amount and frequency of usage. Abrupt discontinuation is done routinely in clinical practice if the dosage <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> frequency of administration are not too high. However, we suggest a gradual taper when these agents (particularly barbiturates or benzodiazepines) are being used frequently or at high doses (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). The taper can usually be accomplished in two to four weeks. When butalbital is stopped abruptly or when high doses are being used, we recommend a <a href=\"topic.htm?path=phenobarbital-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">phenobarbital</a> taper for seizure prophylaxis (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=3\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1C</a>). Our suggested regimen is to treat with 30 mg of phenobarbital per day for every 100 mg of butalbital that was being used and to taper phenobarbital by 30 mg every two to three days until stopped. (See <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Outpatient and inpatient strategies'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>When there is concern for opioid withdrawal symptoms, we suggest treatment with a <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clonidine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">clonidine</a> patch for one to two weeks (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). (See <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Outpatient and inpatient strategies'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Inpatient discontinuation withdrawal with medical monitoring in the first several days may be preferred for some patients who have been using high doses of barbiturates, opioids, and benzodiazepines. Inpatient management may also be preferable for patients with weak social support, medical or psychiatric comorbidities, and poor motivation, and for those who have previously failed outpatient drug withdrawal. (See <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Outpatient and inpatient strategies'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients who are unlikely to be successful with discontinuing the overused medication when combined with preventive and rescue therapy, we suggest bridge therapy. (See <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'Bridge therapy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>For outpatients, our preferred choices for bridge therapy are long acting nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=naproxen-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">naproxen</a>) or oral <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prednisone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">prednisone</a> (see <a href=\"#H8\" class=\"local\">'Naproxen'</a> above and <a href=\"#H10\" class=\"local\">'Glucocorticoids'</a> above)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>For inpatients, our preferred choices for bridge therapy are intravenous <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dihydroergotamine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">dihydroergotamine</a> plus <a href=\"topic.htm?path=metoclopramide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">metoclopramide</a>, intravenous <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prochlorperazine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">prochlorperazine</a>, intravenous <a href=\"topic.htm?path=valproate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">valproate</a>, or intravenous <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methylprednisolone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">methylprednisolone</a> (see <a href=\"#H11\" class=\"local\">'Dihydroergotamine'</a> above and <a href=\"#H14\" class=\"local\">'Prochlorperazine'</a> above and <a href=\"#H16\" class=\"local\">'Valproate'</a> above and <a href=\"#H10\" class=\"local\">'Glucocorticoids'</a> above)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients with MOH and an identified underlying primary headache disorder (eg, migraine or tension-type headache), we suggest starting preventive treatment at the same time as withdrawing the offending medication (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). (See <a href=\"#H17\" class=\"local\">'Preventive therapy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>To prevent MOH relapse, triptan, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ergotamine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ergotamine</a><span class=\"nowrap\">/<a href=\"topic.htm?path=dihydroergotamine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">dihydroergotamine</a></span> or combination analgesic use should be limited to nine or fewer days a month on average, and NSAIDs to 14 or fewer days a month. Butalbital-containing analgesics and opioids should be avoided because of their high risk for MOH.
