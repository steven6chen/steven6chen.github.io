The key to management is to recognize excessive bleeding before it becomes life threatening, identify the cause, and initiate appropriate intervention based on the clinical setting (eg, cause and severity of bleeding, whether the abdomen is open or not). </p><p>This topic will discuss medical and minimally invasive management of patients with PPH. An overview of issues related to PPH (terminology, incidence, pathogenesis, causes, risk factors, diagnosis, general principles of planning and management, morbidity and mortality, recurrence) is available separately (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-postpartum-hemorrhage\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of postpartum hemorrhage&quot;</a>). Treatment approaches to PPH that are performed at laparotomy are also reviewed separately.

Assessment includes:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Vital signs</strong> &ndash; Evaluate blood pressure, heart rate, respiratory rate, peripheral oxygen saturation, and urine output. Tachypnea, tachycardia, hypotension, low oxygen saturation, and air hunger are signs of hypovolemia, which may be due to both inadequate hemoglobin level and circulatory volume (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F56885\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef56885 \">table 2</a>). </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Trends in vital signs over time after delivery should also be evaluated to identify and address patterns suspicious for ongoing bleeding or inadequately replaced blood loss. Assume progressively increasing heart rate and decreasing blood pressure are due to blood <span class=\"nowrap\">loss/hypovolemia</span> until these causes are positively excluded. Deterioration of maternal vital signs out of proportion to vaginal bleeding suggests intraperitoneal or retroperitoneal bleeding.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Estimated blood loss</strong> &ndash; Quantify the amount of blood loss by collecting blood in graduated volumetric containers, using visual aids that correlate the size and appearance of blood on specific surfaces (eg, maternity pad, emesis basin, bed sheet, lap sponge) with the volume of blood absorbed by that surface (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F103418\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef103418 \">picture 1</a>), and measuring the difference in the total weight of bloody materials and the known weight of the same materials when dry (the difference in weight between wet and dry in grams approximates the volume of blood in milliliters).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Coagulation &ndash; </strong>Suspicion of coagulopathy should prompt blood and blood product replacement. (see <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'Transfuse red blood cells, platelets, plasma'</a> below). Thromboelastography is quick and accurate, where available. (See <a href=\"#H3745207166\" class=\"local\">'Thromboelastography and rotational thromboelastometry'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">In the absence of on-unit thromboelastography, check for non-clotting blood or very anemic-appearing vaginal bleeding while waiting for results from the first set of laboratory studies. One method is to draw 5 mL of blood from an arm vein, place it in clean dry red top glass tube, and note the clotting time (ie, time until the blood no longer flows when the tube is inverted). The clotting time is 5 to 8 minutes when the patient likely has adequate fibrinogen stores: If the blood in the tube does not clot within 8 minutes or the initial clot dissolves, then it is likely she is markedly deficient in key clotting factors. Over a dozen methods for testing whole blood clotting time have been described and vary in number of syringes used to draw the blood, whether some of the blood is discarded, the degree and frequency of tilting the tube(s), the diameter of the tube(s), the number of tubes, the volume of blood, whether tubes are pre-rinsed with saline, the temperature at which the test is performed (room temperature versus 37&deg;C), etc [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/postpartum-hemorrhage-medical-and-minimally-invasive-management/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>]. All of these variables affect the time to clotting, which make this an insensitive test. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Review drugs</strong> that the patient has received as some drugs can have unanticipated hemodynamic side effects that may confound the situation. For example, beta-blockade may prevent a normal heart rate response in a bleeding patient; histamine release due to an analgesic (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=morphine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">morphine</a>) may lead to peripheral vasodilation and destabilized compensated shock with resultant sudden hemodynamic collapse. </p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4014555114\"><span class=\"h2\">Postcesarean delivery</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>At cesarean delivery, the presence and cause of excessive bleeding is usually readily apparent (atony, uterine laceration, retained placental fragments). However, in patients with vital signs that are normal or near normal and have no oozing from wounds, it may not be recognized when blood is retroperitoneal, confined to the uterine cavity after closure of the hysterotomy, or hidden under surgical drapes. When compensated shock is present (normal blood pressure with increasing heart rate) at cesarean delivery, these sites should be actively evaluated. &#160;</p><p>After a cesarean delivery has been completed (ie, abdomen has been closed), persistent excessive vaginal bleeding is evaluated as described above for vaginal delivery. Signs of compensated or uncompensated shock without vaginal bleeding should prompt consideration of internal bleeding related to delivery. A modified focused assessment with sonography for trauma (FAST) examination in the recovery room may show fluid in the upper abdomen suggestive of intraabdominal bleeding, but sensitivity is low [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/postpartum-hemorrhage-medical-and-minimally-invasive-management/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>] and an equivocal scan or logistic issues have the potential to delay emergency and life-saving interventions. In all cases, clinical signs suggestive of ongoing bleeding (tachycardia, falling blood pressure, expanding abdomen, change in level of consciousness) should overrule a negative ultrasound scan in determining further management. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3106519889\"><span class=\"h1\">BLOOD LOSS &gt;500 ML AT VAGINAL DELIVERY OR &gt;1000 ML AT CESAREAN DELIVERY BUT &lt;1500 ML WITH ONGOING EXCESSIVE BLEEDING</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>These patients are generally hemodynamically stable, but may have mild tachycardia (heart rate &ge;110 <span class=\"nowrap\">beats/min),</span> mild hypotension (systolic blood pressure 80 to 85 mmHg), fall in oxygen saturation (O<sub>2</sub> sat &lt;95 percent), <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> lightheadedness, before initiation of therapy.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H749851427\"><span class=\"h2\">Basic interventions</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Obtain assistance, if not already assembled.

In those facilities where the labor and delivery operating room may not be equipped <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> staffed for emergency major abdominal surgery, the patient should be stabilized and moved to the main operating room suite (or other appropriately equipped unit, eg, hybrid operating room on labor unit) for further management. </p><p/><p>In addition, apply the following interventions.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3014871257\"><span class=\"h2\">Establish adequate intravenous access</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Adequate intravenous access should be provided with two lines, at least one of which should be a large bore catheter (14 or 16 gauge), for administration of fluids and blood (see <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'Transfuse red blood cells, platelets, plasma'</a> below) and medications. (See <a href=\"#H2153167536\" class=\"local\">'Increase oxytocin infusion'</a> below and <a href=\"#H2022038691\" class=\"local\">'Administer tranexamic acid'</a> below.) </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1279922029\"><span class=\"h2\">Resuscitate with crystalloid</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Isotonic crystalloid should be infused to prevent hypotension (target systolic pressure 90 mmHg) and maintain urine output at &gt;30 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/hour</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/postpartum-hemorrhage-medical-and-minimally-invasive-management/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. Rapid infusion of large volumes of crystalloid (eg, &gt;3 to 4 L) may promote dilutional coagulopathy, electrolyte imbalances, and hypothermia, so appropriately monitoring of hematocrit, coagulation status, core temperature, and electrolytes is essential. Women with preeclampsia may have a contracted intravascular volume and hemoconcentration, and are prone to tissue hypoperfusion from blood loss. The approach to fluid therapy is similar to that in trauma patients. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=intraoperative-management-of-shock-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Intraoperative management of shock in adults&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=initial-management-of-moderate-to-severe-hemorrhage-in-the-adult-trauma-patient#H2226562376\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Initial management of moderate to severe hemorrhage in the adult trauma patient&quot;, section on 'Intravenous fluid resuscitation'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3673510749\"><span class=\"h2\">Provide adequate anesthesia</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In the nonanesthetized patient, local anesthesia rarely provides sufficient pain relief for thorough examination and treatment. Gentle digital exploration of the lower segment of the uterus may be performed without anesthesia; however, if thorough manual examination is needed, this should be performed in an operating room with immediate recourse to anesthesia, surgical therapy, and laparotomy, if needed. The choice of a regional or general anesthetic depends upon the planned interventions and the patient's hemodynamic status. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=anesthesia-for-the-patient-with-peripartum-hemorrhage\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Anesthesia for the patient with peripartum hemorrhage&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1689487287\"><span class=\"h2\">Examine the lower genital tract and uterus to determine the cause of bleeding</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Perform thorough vaginal, abdominal, and rectal examinations</strong> &ndash; It is not sufficient to look only for obvious vaginal or incisional bleeding when determining the source of PPH because significant hemorrhage can occur into the retroperitoneum or into a <span class=\"nowrap\">vaginal/vulval</span> hematoma without visible blood loss. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">After a completed delivery, we examine the genital tract with the woman in stirrups (dorsal lithotomy position) in a room with facilities for general anesthesia and both vaginal and abdominal surgery. Lower genital sources of bleeding not previously detected can usually be readily identified by assessing the birth canal with adequate assistance, exposure, lighting, instruments, and anesthesia, which allow performance of a thorough examination. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">The entire vagina from perineum to cervix should be inspected for significant lacerations. The uterine cavity should be palpated for defects indicating uterine rupture or dehiscence. This examination should be performed in all patients with PPH who delivered vaginally, as well as those who attained significant cervical dilatation and descent of the presenting fetal part before a cesarean delivery. Even if inspection for lacerations had already been performed at delivery (or afterwards without adequate analgesia), a thorough examination should be repeated, as it is possible that a bleeding site was missed. Risk factors for significant cervical lacerations (ie, associated with excessive bleeding or requiring repair) include precipitous labor, operative vaginal delivery, and cerclage [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/postpartum-hemorrhage-medical-and-minimally-invasive-management/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. However, absence of such risk factors should not preclude re-examination of the birth canal.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Intense pain in the anus may be a warning sign of an enlarging vaginal or vulvar hematoma and should prompt examination and repeat examination as necessary to exclude this life-threatening blood loss. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-hematomas-incurred-as-a-result-of-obstetrical-delivery\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of hematomas incurred as a result of obstetrical delivery&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Rapidly assess uterine tone</strong>, but be aware that there can still be significant bleeding from a poorly contracted and dilated lower segment despite adequate upper segment contraction. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Examine the uterine cavity for retained products of conception</strong>. This is more common after vaginal than cesarean delivery, unless the cesarean was performed for a morbidly adherent placenta.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Assess for uterine inversion</strong>, which appears as a smooth round mass protruding from the cervix or vagina on vaginal examination <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> lack of a normally positioned fundus on abdominal examination. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=puerperal-uterine-inversion\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Puerperal uterine inversion&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Consider the possibility of uterine rupture</strong> &ndash; Although uterine rupture is infrequent, examination for this condition is important in patients with signs of PPH who have undergone a trial of labor after a previous cesarean delivery. Rupture of the unscarred uterus is rare, but can occur if labor was induced or augmented and, even more rarely, after instrumental delivery. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">After delivery, uterine rupture is often characterized by pain and persistent vaginal bleeding despite use of uterotonic agents. Even mild hemodynamic instability in any postpartum patient, whether she has observed bleeding or not, should prompt consideration of uterine rupture and intra-abdominal bleeding. Hematuria may occur if the rupture extends into the bladder. Maternal symptoms of hypovolemia that appear to be out of proportion to the observed blood loss and abdominal distention should also prompt consideration of intra-abdominal hemorrhage. Palpation of the uterine cavity may reveal the opening, which can be anterior, fundal, posterior, or lateral. Ultrasound examination may reveal blood in the abdomen <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> a broad ligament hematoma. (See <a href=\"#H4014555114\" class=\"local\">'Postcesarean delivery'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Posterior rupture is more common in the unscarred uterus than the scarred uterus. When laparotomy is performed, a posterior rupture is not readily observed upon entering the abdomen so the entire uterus needs to be inspected carefully. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=uterine-rupture-after-previous-cesarean-delivery\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Uterine rupture after previous cesarean delivery&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=rupture-of-the-unscarred-uterus\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Rupture of the unscarred uterus&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2022038691\"><span class=\"h2\">Administer tranexamic acid</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span><a href=\"topic.htm?path=tranexamic-acid-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Tranexamic acid</a> is an anti-fibrinolytic drug that has been useful for prevention and treatment of bleeding in various clinical settings, such as surgery and trauma. The World Maternal Antifibrinolytic Trial (WOMAN) found that tranexamic acid reduced death due to bleeding in women with postpartum hemorrhage by 20 to 30 percent, and was not associated with an increase in adverse effects<strong> </strong>[<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/postpartum-hemorrhage-medical-and-minimally-invasive-management/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. This pragmatic, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial involved 193 hospitals in 21 countries and evaluated the effect of early administration of tranexamic acid (1 g by intravenous injection) on mortality, hysterectomy, and other morbidities in over 20,000 women with clinically diagnosed PPH. Women were eligible for randomization if blood loss was &gt;500 mL at vaginal delivery, &gt;1000 mL at cesarean, or associated with hemodynamic instability and the provider was uncertain whether to use the drug. All other aspects of management of PPH were per usual standards and determined by the provider. Approximately 70 percent of the deliveries were vaginal and 30 percent cesarean. Compared with placebo, tranexamic acid:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Reduced death due to bleeding by 19 percent overall (1.5 versus 1.9 percent; relative risk [RR] 0.81, 95% CI 0.65-1.00).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>The reduction in death due to bleeding was observed after both vaginal and cesarean deliveries. Death due to bleeding was reduced by 31 percent when treatment was initiated within three hours of delivery (1.2 versus 1.7 percent; RR 0.69, 95% CI 0.52-0.91) and by 26 percent for bleeding due to atony (1.2 versus 1.6 percent; RR 0.74, 95% CI 0.55-0.99). In contrast, the reduction was not significant when the time from delivery was greater than three hours and in patients with other or unknown causes of bleeding.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Reduced the incidence of laparotomy to control bleeding by 36 percent (0.8 versus 1.3 percent; RR 0.64, 95% CI 0.49-0.85).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Did not reduce hysterectomy; however, the decision to perform hysterectomy was sometimes made at the same time as randomization, so some hysterectomies were performed before or concurrently with administration of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tranexamic-acid-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">tranexamic acid</a>. (For this reason, the trial was extended and the sample size was increased).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Did not reduce all-cause mortality, which included death from sepsis, organ failure, eclampsia, pulmonary embolism, etc and accounted for over 25 percent of the deaths.

Delay in treatment, even if short, reduces the benefit of tranexamic acid administration. </p><p>Meta-analyses of randomized trial have concluded that <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tranexamic-acid-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">tranexamic acid</a> reduces mortality due to bleeding in women with primary PPH, irrespective of mode of birth [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/postpartum-hemorrhage-medical-and-minimally-invasive-management/abstract/7,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,8</a>]. As an example, in a meta-analysis using individual level data from patients with acute severe bleeding (traumatic and post-partum hemorrhage), tranexamic acid increased overall survival from bleeding (OR 1.20, 95% CI 1.08-1.33), and immediate treatment improved survival by more than 70 percent (OR 1.72, 95% CI 1.42-2.10). The survival benefit decreased by 10 percent for every 15 minutes of treatment delay until 3 hours, after which there was no benefit [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/postpartum-hemorrhage-medical-and-minimally-invasive-management/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. </p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=tranexamic-acid-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Tranexamic acid</a> is given concomitantly with other drugs and procedures for control of bleeding, and should not be regarded as an alternative therapy. One gram (10 mL of a <span class=\"nowrap\">100mg/mL</span> solution) is infused over 10 to 20 minutes, as infusion &gt;1 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/minute</span> can cause hypotension. If bleeding persists after 30 minutes, a second 1 g dose may be administered. The half-life is two hours and the antifibrinolytic effect lasts up to 7 to 8 hours in serum.</p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=tranexamic-acid-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Tranexamic acid</a> should not be mixed with blood or given through a line with blood, or mixed with solutions containing penicillin. It should not be given to patients with subarachnoid hemorrhage or active intravascular clotting (disseminated intravascular coagulation). The dose should be reduced in patients with renal insufficiency, venous or arterial thrombosis, or ureteral bleeding. </p><p>About 90 percent of the maternal drug is eliminated within 24 hours after intravenous administration.

While higher doses of oxytocin have been used intravenously for a short duration to manage atony (eg, up to 80 units in 500 mL over 30 minutes) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/postpartum-hemorrhage-medical-and-minimally-invasive-management/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>], this is not advisable since lower doses appear to be just as effective. Moreover, rapid infusion of high-dose oxytocin, as may occur in an emergency situation, can cause significant hypotension and cardiovascular collapse. Therefore, if a high-dose oxytocin regimen is used, it is advisable to prepare smaller volumes (ie, 15 units in 250 mL) to limit the total dose infused over a short period of time. These issues and dosing are discussed in more detail separately.

Exposure is facilitated by using a Gelpi retractor (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F65767\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef65767 \">figure 1</a>) to spread the distal vaginal sidewalls and Heaney (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F70162\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef70162 \">figure 2</a>) or Breisky (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F53830\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef53830 \">figure 3</a>) retractors to access the upper vagina. If available, use of several assistants with Deaver retractors placed laterally is also effective. Adequate lighting and exposure are crucial in such repairs, often necessitating that repairs are performed in the operating room with appropriate anesthesia, patient positioning, retraction, and suction apparatus.</p><p>It is often difficult to begin a suture line at the apex of the laceration because of problems with exposure and visualization. In such cases, one can begin the suture line at the distal end of the laceration and sew toward the apex, while using the suture to pull the lacerated tissue toward the surgeon. Alternatively, these patients are good candidates for angiographic embolization, if stable. (See <a href=\"#H1301497499\" class=\"local\">'Consider uterine or hypogastric artery embolization'</a> below.)</p><p>Three pitfalls to avoid:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Sutures should not be placed cephalad to the fornix, as this can result in ureteral ligation. When an extension exists high in the vagina, possibly extending into the cardinal ligament, we perform a laparotomy. The patient's thighs are abducted in stirrups to allow surgery to proceed simultaneously via the abdominal and vaginal routes, as needed for optimal exposure and access. This facilitates identification of the bladder and ureters, minimizing the chance of inadvertent damage to these structures. If appropriately skilled surgeons and equipment are available, the abdominal portion may be possible with a laparoscopic approach.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Vaginal hematomas should not be drained unless expanding. Attempts at operative drainage can result in significant additional blood loss because it is often difficult to identify and ligate bleeding vessels in a fresh vaginal sulcus hematoma. A stable hematoma may be drained later if it becomes infected or pain is not relieved adequately with analgesics. Continuous expansion of a hematoma leading to hypovolemia may necessitate drainage and packing. Alternatively, embolization may be the best approach. Management of vaginal hematomas is discussed in more detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-and-management-of-female-lower-genital-tract-trauma\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation and management of female lower genital tract trauma&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Arterial or heavy active vaginal bleeding should not be treated with packing, as this has the potential to divert blood into the retroperitoneum. A vaginal balloon or packing can be useful to tamponade venous oozing, before or after repair of the vaginal laceration. A balloon with a drainage channel can compress lacerated sidewalls while the drainage channel allows monitoring of any ongoing significant bleeding. Such patients should be closely monitored for ongoing concealed bleeding, which would necessitate active intervention.</p><p/><p>A laparotomy (or angiographic embolization) may be needed when a vaginal laceration has extended above the fornix and appears to be expanding (either on imaging or because of persistent hemodynamic instability). The patient's thighs are abducted in stirrups (modified lithotomy position) to allow surgery to proceed simultaneously via the abdominal and vaginal routes, as needed, for optimal exposure and access. This facilitates identification of the bladder and ureters, minimizing the chance of inadvertently damaging these structures. </p><p>Uterine artery laceration will require interventional radiology if the patient is hemodynamically stable, or surgical exploration and ligation if she is not.

Doses of 16.7 to 120 <span class=\"nowrap\">mcg/kg</span> as a single bolus injection over a few minutes every two hours until hemostasis is achieved have been effective, and usually control bleeding within 10 to 40 minutes of the first dose [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/postpartum-hemorrhage-medical-and-minimally-invasive-management/abstract/90,94\" class=\"abstract_t\">90,94</a>]. It is preferable to start with a low dose (40 or 60 <span class=\"nowrap\">mcg/kg)</span> to reduce the risk of thromboembolic events; doses of 40 <span class=\"nowrap\">mcg/kg</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/postpartum-hemorrhage-medical-and-minimally-invasive-management/abstract/95\" class=\"abstract_t\">95</a>] to 90 <span class=\"nowrap\">mcg/kg</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/postpartum-hemorrhage-medical-and-minimally-invasive-management/abstract/96\" class=\"abstract_t\">96</a>] have been suggested for obstetric hemorrhage. The dose may be repeated once in 15 to 30 minutes if there is no response. Additional doses are unlikely to be effective.</p><p>The efficacy of rFVIIa depends on the levels of other coagulation factors present. For maximal effectiveness, major sources of bleeding should be controlled and blood products should be administered to correct major deficiencies before administering rFVIIa [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/postpartum-hemorrhage-medical-and-minimally-invasive-management/abstract/97\" class=\"abstract_t\">97</a>].

The perceived advantages are a reduced risk of volume overload, no need for thawing or blood group typing, and a reduced risk for transfusion-related acute lung injury and allergic reactions. Disadvantages include very high cost and increased risk of thrombosis. </p><p>The FDA-approved indication for four-factor PCCs is for urgent reversal of acquired coagulation factor deficiency induced by vitamin K antagonist therapy in adult patients with acute major bleeding or need for an urgent <span class=\"nowrap\">surgery/invasive</span> procedure. </p><p>We caution those using PCC off-label in women with postpartum hemorrhage to have evidence (or strong suspicion) of a specific factor deficiency that would be alleviated by PCC because of the risk of thrombosis, the lack of data of efficacy in this population, and the concern that deficiencies in factors II, VII, IX, and X are not common in this setting [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/postpartum-hemorrhage-medical-and-minimally-invasive-management/abstract/49\" class=\"abstract_t\">49</a>]. The most likely scenario where PCC might be of benefit is in a massive transfusion situation with ongoing disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) unresponsive to all of the usual therapies.

This facilitates decision making about the possible need for, and timing of, a procedure. Decision-making and mobilization of personnel and appropriate equipment take time and, in some cases, a significant delay is likely before the uterine vessels can be occluded. Embolization procedures can take one to three hours to complete and fail to control bleeding in 10 percent of cases; furthermore, personnel in a typical interventional suite may not be able to monitor PPH during the procedure. Thus, laparotomy should be performed if the woman is not stable enough to wait for the embolization procedure. However, performing the embolization in an operating room with a full surgical team in attendance is a reasonable option for hemodynamically unstable patients if the facility has a \\ an operating room that allows simultaneous surgery and embolization (eg, hybrid operating room, or an appropriately sensitive portable C-arm and carbon fiber table). &#160;</p><p>If coagulopathy is present, it should be corrected before the procedure, if possible, although some interventional vascular specialists will proceed while a coagulopathy is being treated since the hemorrhage is generally the cause of the coagulopathy. Others consider coagulopathy a relative contraindication to elective interventional procedures; however, under emergency situations, it can be performed as a lifesaving measure even with coagulopathy. In two series, disseminated intravascular coagulation was a risk factor for failure of embolization to control hemorrhage [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/postpartum-hemorrhage-medical-and-minimally-invasive-management/abstract/98,99\" class=\"abstract_t\">98,99</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H704143547\"><span class=\"h3\">Procedure</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The technique of uterine or hypogastric artery embolization is basically the same as with other embolization procedures (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=interventional-radiology-in-management-of-gynecological-disorders\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Interventional radiology in management of gynecological disorders&quot;</a>). Diagnostic angiography is initially performed to identify a bleeding site or abnormal vascular findings, such as extravasation, abnormal arteriovenous communication, pseudoaneurysm, spasm, or truncation (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F67041%7EOBGYN%2F78839\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef67041 graphicRef78839 \">image 1A-B</a>). </p><p>Gelfoam, an <a href=\"topic.htm?path=absorbable-gelatin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">absorbable gelatin sponge</a>, is the preferred agent for embolization of the uterine or hypogastric arteries since the duration of occlusion is temporary (two to six weeks), but sufficient to reduce hemorrhage. Slow development of collateral arterial flow occurs a few hours after embolization and serves to prevent ischemia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/postpartum-hemorrhage-medical-and-minimally-invasive-management/abstract/100,101\" class=\"abstract_t\">100,101</a>]. DIC is a risk factor for failure of embolization to control hemorrhage </p><p>N-butyl cyanoacrylate (NBCA) is a liquid glue that instantly solidifies (polymerizes) when in contact with blood. It has the advantage that it does not depend on maternal clotting factors to plug the bleeding site. In a retrospective cohort study, uterine artery embolization with NBCA was highly effective for hemostasis in patients with PPH and as effective in patients with and without DIC [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/postpartum-hemorrhage-medical-and-minimally-invasive-management/abstract/102\" class=\"abstract_t\">102</a>]. Disadvantages of NBCA include higher costs compared with Gelfoam, the possibility of systemic embolization, minimal information about subsequent pregnancies, and it is permanent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/postpartum-hemorrhage-medical-and-minimally-invasive-management/abstract/103,104\" class=\"abstract_t\">103,104</a>].</p><p>The patient's clinician should monitor her status in the angiography suite at the time of the procedure and be ready to proceed to surgical intervention if the patient becomes hemodynamically unstable. Frequent communication about the patient's status between the interventional vascular specialist and the clinician is important. A prolonged embolization procedure should be avoided if there appears to be little chance of therapeutic success because the patient's condition may deteriorate and increase the risk when surgical intervention is performed.</p><p>If the uterine or hypogastric artery procedure is unsuccessful and time permits, angiographic occlusion balloon catheters can be placed to temporarily occlude the hypogastric or common iliac arteries (or even in the aorta) while en route to the operating room or during the surgery for control of hemorrhage (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=postpartum-hemorrhage-management-approaches-requiring-laparotomy#H2349283299\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Postpartum hemorrhage: Management approaches requiring laparotomy&quot;, section on 'Role of interventional radiology'</a>). Prolonged (48 hours) balloon catheter occlusion of the hypogastric arteries alone, without embolization, was reported to successfully control hemorrhage in two hemodynamically unstable patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/postpartum-hemorrhage-medical-and-minimally-invasive-management/abstract/105\" class=\"abstract_t\">105</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H368030700\"><span class=\"h3\">Outcome</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A literature review of uterine artery embolization for treatment of pelvic hemorrhage unrelated to malignancy reported a 97 percent success rate [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/postpartum-hemorrhage-medical-and-minimally-invasive-management/abstract/106\" class=\"abstract_t\">106</a>]. Another review described a 95 percent success rate in controlling bleeding related to PPH; the failure rate was low (5 percent of cases required hysterectomy) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/postpartum-hemorrhage-medical-and-minimally-invasive-management/abstract/101\" class=\"abstract_t\">101</a>]. A series of 100 cases performed at a single center mostly by one radiologist reported 89 percent success for control of PPH [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/postpartum-hemorrhage-medical-and-minimally-invasive-management/abstract/107\" class=\"abstract_t\">107</a>]. Studies of selective arterial embolization by an interventional vascular specialist used a variety of embolization materials in a variety of arteries (but usually the uterine artery), and employed a variety of interventions prior to and concomitantly with embolization, which explains the spectrum of reported success rates [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/postpartum-hemorrhage-medical-and-minimally-invasive-management/abstract/108\" class=\"abstract_t\">108</a>]. Data are also limited by the small number of published studies and the small number of participants.</p><p>Serious complications are unusual, and the procedure-related morbidity of 3 to 6 percent is much less than with laparotomy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/postpartum-hemorrhage-medical-and-minimally-invasive-management/abstract/106,107,109,110\" class=\"abstract_t\">106,107,109,110</a>]. Postembolization fever is the most common complication; other less common complications include buttock ischemia, vascular perforation, uterine ischemia and necrosis, leg ischemia, and infection. Ovulation and menses generally resume as long as the uterus and ovaries are intact. However, the author is aware of one patient who died after embolization resulted in peripheral pulmonary vascular occlusion (personal communication). </p><p>Menstrual function and fertility generally return to baseline after arterial embolization for PPH [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/postpartum-hemorrhage-medical-and-minimally-invasive-management/abstract/111\" class=\"abstract_t\">111</a>], and subsequent pregnancies experience no or minimal increase in adverse outcome [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/postpartum-hemorrhage-medical-and-minimally-invasive-management/abstract/112-122\" class=\"abstract_t\">112-122</a>]. A case report of uterine artery embolization for treatment of a cervical ectopic pregnancy described regionally decreased blood supply in the mid-posterior wall of the uterine fundus on magnetic resonance imaging on days 5 and 25 postprocedure; this patient had a spontaneous uterine rupture at the mid-posterior wall of the uterus at 32 weeks during a subsequent pregnancy four years later [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/postpartum-hemorrhage-medical-and-minimally-invasive-management/abstract/123\" class=\"abstract_t\">123</a>]. Some authors have reported placenta accreta in 12 to 39 percent of subsequent pregnancies, but there was a small number of subsequent pregnancies and events in these series [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/postpartum-hemorrhage-medical-and-minimally-invasive-management/abstract/124\" class=\"abstract_t\">124</a>].</p><p>This generally favorable experience appears to contradict the reports describing increased pregnancy loss after uterine artery embolization for treatment of leiomyomas. Possible reasons for this discordance include the typically younger age of pregnant patients, the vastly increased vascularization of the gravid uterus (possibly permitting formation of more adequate alternative blood supply), and the absence of leiomyomas in the gravid patients. It is also possible that arterial embolization of the gravid uterus is associated with an increased incidence of subsequent pregnancy loss above baseline, but there is a lack of literature supporting this.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3445250079\"><span class=\"h2\">Consider resuscitative endovascular balloon occlusion of the aorta</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>An ultrasound directed, aortic balloon placement technique has been used in trauma (military and civilian) and emergency room scenarios to decrease the amount of bleeding distal to the occluded site and provide a window of opportunity for resuscitation and definitive hemorrhage control [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/postpartum-hemorrhage-medical-and-minimally-invasive-management/abstract/125-127\" class=\"abstract_t\">125-127</a>]. Minimal data on the use of this technique in obstetrics are available, but suggest that in desperate situations, particularly in low-resource environments where interventional vascular specialists and blood banking are unavailable, resuscitative endovascular balloon occlusion of the aorta (REBOA) by appropriately trained personnel may offer a minimally invasive approach to resuscitation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/postpartum-hemorrhage-medical-and-minimally-invasive-management/abstract/128-131\" class=\"abstract_t\">128-131</a>].</p><p>The aortic balloon has been designed to occlude the aorta in two of three aortic zones: zone 1 is the descending aorta at the level of the diaphragm, which is used in massive abdominal trauma, and zone 3 is in the infra-renal aorta, which is used in lower <span class=\"nowrap\">abdominal/pelvic</span> hemorrhage, including postpartum hemorrhage. The balloon is placed percutaneously into the common femoral artery using ultrasound guidance in the groin, and a Seldinger technique is employed to advance a 7F sheath into the artery. The balloon catheter is then advanced via the sheath into the required zone using the measured markings on the catheter. Reported complications are minimal given the smaller size of the sheath (7F) compared with aortic balloon catheters placed under fluoroscopy (12F to 14F) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/postpartum-hemorrhage-medical-and-minimally-invasive-management/abstract/132\" class=\"abstract_t\">132</a>].

Warming devices (blankets, devices for warming all IV fluids, insulation water mattresses, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> upper- and lower-body forced-air warming devices) are employed to maintain normothermia (temperature &ge;35.5&deg;C). </p><p>Hypothermia results in sympathetic stimulation with increased myocardial oxygen consumption, particularly if shivering occurs, which may lead to myocardial ischemia. Other adverse consequences of hypothermia include sepsis, coagulopathy, decreased platelet function, and increased mortality. The combination of hypothermia and acidosis increases the risk of clinically significant bleeding despite adequate blood, plasma, and platelet replacement [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/postpartum-hemorrhage-medical-and-minimally-invasive-management/abstract/133\" class=\"abstract_t\">133</a>], so acidosis should be corrected, using bicarbonate for pH &lt;7.1 if necessary.

Using a closed fist, firm downward pressure is applied above and slightly to the left of the patient's umbilicus to compress the abdominal aorta against the vertebrae just above the sacral promontory.

Ideally, the clinician should correct hemostatic defects prior to laparotomy, but surgery should not be delayed if bleeding cannot be controlled promptly. </p><p>In patients with atony who have had a vaginal birth, laparotomy is generally a last resort when less invasive interventions have failed. The need for laparotomy is rare in this setting, as the combination of uterotonic therapy, uterine tamponade, and uterine artery embolization can be used to control bleeding in virtually all cases. (See <a href=\"#H1301497499\" class=\"local\">'Consider uterine or hypogastric artery embolization'</a> above.)</p><p>Because the abdomen is already open in patients with atony at cesarean delivery, surgical procedures for control of hemorrhage are performed sooner and are successful in 85 to 90 percent of cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/postpartum-hemorrhage-medical-and-minimally-invasive-management/abstract/137\" class=\"abstract_t\">137</a>]. In postcesarean delivery patients with ongoing bleeding, the author has found that reopening the patient and washing out any collected blood and blood breakdown products and inspecting pedicles is best done earlier rather than later. The lax abdomen of a postpartum patient will not tamponade bleeding until very late in the process, and a large volume of blood can be lost without any increase in girth. In addition, the accumulation of clotted and unclotted blood in the abdominal cavity may activate the fibrinolytic system, with increased release of tissue-type plasminogen activator and possibly fibrinolytic shutdown with increased plasminogen activator inhibitor-1. This may potentiate any coagulopathy and interfere with efforts to reverse disseminated intravascular coagulation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/postpartum-hemorrhage-medical-and-minimally-invasive-management/abstract/138,139\" class=\"abstract_t\">138,139</a>].

Acidosis should be corrected using bicarbonate, if necessary. Aortic compression is a temporizing measure to reduce blood flow to the uterus and thus provide time to initiate and continue other measures. These interventions may be indicated in some patients with less blood loss as well.

Ideally, the clinician should correct hemostatic defects prior to laparotomy, but surgery should not be delayed if bleeding cannot be controlled promptly.
