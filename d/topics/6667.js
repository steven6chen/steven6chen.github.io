Clinical monitoring is the key tool for assessment of the adequacy of nutritional support. Laboratory markers for immune response, indirect calorimetry, and body weight and composition are also used.</p><p>This topic reviews assessment of the adequacy of nutritional support in burn patients. Patient selection; timing, delivery, and types of nutrition support; calculating caloric requirements for burn patients; and selection of enteral formula are discussed elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-nutritional-support-for-moderate-to-severe-burn-patients\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of nutritional support for moderate-to-severe burn patients&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nutritional-demands-and-enteral-formulas-for-moderate-to-severe-burn-patients\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Nutritional demands and enteral formulas for moderate-to-severe burn patients&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL MONITORING TOOLS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The adequacy of nutritional support is monitored by assessing the patient's clinical course and wound healing [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluating-nutritional-support-for-moderate-to-severe-burn-patients/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Trends, rather than single measurements or point estimates, should be monitored.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Clinical course</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Parameters used to evaluate the clinical course include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Hemodynamic stability</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Respiratory status</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Functional status</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Evidence of infection or sepsis</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Tolerating diet</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Wound healing</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>An experienced clinician should evaluate the patient's burns daily. Assessment of the wound includes recording size, depth, condition of the base, and pain [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluating-nutritional-support-for-moderate-to-severe-burn-patients/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. This examination allows for early identification of delayed or inadequate wound healing, both of which are markers of nutritional deficiencies.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h1\">TOTAL BODY WEIGHT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Total body weight (TBW) measures two components: lean weight (muscles, bones, tendons, ligaments, and water) and fat weight. While measurements of TBW are helpful in evaluating nutritional status in healthy individuals, the significant volume of fluid required for resuscitation in burn patients limits its value to assess nutritional status, particularly during the acute phase of burn care. The daily measurement of TBW is used in the majority of burn centers in the United States as one indicator for monitoring and evaluating nutritional status [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluating-nutritional-support-for-moderate-to-severe-burn-patients/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Long-term trends in TBW are a helpful indicator of nutritional status when patients enter the rehabilitative phase of burn care [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluating-nutritional-support-for-moderate-to-severe-burn-patients/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. Because of the limited utility of body weight for monitoring nutritional status in acute burns, our unit practice is to measure it two times per week to allow assessment of trends.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h1\">LEAN BODY MASS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Maintenance of lean body mass (LBM) represents one of the central tenets of nutritional support in burn patients. LBM theoretically can be monitored using body composition technology such as total body potassium counting (K-counter), dual X-ray absorptiometry (DEXA) scanning, and bioimpedance analysis (BIA).</p><p>We do not use any of these technologies, as further studies are needed to determine the utility and appropriateness of routine use in the burn care setting. No studies of BIA have been published in burn patients, though the bedside nature of BIA makes it convenient as a routine clinical tool. Both K-counter and DEXA have been routinely used in long-term studies of pediatric burn patients but have not been used as a routine component for evaluating clinical nutrition status [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluating-nutritional-support-for-moderate-to-severe-burn-patients/abstract/5-7\" class=\"abstract_t\">5-7</a>]. Body composition assessment by current techniques cannot be reliably used as a means to monitor nutritional status in burn patients because of the edema and fluid shifts associated with the inflammatory response to the burn injury [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluating-nutritional-support-for-moderate-to-severe-burn-patients/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. Although K-counter and DEXA provide equivalent data on lean body mass, current recommendations favor DEXA for LBM monitoring because of patient comfort and cost [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluating-nutritional-support-for-moderate-to-severe-burn-patients/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h1\">INDIRECT CALORIMETRY ASSESSMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Indirect calorimetry (IDC) can be used to determine the nutritional requirements as well as serve as an indicator of response to nutritional support, particularly in the difficult-to-manage patient [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluating-nutritional-support-for-moderate-to-severe-burn-patients/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nutritional-demands-and-enteral-formulas-for-moderate-to-severe-burn-patients#H2\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Nutritional demands and enteral formulas for moderate-to-severe burn patients&quot;, section on 'Determining caloric requirements'</a>.)</p><p>The utility of IDC is controversial, particularly as a single measurement point [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluating-nutritional-support-for-moderate-to-severe-burn-patients/abstract/9,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,10</a>]. One of the greatest limitations of IDC is that energy expenditure fluctuates with activity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluating-nutritional-support-for-moderate-to-severe-burn-patients/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. We recommend using trends in IDC as a more reliable estimate of adequate nutritional support than a single measurement. IDC is monitored twice per week in our burn center, with adjustments in nutritional support occurring no more than twice per week based upon trends in IDC, nitrogen balance data, and clinical progress. Two-thirds of responding burn center dieticians indicated that they used IDC to assess energy demands in adult patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluating-nutritional-support-for-moderate-to-severe-burn-patients/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h1\">NITROGEN BALANCE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The assessment of adequate nutritional support must address both energy requirements and protein demands of burn patients. Nitrogen balance, therefore, plays an important role in assessing nutritional adequacy following burn injury. Measuring urinary urea nitrogen (UUN) and calculating nitrogen balance on a weekly basis allows approximation of the trend in nitrogen breakdown and appropriate adjustment of protein goals, particularly when used in conjunction with the previously described methods of nutrition status monitoring [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluating-nutritional-support-for-moderate-to-severe-burn-patients/abstract/4,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,11</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Clinical monitoring tools'</a> above.)</p><p>In children with severe burns, UUN is imprecise, reflecting the diminished reliability of UUN measurements in patients with hypercatabolic responses [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluating-nutritional-support-for-moderate-to-severe-burn-patients/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h1\">LABORATORY TESTS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The physiologic changes that accompany a burn injury make it difficult to accurately interpret laboratory markers. The practice at our burn center is to not use visceral proteins (eg, albumin) to monitor nutritional status, as our experience with them has been unreliable. Furthermore, while there are markers that correlate with compromised nutritional status, they do not provide a meaningful measure of overall trends in nutritional status for burn patients.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h2\">Serum albumin</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Serum albumin does not correlate with nitrogen balance in burn patients. Serum albumin levels decrease dramatically with injury and remain chronically depressed following burns, even when other indicators, including nitrogen balance, suggest adequate nutritional support [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluating-nutritional-support-for-moderate-to-severe-burn-patients/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h2\">Inflammatory response proteins</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>We do not monitor the adequacy of nutritional support with transthyretin, transferrin, retinol-binding protein, and C-reactive protein during the convalescent phase. If these protein markers are monitored, we suggest that they be used only in conjunction with the assessment of the clinical course and wound healing [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluating-nutritional-support-for-moderate-to-severe-burn-patients/abstract/4,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,11</a>].</p><p>A variety of acute phase reactants have been considered as laboratory markers for assessing the efficacy of nutritional support in burn patients. Transthyretin, like albumin, decreases dramatically following burn injury, although it gradually recovers with adequate nutrition and as the inflammatory response subsides. There is a positive association with transthyretin level and wound healing and, at best, a weak association with nitrogen balance [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluating-nutritional-support-for-moderate-to-severe-burn-patients/abstract/12,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,13</a>]. In a cross-sectional study of 50 burn patients, transthyretin was the factor significantly associated with graft healing [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluating-nutritional-support-for-moderate-to-severe-burn-patients/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. Transthyretin levels that do not improve with adequate nutrition and a normalizing C-reactive protein may be indicative of either a protein or calorie deficiency [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluating-nutritional-support-for-moderate-to-severe-burn-patients/abstract/4,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,14</a>]; alternatively, transthyretin levels may not respond to adequate nutritional support in burns [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluating-nutritional-support-for-moderate-to-severe-burn-patients/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. CRP, haptoglobin, and alpha-1 antitrypsin have all failed to show a meaningful relationship to nutritional status in burn patients, even with adequate protein intake [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluating-nutritional-support-for-moderate-to-severe-burn-patients/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1861697930\"><span class=\"h1\">SOCIETY GUIDELINE LINKS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Links to society and government-sponsored guidelines from selected countries and regions around the world are provided separately.
