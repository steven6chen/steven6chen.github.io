The disorder was first described in 1957 by Sj&ouml;gren and Larsson, who reported a series of 28 patients with a clinical triad of ichthyosis, spastic diplegia or quadriplegia, and intellectual disability (mental retardation, oligophrenia) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sjogren-larsson-syndrome/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p>This topic will review the pathogenesis, clinical features, diagnosis, and management of SLS.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">PATHOGENESIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>SLS is a disorder of fatty alcohol metabolism (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F82067\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef82067 \">figure 1</a>) caused by a deficiency of the enzyme fatty aldehyde dehydrogenase (FALDH), a component of the fatty alcohol:nicotinamide-adenine dinucleotide oxidoreductase (FAO) enzyme complex [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sjogren-larsson-syndrome/abstract/2,3\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,3</a>].</p><p>FAO is composed of two distinct proteins that sequentially catalyze the oxidation of fatty alcohols to fatty aldehydes and then to fatty acids (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F66427\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef66427 \">figure 2</a>)&nbsp;[<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sjogren-larsson-syndrome/abstract/2,3\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,3</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Fatty alcohol dehydrogenase (FADH), which catalyzes the oxidation of medium- and long-chain fatty alcohols to fatty aldehydes</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>FALDH, which catalyzes the oxidation of fatty aldehydes to fatty acids</p><p/><p>Lipid accumulation is the probable mechanism of cutaneous and neurologic disease in SLS [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sjogren-larsson-syndrome/abstract/4,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,5</a>]. Fatty alcohols accumulate in the skin, disrupting the epidermal water barrier, and resulting in transepidermal water loss and ichthyosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sjogren-larsson-syndrome/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Experimental evidence supports a permeability barrier abnormality in the stratum corneum of skin [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sjogren-larsson-syndrome/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. Despite their disrupted oxidation, the plasma concentration of fatty alcohols is not elevated in all patients with SLS [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sjogren-larsson-syndrome/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].</p><p>Although the precise mechanism of neurologic disease in SLS is uncertain, the deficiency of fatty alcohol oxidation may impair the structural <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> functional integrity of myelin membranes in the central nervous system, thereby leading to the neurologic features, including leukoencephalopathy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sjogren-larsson-syndrome/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].</p><p>In SLS, myelination is delayed, and some patients have unmyelinated subcortical association fibers, suggesting that the process of myelination does not reach completion in these patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sjogren-larsson-syndrome/abstract/8,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,9</a>]. Myelin deficiency (retarded myelination <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> dysmyelination) may involve the brainstem (corticospinal tracts) and, in severe cases, the corpus callosum [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sjogren-larsson-syndrome/abstract/4,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,8</a>]. The cerebellum and cerebral gray matter are spared [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sjogren-larsson-syndrome/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].</p><p>The deficiency of FALDH also affects the metabolism of leukotriene B4 (LTB4), a proinflammatory mediator. Normally, LTB4 is inactivated by sequential oxidation, first to omega-hydroxy-LTB4, then to omega-aldehyde-LTB4, and lastly, in a step catalyzed by FALDH, to omega-carboxy-LTB4 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sjogren-larsson-syndrome/abstract/7,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,10</a>]. Other pathways cannot compensate for the FALDH deficiency in patients with SLS [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sjogren-larsson-syndrome/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>], leading to accumulation of LTB4 and omega-hydroxy-LTB4. These products are probably responsible for the severe pruritus that is characteristic of the disease. However, it is unclear if the defective degradation of LTB4 contributes to the neurologic involvement in SLS [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sjogren-larsson-syndrome/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Genetics</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Sj&ouml;gren-Larsson syndrome is caused by mutations in the FALDH (ALDH3A2) gene on chromosome 17p11.2 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sjogren-larsson-syndrome/abstract/12-15\" class=\"abstract_t\">12-15</a>]. More than 70 mutations in the FALDH gene, including point mutations, deletions, insertions, and splice site alterations, can lead to the phenotype of SLS [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sjogren-larsson-syndrome/abstract/13,14,16-18\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,14,16-18</a>]. While most mutations are private, common mutations associated with founder effects have been identified [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sjogren-larsson-syndrome/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h1\">EPIDEMIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In Vasterbotten county, Sweden, where Sj&ouml;gren and Larsson identified this syndrome, the prevalence of SLS was 8.3 per 100,000, perhaps due to inbreeding, whereas the overall prevalence in Sweden was 0.4 per 100,000 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sjogren-larsson-syndrome/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. Although SLS occurs worldwide in various ethnic groups, the prevalence and incidence outside of Sweden are unknown [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sjogren-larsson-syndrome/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL FEATURES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>SLS is associated with the following characteristic clinical features [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sjogren-larsson-syndrome/abstract/1,4,17,21\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,4,17,21</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Ichthyosis and pruritus</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Spastic diplegia or quadriplegia</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Intellectual disability (mental retardation)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Ocular abnormalities: photophobia, macular degeneration with retinal crystals, and decreased visual acuity</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Leukoencephalopathy</p><p/><p>The neurologic manifestations of SLS superficially resemble those of cerebral palsy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sjogren-larsson-syndrome/abstract/22,23\" class=\"abstract_t\">22,23</a>]. Most of the clinical symptoms of SLS are apparent in the first years of life, after which they persist with little or no change [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sjogren-larsson-syndrome/abstract/8,17,22\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,17,22</a>]. In older children and adults, there is no apparent correlation of disease severity with age [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sjogren-larsson-syndrome/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. In addition, the severity of the cutaneous symptoms does not correlate with severity of the neurologic manifestations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sjogren-larsson-syndrome/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>].</p><p>Even within individual families affected by SLS, there is phenotypic heterogeneity. Some children have a mild form of SLS, with less severe dermatologic and neurologic difficulties [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sjogren-larsson-syndrome/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Cutaneous</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The dermatologic features are typically the earliest presenting symptoms, beginning with skin erythema at birth. In the latter half of the first year of life, the skin becomes dry, rough, and scaly, due to a defect in keratinization, and it has a brown-yellow discoloration. The flexor surfaces of the extremities, neck, axilla, and umbilicus are predominantly affected, while the face is usually spared.</p><p>Severe pruritus is nearly universal in SLS and distinguishes SLS from other ichthyoses [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sjogren-larsson-syndrome/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>].</p><p>A collodion membrane at birth (&quot;collodion baby&quot;) is unusual in SLS, whereas it is characteristic of lamellar ichthyosis and congenital ichthyosiform erythroderma. (See <a href=\"#H15\" class=\"local\">'Differential diagnosis'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Motor</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Children with SLS usually develop pyramidal signs in the first two years of life. The legs are usually more severely affected than the arms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sjogren-larsson-syndrome/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. Despite the insidious onset of the spasticity, children with SLS may nevertheless learn to walk. However, most become wheelchair dependent during late childhood or early adolescence, and joint contractures frequently develop in the legs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sjogren-larsson-syndrome/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. Generalized dystonia was reported in one child with SLS [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sjogren-larsson-syndrome/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Cognitive</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Developmental delay is usually apparent during the first year of life, and most patients with SLS have mild to moderate intellectual disability (mental retardation) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sjogren-larsson-syndrome/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. However, a minority have normal intelligence [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sjogren-larsson-syndrome/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. The disease is not neurodegenerative, and there is usually no loss of acquired skills.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h2\">Speech and language</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Speech and language problems in SLS are related to both motor and cognitive impairments. In one series, children severely affected with SLS could speak only in short sentences and often produced incomprehensible syllables due to pseudobulbar dysarthria, whereas language comprehension was relatively spared [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sjogren-larsson-syndrome/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h2\">Ocular</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Retinal crystals, which appear as foveal and perifoveal glistening white dots, are present in all patients with SLS beginning in early childhood [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sjogren-larsson-syndrome/abstract/4,25,26\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,25,26</a>]. Younger patients are often difficult to examine due to poor cooperation related to photophobia during the funduscopic examination; this problem may explain the absence of reports of retinal crystals in children younger than two to four years of age [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sjogren-larsson-syndrome/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].</p><p>Decreased visual acuity is common in SLS, and in some patients may be due to dysmyelination of the optic tracts [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sjogren-larsson-syndrome/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h2\">Additional</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The affected children are often born prematurely. The frequency of seizures in patients with SLS ranges from 0 to 40 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sjogren-larsson-syndrome/abstract/4,5,21\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,5,21</a>]. Growth delay and contractures may lead to short stature [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sjogren-larsson-syndrome/abstract/20,21\" class=\"abstract_t\">20,21</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h2\">Neuroimaging</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In patients with SLS, brain MRI shows delayed myelination (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F68733\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef68733 \">image 1</a>) with high signal on T2-weighted imaging in the periventricular white matter with either frontal (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F61461\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef61461 \">image 2</a>) or parieto-occipital (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F82286\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef82286 \">image 3</a>) predominance [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sjogren-larsson-syndrome/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. The same areas appear normal or mildly hypointense on T1-weighted images. The severity of white matter abnormalities on MRI does not correlate with the age of the patient or the symptomatology [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sjogren-larsson-syndrome/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].</p><p>In some patients, magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) shows a high abnormal lipid peak measuring 1.3 ppm in the periventricular white matter, especially around the frontal and posterior trigones, with a greater prominence in the latter (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F59484\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef59484 \">image 4</a>)&nbsp;[<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sjogren-larsson-syndrome/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. The lipid peak suggests local accumulation of the unusual free lipids or lipophilic substances, such as long-chain fatty alcohols. In one study, two patients had this abnormality on MRS before white matter abnormalities were detectable on conventional MRI [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sjogren-larsson-syndrome/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. The intensity of the white matter lipid peak at 1.3 ppm may be inversely correlated with age in adults with SLS, leading to speculation that an unknown compensatory mechanism leads to reduced lipid accumulation and disease severity over time [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sjogren-larsson-syndrome/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>].</p><p>In the cerebral white matter, MRS shows another, smaller peak at 0.8 to 0.9 ppm. The peaks at 0.8 to 0.9 and 1.3 ppm reflect the methyl (CH<sub>3</sub>) and methylene (CH<sub>2</sub>) groups on separate lipid molecules. In addition, creatine, choline, and myoinositol were elevated in cerebral white matter, while N-acetylaspartate and glutamate were normal. These findings on MRS suggest that SLS leads to gliosis without significant axonal loss [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sjogren-larsson-syndrome/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h2\">Pathology</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The key findings in SLS are gliosis and absence of myelin. Multiple features reflecting abnormal myelin structure have been reported. The cerebral white matter, cerebellar white matter, and pyramidal tracts have a decreased number of myelinated nerve fibers. One autopsy report revealed a reduction of in the number of axons in the retina and optic nerve, as well as a loss of neurons in the lateral geniculate bodies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sjogren-larsson-syndrome/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. While some axonal loss occurs, gliosis is more striking. Gross sections of brain reveal diffuse cerebral atrophy with gliosis.</p><p>Microscopically, lipoid deposits are found in multiple regions, including subpial, subependymal, and perivascular glial layers; subpial and perivascular spaces; cerebral white matter; and the brainstem. Perivascular macrophages contain lipofuscin-like pigments in the cytoplasm that probably represent the breakdown products of the lipoid substances. Similarly, ellipsoid bodies, found in the white matter, subpial, and periventricular glial layers, may reflect degraded products of the astrocytic processes as well [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sjogren-larsson-syndrome/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. Finally, spheroid bodies, representing axonal injury, have been reported in the relay nuclei, reticular formation, and periventricular gray matter of the fourth ventricle [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sjogren-larsson-syndrome/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14\"><span class=\"h1\">DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The diagnosis of SLS is confirmed by demonstrating fatty aldehyde dehydrogenase (FALDH) deficiency in cultured skin fibroblasts or leukocytes. In patients with SLS, the activity of FALDH is reduced to &lt;15 percent of normal [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sjogren-larsson-syndrome/abstract/2,3\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,3</a>].</p><p>In addition, the genetic diagnosis of SLS can be confirmed by mutation analysis of the ALDH3A2 gene that encodes FALDH [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sjogren-larsson-syndrome/abstract/29,30\" class=\"abstract_t\">29,30</a>].</p><p>The diagnosis of SLS should be suspected in infants and children with both ichthyosis and neurologic symptoms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sjogren-larsson-syndrome/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. The diagnosis may be delayed or missed in the neonatal period and early infancy, a time when the cutaneous manifestations are typically mild [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sjogren-larsson-syndrome/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>], and the neurologic signs and symptoms are usually occult. However, suspicion for the diagnosis of SLS should be raised in any infant with congenital ichthyosis, particularly when the ichthyosis has the characteristic brownish-yellow discoloration and wrinkled hyperkeratosis observed in SLS.</p><p>The preferred method for prenatal diagnosis involves amniocentesis or chorionic villus sampling; the prenatal diagnosis can be made by demonstrating deficient fatty alcohol:nicotinamide-adenine dinucleotide oxidoreductase (FAO) and FALDH activity in amniocytes and cultured chorionic villi cells [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sjogren-larsson-syndrome/abstract/31,32\" class=\"abstract_t\">31,32</a>]. The prenatal diagnosis of SLS was first demonstrated by fetal skin biopsy at 23 weeks gestation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sjogren-larsson-syndrome/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>], but the diagnosis can be missed if the analysis is performed earlier in the pregnancy.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15\"><span class=\"h1\">DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The typical presenting symptoms of SLS in newborns and early infancy are dermatologic, and the differential diagnosis includes the primary ichthyoses. Once neurologic symptoms have developed, neuroichthyotic disorders must be considered [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sjogren-larsson-syndrome/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H16\"><span class=\"h2\">Primary ichthyoses</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The ichthyoses are a heterogeneous group of dermatoses caused by abnormal keratinization with variable modes of inheritance. Ichthyosis may be a primary disorder, in which the skin is predominantly or solely affected, or a component of a multisystem disorder.

A randomized placebo-controlled trial of zileuton that included 10 patients with SLS did not show efficacy overall, but one patient in the active treatment group showed substantial improvement [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sjogren-larsson-syndrome/abstract/49\" class=\"abstract_t\">49</a>]. In a small case series, pruritus was improved at three months in four of five patients with SLS (14 to 21 years old) who were treated with zileuton 600 mg three times daily for the first six weeks and 600 mg four times daily for the last six weeks of the study. </p><p>Given these data, we suggest treatment with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=zileuton-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">zileuton</a> 600 mg three to four times daily for severe refractory pruritus in patients with SLS, despite the unproven benefit. Of note, zileuton is not approved for use in SLS, and safety has not been established in children &lt;12 years of age.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H20\"><span class=\"h1\">SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Sj&ouml;gren-Larsson syndrome (SLS) is a disorder of fatty alcohol metabolism caused mutations in the ALDH3A2 gene that encodes for the enzyme fatty aldehyde dehydrogenase (FALDH). Lipid accumulation is the probable mechanism of cutaneous and neurologic disease in SLS. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Pathogenesis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>SLS is associated with the following characteristic clinical features:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Ichthyosis and pruritus</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Spastic diplegia or quadriplegia</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Intellectual disability (mental retardation)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Ocular abnormalities: photophobia, macular degeneration with retinal crystals, and decreased visual acuity</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Leukoencephalopathy</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">The dermatologic features are typically the earliest presenting symptoms. Severe pruritus is nearly universal in SLS. (See <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Clinical features'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Brain MRI shows delayed myelination with high signal on T2-weighted imaging in the periventricular white matter with either frontal or parieto-occipital predominance. (See <a href=\"#H12\" class=\"local\">'Neuroimaging'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The diagnosis of SLS is confirmed by demonstrating FALDH deficiency in cultured skin fibroblasts or leukocytes. The genetic diagnosis of SLS can be confirmed by mutation analysis of the ALDH3A2 gene that encodes FALDH. (See <a href=\"#H14\" class=\"local\">'Diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In the neonatal period and early infancy, the differential diagnosis of SLS includes the primary ichthyoses, particularly X-linked ichthyosis, lamellar ichthyosis, and congenital ichthyosiform erythroderma. Once neurologic symptoms have developed, neuroichthyotic disorders must be considered. (See <a href=\"#H15\" class=\"local\">'Differential diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>There is no cure for SLS. However, most patients survive until adulthood. Management involves therapies directed towards controlling ichthyosis, spastic paraparesis, contractures, seizures, and ocular problems. The spastic paraparesis and mild to moderate intellectual disability (mental retardation) that occurs with SLS are addressed by multidisciplinary interventions and educational assistance. (See <a href=\"#H18\" class=\"local\">'Management'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The cutaneous symptoms of SLS are treatable with keratolytic agents and measures to maintain skin hydration, including daily water baths and topical moisturizing creams. For patients &ge;12 years old with SLS who have severe pruritus refractory to keratolytic agents and measures to maintain skin hydration, we suggest treatment with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=zileuton-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">zileuton</a> 600 mg three to four times daily (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). This recommendation to use zileuton places a relatively high value on a possible but uncertain benefit for improvement of pruritus, and a low value on the high cost and potential risks of such treatment.
