Following establishment of a benign diagnosis, treatment in general is aimed at symptomatic relief and patient education.</p><p>Some benign breast diseases, such as atypical hyperplasia, confer an increase in the patient's future risk of developing breast cancer and should lead to counseling about screening recommendations and risk reduction strategies. These lesions are considered risk markers, rather than premalignant, because those cancers that subsequently develop are not necessarily in the area of the atypia and may occur in the contralateral breast.</p><p>This topic will review the pathologic classification and treatment of benign breast disorders. Evaluation of women presenting with symptoms related to the breast and diagnosis of breast disorders are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-a-palpable-breast-mass\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of a palpable breast mass&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=breast-pain\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Breast pain&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nipple-discharge\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Nipple discharge&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">CLASSIFICATION OF BENIGN BREAST LESIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Benign epithelial breast lesions can be classified histologically into three categories: nonproliferative, proliferative without atypia, and atypical hyperplasia. The categorization is based upon the degree of cellular proliferation and atypia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-benign-breast-disease/abstract/1-10\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-10</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=breast-development-and-morphology\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Breast development and morphology&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">NONPROLIFERATIVE BREAST LESIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Nonproliferative epithelial lesions are generally not associated with an increased risk of breast cancer [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-benign-breast-disease/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. It should be noted that terms such as fibrocystic changes, fibrocystic disease, chronic cystic mastitis, and mammary dysplasia refer to nonproliferative lesions and are not useful clinically, as they encompass a heterogeneous group of diagnoses [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-benign-breast-disease/abstract/5,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,11</a>]. The most common nonproliferative breast lesions are breast cysts. Other nonproliferative lesions include papillary apocrine change, epithelial-related calcifications, and mild hyperplasia of the usual type [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-benign-breast-disease/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. Apocrine metaplasia (also referred to as a &quot;benign epithelial alteration&quot;) is also a nonproliferative change that is secondary to some form of irritation, typically associated with a breast cyst.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Simple breast cysts</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Simple cysts are fluid-filled, round, or ovoid masses derived from the terminal duct lobular unit. Breast cysts can present as breast masses or mammographic abnormalities. Cysts are common in women between 35 and 50 years old. Acute enlargement of cysts may cause severe, localized pain of sudden onset. The diagnosis and management of breast cysts is discussed elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=breast-cysts-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-management\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Breast cysts: Clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and management&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Papillary apocrine change</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Papillary apocrine change is a proliferation of ductal epithelial cells showing apocrine features, characterized by eosinophilic cytoplasm [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-benign-breast-disease/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Mild hyperplasia of the usual type</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Mild hyperplasia of the usual type is an increase in the number of epithelial cells within a duct that is more than two, but not more than four, cells in depth [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-benign-breast-disease/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. The epithelial cells do not cross the lumen of the involved space.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h1\">PROLIFERATIVE BREAST LESIONS WITHOUT ATYPIA</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Proliferative lesions without atypia include usual ductal hyperplasia, intraductal papillomas, sclerosing adenosis, radial scars, and fibroadenomas. These lesions are associated with a small increased risk of developing breast cancer, approximately 1.5 to 2 times that of the general population [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-benign-breast-disease/abstract/2-5,8,9,12-15\" class=\"abstract_t\">2-5,8,9,12-15</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h2\">Usual ductal hyperplasia</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Ductal hyperplasia without atypia is a pathologic diagnosis, usually found as an incidental finding on biopsy of mammographic abnormalities or breast masses, characterized by an increased number of cells within the ductal space. Although the cells vary in size and shape, they retain the cytological features of benign cells [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-benign-breast-disease/abstract/5,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,6</a>]. No additional treatment is needed for ductal hyperplasia. The risk of subsequent breast cancer in women with usual ductal hyperplasia is small, and chemoprevention is not indicated.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h2\">Intraductal papillomas</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Intraductal papillomas consist of a monotonous array of papillary cells that grow from the wall of a cyst into its lumen. Although they are not concerning in and of themselves, they can harbor areas of atypia or ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS). Papillomas can occur as solitary or multiple lesions.</p><p>Classically, the standard approach to a papilloma diagnosed by core needle biopsy (CNB) has been to perform a surgical excision. In a meta-analysis of 34 studies that included 2236 nonmalignant breast papillary lesions, 346 (15.7 percent) were upgraded to malignancy following surgical excision [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-benign-breast-disease/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. Because of this risk of malignancy, surgical excision was recommended. However, newer data suggest that not all papillomas diagnosed by CNB require excision.</p><p>When a CNB demonstrates papilloma with atypical cells, surgical excision is warranted [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-benign-breast-disease/abstract/14,16-21\" class=\"abstract_t\">14,16-21</a>]. Papillary lesions with atypia are upgraded pathologically up to 67 percent of the time [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-benign-breast-disease/abstract/20,22-24\" class=\"abstract_t\">20,22-24</a>]. After excision, if there is no upgrading beyond atypia, a discussion about endocrine therapy for breast cancer prevention is indicated. The data surrounding solitary papillomas without evidence of atypia are less clear. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H183127241\"><span class=\"h3\">Solitary lesions</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Solitary intraductal papillomas may be identified as a mass on a mammogram (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RADIOL%2F83703\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef83703 \">image 1</a>), ultrasound (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RADIOL%2F83702\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef83702 \">image 2</a>), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RADIOL%2F85531\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef85531 \">image 3</a>), or ductogram [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-benign-breast-disease/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>], or they can be found incidentally [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-benign-breast-disease/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. Nipple discharge, particularly bloody nipple discharge, is a frequent clinical presentation. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nipple-discharge\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Nipple discharge&quot;</a>.) </p><p>For a solitary papilloma without biopsy evidence of atypia, the need for surgical excision is not clear. Examples in the literature include the following:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a retrospective review of 38 patients who underwent a CNB for a mass or calcifications and an incidental intraductal papilloma was identified, no cancers were identified in 14 patients who underwent excision, and the remaining 24 patients who did not were radiographically stable for over 12 months [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-benign-breast-disease/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a larger series of 97 patients with intraductal papilloma diagnosed by CNB, the upgrade rate was 21 percent for papillomas with atypia but only 6 percent (three lesions) for patients without atypia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-benign-breast-disease/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. In all three cases, the biopsy results were discordant, so the upgrade rate among concordant intraductal papillomas without atypia was 0 percent. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>One cohort study compared the cancer risk among patients with a single papilloma without atypia (n = 54) with what would be expected in the general population. It found that the risk of subsequent cancer was twofold higher in the presence of a single papilloma (relative risk [RR] 2.04, 95% CI 1.43-2.81), which was estimated to be similar to the risk for women found to have proliferative disease without atypia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-benign-breast-disease/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. However, the presence of atypia increased this risk fivefold (RR 5.11, 95% CI 2.64-8.92), which is similar to the risk of cancer in the presence of atypia without a papilloma.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Lastly, a small series also showed that excluding discordant imaging findings and atypia, the upgrade rate was 0 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-benign-breast-disease/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. </p><p/><p>Given this emerging literature, it may be reasonable to offer observation to a small subset of select patients with papillomas. The American Society of Breast Surgeons published a consensus guideline on concordance assessment of image-guided breast biopsies and management of borderline or high-risk lesions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-benign-breast-disease/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. Given the challenges in reliably predicting upgraded pathology, most papillary lesions should be offered excision, but this decision should be individualized based on risk, including such criteria as size, symptoms, palpability, concurrent symptoms, and breast cancer risk factors. Excision is particularly recommended in cases of pathology-imaging discordance. However, incidental solitary papillomas with imaging concordance may be offered close clinical follow-up. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h3\">Multiple lesions</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Diffuse papillomatosis (multiple papillomas) may present as breast masses or nodules on ultrasound, or may be the cause of nipple discharge and can be seen on ductography. Diffuse papillomatosis is defined as a minimum of five papillomas within a localized segment of breast tissue and can be definitively managed with excision [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-benign-breast-disease/abstract/19,29,30\" class=\"abstract_t\">19,29,30</a>]. The risk of subsequent breast cancer in women with diffuse papillomatosis is not well defined but may be higher than with solitary papillomas [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-benign-breast-disease/abstract/31,32\" class=\"abstract_t\">31,32</a>]. In one retrospective study, the risk for subsequently developing cancer evaluated in a cohort of patients with papillomas (n = 480) was compared with the risk within the general population [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-benign-breast-disease/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. The presence of multiple papillomas without atypia was associated with an RR of 3.01 (95% CI 1.10-6.55). In the presence of atypia, the relative risk was even greater (RR 7.01, 95% CI 1.97-17.97) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-benign-breast-disease/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. </p><p>Given the risks of multiple papillomas, even in the absence of atypia, it may be reasonable to discuss the role of endocrine therapy for breast cancer prevention with women once they have completed surgical excision. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h2\">Sclerosing adenosis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Sclerosing adenosis is a lobular lesion with increased fibrous tissue and interspersed glandular cells. It can present as a mass or a suspicious finding on mammogram [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-benign-breast-disease/abstract/33,34\" class=\"abstract_t\">33,34</a>]. No treatment is needed for sclerosing adenosis. The risk of subsequent breast cancer in this population is small, and chemoprevention is not indicated.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h2\">Radial scars</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Radial scars, also called complex sclerosing lesions, are a pathologic diagnosis, usually discovered incidentally when a breast mass or radiologic abnormality is removed or biopsied. Occasionally, radial scars are large enough to be detected by mammography, which cannot reliably differentiate between these lesions and spiculated carcinoma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-benign-breast-disease/abstract/35-38\" class=\"abstract_t\">35-38</a>]. Radial scars are characterized microscopically by a fibroelastic core with radiating ducts and lobules.</p><p>There is ongoing controversy about the need for surgical excision when radial scars are found on core biopsy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-benign-breast-disease/abstract/39,40\" class=\"abstract_t\">39,40</a>]. We suggest that these be excised since most series show that 8 to 17 percent of surgical specimens at subsequent excision are positive for malignancy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-benign-breast-disease/abstract/41-45\" class=\"abstract_t\">41-45</a>]. In addition to the possibility of finding an unrecognized in situ or invasive component, there is some evidence that radial scars may be premalignant lesions, meaning that they can slowly progress from scar to hyperplasia to carcinoma over time [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-benign-breast-disease/abstract/46\" class=\"abstract_t\">46</a>]. </p><p>No additional treatment beyond excision is needed for radial scars. The risk of subsequent breast cancer after excision in this population is small, and chemoprevention is not indicated.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14\"><span class=\"h2\">Simple fibroadenomas</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Simple fibroadenomas are benign solid tumors containing glandular as well as fibrous tissue. In 20 percent of cases, multiple fibroadenomas occur in the same breast or bilaterally. The etiology of fibroadenomas is not known, but a hormonal relationship is likely since they persist during the reproductive years, can increase in size during pregnancy or with estrogen therapy, and usually regress after menopause. They are most commonly found in women between the ages of 15 and 35 years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-benign-breast-disease/abstract/47\" class=\"abstract_t\">47</a>].</p><p>Although originally classified as nonproliferative lesions, fibroadenomas are now considered proliferative breast lesions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-benign-breast-disease/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. However, it is important to note that the histologic features of the fibroadenoma influence the risk of breast cancer. The risk of subsequent breast cancer is slightly elevated only if the fibroadenoma is complex, if there is adjacent proliferative disease, or if there is a family history of breast cancer. For the majority of women with simple fibroadenomas, there is no increased risk of developing breast cancer [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-benign-breast-disease/abstract/2-5,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">2-5,12</a>]. </p><p>Fibroadenomas usually present as a well-defined, mobile mass on physical examination or a well-defined solid mass on ultrasound. A well-defined solid mass with benign imaging features can be managed with CNB or short-term (three to six months) follow-up with a repeat ultrasound and breast examination [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-benign-breast-disease/abstract/48\" class=\"abstract_t\">48</a>]. Definitive diagnosis can only be confirmed with a core biopsy or excision.</p><p>It is not necessary to excise all biopsy-proven fibroadenomas. Disadvantages of excisional surgery include scarring at the incision site, dimpling of the breast from the removal of the tumor, damage to the breast's duct system, and mammographic changes (eg, architectural distortion, skin thickening, increased focal density). If a biopsy-proven fibroadenoma is asymptomatic, then it can be left in place, although some women wish to have the mass excised so that they will not worry further.</p><p>Cryoablation is an alternative to surgical excision of fibroadenomas but should only be considered after a core biopsy diagnosis of fibroadenoma has been made [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-benign-breast-disease/abstract/49-53\" class=\"abstract_t\">49-53</a>]. A multicenter trial of 50 patients who underwent office-based cryoablation under ultrasound guidance reported that the lesions tended to disappear progressively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-benign-breast-disease/abstract/50\" class=\"abstract_t\">50</a>], and 75 percent were not palpable at 12-month follow-up [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-benign-breast-disease/abstract/51\" class=\"abstract_t\">51</a>]. Transient side effects included ecchymosis, local swelling, and discomfort that lasted as long as a few weeks after treatment. Percutaneous vacuum-assisted ultrasound-guided excision is another alternative to open excision technique for removal of fibroadenomas but may be less effective for lesions &gt;2 cm [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-benign-breast-disease/abstract/54\" class=\"abstract_t\">54</a>].</p><p>If a presumed fibroadenoma increases in size or is symptomatic, then excision is mandated to rule out malignant change and confirm the diagnosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-benign-breast-disease/abstract/49,50,54\" class=\"abstract_t\">49,50,54</a>]. Rapid growth of a lesion raises the suspicion for a phyllodes tumor, unusual fibroepithelial tumors that require more extensive surgical resection and in some cases may require radiation treatment as well. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=phyllodes-tumors-of-the-breast\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Phyllodes tumors of the breast&quot;</a>.) </p><p>The above discussion of fibroadenoma applies to adult patients. Juvenile fibroadenoma in adolescent patients is discussed elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=breast-masses-in-children-and-adolescents#H8\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Breast masses in children and adolescents&quot;, section on 'Juvenile fibroadenoma'</a>.) </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15\"><span class=\"h1\">ATYPICAL HYPERPLASIA</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Atypical hyperplasia (AH) includes both atypical ductal hyperplasia (ADH) and atypical lobular hyperplasia (ALH). AH is a pathologic diagnosis, usually found as an incidental finding on biopsy of mammographic abnormalities or breast masses. These lesions have some, but not all, of the features of ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) or lobular carcinoma in situ (LCIS). </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Atypical ductal hyperplasia &ndash; ADH is characterized by a proliferation of uniform epithelial cells with monomorphic round nuclei filling part, but not the entirety, of the involved duct.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">ADH shares some of the cytologic and architectural features of low-grade DCIS [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-benign-breast-disease/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].

AH is associated with an increased risk of both ipsilateral and contralateral breast cancer and thus provides evidence of underlying breast abnormalities that predispose to breast cancer [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-benign-breast-disease/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. In a report from the Nurses' Health Study, only 56 percent of cancers that developed in women with AH occurred in the ipsilateral breast [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-benign-breast-disease/abstract/56\" class=\"abstract_t\">56</a>]. The cumulative incidence of breast cancer over 30 years approached 35 percent.</p><p>Some studies have shown that the risk of developing breast cancer is higher with ALH than ADH; however, the data on this are conflicting [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-benign-breast-disease/abstract/13,55-57\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,55-57</a>]. There is a higher risk of subsequent breast cancer when the ALH involves both lobules and ducts (RR 6.8) as compared with lobules alone (RR 4.3) or ducts alone (2.1) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-benign-breast-disease/abstract/58\" class=\"abstract_t\">58</a>].</p><p>Data on the effect of family history of breast cancer in women with AH are conflicting [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-benign-breast-disease/abstract/59\" class=\"abstract_t\">59</a>].

However, subsequent studies have not confirmed this and did not show that a family history further increased the breast cancer risk in women with AH [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-benign-breast-disease/abstract/4,55,59\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,55,59</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H16\"><span class=\"h2\">Risk reduction strategies for women with atypical hyperplasia</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Women with AH should be counseled regarding risk reduction strategies.

Typically, flat epithelial atypia is diagnosed on breast biopsies done for calcifications found on screening mammograms. The relationship between flat epithelial atypia and cancer is still being defined, but the available data suggest that the risk of local recurrence or progression to invasive cancer is low [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-benign-breast-disease/abstract/60,61\" class=\"abstract_t\">60,61</a>].

In addition, it is often challenging to differentiate ADH from low-grade DCIS. However, several studies have suggested that additional factors may be used to select patients for observation.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A nomogram using several clinical and pathologic factors associated with the likelihood of upgrade at surgical excision has been created.

Routine surgical excision for ALH and LCIS has become more controversial. </p><p>When no other pathologic findings are present (ADH, papilloma, radial scar) and radiological-pathological concordance is present, upgrade rates are less than 5 percent.

When these lesions are not excised, close clinical and imaging follow-up is recommended, with multidisciplinary input. Excision is necessary when the pathology is discordant or other high-risk lesions are present.

These present as soft, nontender, well-circumscribed masses. Clinically, it is sometimes difficult to distinguish lipomas from other conditions; the diagnosis can be confirmed with a core or excisional biopsy. Core biopsies are somewhat problematic for lipomas, as it is difficult to be certain that the diagnosis is concordant, and lipomas should be surgically excised if they cause diagnostic confusion, continue to enlarge, or grow rapidly [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-benign-breast-disease/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. For smaller lesions, excisional biopsy is often preferable. There is no increased risk of subsequent breast cancer associated with lipomas.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H21\"><span class=\"h2\">Fat necrosis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Fat necrosis of the breast is a benign condition that most commonly occurs as the result of breast trauma or surgical intervention. Fat necrosis can be confused with a malignancy on physical examination and may mimic malignancy on radiologic studies. It is sometimes necessary to biopsy these lesions to confirm the diagnosis, although experienced radiologists can usually determine that a lesion represents fat necrosis based on mammographic and ultrasound findings such as oil cysts (collections of liquefied fat) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-benign-breast-disease/abstract/6,88\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,88</a>].

Excision is recommended. The primary challenge for the pathologist is to differentiate these from phyllodes tumors. Phyllodes tumors have a more cellular stromal component than fibroadenomas. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H23\"><span class=\"h2\">Juvenile fibroadenomas</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Juvenile fibroadenomas occur in young women between the ages of 10 and 18 years. They may differ in presentation and management from adult fibroadenomas (see <a href=\"#H14\" class=\"local\">'Simple fibroadenomas'</a> above). Juvenile fibroadenoma is discussed elsewhere.

However, on pathology, these contain other proliferative changes, such as sclerosing adenosis, duct epithelial hyperplasia, epithelial calcification, or papillary apocrine changes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-benign-breast-disease/abstract/89\" class=\"abstract_t\">89</a>]. They are associated with a slightly increased risk of cancer when multicentric proliferative changes are present in the surrounding glandular tissue.</p><p>Appropriate management of complex fibroadenomas is controversial. While some believe that complex fibroadenomas warrant complete removal for histological examination, others suggest that they can be managed conservatively following core biopsy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-benign-breast-disease/abstract/89\" class=\"abstract_t\">89</a>]. In one series of 401 fibroadenomas, 63 (15.7 percent) were considered complex. At a mean follow-up of two years, invasive carcinoma was found in only one of the 63 patients with complex fibroadenomas; her initial core biopsy had shown atypical lobular hyperplasia (ALH).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H25\"><span class=\"h2\">Diabetic mastopathy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Diabetic mastopathy, also known as lymphocytic mastitis or lymphocytic mastopathy, is seen occasionally in premenopausal women who have longstanding type 1 diabetes mellitus. The typical presentation is a suspicious breast mass with a dense mammographic pattern. Core biopsy is recommended for diagnostic confirmation. Pathology shows dense keloid-like fibrosis and periductal, lobular, or perivascular lymphocytic infiltration [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-benign-breast-disease/abstract/90-92\" class=\"abstract_t\">90-92</a>].

These present as soft cystic masses on physical exam. At mammography, galactoceles may appear as an indeterminate mass, unless the classic fat-fluid level is seen. Ultrasound may show a complex mass. Diagnosis can be made based on the clinical history and aspiration, which yields a milky substance [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-benign-breast-disease/abstract/94\" class=\"abstract_t\">94</a>].

Hamartomas have varying amounts of glandular, adipose, and fibrous tissue. They present as discrete, encapsulated, painless masses or are found incidentally on screening mammography. The diagnosis can be difficult to make with limited tissue, as hamartomas do not have specific diagnostic features. Fine needle aspiration and core needle biopsy (CNB) are not sufficient to establish the diagnosis.

They are distinguished from fibroadenomas by their sparse stromal elements. Adenomas are divided into two main groups: tubular and lactating adenomas. Lactating adenomas occur commonly in pregnancy. They are well circumscribed and lobulated. Although they may require excision because of their size, they do not have malignant potential [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-benign-breast-disease/abstract/5,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,6</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H29\"><span class=\"h2\">Idiopathic granulomatous mastitis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Idiopathic granulomatous mastitis (IGM) is an inflammatory mass in the breast.
