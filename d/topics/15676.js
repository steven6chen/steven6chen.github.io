These devices are often placed in the catheterization laboratory but in some cases, such as an intraaortic balloon pump, can be placed in intensive care unit.</p><p>There are four major (arbitrary) categories of circulatory assist devices: intraaortic balloon pump (IABP), non-IABP percutaneous mechanical circulatory assist devices (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RADIOL%2F93736\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef93736 \">image 1</a>), extracorporeal membrane oxygenator pumps, and nonpercutaneous centrifugal pumps, which are used for cardiopulmonary bypass. </p><p>A description of the short-term circulatory assist devices will be reviewed here. The clinical indications for these devices are discussed separately.

It is inserted easily and rapidly, is the least expensive of all the devices, and does not require continuous monitoring by technical support personnel. However, it is limited in that it is capable of generating only modest hemodynamic support and myocardial protection. In addition, clinical trials of patients with cardiogenic shock have not shown an improvement in mortality with its use. IABP is discussed separately.

These devices are continuous flow pumps. Compared to the IABP, they provide greater improvement in hemodynamic parameter. However, there is no evidence to suggest they improve clinical outcomes. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prognosis-and-treatment-of-cardiogenic-shock-complicating-acute-myocardial-infarction#H26\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Prognosis and treatment of cardiogenic shock complicating acute myocardial infarction&quot;, section on 'Other mechanical devices'</a>.) </p><p>In the literature, these devices have differing names: percutaneous ventricular assist devices, percutaneous ventricular support devices, percutaneous mechanical circulatory assist devices, percutaneous mechanical circulatory support devices, and percutaneous ventricular assist devices (VADs).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h2\">Left ventricle to aorta assist devices</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The axial flow pump works on the principle of an Archimedes screw. The inflow is placed retrograde across the aortic valve into the left ventricle. A pump revolving at high speeds draws blood out of the left ventricle and ejects it proximally into the ascending aorta. A device that uses this principle is the Impella microaxial flow device (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F103910\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef103910 \">figure 1</a>), which is a miniature impeller pump located within a catheter. The Impella System comes in different sizes from 2.5 to 5.0 where the smaller device can be placed percutaneously but only provides half the support of the larger device that is placed surgically. </p><p>Impella was designed for either surgical placement via a graft in the ascending aorta or subclavian artery or for percutaneous placement via the femoral artery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/short-term-mechanical-circulatory-assist-devices/abstract/2,3\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,3</a>]. In a study of 24 patients who received a surgically implanted Impella device for post-cardiotomy failure, mortality was 54 percent, comparable to that seen in a cohort of high-risk patients supported with an IABP [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/short-term-mechanical-circulatory-assist-devices/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. </p><p>The PROTECT II trial was designed to compare outcomes in over 600 symptomatic patients with complex three-vessel or unprotected left main coronary artery disease and severely depressed left ventricular function (left ventricular ejection fraction &le;35 percent) who were to be randomly assigned to an Impella (version 2.5) or an IABP [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/short-term-mechanical-circulatory-assist-devices/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].

Blood is pumped from the left atrium to the ileofemoral system and is used in patients with very poor left ventricular function. A centrifugal pump that contains a spinning impeller is used in this device. Adequate right ventricular function is necessary for optimal performance of the Tandem Heart. The device is approved for use by the United States Food and Drug administration for six hours of support and by the European Commission for up to 30 days. </p><p>The role of this device for short-term stabilization until recovery of jeopardized myocardium or as a bridge to definite surgical treatment was evaluated in 18 patients with cardiogenic shock due to a myocardial infarction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/short-term-mechanical-circulatory-assist-devices/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].

The pulmonary circulation is bypassed and oxygenated blood returns to the patient via an arterial or venous route. With veno-venous bypass, ECMO is effective primarily as a therapeutic option for patients with severe respiratory failure. With venoarterial bypass, an extracorporeal pump is employed to support systemic perfusion, thus providing a hemodynamic support option in patients with circulatory and respiratory failure. A MagLev centrifugal pump in combination with long-term oxygenators (CentriMag plus Maquet Quadrox or the Maquet CardioHelp) provides full cardiopulmonary support (including hemodynamic support and oxygenation of venous blood) analogous to that provided by bypass during cardiac surgery. The ECMO systems involve placement in the central arterial and venous circulation of large bore catheters that allow positioning of cannulae in the aorta and right atrium. Blood from the venous catheter is pumped through a heat exchanger and oxygenator and then returned to the systemic arterial circulation via the arterial cannula. The ECMO systems can be used for support for up to 30 days. &#160; </p><p>These ECMO systems can be initiated through percutaneous cannulation or central cannulation (in the operating room).

There are presently two centrifugal pumps available for very short-term use (less than six hours): the Bio-Medicus (Bio-Medicus Inc, Minneapolis, MN) and the Sarns <span class=\"nowrap\">(Sarns/3M</span> Ann Arbor, MI). They are used primarily for cardiopulmonary bypass during open heart cases and thus are not placed percutaneously. They cause too much hemolysis to permit long-term use. A larger discussion of cardiopulmonary bypass is found elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cardiopulmonary-bypass-management#H187957080\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Cardiopulmonary bypass: Management&quot;, section on 'General principles'</a>.)</p><p>There are currently two magnetically levitated centrifugal pumps approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration for ventricular assistance (Thoratec CentriMag and TandemHeart). One example of their use is right ventricular support at the time of left ventricular assist device (LVAD) placement. The Maquet Rotaflow is also magnetically levitated and can be used long or short term but is United States Food and Drug Administration-approved only for use in cardiopulmonary bypass during open heart procedures. The magnetic levitated pumps cause less trauma, less heat generation, and are standard of care for short-term VAD support. They can be implanted for long periods of time (up to four months). They have the capability of supporting patients who cannot be weaned from cardiopulmonary bypass, those in cardiogenic shock, or who are awaiting cardiac transplantation. The pumps are versatile and can be used as a right ventricular assist device (RVAD), LVAD, or biventricular support.</p><p>Insertion of centrifugal pumps, especially for long-term use, generally requires a sternotomy. The right <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> left atrium can be cannulated by using simple purse string sutures. The aorta <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> the pulmonary artery are cannulated by using standard cardiopulmonary bypass aorta cannulae placed through a purse string suture. For long-term use, sewn grafts to the aorta or pulmonary artery are preferred. With appropriate cannulae, these devices can also be placed percutaneously in the catheterization laboratory. For instance, the TandemHeart system has special left atrial and pulmonary arterial cannulae that permit use for percutaneous LVAD or RVAD support.</p><p>Centrifugal pumps have several important caveats:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Flow is nonpulsatile, which may be reflected in poor microcirculation perfusion and reduced end-organ function (eg, renal dysfunction).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The magnetically levitated devices are generally well tolerated and cause a minimal amount of hemolysis and generalized inflammatory response. The devices themselves perform well; most of the complications occur due to the method of cannulation whether percutaneous or open. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>An important potential complication of these devices is clot formation. The main source of problematic clots is at the tips of the cannulae and not the devices themselves. These clots can lead to arterial embolization or inflow occlusion. Patients with centrifugal pumps should be maintained on continuous intravenous heparin anticoagulation, which is begun as soon as the initial bleeding subsides and continued until device removal.
