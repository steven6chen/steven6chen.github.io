Furthermore, if an HIV-infected woman is already receiving a suppressive elvitegravir-cobicistat-containing regimen when she becomes pregnant, we suggest switching to a different regimen; if elvitegravir-cobicistat is continued, the potential risks and need for close viral monitoring should be discussed.

A recent meta-analysis reported that TDF increased neonatal mortality, and an accompanying British Medical Journal clinical practice guideline thus suggested <a href=\"topic.htm?path=zidovudine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">zidovudine</a> rather than TDF for HIV-infected pregnant women [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/whats-new-in-infectious-diseases/abstract/18,19\" class=\"abstract_t\">18,19</a>].

We suggest RZV rather than ZVL for most patients who meet criteria for vaccination. RZV appears to provide greater protection against herpes zoster, and there is less concern for waning immunity.

Disadvantages of RZV are the need for two doses (versus one with ZVL), and an increased risk of mild to moderate side effects (pain at the injection site, myalgia, fatigue, headache, fever) that typically resolve in one to three days. These factors rarely prevent patients from completing the RZV series. For patients who previously received ZVL, we suggest revaccination with RZV.

As a result, infection can be transmitted through sneezing and coughing and is thought to be via both large droplets and small particle aerosols. A study suggested that it may also be possible to transmit influenza by small aerosols that are released into the air during breathing [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/whats-new-in-infectious-diseases/abstract/54\" class=\"abstract_t\">54</a>]. In this study, infectious virus was recovered by culture from 39 percent of fine aerosol samples collected from breath samples. Sneezing and coughing were not necessary for infectious aerosol generation.

Influenza vaccine effectiveness against H3N2 viruses has been low, estimated at 32 percent during the 2016 to 2017 season in the United States and only 10 percent during the 2017 season in Australia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/whats-new-in-infectious-diseases/abstract/56,57\" class=\"abstract_t\">56,57</a>]. For these reasons, influenza should be high on clinicians' lists of possible diagnoses for ill patients, and the use of antiviral medications is even more important than usual in limiting the morbidity associated with influenza. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-seasonal-influenza-in-adults#H2855203171\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of seasonal influenza in adults&quot;, section on 'Antiviral therapy'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=seasonal-influenza-vaccination-in-adults#H949368384\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Seasonal influenza vaccination in adults&quot;, section on 'Low effectiveness in the Southern Hemisphere during the 2017 season'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H116211\"><span class=\"h2\">Screening for hepatitis B virus infection (January 2018)</span></p><p>In the United States, an estimated 847,000 persons are living with chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection. In a recent best practice statement, the American College of Physicians and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention advised HBV testing in patients with elevated aminotransferases and in asymptomatic individuals at high risk for exposure or severe adverse outcomes with a missed diagnosis (eg, those requiring immunosuppressive therapy) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F55052\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef55052 \">table 4</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/whats-new-in-infectious-diseases/abstract/58\" class=\"abstract_t\">58</a>]. Screening allows for vaccination of high-risk uninfected individuals and linkage to appropriate medical care for patients with chronic infection or risk for reactivation of resolved infection. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hepatitis-b-virus-screening-and-diagnosis#H3644755507\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Hepatitis B virus: Screening and diagnosis&quot;, section on 'Asymptomatic patients'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H115969\"><span class=\"h2\">Prevalence of oropharyngeal HPV infection in the United States (December 2017)</span></p><p>Although less prevalent than genital infection, oropharyngeal human papillomavirus (HPV) infection is common in the United States and disproportionately occurs in men. In a large cross-sectional study of men and women who provided an oral rinse sample for HPV DNA sampling, the prevalence among men was 12 percent for any HPV type and 7 percent for high-risk HPV types (in contrast to 3 and 1.4 percent among women) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/whats-new-in-infectious-diseases/abstract/59\" class=\"abstract_t\">59</a>]. Prevalence of high-risk HPV infection was especially high (22 percent) among men reporting two or more lifetime same-sex oral sex partners. These findings are consistent with the observed distribution of HPV-associated oropharyngeal cancer. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=human-papillomavirus-infections-epidemiology-and-disease-associations#H3550551442\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Human papillomavirus infections: Epidemiology and disease associations&quot;, section on 'Epidemiology of oropharyngeal infection'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H115483\"><span class=\"h2\">Updated guidance for fetal ultrasound surveillance for congenital Zika virus syndrome (November 2017)</span></p><p>Prenatal ultrasound is used to screen for congenital Zika virus infection, although the sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative predictive values are not well established, and optimal timing between exposure and initial and follow-up sonographic screening are unknown. A common protocol is to perform an initial ultrasound examination four weeks from the suspected exposure, followed by serial ultrasound examinations every four weeks, ensuring that at least one ultrasound is performed between 28 and 33 weeks of gestation. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has updated its guidance for women with laboratory evidence of infection and now states that clinicians may consider extending the time interval between follow-up ultrasound examinations in accordance with patient preferences and clinical judgment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/whats-new-in-infectious-diseases/abstract/60\" class=\"abstract_t\">60</a>]. In women with possible exposure during pregnancy but no laboratory evidence of infection, ultrasound screening beyond that obtained for routine prenatal care is no longer recommended. We agree with these recommendations.

Newer tests include rapid molecular assays using nucleic acid amplification and digital immunoassays (DIAs) using automated antigen detection. Both provide results more quickly than conventional RT-PCR and have higher sensitivity than traditional antigen detection tests. In a meta-analysis that compared various influenza assays with conventional RT-PCR for influenza A, the pooled sensitivities of rapid molecular assays and DIAs were 92 and 80 percent, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/whats-new-in-infectious-diseases/abstract/61\" class=\"abstract_t\">61</a>]. Both had higher sensitivity than traditional rapid antigen tests (sensitivity 54 percent). If available, a rapid molecular assay can be used as an alternative to conventional RT-PCR.

They recommend confirmatory stool culture and susceptibility testing when culture-independent diagnostic tests are positive for clinically important bacterial pathogens. They highlight the need for careful interpretation of multiplex molecular panels, which simultaneously test for multiple organisms by detecting genetic material, do not always indicate infection with a viable organism, and frequently identify more than one potential pathogen. The guidelines also emphasize reserving empiric antibiotic therapy for select patients, including those with severe illness or immunocompromising conditions. Our approach is generally consistent with these guidelines.
