The severity of the disorder ranges from small patches of alopecia on any hair-bearing area to the complete loss of scalp, eyebrow, eyelash, and body hair.</p><p>Although up to 50 percent of patients who present with patchy alopecia areata experience spontaneous hair regrowth within one year, most will relapse [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-alopecia-areata/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. The unpredictable course of the disease and the psychological distress associated with hair loss prompt many patients to seek therapy. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-alopecia-areata#H13\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of alopecia areata&quot;, section on 'Course of disease'</a>.)</p><p>The management of alopecia areata involves both addressing the psychological needs of the patient and offering treatment to patients who desire intervention. A variety of topical, intralesional, and systemic agents, as well as devices, have been used for alopecia areata, but the response to treatment varies widely, and few well-designed clinical trials have evaluated these therapies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-alopecia-areata/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p>Options for the management of alopecia areata will be discussed here. The clinical manifestations and diagnosis of the disorder are reviewed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-alopecia-areata\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of alopecia areata&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">FIRST-LINE THERAPIES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Based upon the relative safety and the available, although limited, evidence for the efficacy of these agents, intralesional or topical corticosteroids are the initial treatment for most patients with patchy alopecia areata [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-alopecia-areata/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Topical immunotherapy can be used as first-line treatment for patients with extensive disease (greater than 50 percent scalp hair loss).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Intralesional corticosteroids</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>We suggest intralesional corticosteroids as the preferred therapy for adults with isolated patches of hair loss who desire treatment.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h3\">Efficacy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There are no randomized trials of intralesional corticosteroids for alopecia areata. One study reported regrowth of tufts of hair at 33 of 34 sites injected with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=triamcinolone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">triamcinolone</a> hexacetonide in 11 patients and at 16 of 25 sites injected with triamcinolone acetonide in 17 patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-alopecia-areata/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Another study reported complete regrowth of hair after four months in 40 of 62 patients (63 percent) treated with monthly injections of triamcinolone acetonide [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-alopecia-areata/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h3\">Administration</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Intralesional injections should be performed on both existing and newly forming patches of alopecia. The goals of treatment are to promote regrowth and limit hair loss. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=intralesional-injection\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Intralesional injection&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The affected area may be pretreated with a topical anesthetic cream (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lidocaine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">lidocaine</a> 2.5% and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prilocaine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">prilocaine</a> 2.5% EMLA cream). The cream is applied generously, and is placed under occlusion with a tightly fitting shower cap or plastic wrap 1.5 to 2 hours before treatment. The cream is removed immediately before injection.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><a href=\"topic.htm?path=triamcinolone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Triamcinolone</a> 2.5 to 5.0 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/mL</span> is injected into the upper subcutis on the face for eyebrow or beard involvement; concentrations of 5 to 10 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/mL</span> are injected into the upper subcutis on the scalp. Small volumes (0.1 mL or less) are injected into multiple sites 1 cm apart (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F80429\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef80429 \">picture 1</a>). The dose per visit is largely determined by the extent of disease and patient tolerance but is usually around 20 mg or less on the scalp. The dose of triamcinolone administered should not exceed 40 mg per treatment session. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>New growth is usually visible within six to eight weeks. The treatment may be repeated as necessary every four to six weeks, and is stopped once regrowth is complete. If there is no response after six months, treatment should be discontinued [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-alopecia-areata/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>] and alternative treatments may be attempted. </p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h3\">Adverse effects</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Local skin atrophy is a consistent side effect but usually resolves within a few months. Other cutaneous side effects include telangiectasias and hypopigmentation. Facial injection should be approached cautiously, particularly in patients with pigmented skin, in whom hypopigmentation can be prominent. Non-dermatologists should consider referring patients who need facial injections to a dermatologist. The risk for adrenal suppression in patients treated with intralesional corticosteroid injections into the skin has not been formally studied [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-alopecia-areata/abstract/6-8\" class=\"abstract_t\">6-8</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=intralesional-injection#H7\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Intralesional injection&quot;, section on 'Side effects, complications, and pitfalls'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=general-principles-of-dermatologic-therapy-and-topical-corticosteroid-use#H16\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;General principles of dermatologic therapy and topical corticosteroid use&quot;, section on 'Side effects'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h3\">For extensive disease</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients with extensive disease are less frequently treated with intralesional corticosteroids due to concern for lower efficacy in this subgroup and the large number of injections required. One retrospective study reported superior efficacy of topical immunotherapy over intralesional corticosteroids for patients with patches of hair loss exceeding 50 cm<sup>2</sup> in size [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-alopecia-areata/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].</p><p>Still, some patients with extensive disease respond to treatment. In one case series, 6 out of 10 patients with greater than 50 percent scalp hair loss responded well to intralesional corticosteroid therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-alopecia-areata/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. Pain of injection was managed with topical anesthetics. None of the patients in this study exhibited clinical signs of adrenal insufficiency; however, laboratory assessment for adrenal suppression was not performed.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h2\">Potent topical corticosteroids</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>While potent topical corticosteroids are frequently used to treat alopecia areata, evidence for their effectiveness is limited. We usually reserve first-line therapy with topical corticosteroids for children and adults who cannot tolerate intralesional injections. (See <a href=\"#H34\" class=\"local\">'Considerations for the treatment of children'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h3\">Efficacy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Examples of studies investigating the efficacy of topical corticosteroids for alopecia areata include the following:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A trial in 70 patients with patchy alopecia areata randomly assigned patients to apply either 0.25% <a href=\"topic.htm?path=desoximetasone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">desoximetasone</a> cream or placebo twice daily [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-alopecia-areata/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. After 12 weeks of therapy, a non-statistically significant greater number of patients treated with desoximetasone experienced complete regrowth of hair (58 versus 39 percent, relative risk 1.5, 95% CI 0.83-2.59). More patients treated with the corticosteroid experienced at least mild improvement and this result did achieve statistical significance. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A 12-week randomized trial in which 105 patients with localized alopecia areata were randomized to treatment with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=betamethasone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">betamethasone</a> valerate 0.1% foam applied twice daily, intralesional <a href=\"topic.htm?path=triamcinolone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">triamcinolone</a> acetonide (10 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/mL)</span> administered every three weeks, or topical <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tacrolimus-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">tacrolimus</a> 0.1% ointment applied twice daily found &gt;75 percent hair regrowth in 54, 60, and 0 percent of patients, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-alopecia-areata/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. Of note, 27 patients dropped out of the study prior to completion and were not included in the analysis of data.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A trial in 34 patients with moderate to severe alopecia areata randomly assigned treatment with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clobetasol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">clobetasol</a> propionate 0.05% foam to one side of the scalp and vehicle to the other side [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-alopecia-areata/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. After 12 weeks of treatment, more sites treated with clobetasol had at least 50 percent regrowth of hair (7 of 34 versus 1 of 34).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><a href=\"topic.htm?path=clobetasol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Clobetasol</a> propionate applied under an occlusive dressing may be effective in some patients. In a study of 28 patients who had alopecia totalis and alopecia universalis for a mean duration of seven years, clobetasol propionate 0.05% ointment applied under an occlusive plastic film on six out of seven nights for six months resulted in long-term hair regrowth in five patients (17.8 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-alopecia-areata/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. The study initially had patients use the treatment on only one side of the scalp, and no hair regrowth occurred on the untreated side.</p><p/><p>The low response rate seen in the last two studies may reflect the greater severity of disease in the patients enrolled. </p><p>Preferential use of a potent topical corticosteroid is supported by the findings of a 24-week randomized trial performed in 41 children with alopecia areata involving at least 10 percent of the scalp surface area. The trial found that twice daily treatment with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clobetasol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">clobetasol</a> propionate 0.05% cream (a high potency topical corticosteroid) for two six-week cycles separated by six weeks was more effective for decreasing the area of scalp hair loss than <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hydrocortisone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">hydrocortisone</a> 1% cream (a low potency topical corticosteroid) administered via the same regimen [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-alopecia-areata/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. After 24 weeks, 85 percent of children treated with clobetasol propionate had at least a 50 percent reduction in the surface area with hair loss compared with only 33 percent of children treated with hydrocortisone. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h3\">Administration</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>We typically treat with a high potency topical corticosteroid such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=betamethasone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">betamethasone</a> dipropionate 0.05% (cream, lotion, ointment) applied to affected areas and 1 cm beyond twice daily (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F62402\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef62402 \">table 1</a>). The entire scalp is treated if a large area is involved. Therapy should be evaluated after three months of use.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h3\">Adverse effects</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Similar to intralesional corticosteroids, side effects of topical therapy include local skin atrophy, telangiectasias, hypopigmentation, and adrenal suppression. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=general-principles-of-dermatologic-therapy-and-topical-corticosteroid-use#H16\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;General principles of dermatologic therapy and topical corticosteroid use&quot;, section on 'Side effects'</a>.)</p><p>Application under occlusion increases the potency of topical corticosteroids. Given the potential for increasing side effects, we do not recommend this method of application in the absence of additional studies demonstrating safety and long-term efficacy.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h2\">Topical immunotherapy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Topical immunotherapy is probably the most effective treatment for patients with extensive or recurrent scalp involvement [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-alopecia-areata/abstract/1,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,9</a>]. The procedure is usually performed by dermatologists. </p><p>A potent contact allergen is applied weekly to the scalp to precipitate an allergic contact dermatitis. The resultant mild inflammatory reaction is associated with hair regrowth [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-alopecia-areata/abstract/16,17\" class=\"abstract_t\">16,17</a>]. The reason for this response remains unknown, but an immunomodulatory effect on the inflammatory infiltrate surrounding affected hair follicles is thought to play a role. Theories for the mechanism of action have focused on the inhibition of the pathologic immune response via antigenic competition [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-alopecia-areata/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>], the induction of lymphocyte apoptosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-alopecia-areata/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>], or an effect on the type or function of lymphocytes in the inflammatory infiltrate [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-alopecia-areata/abstract/20-22\" class=\"abstract_t\">20-22</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14\"><span class=\"h3\">Efficacy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Uncontrolled studies have found variable rates of response, but as many as 40 to 60 percent of patients may achieve cosmetically significant hair regrowth [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-alopecia-areata/abstract/16,23-26\" class=\"abstract_t\">16,23-26</a>]. Patients with severe or long-standing disease may be less likely to respond to topical immunotherapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-alopecia-areata/abstract/16,27,28\" class=\"abstract_t\">16,27,28</a>]. Relapse rates are approximately 60 percent, with a mean time to relapse of 2.5 years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-alopecia-areata/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15\"><span class=\"h3\">Administration</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Topical immunotherapy can be performed with diphenylcyclopropenone (DPCP), squaric acid dibutyl ester (SADBE), or dinitrochlorobenzene (DNCB). DNCB was the first topical sensitizer used for the treatment of alopecia areata, but is now infrequently used due to concerns that it may be mutagenic [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-alopecia-areata/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. The agents for topical immunotherapy are typically purchased from a chemical distributor. The solutions are subsequently prepared by a pharmacy or the clinician. Careful handling during preparation and treatment is essential to avoid inadvertent contact with the skin that results in sensitization of pharmacists or clinicians.</p><p>When both agents are available, DPCP is often favored over SADBE because it is less expensive and more stable in solution. SADBE must be refrigerated. DPCP is degraded by light, and should be stored in an amber glass bottle or another protective container.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Topical immunotherapy with DPCP begins with the application of a 2% solution to a small (eg, 4x4 cm) area, usually on the scalp, to sensitize the patient [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-alopecia-areata/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. One to two weeks later, treatment is initiated with the application of a 0.001% concentration of the allergen to the affected areas.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients should be instructed to wash off DPCP after 24 to 48 hours. While the product is on the skin, the treated areas should be protected from sun exposure with an opaque scarf or hat.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients who exhibit a severe eczematous response to sensitization, an additional week should pass before starting treatment, and an even lower initial concentration of DPCP should be used.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Treatments are usually repeated once weekly with slowly increasing concentrations of DPCP to a maximum concentration of 2%. The concentration that induces a mild dermatitis is utilized for all subsequent treatments.</p><p/><p>Signs of hair growth are expected by approximately three months, and the frequency of treatment is reduced once maximal hair growth is attained [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-alopecia-areata/abstract/3,27\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,27</a>]. Most clinicians discontinue therapy if there is no response after six months [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-alopecia-areata/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]; however, improvement requiring longer courses of DPCP therapy has been reported [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-alopecia-areata/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. Further study is necessary to confirm the results of a retrospective study that suggest that combination therapy with DPCP and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=anthralin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">anthralin</a> is more effective than DPCP monotherapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-alopecia-areata/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H19\" class=\"local\">'Anthralin'</a> below.)</p><p>The procedure for sensitization and treatment with SADBE is similar. Sensitization is performed with a 2% solution, and is followed by weekly 24 hour applications of the agent. Treatment begins with a low concentration solution (such as 0.0001%) that is increased until mild dermatitis is elicited. Further study is necessary to confirm the findings of a small retrospective study that suggest an initial eczematous reaction to sensitization is not always necessary for successful treatment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-alopecia-areata/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>]. Opinions vary on whether patients should be allowed to apply SADBE at home [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-alopecia-areata/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H16\"><span class=\"h3\">Adverse effects</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Severe dermatitis is a potential side effect of topical immunotherapy. If a vesicular or bullous reaction occurs, the contact allergen should be washed from the skin and treatment with a topical corticosteroid should be initiated. Other potential side effects include lymphadenopathy, urticaria, vitiligo, and dyschromia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-alopecia-areata/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].

Not all patients with alopecia areata require treatment; up to 50 percent of patients with limited alopecia areata of less than one year's duration will experience spontaneous regrowth of hair. (See <a href=\"#H1\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The cosmetic effects of alopecia areata can cause severe emotional distress; counseling in such patients is essential. (See <a href=\"#H550499604\" class=\"local\">'Counseling'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>There is relatively little evidence on treatment from well-designed clinical trials. The response to treatment is variable, and some patients may elect not to treat this condition. For patients who desire treatment, we suggest the following:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>We suggest that localized scalp alopecia areata be treated with intralesional injections of corticosteroids (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=5\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2B</a>). (See <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Intralesional corticosteroids'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>In children or adults with limited disease who are unlikely to tolerate intralesional therapy, we suggest treatment with topical corticosteroids (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=5\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2B</a>). (See <a href=\"#H9\" class=\"local\">'Potent topical corticosteroids'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>If intradermal or topical corticosteroid therapy produces an inadequate response, we suggest a trial of topical 5% <a href=\"topic.htm?path=minoxidil-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">minoxidil</a> either alone or in combination with continued corticosteroid therapy (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=5\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2B</a>). (See <a href=\"#H18\" class=\"local\">'Minoxidil'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>We suggest that patients with extensive alopecia areata, including alopecia totalis, as well as patients with more limited disease who do not respond to the above therapies be treated with topical immunotherapy (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=5\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2B</a>). Patients should generally be referred to a dermatologist for such therapy and any additional management. (See <a href=\"#H13\" class=\"local\">'Topical immunotherapy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>In patients with extensive disease who have failed topical immunotherapy or when such therapy is contraindicated, another option is photochemotherapy. Long-term photochemotherapy should be avoided. (See <a href=\"#H20\" class=\"local\">'Photochemotherapy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Systemic glucocorticoid therapy may induce hair regrowth, and short courses of treatment are occasionally utilized to temporarily halt disease progression in patients with widespread active disease. The potential adverse effects of systemic glucocorticoids make them unfavorable options for long-term management. (See <a href=\"#H22\" class=\"local\">'Oral glucocorticoids'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients who do not desire treatment may benefit from cosmetic interventions. Wigs (particularly in women) and shaving the scalp (in men) may produce an acceptable cosmetic result. Temporary tattooing can be helpful for loss of eyebrows. False eyelashes are available for patients with alopecia of the eyelashes.
