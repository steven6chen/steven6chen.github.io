There are three main subtypes of PCBCL:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Primary cutaneous follicle center lymphoma (PCFCL)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Primary cutaneous large B cell lymphoma (PCLBCL), leg type </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Primary cutaneous marginal zone lymphoma (PCMZL), included in the broader category of extranodal marginal zone B cell lymphoma</p><p/><p>These appear to be unique entities with differing clinical presentation, pathologic features, prognosis, and treatment approach. This topic review will discuss primary cutaneous large B cell lymphoma (PCLBCL), leg type.</p><p>Initially, patients with this type of lymphoma were classified as PCFCL. Because of their characteristic clinical features (presentation on the legs, older age at diagnosis, intermediate prognosis), that were different from those of PCFCL (presentation on head or trunk, excellent prognosis), they were included as a separate group, designated PCLBCL of the leg, in the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) classification for primary cutaneous lymphomas [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-cutaneous-large-b-cell-lymphoma-leg-type/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. In the 2001 World Health Organization (WHO) classification, both PCLBCL of the leg and PCFCL with a diffuse growth pattern were included in the general diffuse large B cell lymphoma category. In the WHO-EORTC classification 2005 it was recognized that these PCLBCL presenting on the legs were a distinct disease entity. Since cases with similar morphology (predominance or cohesive sheets of centroblasts and immunoblasts), immunophenotype (strong expression of BCL2 and MUM1) and prognosis, may arise at other sites than the legs, in the WHO-EORTC classification, and subsequently in the 2008 and revised 2016 WHO classification [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-cutaneous-large-b-cell-lymphoma-leg-type/abstract/2,3\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,3</a>], the term PCLBCL, leg type was preferred for both lesions on the legs and similar lesions at other skin sites.</p><p>The other PCBCL subtypes and other forms of cutaneous lymphoma (ie, T cell lymphoma) are presented separately.

The skin is the second most common primary extranodal site, second in frequency only to the gastrointestinal tract [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-cutaneous-large-b-cell-lymphoma-leg-type/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. The overall incidence of primary cutaneous lymphomas in Western countries is estimated to be 0.5 to 1 case per 100,000 people annually, of which approximately 20 percent represent primary cutaneous B cell lymphoma (PCBCL) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-cutaneous-large-b-cell-lymphoma-leg-type/abstract/5,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,6</a>].</p><p>Primary cutaneous large B cell lymphoma (PCLBCL), leg type comprises approximately 4 percent of all cutaneous lymphomas and 20 percent of all primary cutaneous B cell lymphomas [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-cutaneous-large-b-cell-lymphoma-leg-type/abstract/5,7,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,7,8</a>]. The median age at presentation is in the mid to late seventies and is more common in females than in males with a male:female ratio of 1:3 to 4 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-cutaneous-large-b-cell-lymphoma-leg-type/abstract/7,9-12\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,9-12</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">PATHOGENESIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There are no clearly defined risk factors for developing this disease and there is no identifiable hereditary tendency.</p><p>Primary cutaneous large B cell lymphoma (PCLBCL), leg type shows many genetic similarities with diffuse large B cell lymphomas arising at other sites, but marked differences with primary cutaneous follicle center lymphoma (PCFCL). Interphase FISH analysis frequently shows translocations involving <em>MYC, BCL6 </em>and<em> IgH</em> genes in PCLBCL, leg type, but not in patients with a PCFCL [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-cutaneous-large-b-cell-lymphoma-leg-type/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>].<sup> </sup>Using array-based CGH and FISH analyses, high-level DNA amplifications of 18q21.31 to 18q21.33, including the <em>BCL2 </em>and<em> MALT1</em> genes, were detected in 67 percent of the cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-cutaneous-large-b-cell-lymphoma-leg-type/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. Amplification of the <em>BCL2</em> gene may well explain the strong BCL2 expression in these cases, particularly because the t(14;18) is not found in these lymphomas. Deletion of a small region on chromosome 9p21.3 containing the CDKN2A and CDKN2B gene loci has been reported in 67 percent of PCLBCL, leg type, and is associated with an inferior prognosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-cutaneous-large-b-cell-lymphoma-leg-type/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. PCLBCL, leg type have the gene expression profile of activated B cell-like diffuse large B cell lymphomas, while diffuse PCFCL have the gene expression profile of germinal center-like diffuse large B cell lymphomas [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-cutaneous-large-b-cell-lymphoma-leg-type/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>].</p><p>Genetics studies have reported <em>MYD88</em> L265P mutations (60 percent), and mutations in different components of the B cell receptor signalling pathway, including <em>CARD11</em> (10 percent), <em>CD79B</em> (20 percent), and <em><span class=\"nowrap\">TNFAIP3/A20</em></span> (40 percent) that all strongly suggest constitutive NF-kB activation in PCLBCL, leg type [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-cutaneous-large-b-cell-lymphoma-leg-type/abstract/17-20\" class=\"abstract_t\">17-20</a>]. The similarities in gene expression profile and cytogenetic alterations, including translocations and NF-kB activating mutations, underscore that PCLBCL, leg type may be considered as the cutaneous counterpart of ABC-type diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-cutaneous-large-b-cell-lymphoma-leg-type/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL FEATURES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Most patients present with red or bluish nodules or tumors on one or both legs, preferentially the lower legs (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F68920%7EHEME%2F79655\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef68920 graphicRef79655 \">picture 1A-B</a>).

Unlike other cutaneous B cell lymphomas, these tumors frequently disseminate to extracutaneous sites.</p><p>The presence of &quot;B&quot; symptoms, abnormal blood counts, or an elevated lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) should raise suspicion of a systemic lymphoma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-cutaneous-large-b-cell-lymphoma-leg-type/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h1\">PATHOLOGIC FEATURES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The diagnosis of primary cutaneous large B cell lymphoma (PCLBCL), leg type is made based upon a pathologic evaluation of a skin biopsy in a patient who has no evidence of systemic lymphoma upon staging studies.

These infiltrates generally show a monotonous population or large confluent sheets of centroblasts (large follicle center cells with round nuclei and prominent nucleoli) and immunoblasts that spare the epidermis (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F58187\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef58187 \">picture 2</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F90915\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef90915 \">picture 3</a>). Frequent mitotic figures can be seen.

At this time flow cytometry cannot be routinely recommended as a replacement for immunohistochemical studies. This is principally because of the difficulty associated with making a single-cell suspension with this tumor type.</p><p>The normal counterpart of PCLBCL, leg type is unclear, although it has a gene expression profile similar to an activated (post-germinal center) B cell [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-cutaneous-large-b-cell-lymphoma-leg-type/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. The neoplastic cells express B cell markers (eg, CD19, CD20, CD22, and CD79a) and may express surface or cytoplasmic monotypic immunoglobulin (Ig). One study has demonstrated cytoplasmic IgM expression by the tumor cells in all 40 cases of PCLBCL, leg type, but in only 5 of 53 PCFCL [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-cutaneous-large-b-cell-lymphoma-leg-type/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. In a subsequent study, cytoplasmic IgM was expressed by all cases of PCLBCL, leg type, but not in any of the cases of primary cutaneous follicle center lymphoma (PCFCL) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-cutaneous-large-b-cell-lymphoma-leg-type/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. Clonal rearrangement of Ig genes has been demonstrated.</p><p>In contrast to (diffuse) PCFCL, BCL2, MUM1, and FOXP1 protein expression is common (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F78894\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef78894 \">picture 4</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F90915\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef90915 \">picture 3</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-cutaneous-large-b-cell-lymphoma-leg-type/abstract/11,24,25\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,24,25</a>], although the chromosomal translocation t(14;18) which often leads to BCL2 overexpression is not commonly seen [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-cutaneous-large-b-cell-lymphoma-leg-type/abstract/24,26\" class=\"abstract_t\">24,26</a>]. However, up to 10 percent of cases may not express BCL2, MUM1, or FOXP1. BCL6 is frequently positive [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-cutaneous-large-b-cell-lymphoma-leg-type/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. CD10 staining is usually negative. PCLBCL, leg type, but not PCFCL, shows strong nuclear expression of MYC [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-cutaneous-large-b-cell-lymphoma-leg-type/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. However, there is no correlation between MYC expression and <em>MYC</em> rearrangements; <em>MYC</em> translocations have been demonstrated in only a minority of PCLBCL, leg type [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-cutaneous-large-b-cell-lymphoma-leg-type/abstract/13,18\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,18</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h1\">DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The diagnosis of PCLBCL, leg type requires a representative biopsy. Excisional biopsies are preferred to punch biopsies, but if a punch biopsy is taken, the diameter should be at least 4 millimeters. The biopsy specimen is evaluated for morphology, growth pattern, and immunohistochemical studies. Immunohistochemical studies should be performed on paraffin sections and include testing for BCL2, MUM1, MYC, and both IgM and Ig light chains. We also perform immunohistochemical staining for FOXP1, when available. We do not routinely perform fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) studies on suspected cases of PCLBCL, leg type. </p><p>Importantly, lesions with this characteristic appearance are classified as PCLBCL, leg type regardless of their anatomic location.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12556659\"><span class=\"h1\">DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h2\">Systemic lymphoma</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>An estimated 6 to 10 percent of patients with systemic B cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma will develop cutaneous disease at some point in their illness [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-cutaneous-large-b-cell-lymphoma-leg-type/abstract/28,29\" class=\"abstract_t\">28,29</a>]. They key to differentiating systemic diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL) from PCLBCL is a thorough staging evaluation. (See <a href=\"#H16\" class=\"local\">'Staging'</a> below and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-pathologic-features-and-diagnosis-of-diffuse-large-b-cell-lymphoma#H12\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Epidemiology, clinical manifestations, pathologic features, and diagnosis of diffuse large B cell lymphoma&quot;, section on 'Diagnosis'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h2\">Primary cutaneous follicle center lymphoma</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>PCFCL may show a follicular (less than 5 percent), follicular and diffuse (30 percent), or diffuse growth pattern (65 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-cutaneous-large-b-cell-lymphoma-leg-type/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. In particular, differentiation between diffuse PCFCL and PCLBCL, leg type may sometimes be difficult, but is extremely important because of the therapeutic and prognostic consequences. Differentiation should always be based on a combination of histological, immunophenotypical, and clinical criteria (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F90908\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef90908 \">table 1</a>). In contrast to PCLBCL, leg type, PCFCL characteristically show a proliferation of large cleaved cells (large centrocytes), which generally do not express BCL2, MUM1, FOXP1, MYC, and cytoplasmic IgM, and in 85 percent of patients present with localized skin lesions on the head (in particular the scalp) or trunk. Additional histological criteria favoring a diagnosis of PCFCL include a considerable proportion of admixed T cells, the presence of a stromal reaction and demonstration of (remnants of) follicular dendritic cell networks.

Aberrant expression of B cell markers (CD20, CD79a) can occasionally be found in advanced stages of mycosis fungoides and may raise confusion. In such cases, lineage analysis by immunoglobulin or T cell receptor (<em>TCR</em>) gene rearrangement studies may facilitate a correct diagnosis. This is discussed in more detail separately.

These lymphoproliferative disorders commonly involve extranodal sites, including the skin. Diffuse large B cell lymphoma is the most common histology in this setting. Primary cutaneous large B cell lymphomas that develop in this setting often express CD20 and CD30 (but not CD15) and variably demonstrate positivity for Epstein-Barr virus [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-cutaneous-large-b-cell-lymphoma-leg-type/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H16\"><span class=\"h1\">STAGING</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>At the time of diagnosis, patients with suspected primary cutaneous lymphoma should undergo a complete history, physical examination, and staging evaluation. This evaluation confirms the diagnosis of primary cutaneous lymphoma by excluding involvement of other sites, and provides information to guide treatment. This staging evaluation is described in more detail separately.

The published data regarding treatment consist entirely of retrospective reviews and anecdotal reports.</p><p>PCLBCL, leg type is widely reported to have a more aggressive clinical course than other categories of PCBCL. In contrast to PCFCL and PCMZL, which have estimated five-year survival rates of over 95 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-cutaneous-large-b-cell-lymphoma-leg-type/abstract/1,11,30\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,11,30</a>], PCLBCL, leg type has an estimated five-year survival rate of between 41 and 66 percent, with higher rates reported since the more routine incorporation of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=rituximab-intravenous-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">rituximab</a> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-cutaneous-large-b-cell-lymphoma-leg-type/abstract/9,11,12,31-33\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,11,12,31-33</a>]. While a watch and wait approach or treatment with localized therapy is often appropriate for other types of primary cutaneous B cell lymphoma, patients with PCLBCL, leg type require a more aggressive approach with combination chemotherapy.</p><p>Our treatment approach is largely based upon observations from the largest literature review that reported outcomes of 164 patients with PCLBCL, leg type treated with different modalities as described below [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-cutaneous-large-b-cell-lymphoma-leg-type/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>].

Restaging should consist of repeating all laboratory, clinical, and radiographic examinations used to stage the disease at presentation though we typically do not repeat a bone marrow biopsy unless there is suspicion of new bone marrow involvement such as an abnormal complete blood count.</p><p>Following the completion of therapy, restaging, and documentation of complete remission, patients are seen at periodic intervals to monitor for treatment complications and assess for possible relapse. The frequency and extent of these visits depends upon the comfort of both the patient and physician. When planning the post-treatment surveillance strategy, care should be taken to limit the number of CT scans, particularly in younger individuals, given concerns about radiation exposure and the risk for second malignancies.

The frequency of clinic visits is then decreased thereafter. We do not pursue routine radiographic restaging after a patient has attained a complete remission in order to limit the number of CT scans, particularly in younger individuals, given concerns about radiation exposure and the risk for second malignancies. Unlike systemic diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL), relapse of PCLBCL, leg type almost invariably occurs in the leg of initial involvement with or without regional lymph node involvement. More widespread nodal involvement without skin lesions is exceptional.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H19\"><span class=\"h1\">TREATMENT AT RELAPSE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Greater than half of patients will relapse. The median length of remission is largely unknown. In one large series of PCLBCL, leg type 27 of 58 patients had developed extracutaneous disease and 26 of 58 patients had died as a result of lymphoma after a median follow-up of 26 months [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-cutaneous-large-b-cell-lymphoma-leg-type/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. The overall and disease-specific five-year survival rates were 37 and 50 percent, respectively. Relapsed disease should be approached in much the same way as relapsed diffuse large B cell lymphoma. This is discussed in length separately.

Unlike other cutaneous B cell lymphomas, these tumors frequently disseminate to extracutaneous sites. Retrospective analyses have reported estimated five-year survival rates of between 41 and 66 percent, with the higher rates reported since the more routine incorporation of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=rituximab-intravenous-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">rituximab</a> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-cutaneous-large-b-cell-lymphoma-leg-type/abstract/9,11,12,31-33\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,11,12,31-33</a>].

The presence of multiple skin lesions at diagnosis is, however, a significant adverse risk factor [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-cutaneous-large-b-cell-lymphoma-leg-type/abstract/9,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,11</a>]. In analyses that included 58 patients with a PCLBCL, leg type, patients presenting with solitary, localized, or generalized skin lesions had estimated rates of five-year disease-specific survival of 75, 49, and 0 percent, respectively, and five-year overall survival of 70, 27, and 0 percent, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-cutaneous-large-b-cell-lymphoma-leg-type/abstract/11,39\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,39</a>]. Inactivation of CDKN2A either by deletion or hypermethylation and the presence of MYD88 L265P mutation has been found to be an unfavorable prognostic factor [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-cutaneous-large-b-cell-lymphoma-leg-type/abstract/15,19\" class=\"abstract_t\">15,19</a>].<sup> </sup></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H20\"><span class=\"h1\">SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Primary cutaneous B cell lymphoma (PCBCL) refers to those cases of B cell lymphoma that present in the skin when there is no evidence of extracutaneous disease at the time of diagnosis and after the completion of an initial staging evaluation. Primary cutaneous large B cell lymphoma (PCLBCL), leg type is the most aggressive form of PCBCL. (See <a href=\"#H1\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above and <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Epidemiology'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Most patients with PCLBCL, leg type present with red or bluish nodules on one or both legs (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F79655%7EHEME%2F68920\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef79655 graphicRef68920 \">picture 1A-B</a>). Ten to 15 percent will develop outside of the lower extremities. This terminology could understandably be confusing, since a patient can sometimes be diagnosed with PCLBCL, leg type without having any lesions on the leg. (See <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Clinical features'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The diagnosis of PCLBCL, leg type requires a representative biopsy of involved skin and the exclusion of non-cutaneous disease in the appropriate clinical setting. Lesions with a diffuse pattern or a monotonous proliferation of large cells with round nuclei (centroblasts and immunoblasts) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F58187\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef58187 \">picture 2</a>) and expression of BCL2 (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F78894\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef78894 \">picture 4</a>) and MUM1 are classified as PCLBCL, leg type regardless of their anatomic location. (See <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Pathologic features'</a> above and <a href=\"#H8\" class=\"local\">'Diagnosis'</a> above and <a href=\"#H12556659\" class=\"local\">'Differential diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The staging evaluation confirms the diagnosis by excluding involvement of other sites, and provides information to guide treatment. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=primary-cutaneous-follicle-center-lymphoma#H18\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Primary cutaneous follicle center lymphoma&quot;, section on 'Staging'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>PCLBCL, leg type is a rare disorder; accordingly, large trials are lacking. The published data regarding treatment consist entirely of retrospective reviews and anecdotal reports.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We treat patients with PCLBCL, leg type in a similar fashion to patients with limited stage systemic diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL). For patients with PCLBCL, leg type, we suggest treatment with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=rituximab-intravenous-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">rituximab</a> plus an anthracycline-based combination chemotherapy regimen (eg, R-CHOP) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F63586\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef63586 \">table 2</a>) followed by involved field radiation therapy rather than any of these modalities alone (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=5\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2B</a>). Given the aggressive nature of this disease, neither surgical excision nor observation is appropriate treatment modalities. (See <a href=\"#H17\" class=\"local\">'Treatment'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>More than half of patients will relapse and extracutaneous relapses are not uncommon.
