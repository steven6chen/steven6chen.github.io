The American Psychiatric Association defines premenstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD) as a severe form of PMS in which symptoms of anger, irritability, and internal tension are prominent.</p><p>The management of PMS and PMDD will be reviewed here. The epidemiology, pathogenesis, clinical manifestations, and <span class=\"nowrap\">diagnosis/differential</span> diagnosis of PMS and PMDD are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-premenstrual-syndrome-and-premenstrual-dysphoric-disorder\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of premenstrual syndrome and premenstrual dysphoric disorder&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epidemiology-and-pathogenesis-of-premenstrual-syndrome-and-premenstrual-dysphoric-disorder\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Epidemiology and pathogenesis of premenstrual syndrome and premenstrual dysphoric disorder&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H625948558\"><span class=\"h1\">GENERAL PRINCIPLES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The core symptoms of premenstrual syndrome (PMS) include affective symptoms, such as depression, irritability, and anxiety, and somatic symptoms, such as breast pain, bloating and swelling, and headache. The symptom(s) must impair functioning in some way and the symptom must remit at menses or shortly thereafter. Premenstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD) is a more severe form. The diagnostic criteria for PMS and PMDD are reviewed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-premenstrual-syndrome-and-premenstrual-dysphoric-disorder\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of premenstrual syndrome and premenstrual dysphoric disorder&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The treatment goals for patients with premenstrual disorders are to relieve symptoms and improve functional impairment. A number of lifestyle measures (exercise and relaxation techniques) and medications (selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors [SSRIs]) are effective for women with either PMS or PMDD (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F59712\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef59712 \">table 1</a>). These therapies have largely supplanted earlier approaches that had little or no scientific evidence to support their efficacy.</p><p>A clear diagnosis of PMS or PMDD should be established before treatment is considered. In particular, women must be symptom-free during the follicular phase. This can be best discerned by having a patient chart her mood and physical symptoms daily over the course of at least one, but ideally two menstrual cycles. (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F62189\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef62189 \">figure 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F86743\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef86743 \">table 2</a>).

However, it is unclear if benefits from these techniques are any more than a placebo effect.

We typically start with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fluoxetine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">fluoxetine</a> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sertraline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">sertraline</a> as these are the most extensively studied (and they are approved for use in premenstrual disorders).

Women should be informed of this possibility and tapered from medication if possible.</p><p>For some women, increasing the SSRI dose during the luteal phase is more effective than a continuous dose throughout the cycle [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-premenstrual-syndrome-and-premenstrual-dysphoric-disorder/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3671884095\"><span class=\"h3\">Regimens</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2120104886\"><span class=\"h4\">Continuous</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>SSRIs are effective for premenstrual symptoms whether taken continuously or in the luteal phase only [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-premenstrual-syndrome-and-premenstrual-dysphoric-disorder/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1839961405\"><span class=\"h4\">Luteal phase therapy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Many women prefer the luteal phase-only regimen, which is started on cycle day 14 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-premenstrual-syndrome-and-premenstrual-dysphoric-disorder/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. Therapy is typically discontinued at the onset of menses, although it may be continued for several additional days in women with a history of persistent symptoms during menses. This regimen has the advantages of being less expensive and having fewer side effects. Individual trials [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-premenstrual-syndrome-and-premenstrual-dysphoric-disorder/abstract/22,27,30,31\" class=\"abstract_t\">22,27,30,31</a>] and a meta-analysis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-premenstrual-syndrome-and-premenstrual-dysphoric-disorder/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>] have reported that SSRIs are equally effective for symptom relief whether taken continuously or only in the luteal phase.</p><p>For a woman who chooses this regimen, it is important to ensure that she is asymptomatic during the follicular phase of the cycle as she will otherwise be undertreated. Higher doses of the SSRI are needed in some women receiving luteal phase therapy to adequately treat physical symptoms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-premenstrual-syndrome-and-premenstrual-dysphoric-disorder/abstract/32,33\" class=\"abstract_t\">32,33</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1668595345\"><span class=\"h4\">Symptom-onset therapy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Intermittent therapy beginning at the point of symptom onset until the first few days of menses is effective [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-premenstrual-syndrome-and-premenstrual-dysphoric-disorder/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>].

These include nausea, headache, insomnia, and decreased libido [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-premenstrual-syndrome-and-premenstrual-dysphoric-disorder/abstract/19,35\" class=\"abstract_t\">19,35</a>]. Nausea, the most common side effect, usually resolves within 4 to 5 days and does not recur if treatment is given intermittently (luteal phase only). To minimize side effects, we suggest initiating therapy with a low dose and increasing as needed. (See <a href=\"#H1067925827\" class=\"local\">'Dosing'</a> above.)</p><p>The most problematic side effect of an SSRI may be sexual dysfunction, including diminished sexual interest, delayed orgasm, and anorgasmia. A dose reduction may not alleviate this side effect. Women should be informed that this complication may arise. Sexual function recovers after therapy is stopped. Intermittent (luteal phase) treatment may reduce these side effects. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sexual-dysfunction-caused-by-selective-serotonin-reuptake-inhibitors-ssris-management\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Sexual dysfunction caused by selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs): Management&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1514571135\"><span class=\"h2\">Response to therapy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Up to 60 to 70 percent of symptomatic women respond to an SSRI, but 30 to 40 percent of women do not respond. There are no strong predictors of response to SSRIs in women with PMDD.</p><p>A beneficial effect can be expected in the first cycle. If response is suboptimal, the dose can be increased in the subsequent cycle. However, lack of response should not be diagnosed until there is no effect after several menstrual cycles of treatment. SSRI therapy appears to be more effective for mood symptoms than somatic symptoms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-premenstrual-syndrome-and-premenstrual-dysphoric-disorder/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>].</p><p>Some women who do not respond to one SSRI may respond to a second SSRI, so it is worth attempting this switch in nonresponders. Additionally, women who do not respond completely to luteal phase therapy may benefit from daily therapy, and some women whose response is not optimal to continuous treatment may do better with luteal phase treatment.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3092578564\"><span class=\"h3\">Symptomatic improvement</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>As noted, 60 to 70 percent of women with PMDD respond to an SSRI.

We often continue therapy for one year and then discuss either a taper and discontinuation of medication or a trial of intermittent therapy. For women on intermittent therapy, they can try to stop therapy. Recurrence of symptoms is an indication that treatment should be resumed. Women with recurrent symptoms typically need treatment until they become pregnant or complete the menopausal transition.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1668742919\"><span class=\"h3\">No improvement</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>If the SSRI is ineffective, we suggest that women next try a different SSRI (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F59712\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef59712 \">table 1</a>). If a second SSRI is ineffective, we often try a third SSRI before moving to a second-line therapy.

In contrast, another randomized, placebo-controlled trial reported that alprazolam was no more effective than placebo [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-premenstrual-syndrome-and-premenstrual-dysphoric-disorder/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">The International Society for Premenstrual Disorders does <strong>not</strong> consider benzodiazepines to be an evidence-based treatment for PMDD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-premenstrual-syndrome-and-premenstrual-dysphoric-disorder/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. We agree with this assessment and therefore suggest against the <strong>routine</strong> use of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=alprazolam-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">alprazolam</a> for women with PMDD. However, if alprazolam is used, it should be strictly limited to the symptomatic luteal phase (eg, three to four days at most) and avoided in patients with a prior history of or at increased risk for drug dependence. In addition, this approach requires careful monitoring (eg, monthly follow-up for the first three months until stabilized and every three months thereafter; only three to four pills per month should be dispensed).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>If SSRIs, OCs, or SSRIs with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=alprazolam-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">alprazolam</a> are ineffective, or in women with very severe symptoms, we suggest <strong>GnRH agonist therapy</strong> with low-dose estrogen-progestin replacement.

We suggest an OC before moving to other therapies described below (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=alprazolam-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">alprazolam</a> or GnRH agonist therapy). Some women prefer to try an OC rather than an SSRI as first-line therapy, particularly if contraception is a high priority. If symptom relief with the OC monotherapy is inadequate, an SSRI can be added.</p><p>Placebo-controlled trials [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-premenstrual-syndrome-and-premenstrual-dysphoric-disorder/abstract/40,41\" class=\"abstract_t\">40,41</a>] and a meta-analysis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-premenstrual-syndrome-and-premenstrual-dysphoric-disorder/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>] suggest that an OC containing the progestin drospirenone, and use of a four- rather than seven-day pill-free interval, is more effective than placebo for symptom relief in women with PMDD. Based upon current data, for women with PMDD who also desire contraception, we suggest a drospirenone-containing OC (all available preparations have a shortened hormone-free interval). We typically start with a 3 mg <span class=\"nowrap\">drospirenone/20</span> mcg ethinyl estradiol OC with a four-day pill-free interval; if PMDD symptoms persist or if there is breakthrough bleeding that does not resolve, we increase to a 3 mg <span class=\"nowrap\">drospirenone/30</span> mcg ethinyl estradiol OC.</p><p>If PMDD symptoms do not resolve on the higher estrogen dose, drospirenone-based OC, we suggest a trial with a hormonal OC that is continuously administered. In one multicenter trial, continuous use of a combined OC containing <a href=\"topic.htm?path=levonorgestrel-systemic-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">levonorgestrel</a> (90 mcg) and ethinyl estradiol (20 mcg) was more effective than placebo for the treatment of PMDD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-premenstrual-syndrome-and-premenstrual-dysphoric-disorder/abstract/43\" class=\"abstract_t\">43</a>]. However, women taking the continuous OC experienced higher rates of vaginal bleeding than the placebo groups (similar to bleeding rates seen in other trials of continuous OCs).</p><p>The evidence for a therapeutic effect of an OC for PMDD symptoms is currently strongest for those containing drospirenone [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-premenstrual-syndrome-and-premenstrual-dysphoric-disorder/abstract/40,41,44\" class=\"abstract_t\">40,41,44</a>], but as noted, continuous administration of OCs containing <a href=\"topic.htm?path=levonorgestrel-systemic-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">levonorgestrel</a> has also been shown to have benefit for PMDD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-premenstrual-syndrome-and-premenstrual-dysphoric-disorder/abstract/43,45\" class=\"abstract_t\">43,45</a>]. This is likely due to the continuous rather than cyclic administration of hormones; continuous OCs with progestins other than levonorgestrel have not yet been studied. In addition, no head-to-head trials have been performed comparing OCs containing drospirenone to those containing other progestins.</p><p>Of concern, drospirenone may be associated with a higher risk of venous thromboembolism (VTE) than some other progestins. In 2012, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) added revised labeling to OCs containing drospirenone, stating that they may be associated with a higher risk of VTE when compared with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=levonorgestrel-systemic-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">levonorgestrel</a> and some other progestins. The FDA currently does not advise women to stop drospirenone-containing OCs, but it does suggest that an individual's risk of VTE be assessed before starting one in a new OC user. Lastly, the warning notes that the VTE risk with drospirenone is small and still lower than the risk of VTE during pregnancy. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=risks-and-side-effects-associated-with-estrogen-progestin-contraceptives#H11\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Risks and side effects associated with estrogen-progestin contraceptives&quot;, section on 'Venous thromboembolic disease'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h3\">GnRH agonists</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In women with severe symptoms who have not responded to or cannot tolerate SSRIs or OCs, we suggest gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) agonist therapy as the next step (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F59712\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef59712 \">table 1</a>). However, GnRH agonists should not be considered until the patient has first tried multiple SSRIs and an OC with a shortened pill-free interval or continuous administration.</p><p>The contributory role of ovarian steroids in the pathogenesis of PMDD led to the evaluation of GnRH agonists in this disorder (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epidemiology-and-pathogenesis-of-premenstrual-syndrome-and-premenstrual-dysphoric-disorder\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Epidemiology and pathogenesis of premenstrual syndrome and premenstrual dysphoric disorder&quot;</a>). Pulsatile secretion of GnRH normally stimulates the release of gonadotropins (follicle-stimulating hormone [FSH] and luteinizing hormone [LH]). However, when GnRH or its agonists are given continuously, gonadotropin secretion and gonadal function are suppressed (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F51212\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef51212 \">figure 2</a>) (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=physiology-of-gonadotropin-releasing-hormone\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Physiology of gonadotropin-releasing hormone&quot;</a>). The first demonstration of benefit of &quot;medical oophorectomy&quot; with a GnRH agonist in the treatment of PMS was made in a crossover study of eight patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-premenstrual-syndrome-and-premenstrual-dysphoric-disorder/abstract/46\" class=\"abstract_t\">46</a>]. This finding has subsequently been replicated by several other investigators [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-premenstrual-syndrome-and-premenstrual-dysphoric-disorder/abstract/47,48\" class=\"abstract_t\">47,48</a>].</p><p>In a meta-analysis of seven trials, GnRH agonist therapy alone was effective for PMDD. However, GnRH agonists are usually given with estrogen-progestin addback therapy to avoid menopausal symptoms and estrogen-deficiency complications such as bone loss. We typically start with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=leuprolide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">leuprolide</a> acetate 3.75 mg depot monthly injection. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=endometriosis-long-term-treatment-with-gonadotropin-releasing-hormone-agonists\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Endometriosis: Long-term treatment with gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonists&quot;</a>.)</p><p>For addback therapy, we suggest continuous daily administration of low-dose estradiol. A commonly used regimen is daily oral estradiol (1 mg) plus oral micronized <a href=\"topic.htm?path=progesterone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">progesterone</a> (100 mg). These doses are similar to those used for menopausal hormone therapy. Equivalent doses of other estrogens or progestins may also be used (estrogen equivalents: oral estradiol 1 mg = transdermal estradiol 0.05 mg = oral conjugated estrogen 0.0625 mg; progestin equivalents: oral micronized progesterone 100 mg = oral <a href=\"topic.htm?path=medroxyprogesterone-acetate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">medroxyprogesterone acetate</a> 2.5 mg). Some women may experience PMS symptoms from the progestin addback, in which case dose adjustments are necessary. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=preparations-for-menopausal-hormone-therapy#H352147478\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Preparations for menopausal hormone therapy&quot;, section on 'Dose equivalents'</a>.)</p><p>The side effects with GnRH agonist when administered alone are related to hypoestrogenism and are substantial (in particular, hot flashes and loss of bone mineral density [BMD]) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-premenstrual-syndrome-and-premenstrual-dysphoric-disorder/abstract/49\" class=\"abstract_t\">49</a>]. The long-term use of GnRH agonists is possible with estrogen-progestin addback, with no loss of BMD and with continued resolution of symptoms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-premenstrual-syndrome-and-premenstrual-dysphoric-disorder/abstract/50,51\" class=\"abstract_t\">50,51</a>].

However, it is essential that estrogen and progestin be given in a continuous regimen and not in a cyclic fashion, which may reproduce PMS.</p><p>In some reports, GnRH agonists were less effective for depressive symptoms than for irritability or physical symptoms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-premenstrual-syndrome-and-premenstrual-dysphoric-disorder/abstract/48,55\" class=\"abstract_t\">48,55</a>].
