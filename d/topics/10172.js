Lyme disease is caused by an infection with the bacteria Borrelia burgdorferi, which are carried by deer ticks. The bacteria are transmitted when a tick bites a person.</p><p>In most people, treatment with antibiotics is very effective at eliminating symptoms, preventing complications of the disease, and curing the infection. Some symptoms improve rapidly with this treatment, whereas other symptoms gradually improve over weeks to months.</p><p>This topic review discusses the treatment of Lyme disease. Separate topic reviews discuss what to do after a tick bite to prevent Lyme disease and the symptoms and diagnosis of Lyme disease. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=what-to-do-after-a-tick-bite-to-prevent-lyme-disease-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">&quot;Patient education: What to do after a tick bite to prevent Lyme disease (Beyond the Basics)&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lyme-disease-symptoms-and-diagnosis-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">&quot;Patient education: Lyme disease symptoms and diagnosis (Beyond the Basics)&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lyme-disease-prevention-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">&quot;Patient education: Lyme disease prevention (Beyond the Basics)&quot;</a>.)</p><p>More detailed information about Lyme disease is available by subscription.

The recommended treatment for Lyme disease varies depending upon the stage of disease and the types of symptoms. The rate of recovery may also vary depending upon the specific symptoms and recovery may take weeks to months after finishing antibiotic treatment.</p><p>In about 10 to 15 percent of individuals with early Lyme disease, substances released by the dying bacteria cause a brief worsening of symptoms (called a Jarisch-Herxheimer reaction). This reaction occurs within 24 hours after starting antibiotics, continues for a day or so, and then resolves. Antibiotic therapy should not be stopped if this reaction develops, but should instead continue as originally planned.</p><p>There is no evidence that the Lyme bacteria are resistant to any of the antibiotics commonly used to treat the infection. In rare cases, additional therapy beyond the recommended doses may be used for brief periods of time (typically one month). However there is <strong>no</strong> evidence that additional treatment with any antibiotic results in improvement of slowly resolving symptoms. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-lyme-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of Lyme disease&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Early localized Lyme disease</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Early localized Lyme disease (the erythema migrans rash, with or without flu-like symptoms) is treated with oral antibiotics, usually doxycycline, amoxicillin, or cefuroxime, taken daily. Doxycycline is given for 10 to 21 days, and amoxicillin and cefuroxime are given for 14 to 21 days.</p><p>Antibiotics prevent worsening of the disease and may decrease the duration and severity of symptoms. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=musculoskeletal-manifestations-of-lyme-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Musculoskeletal manifestations of Lyme disease&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Early disseminated Lyme disease</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>When Lyme disease is recognized after it has moved from the tick bite site to other locations, the recommended treatments may be either oral or intravenous antibiotics. Oral antibiotics are used for cases that are considered less serious. These include cases of multiple skin lesions, nerve involvement (such as facial palsy) in which the symptoms are limited to nerves that do not involve the brain or spinal cord, and mild cases of inflammation of the heart (typically causing slight delays in conduction of electrical signals from one part of the heart to the other). For cases of nerve involvement such as facial palsy, a spinal tap may be required to test the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) for evidence of infection before deciding whether to treat with oral or intravenous antibiotics. </p><p>More serious manifestations including meningitis (inflammation of the lining of the brain and spinal cord) and more advanced forms of heart block with moderate to severe delays in conduction are usually treated with intravenous therapy. For meningitis, the entire course of antibiotics is often given intravenously. For heart block, patients are generally given intravenous antibiotics initially and monitored in the hospital; in addition, a temporary pacemaker may be required for patients with complete heart block resulting in a very slow heartbeat. When the heart block has improved, patients are often changed to oral antibiotics. For patients with multiple symptoms, the treatment used is dictated by the most serious manifestation. Treatment with intravenous antibiotics is typically recommended for 10 to 28 days (most commonly 14 days).</p><p>Intravenous (IV) therapy is usually started in a healthcare provider's office or emergency department. It can be continued at home and monitored by a visiting or home health nurse. Patients receiving home intravenous therapy should watch for symptoms of infection or inflammation at the site of the IV line (pain, redness, and swelling) and symptoms of blood clots in the vein (pain and swelling in the arm or armpit). Because of the risks associated with intravenous antibiotics, some clinicians may choose to use oral antibiotics even for more serious manifestations of disease in some patients where the risk of intravenous therapy is elevated. </p><p>It has not been proven that the use of intravenous antibiotics results in faster or more complete improvement of symptoms, even in severe cases of meningitis and heart block. In European cases of Lyme disease, oral antibiotics appear to be equivalent to intravenous antibiotics for meningitis, and an increasing number of providers in the United States are starting to use oral doxycycline to treat meningitis. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Late Lyme disease</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Manifestations of late Lyme disease include arthritis and neurologic conditions.</p><p>In most individuals, the arthritis of late Lyme disease resolves with oral antibiotic therapy given for 28 days; intravenous antibiotics are recommended only if the arthritis does not improve with oral treatment. However, in some adults and children, arthritis persists after antibiotic therapy.</p><p>Arthritis that lingers after antibiotic therapy may require therapies used for other types of arthritis, such as hydroxychloroquine <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> synovectomy (surgical removal of the joint lining). More information about these treatments is discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=osteoarthritis-treatment-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">&quot;Patient education: Osteoarthritis treatment (Beyond the Basics)&quot;</a>.) </p><p>Neurologic conditions associated with late Lyme disease are treated with intravenous antibiotics, usually ceftriaxone or cefotaxime, given daily for two to four weeks.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Post-Lyme disease syndromes</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In some people, symptoms such as headache, fatigue, and joint pain do not resolve immediately after treatment is completed. In addition, some patients develop pain or fatigue after a gap of several weeks to months after antibiotic treatment of Lyme disease. These symptoms usually resolve gradually over time. Taking more antibiotics does not improve symptoms or shorten the course of post-Lyme symptoms.</p><p>Chronic Lyme disease is another term that is used to describe symptoms of pain, fatigue, and difficulty thinking clearly that occur after antibiotic treatment of Lyme disease. There are currently no strict criteria for defining chronic Lyme disease, and no evidence that antibiotics beyond the currently recommended amounts improve symptoms. Because the symptoms are often non-specific and can overlap with many other diseases, it is important to ensure that there are no other potential causes of the symptoms that may be more amenable to therapy. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h1\">CAN I GET LYME DISEASE AGAIN?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>After being infected with and treated for <strong>early</strong> Lyme disease, it is possible to become infected with Lyme disease again. However, there has never been a case of re-infection with Lyme disease in a person who has had Lyme arthritis.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h1\">ARE ANTIBIOTICS NECESSARY AFTER A TICK BITE?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Several factors must be taken into consideration when deciding if antibiotic treatment is necessary after a tick bite to prevent Lyme disease.
