As part of psoralen plus ultraviolet A (PUVA) therapy, psoralens may be applied topically or taken orally.</p><p>Psoralens are produced by a variety of plants of the Apiaceae and Rutaceae families, including fig, lime, celery, and parsnip. The medicinal properties of psoralens have been known for centuries and their use in treating vitiligo was recorded as long ago as 1550 BC [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/psoralen-plus-ultraviolet-a-puva-photochemotherapy/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].</p><p>Three psoralens are used for PUVA therapy (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F83021\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef83021 \">table 1</a>). <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methoxsalen-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Methoxsalen</a> or 8-methoxypsoralen (8-MOP) is the most widely used and the only psoralen available in the United States. Trioxsalen or 4,5',8-trimethylpsoralen and bergapten or 5-methoxypsoralen are available in Europe and elsewhere (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F83609\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef83609 \">figure 1</a>).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3425444\"><span class=\"h2\">Pharmacokinetics</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The intestinal absorption rate of psoralens depends upon the physical characteristics of the preparation, concomitant food intake, and individual factors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/psoralen-plus-ultraviolet-a-puva-photochemotherapy/abstract/5-8\" class=\"abstract_t\">5-8</a>]. </p><p>Variable absorption can impact the effect of psoralen on UVA exposure. Dissolved preparations (eg, soft gelatin capsules) are better absorbed than micronized, crystalline formulations (eg, hard gelatin capsules) and yield peak serum levels in a relatively reproducible time in all subjects (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F83021\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef83021 \">table 1</a>). Food intake retards and decreases the absorption of psoralens. A first-pass effect (eg, the amount of drug that is metabolized by the liver after intestinal absorption, before entering the general circulation) may be the cause of the high interindividual variability in the plasma levels achieved after a fixed dose of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methoxsalen-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">methoxsalen</a>.</p><p>In the blood, 75 to 80 percent of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methoxsalen-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">methoxsalen</a> is reversibly bound to serum albumin and is distributed to all organs. In the absence of UVA exposure, the binding is short lived and the drug is rapidly metabolized in the liver and excreted with urine as inactive metabolites. Drugs that induce cytochrome P-450 enzymes accelerate the metabolism of methoxsalen and may decrease the biologic effect of PUVA [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/psoralen-plus-ultraviolet-a-puva-photochemotherapy/abstract/7,9-11\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,9-11</a>].</p><p>The pharmacokinetics of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methoxsalen-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">methoxsalen</a> after transepidermal absorption depends upon the method of application [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/psoralen-plus-ultraviolet-a-puva-photochemotherapy/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. Methoxsalen 0.15% emulsion or solution applied topically to large body areas leads to plasma levels comparable to those achieved with oral administration. In contrast, plasma levels after whole body bath PUVA treatment are very low. Bathwater-delivered psoralens are readily absorbed in the skin but are promptly eliminated without cutaneous accumulation.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H31513821\"><span class=\"h2\">Photochemistry</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Psoralens penetrate into the cells and intercalate between DNA base pairs in the absence of UV exposure. Upon exposure to UVA radiation, the psoralen molecules absorb photons, become chemically activated and covalently bond with DNA base pairs, producing interstrand crosslinks of the double helix (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F83232\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef83232 \">figure 2</a>). </p><p>DNA crosslinking suppresses DNA synthesis and mitosis and may cause cell apoptosis through the activation of the p53 pathway. Cells with sublethal damage repair the DNA through an error-prone repair process, resulting in mutagenesis and photocarcinogenesis.</p><p>Psoralens also interact with other cell components, including mitochondria, RNA, and proteins. In keratinocyte cultures, psoralens induce mitochondrial depolarization, cytochrome <em>c</em> release, production of reactive oxygen species, and activation of proteases such as caspase-3 and -9 that are implicated in cell apoptosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/psoralen-plus-ultraviolet-a-puva-photochemotherapy/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H31513828\"><span class=\"h1\">UVA SOURCES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The wavelengths of ultraviolet A (UVA) lie between 320 and 400 nm in the electromagnetic spectrum (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F70045\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef70045 \">figure 3</a>). The most common sources of UVA radiation are fluorescent phototherapy light bulbs with maximum emission at 352 nm. UVA doses are measured in <span class=\"nowrap\">joules/cm<sup>2</span> </sup><span class=\"nowrap\">(J/cm<sup>2</sup>),</span> most often using a photometer with a maximum sensitivity at 350 to 360 nm. Although in vivo wavelengths most efficient at activating psoralens peak at 320 to 340 nm (UVA2 spectrum (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F70045\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef70045 \">figure 3</a>)), the longer wavelength emitted by the available lamps is equally effective in clinical practice [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/psoralen-plus-ultraviolet-a-puva-photochemotherapy/abstract/14,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">14,15</a>]. Psoralen activation also occurs in the UVB spectrum.</p><p>Although a convenient source of UVA, natural sunlight is not safe for use with psoralens because of inherent difficulties in defining the therapeutic dose and increased risk of severe phototoxic reactions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/psoralen-plus-ultraviolet-a-puva-photochemotherapy/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. Similarly, the use of tanning beds, which have emission peaks in the range of 320 to 340 nm, may unpredictably activate psoralens with increased risk of severe erythema.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4791974\"><span class=\"h1\">MECHANISMS OF ACTION OF PUVA</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Psoralen plus ultraviolet A (PUVA) exerts its therapeutic effect through multiple mechanisms, some of which are not completely understood. Initially, the mechanism in psoriasis was believed to be the inhibition of keratinocyte proliferation. However, it is now well established that the efficacy of PUVA in the treatment of psoriasis is based upon its immunomodulatory properties. Proposed mechanisms include the following:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Inhibition of cell proliferation</strong> &ndash; The mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling, implicated in the regulation of cell growth and proliferation, appears to have a role in the pathogenesis of psoriasis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/psoralen-plus-ultraviolet-a-puva-photochemotherapy/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. PUVA may reduce cell proliferation in psoriasis through downregulation of the mTOR signaling pathway [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/psoralen-plus-ultraviolet-a-puva-photochemotherapy/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Immunosuppression</strong> &ndash; The effect of PUVA in inflammatory diseases (with or without a hyperproliferative component) is mediated by its immunomodulatory properties, including alteration of cytokine and cytokine receptor expression, lymphocyte apoptosis, functional perturbation in the types and function of antigen presenting cells, and reduced expression of adhesion molecules [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/psoralen-plus-ultraviolet-a-puva-photochemotherapy/abstract/19-23\" class=\"abstract_t\">19-23</a>]. The effect of PUVA in the early stages of mycosis fungoides is likely related to the ability of PUVA to induce lymphocyte apoptosis in dermal infiltrates.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Melanogenesis</strong> &ndash; PUVA stimulates melanocyte proliferation, melanogenesis, and transfer of melanosomes to keratinocytes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/psoralen-plus-ultraviolet-a-puva-photochemotherapy/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. This mechanism of action, while therapeutic in vitiligo, leads to hyperpigmentation as an adverse effect of PUVA in the treatment of other conditions.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1377222\"><span class=\"h1\">PHOTOSENSITIVITY EFFECTS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Delayed phototoxic erythema and pigmentation are the main photosensitivity effects of psoralen plus ultraviolet A (PUVA) treatment. The erythema intensity is proportional to the dose of psoralen and ultraviolet A (UVA) radiation, although there is variability in the photosensitivity response among individuals. </p><p>PUVA-induced erythema usually appears 36 to 48 hours after exposure to UVA radiation and peaks at 48 to 96 hours or even up to 120 hours [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/psoralen-plus-ultraviolet-a-puva-photochemotherapy/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. Erythema occurs in 10 percent of patients. PUVA treatments are usually given 48 hours apart because daily exposure may result in severe delayed cumulative phototoxicity. Excessive doses of PUVA may induce severe erythema with blistering, intense pruritus, or skin pain. (See <a href=\"#H31513954\" class=\"local\">'Short-term adverse effects'</a> below.)</p><p>PUVA-induced pigmentation may occur in the absence of erythema, particularly with trimethylpsoralen or 5-methoxypsoralen, and is more intense and longer lasting than that produced by sunlight. The efficacy of PUVA is reduced in the presence of intense pigmentation. Therefore, for skin diseases other than vitiligo, higher doses of UVA radiation may be required as treatment proceeds. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H31513870\"><span class=\"h1\">TREATMENT PROTOCOLS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Protocols for psoralen plus ultraviolet A (PUVA) treatment were initially developed for the treatment of psoriasis, but may be applied to its use in other conditions.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H770375\"><span class=\"h2\">Oral PUVA</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span><a href=\"topic.htm?path=methoxsalen-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Methoxsalen</a> capsules are taken orally at doses of 0.4 to 0.6 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> actual body weight one to two hours before exposure to ultraviolet A (UVA) radiation (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F83191\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef83191 \">table 2</a>). Soft gelatin formulations of methoxsalen are absorbed faster and provide higher and more reproducible plasma levels than microcrystalline preparations. (See <a href=\"#H3425444\" class=\"local\">'Pharmacokinetics'</a> above.)</p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=methoxsalen-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Methoxsalen</a> ideally should be taken with water on an empty stomach, or at least one hour after eating. However, nausea develops in about 30 percent of patients and is more common with soft gelatin preparations because of rapid absorption and increased blood levels. Nausea can be prevented by taking the drug with a small amount of food with high fat content (eg, cheese) or milk.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H31513877\"><span class=\"h3\">Initial treatment (clearance phase)</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The initial dose of UVA radiation is based upon one of two factors: the patient's skin type (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F83193%7EPC%2F60541\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef83193 graphicRef60541 \">table 3A-B</a>); or the minimal phototoxic dose (MPD) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/psoralen-plus-ultraviolet-a-puva-photochemotherapy/abstract/12,26,27\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,26,27</a>]. The latter is more commonly used in a few specialized centers in Europe.</p><p>The MPD is defined as the minimal dose of UVA that produces a barely perceptible but well-defined erythema when template areas of the skin are exposed to increasing doses of UVA after psoralen ingestion. Erythema readings are performed 48 or 72 hours after testing, at which time the psoralen phototoxicity reaction usually reaches its peak. The MPD test should be performed on previously nonexposed skin (eg, buttocks). Treatment is started using 50 to 70 percent of the MPD. </p><p>Treatments are delivered two or three times per week, at least 48 hours apart. If no erythema is noted, the UVA dose is increased by 0.5 to 1 <span class=\"nowrap\">J/cm<sup>2</sup></span> in the subsequent treatments until satisfactory control of the disease has been obtained. The dose is then held at that level. If faint erythema is present, the dose of radiation is held constant. </p><p>If skin tenderness or definite erythema is present, treatment is stopped until erythema and pain have diminished. Treatment is then resumed at a lower dose. If localized erythema develops in previously unexposed parts of the body (eg, the breasts or buttocks), shielding may be employed using clothing or sunscreens that protect against UVA radiation and treatment may be continued. </p><p>Repeated exposures are usually required to clear PUVA-responsive diseases, with gradual increment in the UVA dose as pigmentation develops. As an example, improvement of moderate plaque psoriasis is generally noted after 8 to 10 treatments. On average, 25 to 30 treatments are needed for complete clearance [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/psoralen-plus-ultraviolet-a-puva-photochemotherapy/abstract/28-32\" class=\"abstract_t\">28-32</a>]. </p><p>Since arms and legs generally respond to treatment more slowly than the trunk, the extremities may require additional doses of UVA. After the whole body dose, the patient puts on a gown or shorts and t-shirt, and covers his or her head. In patients with skin type I or II, an additional dose of one <span class=\"nowrap\">J/cm<sup>2</sup></span> is delivered to the limbs and increased by 0.5 <span class=\"nowrap\">J/cm<sup>2</sup></span> at each subsequent treatment. In patients with skin type &ge;III, additional doses of 2 to 4 <span class=\"nowrap\">J/cm<sup>2</sup><strong></span> </strong>are delivered to the limbs and increased by 0.5 to 1 <span class=\"nowrap\">J/cm<sup>2</sup></span> at each treatment.</p><p>Adherence to the schedule is critical for treatment success. Decreased frequency of PUVA (eg, once weekly) can result in treatment failure. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H31513884\"><span class=\"h3\">Maintenance treatment</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>After satisfactory clearing of disease, the final dose of UVA is held constant and the frequency of treatments is gradually reduced to as low as once per month [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/psoralen-plus-ultraviolet-a-puva-photochemotherapy/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>]. Ultimately, PUVA therapy can be discontinued for patients in stable remission to avoid overtreatment and the long-term adverse effects of high cumulative doses of PUVA. </p><p>Schedules for maintenance treatment and when to discontinue therapy vary between institutions. The optimal interval between treatments and the duration of the maintenance treatment should be determined for the individual patient, based upon the type of disease and the time to relapse. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H31513891\"><span class=\"h3\">Treatment of relapses</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>If a significant relapse of the disease occurs after treatment discontinuation or during the maintenance phase, it is appropriate to resume a clearance schedule. For minor recurrences occurring during the maintenance phase, the frequency of treatments may be increased until disease control is achieved.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H31513898\"><span class=\"h2\">Alternative psoralen administration</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>To avoid the gastrointestinal side effects of oral psoralen, protocols have been developed for psoralen to be applied topically (for localized disease) or by bath immersion. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1941672\"><span class=\"h3\">Topical PUVA</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Topical PUVA may be used as an alternative to oral PUVA in patients with localized diseases, including limited plaque or palmoplantar psoriasis, hand eczema, or localized vitiligo. </p><p>Topical PUVA consists of direct application to the skin of psoralens in creams, ointments, or lotions followed by exposure to UVA radiation. As an example, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methoxsalen-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Methoxsalen</a> 1% lotion can be diluted 1:10 with ethanol to yield a 0.1% solution that is applied to affected skin 15 minutes before exposure to UVA radiation. </p><p>For vitiligo, the initial exposure is 0.5 <span class=\"nowrap\">J/cm<sup>2</sup></span>. Incremental increases of 0.25 <span class=\"nowrap\">J/cm<sup>2</span> </sup>are given at each treatment thereafter, until a light pink erythema is achieved in the depigmented skin. UVA dose is either held at this level or adjusted with the goal of maintaining a faint erythema in affected skin until repigmentation occurs. Treatment is given two or three times per week. </p><p>A frequent complication of topical PUVA is an unexpected, usually bullous phototoxic reaction, typically caused by inadvertent exposure to natural sunlight after treatment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/psoralen-plus-ultraviolet-a-puva-photochemotherapy/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1376767\"><span class=\"h3\">Bath PUVA</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Bath PUVA consists of whole body immersion or localized skin soaking (eg, of hands or feet) in a 0.5 to 3 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/L</span> solution of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methoxsalen-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">methoxsalen</a> for 15 to 30 minutes. UVA irradiation is performed immediately after, since the photosensitivity decreases rapidly over two hours following immersion. </p><p>The main advantage of bath PUVA is the absence of systemic adverse effects associated with oral psoralens [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/psoralen-plus-ultraviolet-a-puva-photochemotherapy/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>]. However, eye protection is still required after bath PUVA since <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methoxsalen-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">methoxsalen</a> is detectable in the blood after topical application [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/psoralen-plus-ultraviolet-a-puva-photochemotherapy/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>].</p><p>Bath PUVA is not widely available and there is no consensus on the optimal treatment protocol [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/psoralen-plus-ultraviolet-a-puva-photochemotherapy/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>]. Bath PUVA is not FDA approved. In addition, the long-term adverse effects of bath PUVA, including skin carcinogenesis, are unknown.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H31513912\"><span class=\"h1\">SAFETY MEASURES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>It is important to protect skin that is not involved in the disease process from both topical psoralen and ultraviolet A (UVA) exposure during topical psoralen plus ultraviolet A (PUVA). When systemic psoralen is taken, the patient must be protected from additional UV exposure after the treatment. The following measures are recommended:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In PUVA units, small UV-blocking goggles are used to protect the eyes. If treatment is not required for facial involvement, the face is protected either by use of a broad spectrum sunscreen with an SPF of 50+ or a cloth barrier. Male genitalia are protected with the use of underwear or an athletic supporter.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients must protect their eyes after ingesting psoralen (or after bath exposure). Wraparound UV-blocking glasses should be worn when the patient is exposed to sunlight, from the time <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methoxsalen-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">methoxsalen</a> is ingested until sunset that same day. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Sun avoidance is advised to minimize pigmentation from natural sunlight. Excessive pigmentation may ultimately limit the effectiveness of PUVA therapy and require higher doses of UVA. The skin should be protected from natural sunlight through appropriate clothing and avoidance.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The amount of UVA emitted by common fluorescent lights is insufficient to activate psoralens. Thus, photoprotection is not required in home or office settings.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1377203\"><span class=\"h1\">DRUG INTERACTIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Phototoxic drugs (eg, thiazides, tetracyclines, fluoroquinolones, phenothiazines, or sulfonamides), and topical preparations (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=anthralin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">anthralin</a> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=coal-tar-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">coal tar</a>) may augment the action of psoralen plus ultraviolet A (PUVA) and increase the risk of acute phototoxic erythema.

Emollients are generally sufficient to relieve this symptom. Intense pruritus (&quot;PUVA-itch&quot;) is often associated with erythema and is described as a deep, burning itch. PUVA-itch can also occur without erythema. It generally begins on the outer aspect of arms, thighs, buttocks, and, in women, on the breasts.

An important feature is sparing of areas not exposed to UVA light during treatment (eg, axilla <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> inner thigh). Management includes cessation of PUVA therapy, and use of emollients, cool baths, and antipruritic medications until the symptoms subside.
