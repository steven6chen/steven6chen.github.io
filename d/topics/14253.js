The majority of serious catheter-related bloodstream infections are associated with central venous catheters (CVCs), particularly those placed in an intensive care unit [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-intravascular-catheter-related-infections/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. CVC-related bloodstream infection is likely if a primary bloodstream infection develops in a patient who had a CVC within the 48-hour period before the development of the bloodstream infection. If the time interval is longer than 48 hours, there must be compelling evidence that the infection was related to the vascular access device. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epidemiology-pathogenesis-and-microbiology-of-intravascular-catheter-infections\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Epidemiology, pathogenesis, and microbiology of intravascular catheter infections&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Strict adherence to hand hygiene recommendations and the use of aseptic techniques during insertion and dressing changes remain the most important measures for the prevention of catheter-associated infections. These measures are emphasized in guidelines from the Healthcare Infection Control Practices Advisory Committee (HICPAC), the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), and working groups composed of members from professional organizations representing a variety of medical disciplines [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-intravascular-catheter-related-infections/abstract/2-6\" class=\"abstract_t\">2-6</a>].</p><p>Other preventive measures include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Choosing appropriate sites for catheter insertion</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Using the appropriate type of catheter material</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Using barrier precautions during insertion</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Changing catheter administration sets at appropriate intervals</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Ensuring proper catheter site care</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Ensuring removal of catheters when no longer essential</p><p/><p>The importance of the location, duration, catheter material, and catheter care will be reviewed here, and recommendations will be presented for the prevention of infections associated with different types of intravascular catheters (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F75251\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef75251 \">table 1</a>). Issues related to the definitions, epidemiology (including microbiology), diagnosis, and treatment of intravascular catheter-associated infections, both local and systemic, are discussed separately.

The risk of CR-BSI with the different types of intravascular catheters was evaluated in a systematic review of 200 prospective studies that used appropriate criteria [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-intravascular-catheter-related-infections/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. The following rates of CR-BSI, from lowest to highest, were noted per 1000 catheter-days (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F75247\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef75247 \">table 2</a>):</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Peripherally inserted midline catheters &ndash; 0.2 (95% CI 0.0-0.5)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Peripheral intravenous catheters &ndash; 0.5 (95% CI 0.2-0.7)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Peripherally inserted central catheters (PICCs) &ndash; 1.1 (95% CI 0.9-1.3)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Cuffed and tunneled central venous catheters (CVCs) &ndash; 1.6 (95% CI 1.5-1.7)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Arterial catheters for hemodynamic monitoring &ndash; 1.7 (95% CI 1.2-2.3)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Noncuffed central venous catheters</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Nonmedicated and tunneled &ndash; 1.7 (95% CI 1.2-2.3)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Nonmedicated and nontunneled &ndash; 2.7 (95% CI 2.6-2.9)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pulmonary artery catheters &ndash; 3.7 (95% CI 2.4-5.0)</p><p/><p>Thus, all types of intravascular catheters pose significant but often widely differing risks of BSI. Because the study was unable to adjust for different degrees of severity of illness, a particular type of catheter could be associated with an increased risk of infection if it were preferentially used in more severely ill or vulnerable patients.</p><p>PICCs have been associated with a lower rate of bloodstream infection than centrally inserted catheters in studies conducted largely among outpatients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-intravascular-catheter-related-infections/abstract/5,7,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,7,8</a>]; studies among inpatients have demonstrated infection rates comparable with those of other central venous catheters [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-intravascular-catheter-related-infections/abstract/9,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,10</a>]. A higher rate of PICC-related bloodstream infections may occur in the more severely ill, including oncology and hospitalized patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-intravascular-catheter-related-infections/abstract/11,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,12</a>]. In a study of 251 PICCs placed in 115 hospitalized patients, of whom 42 percent had an intensive care unit (ICU) stay during the study period, the rate of CR-BSI was 2.1 per 1000 catheter-days, similar to rates seen with conventional CVCs placed in the internal jugular or subclavian veins (2 to 5 per 1000 catheter-days) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-intravascular-catheter-related-infections/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>].</p><p>Midline catheters, which are peripherally inserted and terminate three to eight inches from the insertion site, have been infrequently used despite their low infection rate [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-intravascular-catheter-related-infections/abstract/7,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,13</a>], in part because the complication rate due to catheter dysfunction, which may be more than twice as high with midline catheters compared with PICCs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-intravascular-catheter-related-infections/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. Midline catheter devices had traditionally been made from rigid materials that can be irritating to veins; softer materials have been associated with hypersensitivity reactions, thrombosis, or thrombophlebitis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-intravascular-catheter-related-infections/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. Newer midline catheters made of silicone, polyurethane, or a blend of polycarbonate and polyurethane have been adopted in place of PICCs; data regarding complication rates associated with these newer midline catheters are limited, although they appear to be associated with fewer adverse events than earlier midline catheters.</p><p>Among CVCs, higher rates of catheter-related infection have been described with triple-lumen compared with single-lumen catheters when used for administration of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=total-parenteral-nutrition-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">total parenteral nutrition</a> (TPN) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-intravascular-catheter-related-infections/abstract/16,17\" class=\"abstract_t\">16,17</a>]. However, this increase in infection risk compared with single-lumen catheters was not seen in a randomized trial of critically ill patients in an ICU [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-intravascular-catheter-related-infections/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1532435\"><span class=\"h3\">Surgically implanted central catheters</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Surgically implanted tunneled catheters such as Hickman catheters are generally associated with significantly lower rates of bloodstream infection (0.1 to 0.2 per 100 catheter-days) than percutaneously inserted catheters. In addition, subcutaneous infusion ports may be associated with a 10- to 12-fold lower rate of infection than tunneled catheters [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-intravascular-catheter-related-infections/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1531907\"><span class=\"h3\">Needleless devices</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Some studies have shown an association between the use of needleless intravascular access devices and an increased risk for CR-BSI under certain circumstances [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-intravascular-catheter-related-infections/abstract/20-23\" class=\"abstract_t\">20-23</a>]. These specifically include receiving TPN, having a tunneled CVC or one with multiple ports, showering (as opposed to bathing), and changing the needleless device end cap infrequently (eg, once weekly versus every two days).</p><p>Newer mechanical valve needleless connectors have also been temporally associated with increased rates of health care-associated bloodstream infection that have not been clearly associated with lack of compliance with recommended catheter care (relative risk 1.54, 95% CI 1.37-1.74) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-intravascular-catheter-related-infections/abstract/24-26\" class=\"abstract_t\">24-26</a>]. These devices generate positive or negative pressure and are accessed using luer lock connectors, eliminating needle use for device access. In one study, the rate of CR-BSI in five hospitals increased from 6.2 to 9.5 infections per 1000 catheter-days after the introduction of a mechanical valve connector into routine use, despite similar surveillance and prevention strategies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-intravascular-catheter-related-infections/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. Thus, positive-pressure needleless connectors with mechanical valves should not be used routinely without a thorough assessment of risks, benefits, and education regarding proper use [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-intravascular-catheter-related-infections/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Anatomic location</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The anatomic site chosen for catheter placement influences the subsequent risk for catheter-associated infection. As an example, the risk of infection with peripheral venous catheters is higher in the lower compared with the upper extremity and higher in the wrist or upper arm compared with the hand [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-intravascular-catheter-related-infections/abstract/2,28\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,28</a>].</p><p>The location of CVCs is also important. Catheter-related infection is generally more common with catheters in the femoral [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-intravascular-catheter-related-infections/abstract/29-33\" class=\"abstract_t\">29-33</a>] and, probably to a lesser degree, internal jugular veins [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-intravascular-catheter-related-infections/abstract/31,34\" class=\"abstract_t\">31,34</a>] compared with the subclavian vein [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-intravascular-catheter-related-infections/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>]. An increase in risk with internal jugular compared with subclavian sites of insertion has also been noted with pulmonary artery catheters [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-intravascular-catheter-related-infections/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>].</p><p>The magnitude of this difference according to the site of insertion was illustrated by meta-analysis of nine observational studies and one randomized controlled trial, which included ICU patients with short-term CVC placement. The pooled catheter-associated infection rate was lower with nontunneled subclavian catheters (1.3 events per 1000 catheter-days) than either internal jugular or femoral catheters (2.6 and 3.6 events per 1000 catheter-days, respectively) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-intravascular-catheter-related-infections/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>]. However, this meta-analysis was limited by the lack of randomization by site in most studies, significant clinical heterogeneity in the studies (eg, with regards to insertion techniques and other prevention strategies), and lack of standard definitions of catheter-related infections.</p><p>A subsequent meta-analysis included a different subset of studies evaluating CVC location and infection rates [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-intravascular-catheter-related-infections/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>]. Many of the included studies were performed at a time when overall rates of CVC infections had fallen dramatically. This meta-analysis had similar limitations to the above meta-analysis and additionally excluded two outlier studies from the analysis. It did not demonstrate any difference in the rate of infections between femoral versus subclavian or internal jugular catheters.</p><p>However, in the one trial included in both meta-analyses in which 289 patients were randomly assigned to either the femoral or subclavian sites for central venous catheter placement, femoral catheterization was associated with a significant increase in overall infection (20 versus 3.7 per 1000 catheter-days), clinical sepsis with or without documented bloodstream infection (4.5 versus 1.2 per 1000 catheter-days), and thrombotic complications [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-intravascular-catheter-related-infections/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>].</p><p>Differences in infection risk among sites of catheterization may be minimized when experienced clinicians insert the catheters, strict sterile technique is used, and trained nursing staff performs catheter care [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-intravascular-catheter-related-infections/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>]. Nevertheless, we generally avoid the femoral site in adults for insertion of central venous or pulmonary artery catheters. However, the choice of access site takes into account the risk for infection as well as other factors that may increase the risk for mechanical complications, which varies for each site. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-central-venous-access#H3103787\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of central venous access&quot;, section on 'Site selection'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=central-catheters-for-acute-and-chronic-hemodialysis-access#H79681682\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Central catheters for acute and chronic hemodialysis access&quot;, section on 'Access site considerations'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Duration</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The duration of catheterization has been considered an important risk factor for infection with both peripheral venous and arterial catheters.

The incidence of phlebitis was evaluated in a prospective study of 1054 small peripheral venous catheters [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-intravascular-catheter-related-infections/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. The rate of phlebitis exceeded 50 percent by day 4. The rate of catheter-related infection was much lower (5.4 percent), and there were no cases of bacteremia.</p><p>In contrast with these findings, another large observational study failed to demonstrate a difference in the risk of complications for peripheral venous catheters after three days of cannulation and suggested that routine replacement of peripheral catheters may not be required [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-intravascular-catheter-related-infections/abstract/46\" class=\"abstract_t\">46</a>]. Similarly, a Cochrane review including 4895 patients noted no difference in the rate of infection among patients who underwent peripheral venous catheter replacement when clinically indicated or routine replacement (risk ratio 0.61; CI 0.08 to 4.68; p = 0.64) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-intravascular-catheter-related-infections/abstract/47\" class=\"abstract_t\">47</a>].</p><p>As such, it is becoming our practice to replace or remove peripheral venous catheters as clinically indicated rather than at a set time period of three to four days. We are in agreement with the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention 2011 guidelines, which state there is no need to replace peripheral catheters more frequently than every 72 to 96 hours to reduce risk of infection and phlebitis in adults [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-intravascular-catheter-related-infections/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].</p><p>An exception to this time interval is when adherence to aseptic technique cannot be assured, which primarily occurs when catheters are placed during a medical emergency. In this setting, the catheter should be replaced as soon as possible and no longer than 48 hours after insertion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-intravascular-catheter-related-infections/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h3\">Central venous or pulmonary artery catheters</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The risk of infection with central venous and pulmonary artery catheters increases with the duration of use [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-intravascular-catheter-related-infections/abstract/35,42,43\" class=\"abstract_t\">35,42,43</a>]. However, a defined time period to routinely change these catheters has not been conclusively established [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-intravascular-catheter-related-infections/abstract/48,49\" class=\"abstract_t\">48,49</a>] and changing such catheters is not as simple as changing peripheral venous catheters.

(See <a href=\"#H27\" class=\"local\">'Replacement'</a> below.)</p><p>Vigilant clinical evaluation and assessment of the catheter site should be performed at least every other day. Indications for catheter replacement include purulence at the insertion site with short-term central venous catheters and hemodynamic stability that is suspected to be due to catheter-related bloodstream infection with all central venous catheters [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-intravascular-catheter-related-infections/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Guidewire techniques should not be used to exchange catheters since this approach increases the risk of bloodstream infection (eg, 6 versus 0 percent with replacement of the catheter at a new site in a randomized trial) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-intravascular-catheter-related-infections/abstract/2,48\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,48</a>].

The risk of infection increases after more than four to six days. This was illustrated in two reports with a total 201 peripheral arterial catheters in which there were 34 local infections and 9 episodes of bacteremia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-intravascular-catheter-related-infections/abstract/44,45\" class=\"abstract_t\">44,45</a>]. Twenty-six of the local infections and all of the episodes of bacteremia occurred more than four days after catheter placement. However, given the limited number of access sites, routine replacement of these catheters is not recommended (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F65076\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef65076 \">table 5</a>).

The potential efficacy of this approach was illustrated in a randomized controlled trial in 204 hospitalized adults with hematologic or oncologic malignancy and a nontunneled CVC; the patients were assigned to treatment with an infusion of low-dose heparin or normal saline (control group) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-intravascular-catheter-related-infections/abstract/116\" class=\"abstract_t\">116</a>]. Catheter-related bloodstream infection was significantly less common in the heparin group (6.8 versus 16.6 percent in the control group). In a trial of 341 ICU patients who required CVC placement, there was a trend toward fewer episodes of lumen nonpatency (3.8 versus 6.3 percent) and catheter-related bloodstream infections (0 versus 3.1 per 1000 catheter-days) in patients who were randomly assigned to have their catheters flushed with heparin compared with normal saline [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-intravascular-catheter-related-infections/abstract/118\" class=\"abstract_t\">118</a>]. However, these differences were not statistically significant.</p><p>These observations support the use of clot prevention strategies to reduce the rate of CVC-related infection, at least in patients with hematologic or oncologic malignancy. In general, we do not favor routine use of anticoagulation to reduce the risk of catheter-related infection. Most studies indicate a beneficial effect of the antimicrobial flush or lock solution in terms of prevention of catheter-related infection; however, this must be balanced by the potential for side effects, toxicity, or allergic reactions.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H29\"><span class=\"h1\">COMPLIANCE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Compliance with measures to prevent intravascular catheter infections is a challenging problem [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-intravascular-catheter-related-infections/abstract/119,120\" class=\"abstract_t\">119,120</a>]. Compliance with infection control practices for prevention of central venous catheter (CVC)-related bloodstream infection was evaluated in a survey of infection control coordinators at 516 Veterans Administration (VA) and non-VA hospitals in the United States for the period March 16 through August 1, 2005 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-intravascular-catheter-related-infections/abstract/119\" class=\"abstract_t\">119</a>].

The use of antibiotic-impregnated catheters was not reported.</p><p>The importance of a specialized team for peripheral venous catheters was illustrated in a controlled trial in a university hospital in which patients were randomly assigned to insertion by a house officer and maintenance by the ward nursing staff or insertion and maintenance by an intravenous therapy team [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-intravascular-catheter-related-infections/abstract/126\" class=\"abstract_t\">126</a>]. The team approach was associated with a significantly lower frequency of signs or symptoms of inflammation (7.9 versus 21.7 percent with the house staff-nursing approach), no episodes of bacteremia versus three (2.2 percent), and a higher number of catheters placed per patient (2.1 versus 1.6).
