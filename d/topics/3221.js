Professional organizations recommend that women ages 25 to 29 years be screened with cytology alone, while women 30 years or older should be screened with cytology and HPV co-testing (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F82951\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef82951 \">table 3</a>). Thus, the American Society for Colposcopy and Cervical Pathology (ASCCP) prefers that women ages 25 to 29 years are not managed based upon HPV results, even if an HPV test was performed at the time of screening [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cervical-cytology-evaluation-of-low-grade-squamous-intraepithelial-lesions-lsil/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>].

(See <a href=\"#H2670274\" class=\"local\">'Risk of premalignant or malignant disease'</a> above and <a href=\"#H2670454\" class=\"local\">'Rationale for evaluation strategies'</a> above.)</p><p>Despite HPV triage, most women with LSIL will require colposcopy. This is because the majority of women with LSIL are HPV positive, regardless of age. This is in contrast to ASC-US cytology, which is more likely to be associated with HPV infection in younger women. As an example, in one study, the rate of HPV positivity declined only modestly in women with LSIL (ages 30 to 34: 88 percent; ages 60 to 64: 72 percent) compared with those with ASC-US, in whom it declined more steeply (ages 30 to 34: 56 percent; ages 60 to 64: 29 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cervical-cytology-evaluation-of-low-grade-squamous-intraepithelial-lesions-lsil/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].</p><p>This limited use of LSIL triage was introduced with the ASCCP 2012 guidelines. Previous guidelines did not include this strategy, likely due to the high rate of HPV positivity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cervical-cytology-evaluation-of-low-grade-squamous-intraepithelial-lesions-lsil/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. Similarly, the <span class=\"nowrap\">ASCUS/LSIL</span> Triage Study (ALTS), a randomized trial that evaluated management strategies for ASC-US and LSIL cytology, did not evaluate HPV triage for LSIL because 80 percent of women within the LSIL group were HPV positive [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cervical-cytology-evaluation-of-low-grade-squamous-intraepithelial-lesions-lsil/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H436040\"><span class=\"h4\">Ages 25 to 29</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Women ages 25 to 29 (and 21 to 24) have a high prevalence of HPV infection, but cervical intraepithelial lesions often regress spontaneously, and the risk of cervical cancer is low [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cervical-cytology-evaluation-of-low-grade-squamous-intraepithelial-lesions-lsil/abstract/13-16\" class=\"abstract_t\">13-16</a>]. Recommended cervical cancer screening in this age group consists of cytology alone, without HPV testing (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F82951\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef82951 \">table 3</a>), as noted above. As a result, there are few data about the risk of high-grade CIN or cervical cancer in women in this age group stratified by HPV status. Given the difficulty interpreting HPV testing results in this patient population, for women ages 25 to 29 with LSIL who have been inadvertently tested for HPV and are HPV negative, we suggest management based solely on the cytology results. This recommendation is consistent with advice from the ASCCP [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cervical-cytology-evaluation-of-low-grade-squamous-intraepithelial-lesions-lsil/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>].</p><p>The differential rates of HPV infection and risks of cervical cancer in young women are discussed in detail separately.

This is because the risk of cervical cancer is low and the rate of transient HPV infection is high in this patient population. Thus, recommended cervical cancer screening in this patient population is cytology alone, without HPV testing (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F82951\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef82951 \">table 3</a>).

Findings may be described as atypical squamous cells (ASC), low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions (LSIL), high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions (HSIL), or atypical glandular cells (AGC). Abnormal cervical cytology requires further evaluation to exclude the presence of a precancerous or cancerous condition. (See <a href=\"#H1\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For women ages 30 years or older with LSIL cervical cytology (see <a href=\"#H2670520\" class=\"local\">'Women ages 25 and older'</a> above and <a href=\"#H435945\" class=\"local\">'Ages 30 and older'</a> above):</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>For those with negative human papillomavirus (HPV) testing, we suggest follow-up with repeat HPV and cytology co-testing at 12 months rather than colposcopy.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>For those with a positive HPV test, colposcopy should be performed.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>For those who were not initially tested for HPV as part of cervical cancer screening, colposcopy should be performed.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For women ages 25 to 29 years with LSIL cytology, colposcopy should be performed. This is the preferred management for all women in this age group, even those inadvertently tested for HPV who have a negative HPV result. HPV testing is not part of recommended cervical cancer screening in this patient population (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F82951\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef82951 \">table 3</a>). (See <a href=\"#H2670520\" class=\"local\">'Women ages 25 and older'</a> above and <a href=\"#H436040\" class=\"local\">'Ages 25 to 29'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The recommendations for follow-up for abnormal cervical screening results differ for women ages 21 to 24 years from those for women 25 and older. These rely less upon HPV testing and also advise colposcopy only if abnormal results are severe or persistent. This is because the risk of cervical cancer is low and the prevalence of HPV infection is high in this patient population. (See <a href=\"#H2670616\" class=\"local\">'Women ages 21 to 24'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For women ages 21 to 24 years with LSIL cytology, we suggest repeating cytology at 12 months rather than colposcopy. (See <a href=\"#H2670616\" class=\"local\">'Women ages 21 to 24'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For pregnant women with LSIL, the preferred approach is to evaluate with colposcopy during pregnancy, but colposcopy may be deferred until six weeks postpartum. Endocervical curettage should not be done during pregnancy, but gentle sampling of the endocervical canal with a cytobrush may be performed. Cervical biopsy should be done only if a high-grade abnormality is suspected. (See <a href=\"#H205671\" class=\"local\">'Pregnant women'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Postmenopausal women with LSIL have three options for further evaluation: reflex HPV testing, repeat cytology at 6 and 12 months, or colposcopy. (See <a href=\"#H206253\" class=\"local\">'Postmenopausal women'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Management of immunocompromised women with cervical cytology abnormalities is the same as for other women.
