The diagnosis of CS is challenging and is frequently missed or delayed. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-cardiac-sarcoidosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of cardiac sarcoidosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Patients who have probable or definite CS are at risk for adverse cardiovascular outcomes, including death and ventricular tachycardia. Yet, data regarding how various therapies might mitigate this increased risk are limited. </p><p>This topic will provide an overview of how different clinical and imaging variables can be used to determine the prognosis of patients with known or suspected CS and a discussion of management of CS. The clinical manifestations and diagnosis of CS are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-cardiac-sarcoidosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of cardiac sarcoidosis&quot;</a>.) </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2225787707\"><span class=\"h1\">PROGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients with CS face high rates of adverse events, including ventricular arrhythmias, heart block requiring pacemaker implantation, heart failure (HF; which in some may progress to requiring heart transplantation), and death. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H953683331\"><span class=\"h2\">Clinical significance of prognosis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients at highest risk of ventricular arrhythmias and sudden cardiac death (SCD) are those most likely to benefit from implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) therapy. Thus, prognostic information may be useful to aid shared decision making on ICD implantation, especially in patients who do not have a general indication for secondary prevention of an ICD such as those with normal left ventricular (LV) function, for whom decision making regarding the role of an ICD is less clear.</p><p>While prognostic predictors of mortality have been identified in various retrospective studies, the best means of assessing disease prognosis and choosing therapeutic interventions remain uncertain. At present, a combination of clinical variables, together with cardiac imaging findings, offers the best methods to assess the risk of future adverse cardiovascular events. However, despite an overall high risk of adverse events, many patients who have CS may not have any events, and there is marked variability in the presentation, progression, and severity of CS [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-and-prognosis-of-cardiac-sarcoidosis/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2423521803\"><span class=\"h2\">Prognostic factors</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Assessment of prognosis in patients with CS includes evaluation of clinical features, review of advanced cardiac imaging results, and selected use of invasive electrophysiologic (EP) testing.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H212169742\"><span class=\"h3\">Clinical features</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Clinical features in patients with CS that predict adverse cardiac events (death, need for cardiac transplantation, sudden cardiac arrest) include sustained ventricular tachycardia (VT), symptoms of HF, and depressed left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-and-prognosis-of-cardiac-sarcoidosis/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. </p><p>Patients who have a prior history of sustained VT or who have an ICD appear to have the highest rate of events, and patients with CS with ICDs have high rates (32 to 38 percent over two years or approximately one-third of patients over two years) of appropriate therapies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-and-prognosis-of-cardiac-sarcoidosis/abstract/4-6\" class=\"abstract_t\">4-6</a>]. In part, this may be due to bias inherent in the fact that having an ICD may result in an increased rate of detection and treatment of arrhythmic events, but it is also plausible that patients with prior arrhythmias likely have a more arrhythmogenic substrate. </p><p>Studies have also suggested worse outcomes in those with symptomatic CS. Patients with symptomatic CS and coexisting pulmonary involvement account for approximately 5 percent of all cases of sarcoidosis and experience worse survival than other patients with extracardiac sarcoidosis. By contrast, 30 to 50 percent of patients with pulmonary disease have structural but asymptomatic cardiac abnormalities that appear to have a less profound impact on survival [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-and-prognosis-of-cardiac-sarcoidosis/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. In the above cited study of the prognostic significance of sustained VT, worse New York Heart Association functional class and larger LV end diastolic diameter were additional independent predictors of mortality [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-and-prognosis-of-cardiac-sarcoidosis/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. </p><p>An early autopsy series of 113 patients concluded that survival in most patients with CS was limited to approximately two years after the development of cardiac symptoms and signs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-and-prognosis-of-cardiac-sarcoidosis/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. However, substantially better outcomes were noted in two later reports in which 44 percent of 250 patients and 75 percent of 75 glucocorticoid-treated patients survived for more than five years following their diagnosis of CS [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-and-prognosis-of-cardiac-sarcoidosis/abstract/4,9,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,9,10</a>]. Most patients in these series ultimately died from cardiac complications of sarcoidosis, including ventricular tachyarrhythmias, conduction disturbances, and progressive cardiac failure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-and-prognosis-of-cardiac-sarcoidosis/abstract/4,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,8</a>].</p><p>These relationships were illustrated in a report cited above, in which 19 of 101 patients with biopsy-proven CS presented with cardiac symptoms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-and-prognosis-of-cardiac-sarcoidosis/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. There were two major findings:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>CS was diagnosed much more frequently in symptomatic patients (84 versus 4 percent).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Symptomatic patients were at high risk. At a mean follow-up of 1.7 years, 4 of the 19 patients died, and nine received a pacemaker <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> an ICD. By contrast, there were no adverse cardiac events in the 82 asymptomatic patients.</p><p/><p>While patients with asymptomatic CS are thought to have a more benign course, sudden death can occur as an initial clinical manifestation of disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-and-prognosis-of-cardiac-sarcoidosis/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. Thus, optimal detection and management of CS require heightened clinical suspicions of CS and close monitoring of CS disease progression, even for asymptomatic patients. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H150420123\"><span class=\"h3\">Prognostic value of advanced cardiac imaging</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Several studies have demonstrated that advanced cardiac imaging with cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) or <sup>18</sup>F-fluorodeoxyglucose-positron emission tomography (FDG-PET) has predictive value for adverse cardiovascular events including death [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-and-prognosis-of-cardiac-sarcoidosis/abstract/2,12,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,12,13</a>]. In fact, once accounting for abnormal findings based on FDG-PET or CMR, the association between EF and subsequent events is no longer significant. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3994728747\"><span class=\"h4\">Cardiac PET studies</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Retrospective studies in patients with known or suspected CS have found that abnormal cardiac PET findings are associated with adverse cardiac events including sustained VT and death, as illustrated by the following studies.</p><p>A retrospective study of 118 patients referred for cardiac PET with known or suspected CS with a mean follow-up of 1.5 years found that 31 patients (26 percent) developed death or VT requiring therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-and-prognosis-of-cardiac-sarcoidosis/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. Patients who had both abnormal uptake of FDG by the myocardium (eg, focal inflammation) and a resting perfusion defect (eg, scar or compression of the microvasculature) had a fourfold increase in the annual rate of VT or death compared with patients with normal imaging. These findings remained significant even after accounting for the Japanese Ministry of Health and Welfare (JMHW) criteria [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-and-prognosis-of-cardiac-sarcoidosis/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>] and LVEF. Individuals who had evidence of focal FDG uptake involving the right ventricle had the highest rate of death or VT [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-and-prognosis-of-cardiac-sarcoidosis/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. The presence of evidence of extracardiac inflammation was not associated with adverse events, suggesting that such features should not be used in deciding on the role of ICD therapy.</p><p>Another retrospective study of 31 patients with suspected CS found a similarly high event rate, as nine patients experienced events over a follow-up of 1.2 years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-and-prognosis-of-cardiac-sarcoidosis/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. The majority of adverse cardiac events occurred in individuals with abnormal FDG uptake.</p><p>A retrospective study of 203 patients referred for cardiac PET with a mean follow-up of 1.8 years found that 63 patients (31 percent) developed death, ventricular arrhythmia requiring defibrillation, or heart transplantation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-and-prognosis-of-cardiac-sarcoidosis/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. Events were more common in patients with abnormal cardiac PET studies, and quantitative measures of the extent and severity of resting perfusion defects in segments that had evidence of inflammation were found to have the highest association with adverse events, after accounting for baseline clinical risk factors and EF. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H345524795\"><span class=\"h4\">Cardiac magnetic resonance studies</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Observational studies in patients with suspected CS have suggested that CMR detection of late gadolinium enhancement (LGE) is associated with adverse outcomes. Collectively, these studies found that patients with suspected CS with LGE had significantly higher rates of death or ventricular arrhythmias than those without LGE. In part, this finding may reflect that most patients who do not have LGE do not have CS, but it also suggests that patients with suspected CS who demonstrate LGE should be considered for ICD therapy, particularly if they are symptomatic, have a reduced LVEF, or if they have other risk factors for having adverse events. </p><p>A systematic review and meta-analysis of patients referred to CMR imaging for known or suspected CS identified seven studies representing 694 subjects with mean follow-up of three years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-and-prognosis-of-cardiac-sarcoidosis/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. Overall, 29 percent of the patients had abnormal LGE on CMR, and the mean LVEF was 59 percent. Patients with LGE had a higher annual rate of all-cause mortality (3.1 versus 0.6 percent), cardiovascular mortality (1.9 versus 0.3 percent), and VT (5.9 versus 0 percent). These findings suggest that patients with known or suspected CS who do not have abnormal LGE on CMRs have an extremely low event rate. </p><p>Similar results were obtained by a second meta-analysis including 10 studies with a total of 760 patients with known or suspected CS referred for CMR imaging [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-and-prognosis-of-cardiac-sarcoidosis/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. Patients with LGE had higher odds for all-cause mortality during a mean follow-up of three years (10.5 versus 3.5 percent; odds ratio 3.06). </p><p>The following studies included in one or both meta-analyses illustrate the range of findings:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A study of 106 patients with known extracardiac sarcoidosis and suspected cardiac involvement found adverse cardiac events (SCD and VT) were more frequent among those with LGE consistent with CS on CMR than among those with only extracardiac disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-and-prognosis-of-cardiac-sarcoidosis/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. Among patients with CS detected by CMR, the presence of an ICD was associated with a lower rate of SCD.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A study of 81 patients with biopsy-proven extracardiac sarcoidosis compared modified JMHW criteria [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-and-prognosis-of-cardiac-sarcoidosis/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>] with LGE [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-and-prognosis-of-cardiac-sarcoidosis/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. The patients were followed for a mean of 21 months for major adverse events (death, appropriate ICD discharge, or symptomatic bradycardia requiring pacemaker placement). LGE was identified in 21 patients, while JMHW criteria identified cardiac disease in 10 patients, with eight overlapping. Obstructive coronary artery disease was excluded by coronary angiography in all patients with LGE, although 48 percent of LGE regions were in a coronary distribution. Patients with LGE had a ninefold higher rate of major adverse events (17.2 versus 1.9 percent per year) and an 11.5-fold higher rate of cardiac death (11.5 versus 1.0 percent per year) as compared with patients without LGE. JMHW-positive patients had only a 3.5-fold higher rate of adverse events (14.5 versus 4.1 percent per year) and a 3.9-fold higher cardiac death rate (9.7 versus 2.5 percent per year) as compared with JMHW-negative patients.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>One of the largest studies included in the meta-analysis was a study of 155 patients with suspected CS (83 percent with sarcoidosis confirmed by extracardiac biopsy) followed for a median of 2.6 years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-and-prognosis-of-cardiac-sarcoidosis/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. The 39 patients (25.5 percent) with cardiac involvement manifested by LGE on CMR had an over 30-fold increased risk of death, aborted SCD, or appropriate ICD discharge compared with patients without LGE [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-and-prognosis-of-cardiac-sarcoidosis/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. In a multivariable analysis including the initial LVEF, initial LV end diastolic volume, and initial presentation as HF, LGE was the best independent predictor of potentially lethal events.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A single-center study evaluating 205 patients with extracardiac sarcoidosis with preserved LVEF found that the presence of LGE on CMR was associated with increased risk of <span class=\"nowrap\">death/VT</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-and-prognosis-of-cardiac-sarcoidosis/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. Twenty percent of patients had LGE. The rate of <span class=\"nowrap\">death/VT</span> per year was more than 20 times higher for patients with LGE compared with patients without LGE (4.9 versus 0.2 percent). Risk of death or VT was associated with a greater burden of LGE (14 versus 5 percent) and with right ventricular dysfunction (right ventricular EF 45 versus 53 percent). </p><p/><p>While there are emerging data on various CMR quantitative techniques that may aid the detection of CS (eg, T1 and T2 mapping), data are lacking on how these parameters relate to prognosis.

For patients with CS who lack an indication for ICD therapy, the finding of inducible sustained VT would impact the decision to implant an ICD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-and-prognosis-of-cardiac-sarcoidosis/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H741758097\" class=\"local\">'Approach to ventricular arrhythmias'</a> below.)</p><p>Some observational studies suggest that EP testing may help identify those patients with CS who are likely to experience ventricular arrhythmias or SCD and that those with spontaneous or inducible arrhythmias should receive an ICD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-and-prognosis-of-cardiac-sarcoidosis/abstract/21,22\" class=\"abstract_t\">21,22</a>]. </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>One series included 32 patients with CS referred for evaluation of symptoms (palpitations, syncope, presyncope) <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> ventricular arrhythmia (including ventricular premature beats, nonsustained or sustained VT, or ventricular fibrillation [VF]) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-and-prognosis-of-cardiac-sarcoidosis/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. All 12 patients with spontaneous (six) or inducible (10; four with spontaneous) sustained VT or VF received an ICD. At a mean 32-month follow-up, 9 of the 12 patients who had received an ICD had received an appropriate shock. By contrast, 2 of 20 patients without ICDs experienced SCD or sustained ventricular arrhythmias.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a series of 76 patients with CS by cardiac FDG-PET or CMR imaging and no cardiac symptoms, 11 percent had inducible sustained ventricular arrhythmias and received an ICD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-and-prognosis-of-cardiac-sarcoidosis/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. LVEF was lower in patients with inducible ventricular arrhythmia (36.4 versus 55.8 percent). Over median five-year follow-up, six of eight patients in the group with inducible ventricular arrhythmias had appropriate ICD shocks or died compared with one death in the noninducible group.</p><p/><p>However, the added value of EP testing in risk stratification and management remains uncertain, since many patients with inducible ventricular arrhythmias meet criteria for ICD placement for primary prevention in nonischemic cardiomyopathy. In the earlier study cited above, the mean LVEF in the inducible VT group was 33 percent, and 40 percent of the inducible group had HF [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-and-prognosis-of-cardiac-sarcoidosis/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. Thus, many patients with inducible VT may meet criteria for ICD placement regardless of the EP study results or their sarcoidosis diagnosis.

In such cases, cardiologists (especially electrophysiologists and heart failure [HF] specialists), rheumatologists, imaging experts, and other specialists often work together to provide optimal patient management.</p><p>There are several challenges related to the management of patients with CS. First, data regarding the benefit of treatment are limited to small observational studies. Second, most of the treatments that are used (eg, immunosuppressive therapies and implantable cardioverter-defibrillators [ICDs]) have a high likelihood of adverse effects. Third, many patients may have probable (but not definitive) CS, and thus clinicians often have to decide whether or not to use various therapies in cases where the diagnosis may be uncertain. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H913208247\"><span class=\"h2\">Approach to management</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The first step in managing patients with suspected CS is determining the probability of CS, as described separately.

However, experts use differing criteria for identifying patients with CS who are candidates for immunosuppressive therapy; the recommendations below differ from those in the 2014 Heart Rhythm Society (HRS) consensus statement [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-and-prognosis-of-cardiac-sarcoidosis/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. </p><p>The following recommendations apply to patients with definite or probable CS:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients who have evidence of active myocardial inflammation (by <sup>18</sup>F-fluorodeoxyglucose-positron emission tomography [FDG-PET] or myocardial histology), we suggest immunosuppressive therapy.

Such assessment may include evaluation of the burden of inflammation in other organs, as determined by a limited whole-body FDG-PET study. Patients with CS who are asymptomatic and have a preserved LVEF have a low event rate; there are no current data supporting immunosuppressive therapy in this population. Thus, this recommendation is based upon indirect observational evidence on immunosuppressive therapy in patients with CS and depressed LVEF.</p><p/><p>The role of glucocorticoids in treating extracardiac disease is discussed separately.

Cardiac FDG-PET is not a test that is routinely available at most centers and often requires referral to a center that has PET availability, as well as expertise in the acquisition and interpretation of this exam.

However, while identification of increased T2 signal by CMR may have an adequate positive predictive value, the negative predictive value is low, and thus the absence of inflammation by CMR cannot be used to rule out myocardial inflammation or to determine that immunosuppressive therapy is not required.

Glucocorticoid therapy has been the most commonly used immunosuppressive agent in this setting, but there is lack of consensus on glucocorticoid dosing, duration of therapy, or when to use additional immunosuppressive agents in CS [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-and-prognosis-of-cardiac-sarcoidosis/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. The optimal dose of glucocorticoid therapy for CS is not known, and choosing a dose requires balancing the risk of side effects with the likelihood of response [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-and-prognosis-of-cardiac-sarcoidosis/abstract/4,26\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,26</a>]. It is unknown whether glucocorticoid dose should be adjusted for body surface area or whether the effective dose varies among patient populations. </p><p>For a patient with CS with an indication for immunosuppressive therapy, we suggest generally starting with a dose of 60 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day</span> of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prednisone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">prednisone</a> and gradually reducing this dose to a maintenance level of 10 to 15 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day</span> over one year. Patients who have complete resolution of inflammation can have recurrence of disease activity. Therefore, we suggest continuing low-dose glucocorticoid therapy (eg, prednisone 5 mg) for at least one year, especially if low-dose glucocorticoid therapy is well tolerated. Thus, glucocorticoid treatment should be continued for at least one to two years. In patients with significant inflammation, FDG-PET imaging at approximately six months of therapy may be reasonable to assess treatment response. If serial evaluations reveal that the disease is stable or dormant, glucocorticoids may be tapered and eventually discontinued. However, vigilance must continue for the rest of the patient's life, as relapses are common after tapering of glucocorticoid therapy. Any evidence of recurrence may be handled by reinstituting or increasing prednisone to 40 to 60 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day</span>. </p><p>Due to the side effect profile of glucocorticoids, the use of glucocorticoid-sparing agents is becoming increasingly common, either as an add-on to glucocorticoids or instead of glucocorticoids. </p><p>Alternative agents such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methotrexate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">methotrexate</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=azathioprine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">azathioprine</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=infliximab-including-biosimilars-of-infliximab-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">infliximab</a>, or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=mycophenolate-mofetil-cellcept-and-enteric-coated-mycophenolate-sodium-myfortic-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">mycophenolate</a> mofetil may be given to patients who do not respond to glucocorticoids or who cannot tolerate their side effects.

With this caveat, retrospective studies suggest that glucocorticoid therapy can improve AV block. In addition, there are limited data suggesting that glucocorticoid therapy may prevent LV dysfunction, particularly if treatment is initiated before the onset of moderate or severe systolic dysfunction. A means to predict who may or may not be glucocorticoid-responsive remains unknown. The effect of glucocorticoid therapy on ventricular arrhythmias is even less certain [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-and-prognosis-of-cardiac-sarcoidosis/abstract/27,28\" class=\"abstract_t\">27,28</a>]. </p><p>A systematic review of 10 studies included 257 patients treated with glucocorticoids and 42 patients not treated [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-and-prognosis-of-cardiac-sarcoidosis/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>].

Patients who had an initial LVEF &ge;55 percent were found to have preservation of LVEF and volumes, while patients who had an LVEF between 30 and 55 percent had a decrease in LV volumes and an improvement in LVEF.
