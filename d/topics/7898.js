The clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and treatment of GH deficiency in adults are discussed here. GH deficiency in children is discussed elsewhere.

The likelihood of GH deficiency in such patients has been estimated to range from approximately 45 percent in patients with no other pituitary hormone deficits to virtually 100 percent in patients with multiple deficits [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/growth-hormone-deficiency-in-adults/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].</p><p>When GH deficiency occurs in childhood due to any of the organic causes above, the deficiency will almost always persist into adulthood. In contrast, idiopathic GH deficiency in childhood may not persist. This topic is discussed in detail elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=growth-hormone-treatment-during-the-transition-period#H8327051\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Growth hormone treatment during the transition period&quot;, section on 'Isolated GHD'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-growth-hormone-deficiency-in-children#H1717695935\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of growth hormone deficiency in children&quot;, section on 'Duration of therapy'</a>.)</p><p>Although an entity referred to as &quot;idiopathic adult growth hormone deficiency&quot; has been postulated, it has not been well documented. A low GH response to a stimulus in the absence of a documented cause could result from obesity, which typically blunts the response to any stimulus [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/growth-hormone-deficiency-in-adults/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL MANIFESTATIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The most prominent feature of GH deficiency in children is short stature (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diagnosis-of-growth-hormone-deficiency-in-children\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Diagnosis of growth hormone deficiency in children&quot;</a>). Individuals who develop GH deficiency in adulthood experience a decrease in lean body mass, bone mineral density (BMD), and quality of life; an increase in fat mass; and increased rate of fractures, cardiovascular disease, and mortality [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/growth-hormone-deficiency-in-adults/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Individuals with childhood-onset GH deficiency that persists into adulthood have more severe clinical manifestations than those who develop it as adults [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/growth-hormone-deficiency-in-adults/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].</p><p>The contribution of GH deficiency itself to the clinical manifestations is uncertain because of the possible contribution of concomitant conditions, including the other pituitary hormonal deficiencies; treatment or overtreatment with replacement hormones, such as glucocorticoids; and the consequences of surgery on the pituitary or hypothalamus.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Body composition</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Studies using different techniques indicate that lean body mass is decreased in adults who are deficient in GH and not replaced compared with those who have normal GH secretion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/growth-hormone-deficiency-in-adults/abstract/7-10\" class=\"abstract_t\">7-10</a>]. As an example, computed tomographic (CT) measurements of the cross-sectional area of arm and thigh muscle show that muscle mass is decreased in patients with GH deficiency when compared with normal subjects [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/growth-hormone-deficiency-in-adults/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. Improvement in body composition is probably the best-documented effect of GH treatment in adults with hypopituitarism. (See <a href=\"#H1758363\" class=\"local\">'Effects of treatment'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Bone mineral density and fractures</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>BMD of the lumbar spine is somewhat lower in patients with adult-onset GH deficiency and not replaced, compared with normal subjects. The degree of osteopenia appears to correlate directly with the degree of GH deficiency; however, the number and severity of other hormonal deficiencies are also more pronounced in patients with more severe GH deficiency [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/growth-hormone-deficiency-in-adults/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. As a result, it is not possible to determine from available data which factors are most important in the development of low BMD.</p><p>Limited data suggest an increased incidence of fractures in patients with GH deficiency. In one report, the prevalence of a history of fracture in 107 patients, men and women, with hypopituitarism, including GH deficiency, was more than three times that in a control group of 323 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/growth-hormone-deficiency-in-adults/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. In a second study, in 422 patients with a pituitary disorder, those who had a subnormal GH response to stimulation had nearly five times more fractures than those who had a normal GH response [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/growth-hormone-deficiency-in-adults/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Quality of life</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients who develop GH deficiency in adulthood often perceive themselves as less healthy and less energetic than normal subjects of the same age [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/growth-hormone-deficiency-in-adults/abstract/14-16\" class=\"abstract_t\">14-16</a>]. They have lower scores on quality of life questionnaires when compared with healthy controls, which improved in response to GH therapy.

In one retrospective study, patients with hypopituitarism had a mortality rate twice that of age- and sex-matched normal subjects, a difference due to an increased number of cardiovascular events [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/growth-hormone-deficiency-in-adults/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. A later report by the same authors and another series found an increase in overall mortality in patients with hypopituitarism but did not confirm that the increased mortality was due to cardiovascular disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/growth-hormone-deficiency-in-adults/abstract/3,24\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,24</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h1\">DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The diagnosis of GH deficiency in an adult should be based on the combination of documented pituitary or hypothalamic disease, panhypopituitarism, and a subnormal serum insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) concentration (lower than the gender- and age-specific lower limit of normal). If the IGF-1 value is equivocal, a subnormal serum GH response to a potent stimulus will confirm the diagnosis.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H248671876\"><span class=\"h2\">Who should be evaluated?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Because the manifestations of GH deficiency are subtle and nonspecific, evaluation for this disorder should only be undertaken in individuals with a high likelihood of GH deficiency including:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Adults with known hypothalamic or pituitary disease (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=causes-of-hypopituitarism\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Causes of hypopituitarism&quot;</a>). The diagnosis of GH deficiency in adults is likely if the patient has documented panhypopituitarism, that is, documented deficiencies of thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH), corticotropin (ACTH), and gonadotropins. In a retrospective analysis of 817 adults who were evaluated for consideration of GH therapy, multiple deficiencies of other pituitary hormones correlated highly with a subnormal GH response to a stimulation test [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/growth-hormone-deficiency-in-adults/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. As noted below, a low serum IGF-1 concentration confirms the diagnosis of GH deficiency in these patients; provocative testing is not required [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/growth-hormone-deficiency-in-adults/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Adults with a history of GH deficiency in childhood. Some will be found to have normal GH secretion as adults, although this is not likely in those with GH deficiency due to an organic, such as pituitary adenoma.

Human GH is widely used as an anti-aging therapy, based upon the observation that serum GH and IGF-1 decrease with age. However, these declines have not been associated with important clinical consequences.</p><p>We also recommend against the use of GH therapy to otherwise healthy, older individuals. While administration of GH results in a decrease in fat mass and increase in lean body mass, these potential benefits are outweighed by its adverse effects, including soft tissue edema, arthralgias, carpal tunnel syndrome, and glucose intolerance [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/growth-hormone-deficiency-in-adults/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. In the United States, the off-label use of recombinant human GH (rhGH) as an anti-aging intervention is illegal.

Either insulin-induced hypoglycemia or the combination of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=arginine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">arginine</a> and GH-releasing hormone (GHRH) (or levodopa [L-DOPA]) is a potent stimulus of GH release. A subnormal increase in the serum GH concentration in a patient who has organic pituitary disease confirms the diagnosis of GH deficiency in those whose serum IGF-1 was equivocal (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F58987\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef58987 \">figure 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/growth-hormone-deficiency-in-adults/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. Because obesity impairs GH release, the GH cutoff to diagnose deficiency should be lower for obese patients than for those of normal weight. The effects of obesity on some specific tests are given below.</p><p>Other stimuli, such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=arginine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">arginine</a> alone, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clonidine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">clonidine</a>, L-DOPA, and the combination of arginine and L-DOPA are much weaker and therefore more likely to give false-positive results.

In countries where GHRH is not available (including the United States), we recommend a combination of two stimuli, eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=arginine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">arginine</a> and L-DOPA. Combinations of stimuli are generally more potent and have better receiver operating characteristics than a single stimulus [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/growth-hormone-deficiency-in-adults/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. For this reason, we disagree with the recommendation in the Endocrine Society guidelines of 2011 to use <a href=\"topic.htm?path=glucagon-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">glucagon</a> alone [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/growth-hormone-deficiency-in-adults/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>].

A bolus dose of GHRH, 1 <span class=\"nowrap\">mcg/kg</span> body weight, is given intravenously at time 0, followed immediately by an intravenous infusion of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=arginine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">arginine</a> hydrochloride, 0.5 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/kg</span> body weight (to a maximum of 30 g) over 30 minutes.

The dose of L-DOPA recommended for the arginine-L-DOPA stimulation test is 500 mg orally, given at the start of the arginine infusion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/growth-hormone-deficiency-in-adults/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. The dose of arginine hydrochloride is 30 g in a 10 percent solution, which is given as an infusion over 30 minutes.

There was no significant change in weight.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Total cholesterol decreased, but the change was not significant after adjustment for changes in body composition. BMD and other lipids did not change.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients receiving GH were significantly more likely to develop soft tissue edema, arthralgias, carpal tunnel syndrome, and gynecomastia.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A nonsignificant increase in the risk of developing impaired fasting glucose or type 2 diabetes was seen in the GH group.</p><p/><p>Thus, although combined rhGH-sex steroid supplementation appears to exert some modest beneficial effects on body composition in both men and women and possibly improve muscle strength and VO2max in men, significant adverse effects occur. Of further concern is the fact that mice with disrupted GH secretion or absent GH receptors live longer than normal mice, an observation that challenges the idea that GH is an anti-aging hormone [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/growth-hormone-deficiency-in-adults/abstract/94,95\" class=\"abstract_t\">94,95</a>].</p><p>Given the above, rhGH administration should be reserved for patients with documented GH deficiency.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1514881270\"><span class=\"h3\">Athletes</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The use of GH therapy by athletes is reviewed separately.

(See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Etiology'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Adults who have GH deficiency exhibit increased fat mass, decreased lean body mass, decreased bone mineral density (BMD), less energy, and greater mortality. The evidence for worse cardiovascular risk factors is conflicting. (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Clinical manifestations'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A serum insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) concentration lower than the age-specific lower limit of normal in a patient who has organic pituitary disease confirms the diagnosis of GH deficiency [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/growth-hormone-deficiency-in-adults/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. If the IGF-1 is not subnormal, a subnormal GH response to arginine-GH-releasing hormone (GHRH) (&lt;4.1 <span class=\"nowrap\">ng/mL)</span> is necessary to make the diagnosis.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">In countries where GHRH is available, we recommend the arginine-GHRH test. In countries where GHRH is not available (including the United States), we recommend a combination of two stimuli, eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=arginine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">arginine</a> and levodopa (L-DOPA). (See <a href=\"#H10\" class=\"local\">'Diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><a href=\"topic.htm?path=macimorelin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Macimorelin</a>, an orally available ghrelin agonist, has been approved for use in the diagnosis of patients with adult GH deficiency; the accuracy of the macimorelin stimulation test is comparable with the arginine-GHRH test (the currently recommended test). However, macimorelin testing requires only a single oral dose of medication, while the arginine-GHRH test requires an intravenous infusion; GHRH is unavailable in some countries. (See <a href=\"#H2874403454\" class=\"local\">'Macimorelin stimulation test'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Evaluation should be performed in adults who had been diagnosed as having GH deficiency in childhood because many of them have been found to have normal GH secretion in adulthood. (See <a href=\"#H10\" class=\"local\">'Diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Normal aging is <strong>not</strong> a reason to evaluate for GH deficiency. The risks of human GH as an anti-aging intervention outweigh its benefits. In the United States, this off-label use of GH is illegal. (See <a href=\"#H196589454\" class=\"local\">'Who should not be evaluated?'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Substantial evidence suggests that GH treatment in adults who acquired GH deficiency in adulthood results in an increase in muscle mass and a decrease in body fat, improvement in exercise capacity though not in muscle strength, improvement in BMD in men but not women, and improvement in some parameters of cardiac function. The evidence concerning improvements in the sense of well-being and serum lipids and other markers of cardiovascular risk is conflicting. (See <a href=\"#H17\" class=\"local\">'GH therapy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For adult patients with childhood onset of GH deficiency due to organic diseases and severe clinical manifestations and unequivocal biochemical evidence of GH deficiency, we suggest GH replacement (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). (See <a href=\"#H18\" class=\"local\">'Who should be treated?'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For those with adult onset of GH deficiency, we suggest not treating with GH (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). However, patient values and preferences may affect this decision. (See <a href=\"#H18\" class=\"local\">'Who should be treated?'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>To minimize side effects, we start with low doses of GH (2 to 5 <span class=\"nowrap\">mcg/kg</span> body weight once daily). (See <a href=\"#H20\" class=\"local\">'Treatment protocol'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>If the serum IGF-1 concentration has not increased to within the normal range after two months of therapy, the daily dose should be increased stepwise in 1 to 2 <span class=\"nowrap\">mcg/kg</span> increments at two-month intervals until it is normal. If side effects occur or the serum IGF-1 concentration increases to above normal at any dose, the dose should be decreased.
