Palliative care is applicable early in the course of terminal illness in conjunction with other therapies that are intended to prolong life; it is not limited to end of life care [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/palliative-care-end-stage-liver-disease/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Palliative services, including setting patient-centered achievable goals for medical care and aggressive symptom management, should be routinely offered alongside curative and disease-modifying treatments for patients with serious illnesses (the simultaneous care model). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=benefits-services-and-models-of-subspecialty-palliative-care#H914734\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Benefits, services, and models of subspecialty palliative care&quot;, section on 'Rationale for palliative care'</a>.)</p><p>Palliative care has been best studied and implemented among patients with malignancy, yet there is growing evidence of the many benefits of integration of palliative care for a variety of advanced illnesses. Despite being the 12<sup>th</sup> most common cause of death in the United States [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/palliative-care-end-stage-liver-disease/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>], end-stage liver disease (ESLD) has only recently become a focus of palliative care research.</p><p>Palliative care issues in adult patients with ESLD will be reviewed here. An overview of the benefits, services, and models of subspecialty palliative care is provided elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=benefits-services-and-models-of-subspecialty-palliative-care\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Benefits, services, and models of subspecialty palliative care&quot;</a>.) </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2947572165\"><span class=\"h1\">DEFINITIONS, CLINICAL COURSE, AND CAUSES OF DEATH</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4106125990\"><span class=\"h2\">Cirrhosis versus end-stage liver disease</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Cirrhosis represents the irreversible late stage of chronic progressive liver disease; it is characterized by the distortion of hepatic architecture and the formation of regenerative nodules. Patients with cirrhosis who have not developed major complications are classified as having compensated cirrhosis. Patients who have developed complications of cirrhosis, such as variceal hemorrhage, ascites, spontaneous bacterial peritonitis, hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), hepatorenal syndrome, or hepatopulmonary syndrome, are considered to have decompensated cirrhosis. These complications are the primary causes of death in ESLD. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cirrhosis-in-adults-overview-of-complications-general-management-and-prognosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Cirrhosis in adults: Overview of complications, general management, and prognosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The term &ldquo;end-stage liver disease&rdquo; is synonymous with advanced liver disease, liver failure, and decompensated cirrhosis, given the general irreversibility of these conditions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/palliative-care-end-stage-liver-disease/abstract/3-5\" class=\"abstract_t\">3-5</a>]. However, in contrast to other terminal illnesses, liver transplantation can be a definitive and potentially curative treatment for irreversible liver disease. While liver transplantation is a viable treatment option for patients with decompensated cirrhosis (and for patients who develop HCC in the setting of cirrhosis as long as they meet criteria for listing), many are not candidates for transplantation because of clinical and social factors. Furthermore, the number of patients who qualify for transplantation is much greater than the availability of donor organs. Because of wait times for organ transplantation, approximately 14 percent of patients on a transplant waitlist die annually [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/palliative-care-end-stage-liver-disease/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. Many others will be delisted as they become too ill for transplantation. Thus, even with the hope of transplant, most patients with decompensated cirrhosis will die as a result of their underlying illness [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/palliative-care-end-stage-liver-disease/abstract/7,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,8</a>]. It may seem counterintuitive to initiate palliative care for patients considered for transplant because of the potential for cure; however, the potential for adverse outcomes and significant symptom burden is also high. Therefore, it is appropriate to initiate palliative care, even while recognizing the possibility of long-term survival. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cirrhosis-in-adults-overview-of-complications-general-management-and-prognosis#H60387124\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Cirrhosis in adults: Overview of complications, general management, and prognosis&quot;, section on 'Liver transplantation'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=liver-transplantation-in-adults-patient-selection-and-pretransplantation-evaluation\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Liver transplantation in adults: Patient selection and pretransplantation evaluation&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=staging-and-prognostic-factors-in-hepatocellular-carcinoma\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Staging and prognostic factors in hepatocellular carcinoma&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=liver-transplantation-for-hepatocellular-carcinoma\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Liver transplantation for hepatocellular carcinoma&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3336011931\"><span class=\"h2\">Disease trajectory and estimating prognosis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The prognosis of cirrhosis is highly variable since it is influenced by a number of factors, including etiology, severity, type of and severity of complications, and comorbid disease. Patients with compensated cirrhosis have a median survival that may extend beyond 12 years. Patients with decompensated cirrhosis have a worse prognosis than do those with compensated cirrhosis; the average survival without transplantation is approximately two years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/palliative-care-end-stage-liver-disease/abstract/9,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,10</a>]. The trajectory of functional decline in patients with decompensated cirrhosis may be erratic and unpredictable, and many patients are in a constant state of poor or declining health interspersed by intermittent exacerbations and hospitalizations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/palliative-care-end-stage-liver-disease/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. Death may be relatively sudden and unexpected. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cirrhosis-in-adults-overview-of-complications-general-management-and-prognosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Cirrhosis in adults: Overview of complications, general management, and prognosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p>In general, the degree of hepatic decompensation is an important determinant of prognosis. Multiple studies have attempted to predict the prognosis based upon clinical and laboratory assessment of liver function. Two commonly used models are the Child-Pugh classification and the Model for End-Stage Liver disease (MELD) score. </p><p>An important point is that, although these predictive models are useful for predicting long-term outcomes in ESLD and guiding treatment decisions, they do not always align with the patient&rsquo;s reported functional status and sense of well-being.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2820597767\"><span class=\"h3\">Child-Pugh classification</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The Child-Pugh classification (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F78401\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef78401 \">table 1</a>) was initially developed to assess the risk of non-shunt operations in patients with cirrhosis (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=calculator-child-pugh-classification-for-severity-of-liver-disease\" class=\"calc calc_professional\">calculator 1</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=calculator-child-pugh-classification-for-severity-of-liver-disease-si-units\" class=\"calc calc_professional\">calculator 2</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/palliative-care-end-stage-liver-disease/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. Patients with a score of 5 or 6 have Child-Pugh class A cirrhosis (well-compensated cirrhosis), those with a score of 7 to 9 have Child-Pugh class B cirrhosis (significant functional compromise), and those with a score of 10 to 15 have Child-Pugh class C cirrhosis (decompensated cirrhosis).</p><p>The Child-Pugh classification system correlates with survival in patients with cirrhosis; one-year survival rates for patients with Child-Pugh class A, B, and C cirrhosis are approximately 100, 80, and 45 percent, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/palliative-care-end-stage-liver-disease/abstract/13,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,14</a>].

The MELD score is based upon bilirubin levels, creatinine, the international normalized ratio (INR; a measure of hepatic synthetic function), and sodium level (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=calculator-meld-and-meldna-scores-for-liver-transplantation-listing-purposes-not-appropriate-for-patients-under-age-12-years\" class=\"calc calc_professional\">calculator 3</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=calculator-meld-and-meldna-scores-for-liver-transplantation-listing-purposes-not-appropriate-for-patients-under-age-12-years-si-units\" class=\"calc calc_professional\">calculator 4</a>). The MELD score has been adopted for use in prioritizing patients awaiting liver transplantation and has an expanding role in predicting outcomes in patients with liver disease in the non-transplantation setting. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=model-for-end-stage-liver-disease-meld\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Model for End-stage Liver Disease (MELD)&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The utility of the MELD score for predicting mortality among patients awaiting liver transplantation was demonstrated in a study that included 3437 adult liver transplantation candidates who were listed between 1999 and 2001 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/palliative-care-end-stage-liver-disease/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. Of these, 412 died during the three-month follow-up period. Waiting list mortality was directly proportional to the MELD score at the time of listing, with mortality being 1.9 percent for patients with MELD scores less than 9, and 71 percent for patients with MELD scores &ge;40 (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F77732\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef77732 \">figure 1</a>). A table using MELD scores to predict 3, 6, 12, and 24-month survival is provided (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PALC%2F109535\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef109535 \">table 2</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/palliative-care-end-stage-liver-disease/abstract/9,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,15</a>].</p><p>Although the MELD score has a better ability to predict 90-day mortality than does the Child-Pugh classification [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/palliative-care-end-stage-liver-disease/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>], an important limitation is that clinical markers, such as ascites and varices, that represent portal hypertension are excluded from the model. Patients with portal hypertension are often at a higher risk for short-term mortality compared with those without portal hypertension and similar MELD scores [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/palliative-care-end-stage-liver-disease/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. Furthermore, the longitudinal ability of MELD to predict survival beyond three months is not established [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/palliative-care-end-stage-liver-disease/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. </p><p>The utility of these predictive models in estimating prognosis among patients with decompensated cirrhosis is illustrated by a systematic review that found that the median survival was &le;6 months in patients with decompensated cirrhosis, and a Child-Pugh score &ge;12 or a MELD score &ge;21 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/palliative-care-end-stage-liver-disease/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. In addition, patients with decompensated cirrhosis who had been hospitalized with an acute liver-related illness (eg, variceal hemorrhage or spontaneous bacterial peritonitis) had a median survival of &le;6 months if the Child-Pugh score was &ge;12 or the MELD score was &ge;18. Patients with ESLD who have an estimated survival of six months or less may be eligible for hospice care, particularly if they are not candidates for transplantation.

Ideally, palliative care should be provided throughout the trajectory of illness, beginning with the diagnosis of ESLD. Relief of emotional distress and physical symptoms can be provided by primary care physicians and gastrointestinal and hepatology specialists (termed primary palliative care, to distinguish it from secondary or subspecialty palliative care). Ideal timing of subspecialty palliative care consultation depends on local resources and patient need. (See <a href=\"#H1188404935\" class=\"local\">'What is the difference between primary and secondary (subspecialty) palliative care?'</a> below and <a href=\"#H1767197961\" class=\"local\">'Indications for a specialty palliative care consultation'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2268346623\"><span class=\"h2\">What is the difference between palliative care and hospice?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>While hospice and palliative care share the same principles of providing comfort and support for patients, palliative care differs from hospice care. In the United States, the term hospice is used to describe a model of palliative care that is offered to patients with a terminal disease who are at the end of life (generally with an estimated life expectancy of six months or less) when curative or life-prolonging therapy is no longer the focus of treatment. In contrast, palliative care should be appropriately offered to patients at any time along the trajectory of any type of serious life-threatening illness, even concurrent with restorative, life-prolonging therapies. While all care that is delivered by hospice programs can be considered palliative care, not all palliative care is considered to be hospice care.</p><p>Eligibility for hospice care generally requires that a physician estimate that life expectancy is six months or less. Estimating prognosis in ESLD is discussed above, and disease-specific criteria for hospice referral for patients with ESLD, as well as non-disease specific criteria are outlined in the tables (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PALC%2F106152\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef106152 \">table 3</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PALC%2F87321\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef87321 \">table 4</a>) and discussed in more detail below. (See <a href=\"#H3336011931\" class=\"local\">'Disease trajectory and estimating prognosis'</a> above and <a href=\"#H3674109\" class=\"local\">'Considerations for end of life care and hospice referral'</a> below.) </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1188404935\"><span class=\"h2\">What is the difference between primary and secondary (subspecialty) palliative care?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Hospice and Palliative Medicine is now recognized as a medical subspecialty by the American Board of Medical Specialties, as well as in Canada, England, Ireland, Australia, New Zealand, and many other countries. Many other European countries are also in the process of developing certification for palliative care. In most jurisdictions, palliative care is provided by an interdisciplinary team of specially trained physicians, nurses, social workers, chaplains, and other specialists with advanced training in palliative care, who work with a patient&rsquo;s other clinicians to provide an &ldquo;extra layer&rdquo; of support. Clinicians who are specifically trained in palliative care can provide in-depth pain and symptom management, communication regarding goals of care, and care coordination across settings and over time. Subspecialty palliative care services are most available in high-income countries in the inpatient setting, as exemplified by the United States. The availability of subspecialty palliative care services in low-income countries is generally quite limited. Subspecialty palliative care may be delivered in a number of settings across the continuum of health care, including in the home, nursing homes, long-term acute care facilities, acute care hospitals, and outpatient clinics [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/palliative-care-end-stage-liver-disease/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. Moreover, palliative care can also include bereavement care for family and loved ones following the death of the patient. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=benefits-services-and-models-of-subspecialty-palliative-care\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Benefits, services, and models of subspecialty palliative care&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=palliative-care-and-hospice-outside-of-the-united-states\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Palliative care and hospice outside of the United States&quot;</a>.)</p><p>In order for the large number of patients with serious life-threatening illness to benefit from palliative care, it is important that supportive services not only be provided by specialists but also be incorporated into the practices of all clinicians who are caring for persons with serious and complex illness, such as ESLD. Some term this &ldquo;primary&rdquo; palliative care to distinguish it from &ldquo;secondary&rdquo; or &ldquo;subspecialty&rdquo; palliative care [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/palliative-care-end-stage-liver-disease/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. Primary palliative care encompasses any type of supportive care that is delivered by all health care professionals caring for patients with serious life-threatening illness. Clinicians caring for these patients need to attain competence in providing comprehensive supportive care, including initiating and carrying out advance care planning (ACP), assessing and addressing symptoms, recognizing distress, and the appropriate referral for issues not adequately addressed by the primary care or subspecialist non-palliative-care clinician (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PALC%2F107897\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef107897 \">table 5</a>).

Complications of chronic liver disease compromise health-related quality of life (HRQOL), which worsens as disease severity increases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/palliative-care-end-stage-liver-disease/abstract/25-28\" class=\"abstract_t\">25-28</a>]. Over a decade ago, the Study to Understand Prognoses and Preferences for Outcomes and Risks of Treatments (SUPPORT) study demonstrated that patients with ESLD have rates of moderate to severe pain toward the end of life that are similar to those of patients with lung or colorectal cancer [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/palliative-care-end-stage-liver-disease/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. Most patients in this study expressed a preference for dying rather than living in a coma or on prolonged life support, suggesting the importance of understanding patients&rsquo; preferences for care, especially for end of life approaches. Other more recent studies have confirmed the high rate of pain and other symptoms in cohorts of patients with ESLD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/palliative-care-end-stage-liver-disease/abstract/30,31\" class=\"abstract_t\">30,31</a>].</p><p>Furthermore, even patients listed for liver transplantation experience significant functional decline while awaiting a donor organ [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/palliative-care-end-stage-liver-disease/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>], and they have high rates of both physical and psychological suffering [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/palliative-care-end-stage-liver-disease/abstract/26-28\" class=\"abstract_t\">26-28</a>]. Many people die while awaiting transplant. The current system for organ allocation, which is based upon the severity of the underlying liver disease, has left many patients in a sort of limbo, which has been described as &ldquo;too well for transplant but too sick for life&rdquo; [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/palliative-care-end-stage-liver-disease/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>].

For example, pain related to ascites often will respond to paracentesis, and edema pain may respond to diuresis. It is also important to integrate patients&rsquo; preferences into the pain treatment plan. For example, some patients may favor alertness over pain control, and this preference may change as the disease progresses.</p><p>NSAIDs should generally be avoided in this population. <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acetaminophen-paracetamol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Acetaminophen</a> should be limited to 2 to 3 g in a 24-hour period (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F90196\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef90196 \">table 9</a>). Opioids should be used with caution in patients with ESLD (due to challenges with metabolism), but often they are the best option for pain management, especially at the end of life. When initiating opioid therapy in this patient population, lower doses with extended dosing intervals should be employed, with careful monitoring of side effects (changes in respiratory patterns, level of consciousness and cognition, myoclonus, and nausea). Titrations should be made with caution, and patients and their families should be made aware of the signs of opioid toxicity.

Assessment of nutritional status in the setting of decompensated cirrhosis is challenging because of volume and sodium shifts, hepatic synthetic dysfunction, and changes in energy metabolism. Nonetheless, for the pretransplant patient, an assessment of weight history, dietary intake, gastrointestinal symptoms, and signs and symptoms of nutritional deficiency (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F78426\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef78426 \">table 10</a>), laboratory assessment of nutritional status, and a more formal assessment of nutritional status using the patient-generated subjective global assessment (SGA) tool [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/palliative-care-end-stage-liver-disease/abstract/58\" class=\"abstract_t\">58</a>] may be indicated.

This information is used to guide future health care choices in the context of care that is medically reasonable and appropriate. In an ideal ACP discussion, the clinicians, patient, and his or her loved ones think through particular approaches to follow if (or when) the patient&rsquo;s health progressively declines and plan for managing a potential episode of acute decompensation. This process is iterative and typically occurs longitudinally within the context of an existing and continuing medical relationship. General issues of ACP are discussed separately (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=advance-care-planning-and-advance-directives\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Advance care planning and advance directives&quot;</a>). For patients with ESLD, ACP can facilitate decisions around end of life care that reflect a patient&rsquo;s goals and values [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/palliative-care-end-stage-liver-disease/abstract/60\" class=\"abstract_t\">60</a>]. </p><p>However, there are several challenges to ACP in ESLD:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A common symptom of ESLD, encephalopathy, may limit a patient&rsquo;s decision-making capacity at times during illness, making early planning, including identification of a surrogate decision maker and conversations with this individual, important. If this does not happen, many surrogate decision makers have difficulty predicting what their loved would want in future circumstances; they may incorrectly predict a patient&rsquo;s treatment preferences in up to one-third of cases. It is critical to establish goals of care and ACP at a time when cognitive function is intact. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=advance-care-planning-and-advance-directives#H616076112\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Advance care planning and advance directives&quot;, section on 'Surrogate decision makers'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Lack of social support, substance abuse, and caregiver burden are prevalent in this population, which can lead to challenges with communication and care planning [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/palliative-care-end-stage-liver-disease/abstract/40,54,61,62\" class=\"abstract_t\">40,54,61,62</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Consideration of transplant should be an indicator for ACP given the high risk of death, despite hope for cure, which may seem counterintuitive for some physicians. (See <a href=\"#H3336011931\" class=\"local\">'Disease trajectory and estimating prognosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2955198115\"><span class=\"h3\">When to begin the discussion</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>ACP discussions should begin early in the disease process, when the patient is well enough to participate. Based upon data from patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), most patients and their families find these discussions to be less stressful and prefer to have these conversations in a stable medical state when they are able to make clear decisions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/palliative-care-end-stage-liver-disease/abstract/63\" class=\"abstract_t\">63</a>]. Having these discussions early in the disease trajectory will make it easier to return to these discussions at a later time, if needed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/palliative-care-end-stage-liver-disease/abstract/64,65\" class=\"abstract_t\">64,65</a>].</p><p>Because of the possibility of transplantation, a subset of patients pursue curative efforts until the end of life; palliative <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> hospice care frequently is not provided or suggested until the hope of recovery or transplantation is extinguished, which is often in the last weeks of life. Because of this, patients with ESLD are more likely than those without chronic liver disease to receive aggressive care despite declining poor health, and lower quality end of life care [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/palliative-care-end-stage-liver-disease/abstract/30,37,66\" class=\"abstract_t\">30,37,66</a>]. Although it may seem counterintuitive, consideration of transplantation should be an indicator for ACP given the high risk of death, despite hope for a cure. In this setting, discussions should include preparing the patent and family for a range of potential outcomes, including a drastic decline <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> the development of complications that eliminate the patient as a transplant candidate, or the patient undergoing a transplant and then dying of complications related to the procedure.</p><p>Discussions about ACP should be patient centered and sensitive, balancing hope with reality. Eliciting information about the patient&rsquo;s perception of the impact of the disease in their life, disease severity, and prognosis will guide the clinician in achieving this balance. Sensitivity to the individual patient&rsquo;s response to a discussion of these issues is essential due to the broad variation in patient responses. Discussions about prognosis and the process of dying can be especially difficult. Issues related to communication of prognosis in patients with serious life-threatening illness and practical guidance for discussing prognosis are addressed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=communication-of-prognosis-in-palliative-care\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Communication of prognosis in palliative care&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=discussing-serious-news\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Discussing serious news&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3674109\"><span class=\"h2\">Considerations for end of life care and hospice referral</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Hospice care is a model and philosophy of care that focuses on palliating a terminally ill patient&rsquo;s pain and other symptoms and attending to their and their family&rsquo;s emotional and spiritual needs. At least in the United States for the Medicare hospice benefit, hospice eligibility is restricted to patients who have an estimated survival of six months or less. Medicare guidelines for hospice eligibility among patients with ESLD are outlined in the table (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PALC%2F106152\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef106152 \">table 3</a>). A separate table that includes non-disease-specific guidelines for determining appropriateness for hospice referral in the United States Medicare program is also provided (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PALC%2F87321\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef87321 \">table 4</a>).</p><p>A systematic review of non-cancer conditions by Salpeter et al suggested that a median six-month prognosis could be expected in ESLD or decompensated cirrhosis when the Child-Pugh score was at least 12 <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> the MELD score was at least 21 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/palliative-care-end-stage-liver-disease/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H3336011931\" class=\"local\">'Disease trajectory and estimating prognosis'</a> above.)</p><p>Additionally, consensus-based quality indicators by a multidisciplinary expert panel for palliative care in ESLD due to cirrhosis suggest a referral for <span class=\"nowrap\">palliative/hospice</span> services if a patient has advanced ESLD and hepatocellular carcinoma with either a Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer (BCLC) stage D tumor (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F69566\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef69566 \">algorithm 1</a>), or hepatorenal syndrome and is not a candidate for transplant [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/palliative-care-end-stage-liver-disease/abstract/67\" class=\"abstract_t\">67</a>].</p><p>Outside of the United States, availability of hospice care is variable, and criteria for hospice eligibility have not been established.

Providing hospice care for patients awaiting transplant was the topic of a pilot study that showed that concurrent hospice care with transplant candidacy was feasible with specifically trained staff [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/palliative-care-end-stage-liver-disease/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>]. Of the 157 patents with ESLD admitted to hospice, 122 died while awaiting a transplant; the average MELD score was 21 at admission, and almost all patients with a MELD score above 18 died within several months. The mean length of stay was 38 days. Only six (5 percent) of the listed patients went on to a successful liver transplant.</p><p>Despite this positive experience, the hospice philosophy (in the United States and elsewhere [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/palliative-care-end-stage-liver-disease/abstract/68\" class=\"abstract_t\">68</a>]) remains generally aligned with patients whose goals are primarily focused on comfort at the end of life. For this reason, clarification of transplant status is often an important issue to inform decision-making.

While liver transplantation is a viable and potentially curative treatment option, many are not candidates because of clinical or social factors, comorbidity, or in the case of hepatocellular carcinoma, disease extent. Even with the hope of transplant, most patients with decompensated cirrhosis will die of this condition. (See <a href=\"#H2947572165\" class=\"local\">'Definitions, clinical course, and causes of death'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The prognosis of cirrhosis is highly variable. The trajectory of functional decline in patients with ESLD may be erratic and unpredictable, and many patients are in a constant state of poor or declining health interspersed by intermittent exacerbations and hospitalizations. Death may be sudden and unexpected. (See <a href=\"#H3336011931\" class=\"local\">'Disease trajectory and estimating prognosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">In general, the degree of hepatic decompensation, as reflected by the Child-Pugh classification or the Model for End-Stage Liver Disease (MELD) score, is an important determinant of prognosis. Although predictive models such as these are useful for predicting long-term outcomes in ESLD and guiding treatment decisions, they do not always align with the patient&rsquo;s reported functional status and sense of well-being, and they should not be used in isolation for determining eligibility for palliative or hospice care. (See <a href=\"#H2820597767\" class=\"local\">'Child-Pugh classification'</a> above and <a href=\"#H2109463884\" class=\"local\">'MELD score'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In our view, palliative care should be provided throughout the trajectory of illness, beginning with the diagnosis of ESLD, but much of this supportive care can be provided by primary care clinicians and gastrointestinal and hepatology specialists. Ideal timing of specialty palliative care consultation depends on local resources and patient need. An important point is that an increasing number of studies in patients with advanced cancer have suggested that earlier involvement leads to better patient outcomes. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=benefits-services-and-models-of-subspecialty-palliative-care#H914734\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Benefits, services, and models of subspecialty palliative care&quot;, section on 'Rationale for palliative care'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Important components of palliative care include exploring the patient&rsquo;s understanding about their illness and prognosis, assessing and managing symptoms, soliciting and discussing goals of care and advance care planning, coordinating care, and helping to plan end of life care, including determining the need for and timing of hospice care (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F109553\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef109553 \">table 8</a>). (See <a href=\"#H494770323\" class=\"local\">'What are the important components of palliative care in ESLD?'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Hospice can provide an extra layer of support for patients with ESLD and their caregivers when prognosis is estimated to be six months or less. It is noted that some pilot work using hospice concurrently with transplant candidacy has been done, but this is not widely available, and generally, the hospice philosophy is aligned with patients whose goals are primarily focused on comfort at the end of life. For this reason, clarification of transplant status is often an important issue to inform decision-making. (See <a href=\"#H3674109\" class=\"local\">'Considerations for end of life care and hospice referral'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Most symptoms of ESLD are best managed by following the tenets of high-quality cirrhosis care.
