BSIs may be either primary or secondary. Secondary infections are related to infections at other sites, such as the urinary tract, lung, postoperative wounds, and skin. Most nosocomial BSIs are primary, as illustrated by the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's National Nosocomial Infection Surveillance system, in which 64 percent of the nosocomial BSIs reported were primary BSIs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-pathogenesis-and-microbiology-of-intravascular-catheter-infections/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. While some primary BSIs have no identifiable source, most are associated with intravascular catheters, and central venous catheters (CVCs) in particular [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-pathogenesis-and-microbiology-of-intravascular-catheter-infections/abstract/3,4\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,4</a>].</p><p>CVCs are increasingly used in the inpatient and outpatient setting to provide long-term venous access. Infection of CVCs remains a major problem. It is estimated, for example, that approximately 90 percent of annual catheter-related bloodstream infections in the United States occur with CVCs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-pathogenesis-and-microbiology-of-intravascular-catheter-infections/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].</p><p>The epidemiology, risk factors, pathogenesis, and microbiology of intravascular catheter infections will be reviewed here. The diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of CVC-associated infections are discussed separately.

As an example, the incidence of CR-BSI associated with central lines among patients hospitalized in intensive care units (ICUs) in the United States decreased from 3.64 to 1.65 infections per 1000 central line days between 2001 and 2009 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-pathogenesis-and-microbiology-of-intravascular-catheter-infections/abstract/6,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,7</a>]. These decreases in the United States have continued through 2015 and appear to be sustained [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-pathogenesis-and-microbiology-of-intravascular-catheter-infections/abstract/8,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,9</a>]. This amounted to an estimated 18,000 central line&ndash;related infections in 2009. A similar trend of decreasing incidence has been observed in Canada [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-pathogenesis-and-microbiology-of-intravascular-catheter-infections/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. In contrast, the reported pooled incidence of central line&ndash;associated BSI across 422 ICUs in 36 countries in Latin America, Asia, Africa, and Europe from 2004 to 2009 was substantially higher, 6.8 events per 1000 central line days [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-pathogenesis-and-microbiology-of-intravascular-catheter-infections/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. Many of these sites are in resource-limited areas, and the high incidence is thought to be related to a lack of official regulations regarding catheter care.</p><p>Although ICU patients are generally exposed to more medical devices and are more severely ill than other hospitalized patients, CR-BSIs remain common in hospital wards outside the ICU. As an example, an estimated 23,000 central line&ndash;associated BSIs occurred among patients in inpatient wards in the United States in 2009 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-pathogenesis-and-microbiology-of-intravascular-catheter-infections/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. In a prospective analysis from the Surveillance and Control of Pathogens of Epidemiologic Importance (SCOPE) database, which evaluated the characteristics of 24,179 nosocomial BSIs from 49 hospitals in the United States between 1995 and 2002, the following findings were noted [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-pathogenesis-and-microbiology-of-intravascular-catheter-infections/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The incidence of nosocomial BSI was 60 cases per 10,000 hospital admissions.

In 2008 in the United States, an estimated 37,000 CR-BSIs occurred among patients receiving outpatient hemodialysis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-pathogenesis-and-microbiology-of-intravascular-catheter-infections/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tunneled-cuffed-hemodialysis-catheter-related-bacteremia\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Tunneled, cuffed hemodialysis catheter-related bacteremia&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Bloodstream infections associated with the widespread use of indwelling catheters have possibly contributed to the changing epidemiology of other infections. As an example, <em>Staphylococcus aureus</em> has emerged as a leading microbial cause of infective endocarditis in tertiary care centers, as illustrated by a study of a large international cohort of patients with both native and prosthetic valve endocarditis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-pathogenesis-and-microbiology-of-intravascular-catheter-infections/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>].

Furthermore, a number of studies have found a strong correlation between heavy skin colonization and both catheter colonization and subsequent catheter-related infection, especially with short-term intravascular devices [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-pathogenesis-and-microbiology-of-intravascular-catheter-infections/abstract/38,40-42\" class=\"abstract_t\">38,40-42</a>]. Microorganisms gain access to the catheter wound and migrate along the catheter-subcutaneous tract into the fibrin sheath that surrounds intravascular catheters. Scanning electron micrographs reveal that both the external and internal surfaces of catheters can become colonized with microorganisms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-pathogenesis-and-microbiology-of-intravascular-catheter-infections/abstract/43\" class=\"abstract_t\">43</a>].</p><p>The deposition of biofilm on the external and internal surface of vascular catheters is thought to play an important role in the colonization process. The biofilm is produced by a combination of host factors (eg, fibrinogen and fibrin) and microbial products (eg, glycocalyx or &quot;slime&quot;).</p><p>Thus, it is not surprising that common skin commensals, such as <em>S. aureus</em> and coagulase-negative staphylococci, are often isolated from colonized catheters and patients with primary bloodstream infections.

Catheter-related bloodstream infections (CR-BSI) are an important cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide, including resource-limited settings. (See <a href=\"#H1\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above and <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Epidemiology'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Hospitalized patients with burns or neutropenia are at particularly increased risk for nosocomial bloodstream infections. Other host risk factors include immune deficiencies in general, chronic illness, and malnutrition. (See <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Host factors'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>All types of intravascular catheters pose significant but varying risk of infection. Duration of catheterization, catheter material, insertion conditions, and site care also impact the risk of catheter-associated infections (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F63562\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef63562 \">table 1</a>). (See <a href=\"#H1532914\" class=\"local\">'Catheter factors'</a> above and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prevention-of-intravascular-catheter-related-infections\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Prevention of intravascular catheter-related infections&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Bloodstream infection associated with central venous catheters can be attributed to four major sources: colonization from the skin, intraluminal or hub contamination, secondary seeding from a bloodstream infection, and contamination of the infusate (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F64065\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef64065 \">figure 1</a>). Infections related to the administration of contaminated intravenous fluids are rare but should be suspected when bacteremia occurs in an otherwise low-risk patient or when there is a cluster of bloodstream infections with unusual organisms. (See <a href=\"#H2354186\" class=\"local\">'Sources of infection'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The skin flora is probably the most important source of intravascular catheter infection. Thus, coagulase-negative staphylococci and <em>Staphylococcus aureus</em>, common skin commensals, are the most common isolates from nosocomial bloodstream infections. Gram-negative pathogens predominate in patients with hematologic and nonhematologic malignancies. Infections with multidrug-resistant organisms are associated with high rates of treatment failure and death.
