Those who are good operative candidates have traditionally been offered surgical resection because of the high risk that adenocarcinoma is already present or will soon develop [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/barretts-esophagus-treatment-with-photodynamic-therapy/abstract/1-4\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-4</a>]. On the other hand, progression to adenocarcinoma is not universal, suggesting that an intensive surveillance program may be sufficient for some patients. Furthermore, esophagectomy is associated with significant short- and long-term morbidity and a 3 to 13 percent rate of surgical mortality depending in part upon surgical expertise and hospital volume. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-superficial-esophageal-cancer\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of superficial esophageal cancer&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=barretts-esophagus-surveillance-and-management\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Barrett's esophagus: Surveillance and management&quot;</a>.)</p><p>An alternative approach is based upon the observation that the destruction of intestinal metaplasia using a variety of chemical and thermal methods may be accompanied by regrowth of normal-appearing squamous epithelium, particularly if the patients are treated with proton pump inhibitors to keep them achlorhydric. Of the many endoscopic techniques that are capable of ablating columnar mucosa containing high-grade dysplasia, photodynamic therapy has attracted attention due to its novel approach and early success [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/barretts-esophagus-treatment-with-photodynamic-therapy/abstract/5-10\" class=\"abstract_t\">5-10</a>].</p><p>This topic review will focus on the efficacy of photodynamic therapy in the treatment of high-grade dysplasia, including patients with superficial cancers. Alternative approaches to patients with Barrett's esophagus are presented separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=barretts-esophagus-surveillance-and-management\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Barrett's esophagus: Surveillance and management&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=barretts-esophagus-treatment-with-radiofrequency-ablation\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Barrett's esophagus: Treatment with radiofrequency ablation&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=barretts-esophagus-treatment-of-high-grade-dysplasia-or-early-cancer-with-endoscopic-resection\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Barrett's esophagus: Treatment of high-grade dysplasia or early cancer with endoscopic resection&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">TECHNIQUE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Photodynamic therapy is based upon the ability of chemical agents, known as photosensitizers, to produce cytotoxicity in the presence of oxygen after stimulation by light of an appropriate wavelength. The most commonly used photosensitizer in the United States (and the only one approved by the US Food and Drug Administration for use in humans) is <a href=\"topic.htm?path=porfimer-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">porfimer</a> sodium (Photofrin, Pinnacle Biologics Inc). The usual dose for the treatment of esophageal cancer and Barrett's esophagus is 2 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> of body weight given as an intravenous bolus over three to five minutes. However, the recommended duration of light exposure is shorter for Barrett's esophagus than for patients with known esophageal cancer.</p><p>After systemic injection, the photosensitizer is absorbed by most tissues, but for reasons not yet clearly understood, it is selectively retained at a higher concentration by neoplastic tissue. Approximately 48 hours after injection, the ratio of photosensitizer in neoplastic tissue compared with non-neoplastic tissue is approximately 2:1 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/barretts-esophagus-treatment-with-photodynamic-therapy/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. However, residual photosensitizer may remain in the skin for up to 30 days rendering the patient sensitive to ambient sunlight and even strong indoor lighting. Thus, patients should be warned to avoid direct sunlight for four weeks after injection.</p><p>Newer photosensitizers with more favorable characteristics are being developed. One that has gained widespread interest (and is already used in Europe) is 5-aminolevulinic acid (5-ALA, Levulan Kerastick). The synthesis of 5-ALA from glycine and succinyl-CoA is the first step in heme biosynthesis (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F57890\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef57890 \">figure 1</a>). Because the heme biosynthetic pathway is regulated via a negative feedback control mechanism, exogenous administration of 5-ALA produces an increase in protoporphyrin-IX (PpIX), the immediate precursor of heme. This step, the rate limiting step, is regulated by the enzyme ferrochelatase, which incorporates iron into the molecule.</p><p>Advantages of 5-ALA compared with Photofrin are the ability to administer it orally and the shorter duration of skin photosensitivity (24 to 48 hours versus 30 days) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/barretts-esophagus-treatment-with-photodynamic-therapy/abstract/12,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,13</a>]. In addition, PpIX accumulates preferentially in the mucosa unlike Photofrin, which also accumulates in the submucosal vascular stroma, resulting in shallower tissue injury (and potentially fewer complications) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/barretts-esophagus-treatment-with-photodynamic-therapy/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. However, the deeper ablation associated with Photofrin may be required to penetrate the full thickness of the Barrett's mucosa.</p><p>Photosensitizers, as the name implies, are activated by light. In theory, any light source providing the appropriate wavelength of light to activate the photosensitizer can be used. Monochromatic light at wavelengths in the range of 360 to 650 nm are well absorbed. However, visible red light of 630 nm is typically used because it activates the photosensitizer and penetrates the tissue to a depth that produces the clinically desired effect.</p><p>Because of the energy density required at the tissue level, light is best provided by a laser. A variety of tunable dye lasers have been approved to activate photosensitizers. These laser units are capable of generating the desired red light and approximately 2 to 2.5 W of energy output. For endoscopic applications, the light is transmitted via a quartz optical fiber passed through the accessory channel of an endoscope. The tip of the diffusing fibers is provided in several lengths to better match the length of the lesion being treated.</p><p>For treatment of Barrett's esophagus with high-grade dysplasia, most operators recommend a power of 400 <span class=\"nowrap\">mW/cm</span> fiber for a total light energy dose of approximately 200 <span class=\"nowrap\">J/cm</span> fiber (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F62689%7EGAST%2F50907\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef62689 graphicRef50907 \">picture 1A-B</a>). Balloon diffusers have been made of a cylindrical diffuser fiber located in the center of a balloon. The advantage of this system over the diffusing fiber alone is that the balloon allows for a more homogeneous light application by flattening mucosal folds and permits a more central positioning of the fiber within the lumen [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/barretts-esophagus-treatment-with-photodynamic-therapy/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">EFFICACY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The efficacy of photodynamic therapy has been studied for both 5-aminolevulinic acid (5-ALA) and Photofrin, although the absolute numbers of patients reported is small.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Photofrin</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Photofrin is approved in the United States for treatment of high-grade dysplasia based upon the results of a controlled trial that included 208 patients who were randomly assigned to Photofrin plus <a href=\"topic.htm?path=omeprazole-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">omeprazole</a> or omeprazole alone [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/barretts-esophagus-treatment-with-photodynamic-therapy/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. Patients were followed every three months until four consecutive examinations were negative for high-grade dysplasia, after which they were followed semi-annually. Follow-up was approximately 3.5 years.</p><p>Complete ablation of high-grade dysplasia was observed significantly more often in the Photofrin group compared with controls (77 versus 39 percent). Furthermore, progression to cancer was observed significantly less often in the Photofrin group (13 versus 28 percent). Treatment related side effects were more common in the Photofrin group (94 versus 13 percent); serious complications occurred in 12 percent of patients (compared with 1 percent of omeprazole-treated patients). Strictures developed in 36 percent of patients; most (98 percent) resolved after dilation. The benefits on dysplasia resolution and cancer progression persisted at five years follow-up [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/barretts-esophagus-treatment-with-photodynamic-therapy/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>].</p><p>A separate report (from the same author but involving a different cohort) included 103 patients (14 with low-grade and 80 with high-grade dysplasia, and nine with superficial cancers) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/barretts-esophagus-treatment-with-photodynamic-therapy/abstract/17,18\" class=\"abstract_t\">17,18</a>]. Patients were treated with photodynamic therapy and then followed for an average of 51 months while on a maintenance dose of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=omeprazole-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">omeprazole</a>. Patients underwent subsequent upper endoscopies (with multiple biopsies aided by Lugol's iodine staining) at regular intervals. In 84 patients, residual or nonresponding areas of Barrett's mucosa were treated with an Nd:YAG laser; one to four sessions were required. One photodynamic therapy session was required in 69 patients, while 29 required two and five required three sessions. The following results were noted:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The length of Barrett's mucosa was reduced by a mean of 6.92 cm.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Of 65 patients with high-grade dysplasia in whom long-term follow-up was available, 94 percent had elimination of high-grade dysplasia while three (5 percent) developed subsquamous adenocarcinoma.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>On an intention-to-treat basis, success rates were 93, 78, and 44 percent respectively for low-grade and high-grade dysplasia, and early stage carcinoma.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Three patients developed atrial fibrillation, two of whom required hospitalization.

Endoscopic mucosal resection was also employed in 147 patients. After a median follow-up of 36 months, 45 patients (17 percent) had recurrent dysplasia. On multivariable analysis, predictors of recurrence were older age (hazard ratio [HR] 1.04), presence of residual nondysplastic Barrett's esophagus (HR 2.9), and a history of smoking (HR 2.7).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>An observational study involving 199 patients with five-year follow-up found similar survival with photodynamic therapy compared with esophagectomy (overall mortality 9 versus 8.5 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/barretts-esophagus-treatment-with-photodynamic-therapy/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>].

Patients were maintained on high-dose (20 to 80 mg) <a href=\"topic.htm?path=omeprazole-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">omeprazole</a> daily to promote an acid-reduced environment. The mean follow-up period was 10 months (range 1 to 30 months). High-grade dysplasia was eradicated in all patients. Tumors less than 2 mm in thickness were also completely ablated. There was no procedure-related morbidity or mortality.</p><p>5-ALA has also been studied in patients with low-grade dysplasia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/barretts-esophagus-treatment-with-photodynamic-therapy/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. One such study included 36 patients who were randomly assigned to photodynamic therapy or placebo followed by laser treatment with a diffusing fiber [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/barretts-esophagus-treatment-with-photodynamic-therapy/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. Of the 18 patients given 5-ALA, 16 (89 percent) showed macroscopic evidence of Barrett's regression while all had complete clearance of dysplasia. The mean reduction in the area of Barrett's was 30 percent. Of those receiving placebo, two patients (11 percent) had a reduction in the area of Barrett's mucosa and one-third no longer had detectable dysplasia.</p><p>A follow-up report from the same authors included 40 patients with low-grade dysplasia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/barretts-esophagus-treatment-with-photodynamic-therapy/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]. A macroscopic reduction in the area of columnar epithelium was observed in 35 patients (88 percent) and dysplasia was eradicated in all 40 by one month. The effect was maintained for a median follow-up of 53 months. However, one patient developed a late carcinoma in an untreated area of Barrett's three years after treatment.</p><p>Another study compared the efficacy of 5-ALA photodynamic therapy with argon plasma coagulation (APC) in 40 patients (32 with no dysplasia and 8 with low-grade dysplasia) who were randomly assigned to one of two 5-ALA photodynamic therapy regimens or to APC [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/barretts-esophagus-treatment-with-photodynamic-therapy/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>]. After 12 months, histologic evaluation revealed complete ablation in a similar proportion of patients in each group. Side effects were more common with photodynamic therapy than with APC. The authors concluded that both techniques can lead to complete reversal of Barrett's epithelium in at least two-thirds of patients.</p><p>The long-term outcome of photodynamic therapy in patients with high-grade dysplasia or early cancer was described in a series that included 66 patients (35 with high-grade dysplasia [group A] and 31 with adenocarcinoma [group B]) who were treated with photodynamic therapy between 1996 and 2002 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/barretts-esophagus-treatment-with-photodynamic-therapy/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>]. A complete response was observed in 97 and 100 percent in the two groups, respectively, at 37 months. One local recurrence was observed in group A and 10 in group B. Disease-free survival in patients with high-grade dysplasia and intramucosal cancer was 89 and 68 percent, respectively. Seven patients died during follow-up, but none were tumor related.

However, because the Barrett's mucosa is protected from gastroesophageal refluxate by the neosquamous epithelium, the malignant potential of the buried glands may be lower than that seen with normal Barrett's mucosa [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/barretts-esophagus-treatment-with-photodynamic-therapy/abstract/36,37\" class=\"abstract_t\">36,37</a>].</p><p>Some of the clinical uncertainty is due to the observation that buried Barrett's glands may be seen in the absence of treatment, suggesting that buried glands found following photodynamic therapy may have been present prior to treatment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/barretts-esophagus-treatment-with-photodynamic-therapy/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>].</p><p>In a systematic review that included 22 reports of photodynamic therapy for Barrett's esophagus with 953 patients, buried metaplasia was found in 135 patients (14 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/barretts-esophagus-treatment-with-photodynamic-therapy/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>].

One evaluated four strategies for treatment of high-grade dysplasia (esophagectomy, endoscopic surveillance, photodynamic therapy followed by esophagectomy for residual high-grade dysplasia, and photodynamic therapy followed by endoscopic surveillance for residual high-grade dysplasia) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/barretts-esophagus-treatment-with-photodynamic-therapy/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>]. Photodynamic therapy followed by endoscopic surveillance for residual high-grade dysplasia appeared to be the most effective strategy (yielding 12.31 quality-adjusted life-years) but also incurred the greatest lifetime costs ($47,310) for an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of $47,410 per quality-adjusted life-year gained. Photodynamic therapy was also found to be cost-effective compared with endoscopic surveillance and esophagectomy in another decision analysis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/barretts-esophagus-treatment-with-photodynamic-therapy/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>].

Advantages include its ease of use, the need for fewer endoscopic sessions compared with thermal ablative techniques, and reduced morbidity, mortality, and cost when compared with surgery.</p><p>However, limited data are available on the long-term outcome of this approach, although five-year survival rates similar to esophagectomy have been described. Furthermore, photodynamic therapy is expensive, available in only a small number of academic medical centers, and often is complicated by esophageal stricture formation (up to 40 percent), which may require repeated dilation. Another concern is that patients with high-grade dysplasia may have foci of invasive carcinoma that might not be treated adequately. In addition, dysplasia can occur following therapy within specialized columnar epithelium underlying regenerated squamous epithelium (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F78238\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef78238 \">picture 2</a>). As a result, detection of dysplasia during subsequent surveillance endoscopies may be difficult. </p><p>Thus, photodynamic therapy can be considered for patients with high-grade dysplasia who are poor operative candidates after thorough discussion of the risks and alternatives. Notably, photodynamic therapy for high-grade dysplasia reduces, but does not eliminate, the risk of progression to cancer. In the multicenter study with Photofrin described above, progression was observed in 13 percent of patients despite treatment. The efficacy of photodynamic therapy for those who have already developed superficial esophageal carcinoma has not yet been thoroughly evaluated, although long-term ablation has been successfully achieved in small numbers of patients.
