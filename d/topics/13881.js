Genetic factors are present in some patients; these may include heterozygosity for a <em>UROD</em> mutation, which predisposes to the disease by reducing UROD activity to 50 percent of normal in all tissues from birth, and <em>HFE</em> (hemochromatosis) mutations (homozygous or heterozygous), which increase iron absorption.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>HEP</strong> &ndash; HEP is caused by severely deficient UROD activity on a genetic basis due to mutation of both <em>UROD</em> alleles (eg, homozygous mutation, compound heterozygous mutation).

Hepatoerythropoietic porphyria (HEP) is an extremely rare condition caused by homozygosity or compound heterozygosity for <em>UROD</em> mutations.</p><p>UROD is a cytosolic enzyme that catalyzes the four-step decarboxylation of uroporphyrinogen to coproporphyrinogen, which have eight and four carboxyl groups, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/porphyria-cutanea-tarda-and-hepatoerythropoietic-porphyria-pathogenesis-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/4,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,5</a>]. The four carboxyl groups are removed sequentially in a clockwise fashion starting from ring D. The enzyme has greater affinity for uroporphyrinogen III than uroporphyrinogen I.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1422429236\"><span class=\"h2\">Porphyrin accumulation due to reduced hepatic UROD activity</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Reduced UROD activity is responsible for the accumulation of porphyrinogens that are auto-oxidized to photosensitizing porphyrins in PCT. Reduction of UROD activity in the liver to &lt;20 percent of normal is required for clinical manifestations of PCT to occur.</p><p>Reduced hepatic UROD activity leads to hepatic accumulation of highly carboxylated porphyrinogens; these are oxidized to the corresponding porphyrins (mostly uroporphyrin and heptacarboxyl porphyrins), which appear in plasma and are excreted mostly in urine [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/porphyria-cutanea-tarda-and-hepatoerythropoietic-porphyria-pathogenesis-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/6,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,7</a>]. Excess porphyrins consist of both I and III isomers, in a complex, characteristic pattern (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F60572\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef60572 \">table 1</a>). Pentacarboxyl porphyrinogen that accumulates is further metabolized by the next enzyme in the heme biosynthetic pathway (coproporphyrinogen oxidase) to dehydro-isocoproporphyrinogen, an atypical tetracarboxyl porphyrinogen. After oxidation, this appears in feces and urine in the form of isocoproporphyrins, with additional modifications by intestinal bacteria. Porphyrins are transported from the liver to skin, leading to cutaneous phototoxicity. (See <a href=\"#H1422430102\" class=\"local\">'Photosensitization'</a> below.)</p><p>PCT does not appear to be associated with marked upregulation of delta-aminolevulinic acid (ALA) synthase (ALAS1), the first and rate-limiting enzyme in the heme biosynthetic pathway; this contrasts with acute intermittent porphyria (AIP), in which marked upregulation of ALAS1 is common. Little elevation of hepatic ALAS1 is needed to account for the amounts of excess porphyrins excreted in PCT. Accordingly, factors that increase ALAS1 synthesis, including a variety of drugs, hormones, caloric restriction, and metabolic stress, seldom appear to play a significant role in the pathogenesis of PCT. The major <span class=\"nowrap\">environmental/behavioral</span> susceptibility factors in PCT impair UROD activity by promoting iron accumulation or oxidative stress in hepatocytes rather than by inducing ALAS1.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1422430102\"><span class=\"h2\">Photosensitization</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Porphyrins that accumulate in PCT are photosensitizing; they are transported to the skin and cause photodamage on exposure to light with a wavelength near 400 nm (ie, wavelengths within the ultraviolet A and visible light ranges (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F70045\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef70045 \">figure 3</a>)). These wavelengths of light cause porphyrins to enter an excited state and release photons that activate oxygen in the tissues to higher energy singlet oxygen, which damages proteins, lipids, and basement membranes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/porphyria-cutanea-tarda-and-hepatoerythropoietic-porphyria-pathogenesis-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/8,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,9</a>].

This is because a single <em>UROD</em> mutation only reduces UROD activity to approximately 50 percent of normal, whereas reduction of the hepatic enzyme activity to &lt;20 percent of normal is required for disease manifestations to occur. However, some heterozygotes have elevated porphyrins in the absence of skin manifestations; it is not known how frequently this occurs. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=porphyria-cutanea-tarda-and-hepatoerythropoietic-porphyria-management-and-prognosis#H516494\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Porphyria cutanea tarda and hepatoerythropoietic porphyria: Management and prognosis&quot;, section on 'Genetic counseling and asymptomatic carrier management'</a>.)</p><p>More severe reductions of UROD activity occur when both <em>UROD</em> alleles are mutated, resulting in HEP [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/porphyria-cutanea-tarda-and-hepatoerythropoietic-porphyria-pathogenesis-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. This leads to marked increases in highly carboxylated porphyrins in liver, plasma, urine, and feces, and (in contrast to PCT) marked increase in erythrocyte zinc protoporphyrin. The increase in zinc protoporphyrin in HEP is thought to result from the accumulation of heme pathway intermediates during hemoglobin synthesis, which are metabolized to protoporphyrin and then complexed with zinc after hemoglobin synthesis is complete [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/porphyria-cutanea-tarda-and-hepatoerythropoietic-porphyria-pathogenesis-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].

These and other susceptibility factors are quite specific for PCT and distinct from those for other porphyrias. However, some of the susceptibility factors for PCT are unlikely to be hepatotoxic (eg, human immunodeficiency virus [HIV] infection, estrogen use, <em>HFE</em> and <em>UROD</em> mutations), and hepatic injury in general does not lead to development of PCT. Susceptibility factors are less likely to play a role in HEP because individuals with HEP have markedly reduced UROD activity at baseline.</p><p>Most of the susceptibility factors for PCT either decrease hepcidin expression (thereby increasing iron absorption), increase oxidative stress in hepatocytes (favoring the production of the UROD inhibitor), or both. As described in the following sections, susceptibility is unexplained for some of these factors. <em>UROD</em> mutations act as susceptibility factors by decreasing the amount of the enzyme in liver (and all tissues) from birth. Various combinations of these acquired and inherited factors are found in different patients.</p><p>Addressing relevant susceptibility factors is an important component of PCT management.

PCT cases can be classified as inherited or sporadic (approximately 20 and 80 percent of cases, respectively) based on the presence or absence of heterozygous <em>UROD</em> mutations. In both familial and sporadic disease, acquired susceptibility factors such as alcohol use, smoking, estrogen use, and hepatitis C virus (HCV) or human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection are common, as are hemochromatosis (<em>HFE</em>) mutations. HEP, which is exceedingly rare, is due to mutation of both <em>UROD</em> alleles. PCT is iron-related and generally presents in adulthood; HEP can present in children or adults depending on the degree of UROD deficiency.
