Many patients with a typical SCID phenotype who lack the IL7RA chain have been identified [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/severe-combined-immunodeficiency-scid-specific-defects/abstract/6-8\" class=\"abstract_t\">6-8</a>]. This defect is among the most common types of SCID.

Defects in CORO1A lead to absence of normal peripheral T cells and a typical SCID phenotype [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/severe-combined-immunodeficiency-scid-specific-defects/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. The thymus is present, unlike most other forms of SCID.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">CD45 deficiency</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>CD45, the leukocyte common antigen, is encoded on chromosome 1q31-q32. CD45 is a transmembrane tyrosine phosphatase involved in T cell receptor (TCR) signaling and T cell development in the thymus. Only a few patients with classic SCID due to CD45 deficiency have been described [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/severe-combined-immunodeficiency-scid-specific-defects/abstract/11-13\" class=\"abstract_t\">11-13</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">CD3 complex component deficiencies</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The CD3 complex plays a major role in signaling through the TCR. Mutations in the genes encoding CD3 chains (CD3D, CD3E, and CD3Z) lead to SCID. Patients with CD3 gamma deficiency have varying phenotypes, with some having SCID-like symptoms and some having a more benign course, often marked by immune dysregulation. CD3 chain deficiencies are discussed in greater detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cd3-t-cell-receptor-complex-disorders-causing-immunodeficiency#H17\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;CD3/T cell receptor complex disorders causing immunodeficiency&quot;, section on 'CD3 deficiency'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H489763364\"><span class=\"h2\">B cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia/lymphoma 11B (BCL11B) defect</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A patient with leaky SCID due to a heterozygous mutation in <em>BCL11B</em> was detected on newborn SCID screening, and the causal defect was confirmed by whole exome sequencing in the patient and parents followed by functional analysis of the candidate gene [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/severe-combined-immunodeficiency-scid-specific-defects/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. The mutation caused dominant negative activity of the resulting protein, which blocked the wild-type protein from binding DNA. This lead to arrested T cell development and disrupted migration of hematopoietic stem cells. The patient successfully underwent hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) prior to onset of any infections, although his severe neurodevelopmental disorder involving hypotonia, spastic quadriplegia, and seizures, with an absent corpus callosum, and dermal and craniofacial anomalies remained.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h1\">T-B+NK- SCID</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Gene mutations affecting the integrity of the <span class=\"nowrap\">gamma-c/Janus</span> kinase 3 (JAK3) signaling pathway result in the most common form of inherited SCID: T cell-negative, B cell-positive, natural killer (NK) cell-negative (T-B+NK-) SCID.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">X-linked SCID</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>X-linked SCID is due to defects in the common gamma chain (gamma-c, interleukin-2 receptor gamma). X-linked SCID (SCIDX1 or X-SCID, MIM 300400) is the most common form of SCID. These male patients usually have the classic clinical SCID phenotype, presenting in the newborn period with recurrent severe infections, chronic diarrhea, and failure to thrive. This SCID is discussed in greater detail separately.

This autosomal recessive form of T-B+NK- SCID (MIM 600802) is identical to X-linked SCID in cellular and clinical phenotypes. Rarely, partial JAK3 defects associated with low amounts of functional protein can present with mild immunodeficiency. SCID due to JAK3 deficiency is discussed in greater detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=severe-combined-immunodeficiency-scid-with-jak3-deficiency\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID) with JAK3 deficiency&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h1\">T-B-NK+ SCID</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The T cell-negative, B cell-negative, natural killer (NK) cell-positive (T-B-NK+) SCID syndromes include defects in recombinase activating genes 1 and 2 (<em>RAG1</em>, <em>RAG2</em>), Artemis (ARTEMIS or <em>DCLRE1C</em>), and DNA protein kinase catalytic subunit (DNA-PKcs).</p><p>Mutations in the genes for Artemis and DNA-PKcs lead to increased sensitivity to ionizing radiation since these gene products are important in the process of nonhomologous end joining required for repair of double-strand DNA breaks caused by radiation. Mutations in <em>RAG1</em> and <em>RAG2</em> are not associated with radiation sensitivity. These genes are expressed exclusively in lymphocytes and mediate the creation of double-strand DNA breaks at the sites of recombination and signal sequences during T and B cells receptor gene rearrangement. Nonhomologous end joining is normal in individuals with RAG1 or RAG2 defects. Artemis deficiency is also known as Athabascan SCID (SCIDA), since a founder mutation in ARTEMIS is found with increased frequency in Native Americans speaking one of the Athabascan family languages (eg, Apache, Navajo).

Approximately 90 percent of ADA-deficient individuals have a classic severe SCID phenotype, and they develop severe infections in the first months of life. Most of the remainder have a &quot;delayed&quot; or &quot;late-onset&quot; form that presents in late infancy or early childhood.</p><p>The definitive treatment of choice is hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) from a human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-identical sibling or other appropriate donor. PEG-ADA is an effective alternative therapeutic agent, which is sometimes preferred in patients without an HLA-identical sibling.

Severe infections occur earlier than in other forms of SCID due to profound neutropenia in addition to markedly decreased T and NK cells. B cells are absent to low normal. This autosomal recessive SCID is caused by mutations in the mitochondrial adenylate kinase 2 (<em>AK2</em>) gene.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11682628\"><span class=\"h2\">MTHFD1 deficiency</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The methylenetetrahydrofolate dehydrogenase 1 gene (<em>MTHFD1</em>) encodes a trifunctional protein comprised of three enzymes: 5,10-methylenetetrahydrofolate dehydrogenase, 5,10-methylenetetrahydrofolate cyclohydrolase, and 10-formlytetrahydrofolate synthetase. These enzymes together are involved in the processing of single-carbon tetrahydrofolate derivatives that are substrates for methionine, thymidylate, and de novo purine syntheses. Deficiency of MTHFD1 has been described in one patient, born to nonconsanguineous parents, who presented with poor feeding and pallor at a few weeks of age [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/severe-combined-immunodeficiency-scid-specific-defects/abstract/15,16\" class=\"abstract_t\">15,16</a>]. At two months of age, she developed a urinary tract infection and then <em>Pneumocystis jirovecii</em> pneumonia. She had pancytopenia, hypogammaglobulinemia, elevated lactate dehydrogenase and homocysteine, and slightly low methionine. She responded to folate and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hydroxocobalamin-vitamin-b12a-supplement-and-cyanide-antidote-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">hydroxocobalamin</a> therapy, with an improvement in hematopoiesis and partial immune reconstitution. Additional clinical findings that appeared over time include asthma, eczema, mild bilateral sensorineural hearing loss, symptomatic partial epilepsy, and pervasive developmental disorder.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1677687740\"><span class=\"h1\">SOCIETY GUIDELINE LINKS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Links to society and government-sponsored guidelines from selected countries and regions around the world are provided separately.
