The most popular agent in this class, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hydrochlorothiazide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">hydrochlorothiazide</a>, was traditionally used in doses of 50 to 100 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day</span>. These doses were associated with metabolic and electrolyte complications. Low-dose therapy has since been demonstrated to be efficacious and to have a much lower incidence of side effects. <a href=\"topic.htm?path=chlorthalidone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Chlorthalidone</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=indapamide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">indapamide</a>, both thiazide-like diuretics, have been shown to provide greater antihypertensive efficacy and, more importantly, to reduce cardiovascular events and mortality compared with hydrochlorothiazide (a thiazide-type diuretic) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/use-of-thiazide-diuretics-in-patients-with-primary-essential-hypertension/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. No trial has documented a mortality benefit from hydrochlorothiazide.</p><p>This topic will review the antihypertensive mechanisms of thiazide and thiazide-like therapy, the common side effects associated with high doses of these diuretics, and the benefits of low-dose therapy. The role of these drugs in the treatment of primary hypertension is discussed elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=choice-of-drug-therapy-in-primary-essential-hypertension\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Choice of drug therapy in primary (essential) hypertension&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">ANTIHYPERTENSIVE MECHANISM</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The mechanisms responsible for the decline in blood pressure (BP) are incompletely understood. The BP response appears to require initial volume loss (averaging about 1.5 kg) since it is not seen in patients who are resistant to the diuretic or who are ingesting a high-salt diet [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/use-of-thiazide-diuretics-in-patients-with-primary-essential-hypertension/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. The BP in responders begins to fall within the first week, but a slow decline can continue for as long as 12 weeks [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/use-of-thiazide-diuretics-in-patients-with-primary-essential-hypertension/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Longer-acting diuretics are more effective than short-acting loop diuretics in patients with mild to moderate primary hypertension because they maintain the decline in intravascular volume. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=thiazides-versus-loop-diuretics-in-the-treatment-of-hypertension\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Thiazides versus loop diuretics in the treatment of hypertension&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The initial hypotensive response is mediated by a modest reduction in plasma volume and cardiac output [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/use-of-thiazide-diuretics-in-patients-with-primary-essential-hypertension/abstract/3,4\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,4</a>]. However, the fall in BP is blunted by hypovolemia-induced activation of the renin-angiotensin system [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/use-of-thiazide-diuretics-in-patients-with-primary-essential-hypertension/abstract/2,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,5</a>]. Thus, nonresponders to a thiazide or thiazide-like diuretic may have a diuresis that is equivalent to that in responders, but little or no reduction in BP due to a rise in systemic vascular resistance (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEPH%2F76363\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef76363 \">figure 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/use-of-thiazide-diuretics-in-patients-with-primary-essential-hypertension/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. This relationship explains the synergistic response between a diuretic and an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor or an angiotensin II receptor blocker (ARB). These agents block either the generation or the effects of angiotensin II, thereby allowing the full antihypertensive effect of the diuretic to be expressed. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=renin-angiotensin-system-inhibition-in-the-treatment-of-hypertension\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Renin-angiotensin system inhibition in the treatment of hypertension&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Long-term maintenance of the decrease in BP is associated with partial reversal of the initial hemodynamic changes: the plasma volume and cardiac output partially rise toward the baseline level, while the systemic vascular resistance falls [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/use-of-thiazide-diuretics-in-patients-with-primary-essential-hypertension/abstract/3,4\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,4</a>]. Despite near-normalization of the plasma volume, it is likely that the plasma volume remains low in relation to the vasodilation-induced increase in the vascular capacity. Two observations are consistent with this hypothesis: (1) the plasma renin activity is persistently elevated; and (2) discontinuation of the diuretic leads to rapid fluid retention before any reversal of the fall in systemic vascular resistance [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/use-of-thiazide-diuretics-in-patients-with-primary-essential-hypertension/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Mechanism of vasodilation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The secondary vasodilatory response with thiazide diuretics is modest, is most pronounced with longer-acting drugs such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=chlorthalidone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">chlorthalidone</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=indapamide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">indapamide</a>, and has only a minor role in long-term BP reduction with these agents. </p><p>The factors responsible for the secondary vasodilation remain unclear. One hypothesis has proposed a central role for a circulating endogenous digitalis-like natriuretic hormone (distinct from atrial natriuretic peptide) that inhibits the cellular Na-K-ATPase pump [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/use-of-thiazide-diuretics-in-patients-with-primary-essential-hypertension/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. <a href=\"topic.htm?path=chlorthalidone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Chlorthalidone</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=indapamide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">indapamide</a> could diminish the secretion of this hormone, leading sequentially to a rise in Na-K-ATPase activity, a fall in cell sodium concentration (since more sodium is pumped out of the cell), and increased calcium efflux from the cells. The ensuing decline in the cell calcium concentration then leads to vasodilation and a fall in systemic vascular resistance. This theory, however, has yet to be confirmed.</p><p>Another possibility is a direct effect upon potassium channels. Modest vasodilation of the forearm in response to <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hydrochlorothiazide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">hydrochlorothiazide</a> can be abolished with the concurrent administration of tetraethylammonium, a calcium-activated potassium channel blocker [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/use-of-thiazide-diuretics-in-patients-with-primary-essential-hypertension/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. Since this is only observed with high doses of hydrochlorothiazide, it is unclear whether a similar effect occurs in patients undergoing chronic low-dose therapy.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3353436175\"><span class=\"h1\">EFFICACY AND SAFETY</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H299737803\"><span class=\"h2\">Efficacy of low-dose therapy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In patients with primary hypertension and normal renal function, thiazide-type and thiazide-like diuretics are typically used at low doses (eg, 12.5 to 25 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day</span> of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=chlorthalidone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">chlorthalidone</a> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hydrochlorothiazide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">hydrochlorothiazide</a>, or 1.25 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day</span> of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=indapamide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">indapamide</a>) to minimize metabolic complications while maintaining the antihypertensive response [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/use-of-thiazide-diuretics-in-patients-with-primary-essential-hypertension/abstract/9-15\" class=\"abstract_t\">9-15</a>]. </p><p>Although higher diuretic doses tend to produce more fluid loss, there may be little or no greater antihypertensive effect because of greater activation of the renin-angiotensin system [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/use-of-thiazide-diuretics-in-patients-with-primary-essential-hypertension/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. Higher doses, including in the use of loop diuretics, may be required in patients with resistant hypertension, and loop diuretics are the drugs of choice in patients with fluid overload due to heart failure or advanced chronic kidney disease. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-resistant-hypertension\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of resistant hypertension&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-hypertension-in-acute-and-chronic-kidney-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of hypertension in acute and chronic kidney disease&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Used at low doses, the fall in blood pressure (BP) is significantly larger with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=chlorthalidone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">chlorthalidone</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=indapamide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">indapamide</a> as compared with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hydrochlorothiazide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">hydrochlorothiazide</a>; in addition, both chlorthalidone and indapamide have been shown to reduce cardiovascular events in randomized trials, whereas there is no evidence that low-dose hydrochlorothiazide alone reduces cardiovascular events:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The benefits of low-dose <a href=\"topic.htm?path=chlorthalidone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">chlorthalidone</a> (12.5 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day</span> increased to a maximum of 25 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day)</span> were illustrated in the Antihypertensive and Lipid Lowering Treatment to Prevent Heart Attack&nbsp;Trial (ALLHAT), in which it was compared with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=amlodipine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">amlodipine</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lisinopril-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">lisinopril</a>, and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=doxazosin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">doxazosin</a> (the doxazosin arm was prematurely terminated because of an increased risk of heart failure) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/use-of-thiazide-diuretics-in-patients-with-primary-essential-hypertension/abstract/16-18\" class=\"abstract_t\">16-18</a>]. After almost five years of follow-up, each antihypertensive agent successfully lowered BP (with the goal of less than <span class=\"nowrap\">140/90</span> mmHg achieved in approximately 75 percent of patients). Compared with amlodipine and lisinopril, chlorthalidone was associated with the same frequency of the primary end point of cardiovascular death or nonfatal myocardial infarction (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEPH%2F82432\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef82432 \">figure 2</a>) but was associated with a significantly lower rate of heart failure (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEPH%2F68780\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef68780 \">figure 3</a>) and, compared with lisinopril, stroke (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEPH%2F61612\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef61612 \">figure 4</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/use-of-thiazide-diuretics-in-patients-with-primary-essential-hypertension/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. The interpretation of these findings, however, was somewhat hampered by the fact that the chlorthalidone-based regimen lowered systolic BP more than either the calcium channel blocker-based or the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor-based regimen [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/use-of-thiazide-diuretics-in-patients-with-primary-essential-hypertension/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>].

Thus, although some guidelines recommend 12.5 to 25 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day</span> of either drug, one cannot assume that the benefits of chlorthalidone in trials such as ALLHAT would have been replicated with similar doses of hydrochlorothiazide.

These drugs lower BP, which may reduce the required diuretic dose, and prevent renal potassium excretion, which can counteract the hypokalemia associated with diuretics.

The BP response appears to require initial volume loss since it is not seen in patients who are resistant to the diuretic or who are ingesting a high-salt diet. The BP in responders begins to fall within the first week, but a slow decline can continue for as long as 12 weeks. Longer-acting diuretics are more effective than short-acting loop diuretics in patients with mild to moderate primary hypertension because they maintain the decline in intravascular volume. The fall in BP is blunted by hypovolemia-induced activation of the renin-angiotensin system. Long-term maintenance of the decrease in BP is associated with partial reversal of the initial hemodynamic changes: the plasma volume and cardiac output partially rise toward the baseline level, while the systemic vascular resistance falls (secondary vasodilation). (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Antihypertensive mechanism'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In patients with primary hypertension and normal renal function, thiazide-type and thiazide-like diuretics are typically used at low doses (eg, 12.5 to 25 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day</span> of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=chlorthalidone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">chlorthalidone</a> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hydrochlorothiazide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">hydrochlorothiazide</a>, or 1.25 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day</span> of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=indapamide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">indapamide</a>) to minimize metabolic complications while maintaining the antihypertensive response. Although higher diuretic doses tend to produce more fluid loss, there may be little or no greater antihypertensive effect because of greater activation of the renin-angiotensin system. (See <a href=\"#H299737803\" class=\"local\">'Efficacy of low-dose therapy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Used at low doses, the fall in BP is significantly larger with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=chlorthalidone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">chlorthalidone</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=indapamide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">indapamide</a> as compared with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hydrochlorothiazide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">hydrochlorothiazide</a>; in addition, both chlorthalidone and indapamide have been shown to reduce cardiovascular events in randomized trials, whereas there is no evidence that low-dose hydrochlorothiazide alone reduces cardiovascular events. As a result, some experts suggest chlorthalidone (12.5 to 25 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day)</span> or indapamide (1.25 to 2.5 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day)</span> as the low-dose diuretic of choice.

The incidence and magnitude of these side effects are lower with low-dose therapy (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEPH%2F69912\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef69912 \">figure 5</a>). (See <a href=\"#H3901533804\" class=\"local\">'Dose-dependent metabolic effects'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\">The risk of hypokalemia, for example, may be minimized by combining thiazides with angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs), mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=spironolactone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">spironolactone</a>), or blockers of the epithelial sodium channel (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=amiloride-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">amiloride</a>). A low-sodium diet will reduce the required dose of the diuretic and also limit the incidence of hypokalemia by reducing sodium delivery to the distal nephron. Conversely, beta blockers are known to aggravate the perturbations of glucose metabolism associated with thiazides. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Non-dose-dependent effects &ndash; Thiazide diuretics are associated with sexual dysfunction and sleep disturbance.
