Regular aerobic exercise during an uncomplicated pregnancy maintains or improves physical fitness and cardiorespiratory function, enhances psychological well-being, and reduces the risks for sedentary lifestyle-related comorbidities. However, exercise routines may have to be modified during pregnancy to accommodate the normal anatomic and physiological changes that occur in pregnant women and to avoid adverse effects on the fetus.</p><p>Pregnancy is an ideal time for positive lifestyle modifications, including increasing physical activity and consuming a more healthy diet. When pregnant, women tend to be highly motivated to improve unhealthy behaviors and have frequent visits with their providers, which facilitates counseling, support, and supervision.</p><p>This topic will discuss the benefits and risks of exercise during pregnancy and provide guidance about the frequency, type, intensity, and duration of exercise for various populations of pregnant and postpartum women.

For example, overweight and obese women who lose significant weight prepregnancy through exercise and diet and avoid excessive gestational weight gain can reduce their likelihood of developing gestational diabetes and diabetes- and obesity-related comorbidities, such as macrosomia, preeclampsia, obstetrically indicated preterm delivery, and cesarean delivery.

However, it is unlikely that body core temperature would reach teratogenic levels during normal exercise. In a controlled neutral environment during 60 minutes of exercise at an intensity of 55 percent of VO<sub>2</sub> max, rectal temperature in pregnant women rose by only 1&deg;F (0.6&deg;C) and stayed &lt;100.4&deg;F (38&deg;C) in one study [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/exercise-during-pregnancy-and-the-postpartum-period/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. However, running a marathon on a very hot day or strenuous exercise in a hot environment could raise core temperature significantly. &quot;Hot yoga&quot; or &quot;hot Pilates&quot; may also cause unsafe hyperthermia. Thermoregulation improves during pregnancy, possibly due to increased circulation to the skin, increased minute ventilation, and increased plasma volume [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/exercise-during-pregnancy-and-the-postpartum-period/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Reduction in uteroplacental blood flow &ndash; During exercise blood flow is preferentially directed to working muscles. Reports of sporadic episodes of fetal bradycardia during maternal exercise have raised concerns that maternal exercise could compromise uterine blood flow, resulting in hypoxia-related fetal injury [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/exercise-during-pregnancy-and-the-postpartum-period/abstract/22-24\" class=\"abstract_t\">22-24</a>]. However, the body of evidence suggests that the normal fetus compensates for any transient changes in uteroplacental blood flow during maternal exercise and is not at risk of harm, even in previously sedentary pregnant women [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/exercise-during-pregnancy-and-the-postpartum-period/abstract/22,25-29\" class=\"abstract_t\">22,25-29</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">External fetal monitors have been used extensively to evaluate fetal heart rate (FHR) responses to maternal exercise on a treadmill or exercise cycle, and the findings have been reassuring. In these studies, maternal exercise was generally associated with a 10 to 30 <span class=\"nowrap\">beat/minute</span> increase in FHR, independent of gestational age and intensity of exercise [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/exercise-during-pregnancy-and-the-postpartum-period/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. The increase in FHR was sometimes accompanied by FHR accelerations and post-exercise FHR reactivity was generally achieved within 20 minutes. It is likely that the increase in FHR is a normal physiologic response to a transient reduction in uterine blood flow and to transplacental passage of maternal catecholamines, which are elevated during exercise. These fetal responses are protective mechanisms that increase blood flow and facilitate exchange of the respiratory gases across the placenta. In some cases, however, a prolonged reduction in uteroplacental blood flow can result in fetal hypoxemia, leading to vagal stimulation and bradycardia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/exercise-during-pregnancy-and-the-postpartum-period/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Studies of the fetal response to maternal exercise are limited by the technical difficulty of externally recording the FHR during maternal exercise. FHR tracings are frequently obscured by artifacts induced by maternal movement. To avoid this problem, a pilot study applied internal scalp electrodes to the fetuses of two elite athletes who volunteered to exercise while in labor [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/exercise-during-pregnancy-and-the-postpartum-period/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]. The athletes engaged in an incremental resistance bicycle ergometry test and reached 60 percent of their last known maximum aerobic capacity, after which the tests were suspended. In each case, the FHR remained normal during the test. Although the study was small, it provides additional evidence that maternal exercise at this level is not deleterious to the fetus, even during the most challenging exercise conditions, such as labor. In contrast, fetal bradycardia developed in six Olympic-level athletes exercising at &ge;90 percent of maximal heart rate at 23 to 29 weeks of gestation, and mean uterine artery blood flow fell to 50 percent of the initial value [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/exercise-during-pregnancy-and-the-postpartum-period/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>]. FHR and umbilical artery Doppler indices normalized quickly after cessation of exercise. As there are no proven health benefits for&nbsp;strenuous exercise&nbsp;in pregnancy, it should only be considered by elite athletes whose pregnancies are closely monitored. (See <a href=\"#H3203423644\" class=\"local\">'Intensity of exercise'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">A few studies have evaluated parameters other than the FHR, such as standard umbilical and uterine artery Doppler indices [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/exercise-during-pregnancy-and-the-postpartum-period/abstract/24,33,34\" class=\"abstract_t\">24,33,34</a>] and fetal breathing and activity patterns [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/exercise-during-pregnancy-and-the-postpartum-period/abstract/35,36\" class=\"abstract_t\">35,36</a>], to assess fetal health in response to maternal aerobic dancing, cycling, or <span class=\"nowrap\">walking/jogging</span> on a treadmill. These studies also suggest that fetal responses to maternal exercise are transient, normal physiological responses to maternal exercise and adverse fetal events are unlikely to occur in otherwise uncomplicated gestations.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Impaired fetal growth &ndash; Although exercise may have a small negative effect on birth weight, it does not appear to increase the risk of delivery of a small for gestational age infant. In a 2015 systematic review of the effect of supervised prenatal exercise on fetal growth, randomization to standard prenatal care plus a supervised prenatal exercise program (aerobic, resistance, or both) did not adversely affect birth weight compared with standard prenatal care alone (mean difference in birth weight -31 g) or the risk for delivery of a small for gestational age newborn (odds ratio 1.02, 95% 0.72-1.46) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/exercise-during-pregnancy-and-the-postpartum-period/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. The frequency of the prescribed exercise regimen ranged from one to five times per week, the time of each session ranged from 15 to 70 minutes, and the duration of the interventions ranged from 6 to 33 weeks, ending in the mid to late third trimester. Although reassuring, these findings do not address the safety of more intense, frequent, and prolonged exercise sessions in pregnancy. Information on this type of exercise in pregnancy is sparse. (See <a href=\"#H4080539980\" class=\"local\">'Elite/competitive athletes'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Light to moderate recreational physical <span class=\"nowrap\">activity/exercise</span> probably does <strong>not</strong> increase the risk of miscarriage or preterm delivery in women with uncomplicated pregnancies; recall bias in positive retrospective studies is a limitation of these studies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/exercise-during-pregnancy-and-the-postpartum-period/abstract/37-40\" class=\"abstract_t\">37-40</a>]. The effect of strenuous exercise in early pregnancy on miscarriage risk is less clear as contradictory findings have been reported [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/exercise-during-pregnancy-and-the-postpartum-period/abstract/37,41-43\" class=\"abstract_t\">37,41-43</a>]. The only prospective study observed an increased frequency of miscarriage in women who reported high physical strain (eg, exhausting tennis match, long-distance running, frequent occupational lifting of heavy loads [&gt;20 kg, 44 pounds]) around the time of implantation; however, even though the cohort was recruited prospectively, exposure data collection was sometimes obtained retrospectively after the miscarriage [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/exercise-during-pregnancy-and-the-postpartum-period/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>]. These findings need further confirmation in future studies. A potential bias in many studies is the possible confounding effect of nausea and vomiting of pregnancy. If women with this disorder exercise less strenuously and less often in early pregnancy compared with women without the disorder, this would bias outcomes to favor <span class=\"nowrap\">non/low-exercisers</span> since women with nausea and vomiting of pregnancy are known to have a reduced risk of miscarriage.

Women should choose exercises that activate large muscle groups in a rhythmic and continuous fashion (eg, walking, aerobic dance, swimming, cycling, rowing, jogging) and maintain strength, the core muscles, and flexibility (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F108041\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef108041 \">table 2</a>).</p><p>Women may safely continue most of their prepregnancy recreational activities or modify them as pregnancy conditions change. Women who engaged in regular exercise before pregnancy and who have uncomplicated pregnancies should be able to engage in high-intensity exercise, such as jogging and aerobics, during pregnancy.</p><p>However, some activities should be avoided (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F108041\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef108041 \">table 2</a>) and the following principles should be considered when choosing an exercise program:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Activities with a high risk of falling or those with a high risk of abdominal trauma are contraindicated because of the risk for placental abruption as well as maternal injury.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Activities that require jumping movements and quick changes in direction can stress joints and increase the risk of joint injury.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Flexibility exercises should be individualized to reduce susceptibility to joint injury. Because of increased relaxation of ligaments in pregnancy, joints are supported less effectively, especially in women with poor muscle mass. Activities that may result in excessive joint stress should be discontinued, modified, or include cautionary advice, with consideration of individual abilities.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Yoga is generally safe for pregnant women and their fetuses [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/exercise-during-pregnancy-and-the-postpartum-period/abstract/49\" class=\"abstract_t\">49</a>]. It can increase maternal strength and fitness as well as reduce stress. Women should avoid hot yoga and use their judgment about modifying or avoiding yoga positions that are uncomfortable or likely to result in loss of balance and falling.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Exercises that require a supine position should be avoided after the first trimester as this position predisposes many pregnant women to hypotensive episodes.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Strength training can be performed during pregnancy, but information about safety is limited. Studies focused on low-intensity resistance training with low weights (free or machine) (eg, &le;10 pounds [4.5 kg]) with multiple repetitions lifted through a dynamic range of motion suggest this level of activity is safe and effective during pregnancy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/exercise-during-pregnancy-and-the-postpartum-period/abstract/50,51\" class=\"abstract_t\">50,51</a>]. Although supporting data are lacking, a prudent approach is to avoid heavy-resistance weight lifting, any exercises that result in marked straining, and intense repetitive isometric exercises during pregnancy. Women who continue heavy strength training in pregnancy should be aware that the Valsalva maneuver causes a rapid increase in blood pressure and intra-abdominal pressure and therefore may temporarily decrease uteroplacental blood flow [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/exercise-during-pregnancy-and-the-postpartum-period/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. Avoiding this maneuver by exhaling with an open airway also seems prudent.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">In the United States, the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health has published clinical guidelines for occupational lifting in uncomplicated pregnancies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/exercise-during-pregnancy-and-the-postpartum-period/abstract/52\" class=\"abstract_t\">52</a>]. In the absence of better information, these guidelines may be extrapolated to non-occupational lifting, and are reviewed separately.

Weight-bearing exercises are performed less efficiently in pregnancy and are more energy-costly, since they contain a component of added body weight [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/exercise-during-pregnancy-and-the-postpartum-period/abstract/55\" class=\"abstract_t\">55</a>]; however, they are well tolerated by previously active pregnant women.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Because of pregnancy-related anatomical and physiological changes, women may prefer non-weight-bearing physical activities during pregnancy (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=maternal-adaptations-to-pregnancy-musculoskeletal-changes-and-pain#H2\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Maternal adaptations to pregnancy: Musculoskeletal changes and pain&quot;, section on 'Normal pregnancy changes'</a>). Aquatic exercise is a particularly advantageous non-weight-bearing activity for pregnant women since the following occur during immersion: Peripheral edema is reduced, the forces across weight-bearing joints are reduced, body heat is readily dissipated into the water, and loss of balance and falling are of minimal concern [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/exercise-during-pregnancy-and-the-postpartum-period/abstract/56\" class=\"abstract_t\">56</a>].

Basal metabolic rate and heat production are increased during pregnancy so maintenance of euhydration is particularly critical to heat balance during any prolonged exercise and any exercise in hot, humid weather.

Moderate exercise is not a direct cause of any adverse pregnancy outcome; however, pregnant women may be at greater risk of injuries to joints, falling, and significant abdominal trauma during certain types of exercise. Abdominal trauma can result in placental abruption, which can lead to fetal death or morbidity. (See <a href=\"#H2611155132\" class=\"local\">'Benefits and risks'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Prior to participation in an exercise program, pregnant women should be evaluated for medical and obstetrical contraindications to exercise (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F108037\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef108037 \">table 1</a>).

Contact sports and physical activities in which the risk of <span class=\"nowrap\">falls/trauma</span> is high are a concern in pregnancy because of the risk of fetal harm from maternal trauma. SCUBA diving should also be avoided because of the potential for fetal harm. (See <a href=\"#H1212231796\" class=\"local\">'Choosing an exercise program'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Maintenance of euhydration is particularly critical to heat balance during prolonged exercise and exercise in hot, humid weather; hyperthermia in very early pregnancy may increase the risk for neural tube defects. The caloric costs of exercise should be estimated and balanced by appropriate caloric intake and awareness of hypoglycemia symptoms. (See <a href=\"#H3738804700\" class=\"local\">'Hydration and energy'</a> above and <a href=\"#H1440878309\" class=\"local\">'Risks'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The intensity, frequency, and duration of exercise depend on patient-specific factors. For most healthy pregnant women, the following exercise prescription is reasonable: moderate-intensity exercise (able to carry on a normal conversation during exercise) that includes aerobic exercise and strength training, performed for 30 minutes daily, five to seven days per week.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Previously sedentary women should begin with 10 to 20 minutes of continuous low-intensity exercise three times per week, increasing the intensity, frequency, and duration gradually.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Physically active women can engage in moderate to vigorous physical activity. They should strive to maintain a good fitness level throughout pregnancy without trying to reach their peak fitness level or train for athletic competition.
