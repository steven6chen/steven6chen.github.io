Thus, the value for the expected baseline AG must be interpreted with this correction factor when metabolic acidosis increases the AG. Conversely, the expected baseline value for the AG must be adjusted upward using the same correction factor in patients with hyperalbuminemia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-delta-anion-gap-delta-hco3-ratio-in-patients-with-a-high-anion-gap-metabolic-acidosis/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].</p><p>When the AG increases in magnitude as a result of metabolic acidosis, that increase should be compared with the magnitude of the fall in HCO<sub>3</sub>. This represents the delta <span class=\"nowrap\">AG/delta</span> HCO<sub>3</sub> ratio. The reciprocal relationship between these measurement changes can be affected by a number of factors including the volume of distribution of the anions, renal excretion <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> metabolism of the anions, and the accumulation of unmeasured anions unrelated to acids. In addition, the serum AG may also be increased, decreased, or even negative in a number of conditions other than metabolic acidosis. These issues are discussed separately.

Usually, the acid anions that remain in the body (eg, not excreted in the urine) are largely restricted to the extracellular space and thereby raise the AG. By contrast, more than 50 percent of the hydrogen ions released from the acids are buffered within the cells and in bone. The proportion of hydrogen ions that are buffered in compartments other than the extracellular space increases as the serum HCO<sub>3</sub> falls [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-delta-anion-gap-delta-hco3-ratio-in-patients-with-a-high-anion-gap-metabolic-acidosis/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. When hydrogen ions are buffered within cells and in bone, the serum HCO<sub>3</sub> concentration does not fall. Thus, to the extent that this occurs, the serum AG will rise more than the HCO<sub>3</sub> concentration will fall. This increases the delta <span class=\"nowrap\">AG/delta</span> HCO<sub>3</sub> ratio above 1:1.

This partial conversion of a high AG acidosis to a hyperchloremic (normal AG) acidosis is more common with ketoacidosis than with lactic acidosis. The lactate anion is less likely to be excreted into the urine because of markedly reduced renal function in patients with lactic acidosis and because the lactate is reabsorbed. By contrast, renal function usually improves rapidly during the treatment of ketoacidosis, permitting urinary excretion of beta-hydroxybutyrate and acetoacetate anions.

However, the ratio will usually increase as renal function progressively deteriorates.

Only a small fraction of the lactate that is generated by cellular metabolism remains in the intracellular fluid space; by contrast, more than 50 percent of the hydrogen ions that accompany the lactate are buffered in the cells and bone. The proportion of hydrogen ions buffered by cells and bone is substantially higher than 50 percent if the metabolic acidosis is severe [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-delta-anion-gap-delta-hco3-ratio-in-patients-with-a-high-anion-gap-metabolic-acidosis/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>].</p><p>The effect of the larger space of distribution of hydrogen ions compared with lactate anions and the low rate of lactate excretion is that the delta <span class=\"nowrap\">AG/delta</span> HCO<sub>3</sub> ratio is often greater than 1 in lactic acidosis and is usually approximately 1.6 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-delta-anion-gap-delta-hco3-ratio-in-patients-with-a-high-anion-gap-metabolic-acidosis/abstract/3,4,7,9,11,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,4,7,9,11,12</a>].

This is in contrast to the average ratio of 1.6 described in the preceding section in lactic acidosis. One reason for this difference is that lactic acidosis is often associated with renal hypoperfusion and increased renal tubule lactate reabsorption. By contrast, renal function is better maintained in ketoacidosis. Preserved renal function in patients with ketoacidosis permits urinary excretion of the sodium and potassium salts of ketoacid anions (beta-hydroxybutyrate and acetoacetate). The loss of ketoacid anions lowers the AG without affecting the serum HCO<sub>3</sub> concentration. Excretion of anions offsets intracellular and bone buffering of protons, thereby reducing the delta <span class=\"nowrap\">AG/delta</span> HCO<sub>3</sub> ratio toward 1 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-delta-anion-gap-delta-hco3-ratio-in-patients-with-a-high-anion-gap-metabolic-acidosis/abstract/9,13,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,13,14</a>].</p><p>The rate of ketoacid anion excretion in patients with ketoacidosis depends upon the degree to which glomerular filtration is maintained:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients with impaired renal function (due to underlying diabetic nephropathy <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> volume depletion) will retain a greater fraction of the ketoacid anions and have a relatively greater rise in the AG in relation to the fall in the serum HCO<sub>3</sub> concentration, similar to that seen in hypoperfusion-induced lactic acidosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-delta-anion-gap-delta-hco3-ratio-in-patients-with-a-high-anion-gap-metabolic-acidosis/abstract/1,13,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,13,14</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients who maintain relatively normal renal function can lose large quantities of ketoacids in the urine and may have a delta <span class=\"nowrap\">AG/delta</span> HCO<sub>3</sub> ratio <strong>below 1 </strong>[<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-delta-anion-gap-delta-hco3-ratio-in-patients-with-a-high-anion-gap-metabolic-acidosis/abstract/9,13,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,13,14</a>].

If the ketoacid anions are lost in the urine (with sodium and potassium), the potential HCO<sub>3</sub> is lost. In addition, the loss of sodium and potassium into the urine with the ketoacid anions contributes to both extracellular fluid volume depletion and potassium depletion.</p><p>Thus, almost all patients with diabetic ketoacidosis who have relatively intact renal function will develop a <strong>hyperchloremic (normal AG) metabolic acidosis</strong> during the early phase of therapy with saline volume expansion due to the urinary loss of potential HCO<sub>3</sub> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-delta-anion-gap-delta-hco3-ratio-in-patients-with-a-high-anion-gap-metabolic-acidosis/abstract/9,13,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,13,14</a>].

The ingested alcohols and glycols are not acids themselves and will not reduce the HCO<sub>3</sub> concentration or increase the AG. Rather, they will increase the measured osmolality of blood and thereby generate an osmolal gap.</p><p>However, many of these compounds are oxidized and thereby do generate strong acids. As an example, methanol is sequentially metabolized by alcohol dehydrogenase and aldehyde dehydrogenase to generate acetaldehyde and then formic acid. The generated formic acid will reduce the HCO<sub>3</sub> and reciprocally increase the AG. Initially, the delta <span class=\"nowrap\">AG/delta</span> HCO<sub>3</sub> will be approximately 1, and the AG increase represents the accumulated formate. However, the subsequent buffering of hydrogen ions by cells and bone will increase the HCO<sub>3</sub> concentration, while the renal excretion of some of the formate will reduce the AG. Thus, the initial 1:1 ratio of the delta <span class=\"nowrap\">AG/delta</span> HCO<sub>3</sub> may be altered.

This will result in a delta <span class=\"nowrap\">AG/delta</span> HCO<sub>3</sub> ratio below 1 and, occasionally, a pure hyperchloremic acidosis (ie, metabolic acidosis with a normal AG).

The normal baseline serum AG, when it is determined with newer autoanalyzers, is lower than historically reported [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-delta-anion-gap-delta-hco3-ratio-in-patients-with-a-high-anion-gap-metabolic-acidosis/abstract/6,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,7</a>]. Evaluation of recent blood tests, if available, provides the best means of defining the baseline AG for a specific patient. In addition, the AG must be adjusted downward in patients with hypoalbuminemia (by approximately 2.5 <span class=\"nowrap\">mEq/L</span> for every 1 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/dL</span> [10 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/L]</span> reduction in the serum albumin concentration) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-delta-anion-gap-delta-hco3-ratio-in-patients-with-a-high-anion-gap-metabolic-acidosis/abstract/2,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,8</a>].

Hyperphosphatemia may also contribute to a high AG in patients with diabetic ketoacidosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-delta-anion-gap-delta-hco3-ratio-in-patients-with-a-high-anion-gap-metabolic-acidosis/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>].

(See <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'The delta AG/delta HCO3 in lactic acidosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>However, a lower value (in which the delta AG is less than expected from the delta HCO<sub>3</sub>) can be seen in a number of settings:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>In ketoacidosis, D-lactic acidosis, or toluene intoxication, the accumulating organic acid anions can be excreted by the kidney as sodium <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> potassium salts. As a result, in these disorders, the delta <span class=\"nowrap\">AG/delta</span> HCO<sub>3</sub> ratio is often below 1, and the serum AG may be normal. (See <a href=\"#H454868192\" class=\"local\">'D-lactic acidosis and toluene inhalation'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Patients with early-stage chronic kidney disease often have relatively well-preserved acid anion excretion but more severe dysfunction of tubular acid (ammonium) excretion. This generates a hyperchloremic metabolic acidosis and a delta <span class=\"nowrap\">AG/delta</span> HCO<sub>3</sub> ratio below 1. As the kidney function continues to deteriorate, anion excretion falls and the AG increases. (See <a href=\"#H379878044\" class=\"local\">'Chronic kidney disease'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Some clinical disorders, such as severe diarrhea, can generate a combined high and normal AG acidosis. This is due to the following: a hyperchloremic acidosis resulting from the loss of HCO<sub>3</sub> and potential HCO<sub>3</sub> salts in the stool, an AG acidosis generated by a combination of lactic acidosis (resulting from hypovolemia and reduced tissue perfusion), an acidosis from reduced renal function, and the effects of volume contraction on phosphate and albumin.

The high HCO<sub>3</sub> concentration may be due to a preexisting or concurrent metabolic alkalosis, as with vomiting or diuretic use, or as compensation for a chronic respiratory acidosis.
