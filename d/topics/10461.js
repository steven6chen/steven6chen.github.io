These disorders have distinct pathologic and clinical characteristics (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F74564\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef74564 \">table 1</a>), but their pathogenesis remains poorly understood. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=definition-epidemiology-and-risk-factors-in-inflammatory-bowel-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Definition, epidemiology, and risk factors in inflammatory bowel disease&quot;</a>.) </p><p>Approximately 20 percent of patients with CD and 12 percent of those with UC develop symptoms before 20 years of age [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-mild-to-moderate-ulcerative-colitis-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. The development of IBD early in life has implications that are not encountered in adults. Clinicians caring for children and adolescents with CD or UC not only must treat the underlying disease and its complications but must also carefully monitor linear growth, skeletal development, and puberty, as well as how the child's maturation and psychological health are affected by living with a chronic disease. In addition, some therapies used for older patients cannot be applied to young children, because many children are unable to swallow pills or refuse enema therapy. </p><p>The treatment of UC in children and adolescents is reviewed here. Other aspects of the diagnosis and management of children with UC are discussed in separate topic reviews:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-presentation-and-diagnosis-of-inflammatory-bowel-disease-in-children\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical presentation and diagnosis of inflammatory bowel disease in children&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=important-health-maintenance-issues-for-children-and-adolescents-with-inflammatory-bowel-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Important health maintenance issues for children and adolescents with inflammatory bowel disease&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-severe-or-refractory-ulcerative-colitis-in-children-and-adolescents\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of severe or refractory ulcerative colitis in children and adolescents&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL MANIFESTATIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>UC in children principally occurs in teenagers but can also occur earlier in life [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-mild-to-moderate-ulcerative-colitis-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. The presentation in children is similar to that in adults. Affected patients usually present with a subacute illness characterized by diarrhea frequently containing blood, weakness, anemia, abdominal pain, and sometimes weight loss. Those with a more fulminant presentation (acute severe UC) also may have severe abdominal pain, frankly bloody diarrhea, tenesmus, fever, leukocytosis, and hypoalbuminemia. Some children have more insidious onset of symptoms, with nonbloody diarrhea and sometimes poor weight gain prior to the development of more overt symptoms or signs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-mild-to-moderate-ulcerative-colitis-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].

Accordingly, young children are also more likely to present with rectal bleeding, whereas older children are more likely to present with abdominal pain, weight loss, and fever [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-mild-to-moderate-ulcerative-colitis-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. There are no clear differences in disease severity and clinical course among children presenting with IBD between one and six years of age compared with those presenting after six years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-mild-to-moderate-ulcerative-colitis-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. By contrast, cases presenting in infancy have a distinct clinical course that is often more severe because such cases are often related to immunodeficiencies or other causes of &quot;monogenic IBD.&quot; (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epidemiology-and-environmental-factors-in-inflammatory-bowel-disease-in-children-and-adolescents#H7\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Epidemiology and environmental factors in inflammatory bowel disease in children and adolescents&quot;, section on 'Age-related characteristics'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-presentation-and-diagnosis-of-inflammatory-bowel-disease-in-children#H216504648\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical presentation and diagnosis of inflammatory bowel disease in children&quot;, section on 'Early onset IBD'</a>.) </p><p>Extraintestinal manifestations of IBD may precede the gastrointestinal symptoms and are somewhat different in UC as compared with CD, as outlined in the table (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F88092\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef88092 \">table 2</a>) and described in detail separately [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-mild-to-moderate-ulcerative-colitis-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].

A combination of topical and oral mesalamine is also useful in inducing remission and may be necessary if topical therapy alone is ineffective [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-mild-to-moderate-ulcerative-colitis-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. In patients who have not responded to topical aminosalicylates, topical corticosteroid preparations can be utilized for induction of remission, although evidence from pediatric studies is lacking. Topical <a href=\"topic.htm?path=budesonide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">budesonide</a> can treat proctosigmoiditis effectively and may have fewer side effects than conventional glucocorticoids. If topical administration of medication is not possible due to parent or child refusal, oral administration of a 5-ASA medication is a reasonable alternative, although oral 5-ASA usually requires more frequent dosing and is probably less effective than topical 5-ASA for proctitis. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sulfasalazine-and-5-aminosalicylates-in-the-treatment-of-inflammatory-bowel-disease#H194953227\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Sulfasalazine and 5-aminosalicylates in the treatment of inflammatory bowel disease&quot;, section on '5-ASA formulations'</a>.) </p><p>Less commonly, immunosuppressive therapy (with immunomodulators or biologics) or colectomy is required for refractory proctitis. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-mild-to-moderate-ulcerative-colitis-in-adults#H113301576\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of mild to moderate ulcerative colitis in adults&quot;, section on 'Ulcerative proctitis or proctosigmoiditis'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-severe-or-refractory-ulcerative-colitis-in-children-and-adolescents#H349553101\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of severe or refractory ulcerative colitis in children and adolescents&quot;, section on 'Refractory disease'</a>.) </p><p>Once a patient's symptoms are controlled, remission generally can be maintained either with topical or oral aminosalicylates [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-mild-to-moderate-ulcerative-colitis-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. The choice of medication and route of administration depends on the child and family's preference and on the patient's individual responsiveness to the treatment. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-mild-to-moderate-ulcerative-colitis-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of mild to moderate ulcerative colitis in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Relapses in proctitis may be caused by poor adherence to therapy or to proximal extension of the disease over time. As an example, in an observational study in 149 children with ulcerative proctitis, 49 percent had colonic extension of disease at last follow-up; the risk for extension was 10, 45, and 52 percent at 1, 5, and 10 years, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-mild-to-moderate-ulcerative-colitis-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. Similarly, in a separate study of children with ulcerative proctitis, the risk for proximal extension to left-sided colitis or pancolitis was 54 percent among those followed for more than five years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-mild-to-moderate-ulcerative-colitis-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. Thus, patients with proctitis should be reevaluated endoscopically if they have recurrent or refractory symptoms. </p><p>Relapses in proctitis also may be triggered by an enteric infection, especially <em>Clostridium difficile</em>. Therefore, patients presenting with a flare of proctitis or colitis should be screened for bacterial causes of colitis, with stool cultures and testing for <em>C. difficile</em> toxin. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-presentation-and-diagnosis-of-inflammatory-bowel-disease-in-children#H8243939\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical presentation and diagnosis of inflammatory bowel disease in children&quot;, section on 'Stool testing for enteric pathogens'</a>.) </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h1\">LEFT-SIDED DISEASE AND PANCOLITIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>For patients with mild or moderate colitis, medical therapy usually is successful in achieving remission and often maintains long-term remission as well. The basic principles of medical therapy are similar to those in adults with UC, although the chronic use of glucocorticoids in children is particularly problematic because of potential linear growth impairment and bone demineralization. Thus, aminosalicylates or glucocorticoids are used for induction (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F112968\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef112968 \">algorithm 1</a>). The aim is to transition patients to aminosalicylate maintenance therapy. However, a significant proportion of patients require long-term treatment with immunomodulators or biologics, depending on the response to induction therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-mild-to-moderate-ulcerative-colitis-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H349548858\" class=\"local\">'Subsequent management'</a> below.) </p><p>Children with UC are more likely than adults to present with pancolitis (approximately 80 percent in children versus 40 to 50 percent in adults) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-mild-to-moderate-ulcerative-colitis-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. Initial therapy should be adjusted to the severity of presentation. Management of children with severe or refractory colitis is discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-severe-or-refractory-ulcerative-colitis-in-children-and-adolescents\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of severe or refractory ulcerative colitis in children and adolescents&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H349555872\"><span class=\"h2\">Clinical assessment</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H349555891\"><span class=\"h3\">Diagnosis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The diagnosis of UC is made on the basis of clinical, laboratory, radiologic, and <span class=\"nowrap\">endoscopic/histologic</span> information. Clinical manifestations are as described above (see <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Clinical manifestations'</a> above). The steps in diagnosis, including the differentiation between UC and Crohn disease (CD), are described separately. In patients younger than six years who have features suggestive of monogenic inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F99327\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef99327 \">table 3</a>), more extensive workup should be considered (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F99328\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef99328 \">algorithm 2</a>) because management strategies may differ. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-presentation-and-diagnosis-of-inflammatory-bowel-disease-in-children\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical presentation and diagnosis of inflammatory bowel disease in children&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H349555755\"><span class=\"h3\">Disease severity</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A pediatric UC activity index (PUCAI) has been developed to assess the activity of disease (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F69607\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef69607 \">table 4</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-mild-to-moderate-ulcerative-colitis-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. Numerical scores are given to symptoms of abdominal pain, rectal bleeding, stool consistency, stool frequency, presence of nocturnal stools, and activity level, adding to a maximum score of 85. Of these components, rectal bleeding has the greatest impact on the score, contributing up to 30 points. PUCAI scores are interpreted as follows: </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>0 to 9 &ndash; Remission</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>10 to 34 &ndash; Mild disease </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>35 to 64 &ndash; Moderate disease</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>65 to 85 &ndash; Severe disease </p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H349555943\"><span class=\"h3\">Evaluation for infectious colitis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Infectious etiologies or superimposed infections should be excluded by stool cultures for enteric pathogens and tests for <em>C. difficile</em> toxin.

Details of this evaluation to exclude other causes of colitis are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-presentation-and-diagnosis-of-inflammatory-bowel-disease-in-children#H9479602\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical presentation and diagnosis of inflammatory bowel disease in children&quot;, section on 'Differential diagnosis'</a>.) </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2017342917\"><span class=\"h3\">Determination of response to therapy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Response to therapy is typically determined by changes in clinical symptoms documented by the PUCAI score, a noninvasive validated surrogate measure of disease activity. The goal of therapy is complete resolution of symptoms, reflected by a PUCAI score of &lt;10. For patients with moderate or severe UC, a marked improvement in PUCAI (eg, PUCAI &lt;35 or a PUCAI decrease of &ge;20 points) provides an initial indication of successful medical therapy.</p><p>Improvement in serum inflammatory markers and hemoglobin (if abnormal before the initiation of treatment) provide support to the clinical assessment of treatment response. Fecal markers of inflammation, such as lactoferrin and calprotectin, also show promise as biomarkers of clinical response and mucosal healing [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-mild-to-moderate-ulcerative-colitis-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>].</p><p>In addition, endoscopic grading of disease severity is increasingly used for assessing response to therapy and making decisions about when to taper or escalate therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-mild-to-moderate-ulcerative-colitis-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. The goal is improvement <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> resolution of the grossly visible signs of active colitis, such as friability, erythema, erosions, ulcerations, and bleeding. The most commonly utilized scoring system for this purpose is the endoscopy component of the Mayo score, but this has not been validated in children [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-mild-to-moderate-ulcerative-colitis-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. While a Mayo endoscopy subscore of 0 (no grossly visible disease activity at endoscopy) is the ideal goal of treatment, this is not always achievable. Alternatively, some experts have advocated that histologic remission (resolution of microscopic abnormalities) should be the ultimate treatment goal, but benefits of this stringent target are not established, and the measure is complicated by sampling error and lack of consensus about definitions of abnormal histology [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-mild-to-moderate-ulcerative-colitis-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1824380255\"><span class=\"h2\">Initial management</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h3\">Mild disease</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In patients with mild disease extending beyond the rectum (ie, fewer than four bowel movements daily without significant abdominal pain, anemia, or fever, PUCAI score 10 to 34), we suggest a trial of oral 5-aminosalicylate (5-ASA, usually <a href=\"topic.htm?path=mesalamine-mesalazine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">mesalamine</a> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sulfasalazine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">sulfasalazine</a>) as first-line therapy (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F112968\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef112968 \">algorithm 1</a>). These drugs are moderately effective for mild disease and have fewer side effects than systemic glucocorticoids [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-mild-to-moderate-ulcerative-colitis-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. Combination therapy with oral and topical (rectal) 5-ASA should be used for induction of remission, if acceptable to the patient, because this is more effective than topical therapy alone [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-mild-to-moderate-ulcerative-colitis-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/23,24\" class=\"abstract_t\">23,24</a>]. Mild left-sided disease may also respond to topical treatment alone (eg, mesalamine enemas), and a trial of this approach is reasonable in patients who are willing and adherent to enema treatment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-mild-to-moderate-ulcerative-colitis-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>].

The treatment options depend on the disease location and severity and response to initial therapy. </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients with ulcerative colitis (UC) that is limited to the distal rectum (proctitis), we suggest initial treatment with topical rectal 5-aminosalicylic acid (5-ASA, such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=mesalamine-mesalazine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">mesalamine</a>) or glucocorticoid enemas, foam, or suppositories, with or without concurrent oral 5-ASA, rather than treatment with systemic glucocorticoids (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=5\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2B</a>). If the symptoms respond to this treatment, we suggest maintenance therapy with either topical or oral 5-ASA rather than no treatment (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). The choice of medication and route of administration depends on the child and family's preference and on the patient's individual responsiveness to the treatment. (See <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Proctitis'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients with left-sided UC (colitis primarily involving the rectum and descending colon), extensive disease (colitis extending proximal to the splenic flexure), or pancolitis (involving the entire colon), the initial treatment options depend on the severity of the disease. We select the medical therapy based on disease severity and escalate to more intensive therapies or consideration of surgical colectomy for patients whose disease is refractory to treatment.
