Thus, palliative care aims to relieve suffering in all stages of disease and is not limited to end of life care. Palliative services, including setting patient-centered achievable goals for medical care and aggressive symptom management, should be routinely offered alongside curative and disease-modifying treatments for patients with serious illnesses.</p><p>Palliative care has been best studied and implemented among patients with cancer, but is also beneficial for patients suffering from chronic lung diseases, such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), interstitial lung disease, pulmonary hypertension, and others. The ultimate goal of palliative care is to improve patients&rsquo; quality of life and provide support for patients and their families [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/palliative-care-for-adults-with-nonmalignant-chronic-lung-disease/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p>Palliative care issues in adult patients with chronic lung disease will be reviewed here.

While patients typically have a phase of gradual decline, the trajectory can change abruptly due to exacerbations of the underlying lung disease or events caused by a comorbid disease.</p><p>The disease trajectories for less common lung diseases such as pulmonary hypertension (PH) or lung transplant recipients differ depending on the cause of the disease, co-morbid conditions, response to treatment or surgery. &#160;</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H112542889\"><span class=\"h2\">Disease trajectory</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>COPD</strong> &ndash; Patients with advanced COPD usually experience a gradual but progressive decline in exercise tolerance and development of oxygen dependence that is typically punctuated by acute exacerbations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/palliative-care-for-adults-with-nonmalignant-chronic-lung-disease/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Patients with COPD are frequently hospitalized at the end of life, often in the intensive care unit (ICU). However, there is some evidence that over time, fewer patients are dying in acute care hospitals. As an example, one retrospective cohort study examined fee-for-service Medicare beneficiaries who died in 2000, 2005, or 2008 with a diagnosis of cancer, COPD, or dementia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/palliative-care-for-adults-with-nonmalignant-chronic-lung-disease/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Among the cohort with COPD, between 2000 and 2009, more patients died at home in 2009 than in 2000 (28 versus 24 percent), fewer died in acute care hospitals (32 versus 44 percent) and more patients were under hospice care at the time of their death (39 versus 20 percent). </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Every exacerbation of COPD can be life-threatening and is associated with an increased risk of dying. In fact, about 10 percent of patients hospitalized with an acute exacerbation of COPD die during the hospital admission [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/palliative-care-for-adults-with-nonmalignant-chronic-lung-disease/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. This proportion increases to about one-fourth for patients who need invasive mechanical ventilation because of respiratory failure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/palliative-care-for-adults-with-nonmalignant-chronic-lung-disease/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. About one-half of the patients admitted for an exacerbation don&rsquo;t survive four years after discharge [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/palliative-care-for-adults-with-nonmalignant-chronic-lung-disease/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].

In fact, the progression of COPD is very heterogeneous [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/palliative-care-for-adults-with-nonmalignant-chronic-lung-disease/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>], and the end of the patient&rsquo;s life is often unanticipated by their loved ones [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/palliative-care-for-adults-with-nonmalignant-chronic-lung-disease/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. Despite the heterogeneity in clinical course among patients with COPD, certain parameters predict a greater likelihood of death within 12 months: decrease in six-minute walk distance of 50 meters, change toward a very sedentary lifestyle, change toward feeling upset or downhearted, increase in arterial tension of carbon dioxide of &gt;3 mmHg, or decrease in arterial tension of oxygen by &gt;5 mmHg [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/palliative-care-for-adults-with-nonmalignant-chronic-lung-disease/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis</strong> &ndash; Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is usually characterized by a gradual and inexorable decline in respiratory capacity. However, patients may remain stable for a longer period of time or may be confronted with frequent hospital admissions because of acute worsening of respiratory symptoms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/palliative-care-for-adults-with-nonmalignant-chronic-lung-disease/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. The median survival for IPF is two to three years, although some patients live much longer [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/palliative-care-for-adults-with-nonmalignant-chronic-lung-disease/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. Most patients experience a subacute worsening over one or more months, while a minority have an acute deterioration less than one month. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">The majority of patients with IPF die in a hospital setting, and in contrast to the data in COPD, there is no evidence that this number has declined over time or that hospice enrollment has increased [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/palliative-care-for-adults-with-nonmalignant-chronic-lung-disease/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Pulmonary hypertension</strong> &ndash; The clinical course of pulmonary hypertension (PH) is highly variable depending on the type, functional class, and comorbidities. For patients with pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH), the median survival without treatment is three years. Data from the Registry to Evaluate Early and Long-term PAH Disease Management (REVEAL registry) reveal one-, three-, five-, and seven-year survival rates of 85, 68, 57, and 49 percent, respectively, from the time of diagnostic right heart catheterization [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/palliative-care-for-adults-with-nonmalignant-chronic-lung-disease/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. The prognosis of patients with PH related to chronic lung disease, left heart disease, connective tissue disorders, or portal hypertension varies with the prognosis of the underlying disease, severity of the PH, and response to therapy.

Following lung transplantation, the median survival ranges from 4.5 years for patients with IPF to 7.8 years for patients with cystic fibrosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/palliative-care-for-adults-with-nonmalignant-chronic-lung-disease/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>].

For patients with severe or very severe COPD, respiratory failure from an acute exacerbation of COPD is the primary cause of death [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/palliative-care-for-adults-with-nonmalignant-chronic-lung-disease/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. On the other hand, patients with COPD often suffer from multiple comorbidities and a substantial minority (approximately 42 percent) die of non-respiratory diseases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/palliative-care-for-adults-with-nonmalignant-chronic-lung-disease/abstract/7,17\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,17</a>]. The most common causes of death for patients with mild or moderate COPD are cancer and cardiovascular disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/palliative-care-for-adults-with-nonmalignant-chronic-lung-disease/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>].

However, coronary artery disease, heart failure, bronchogenic carcinoma, infection, and pulmonary embolism are additional contributors to mortality. &#160; </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The main cause of death in patients with PAH is right heart failure with circulatory collapse and superimposed respiratory failure. Circulatory collapse can also occur when these patients are placed on mechanical ventilation for ventilatory failure. Patients with PAH who experience cardiac arrest rarely survive. In a retrospective study of more than 3000 patients with PAH who required cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR), only 6 percent survived for 90 days [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/palliative-care-for-adults-with-nonmalignant-chronic-lung-disease/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>].

Chronic lung allograft dysfunction (CLAD), which manifests as bronchiolitis obliterans or restrictive allograft syndrome (RAS), is the leading cause of mortality after the first year. Infectious complications remain a major cause of death at all time points after lung transplantation.

The interdisciplinary support service delivered an intervention focused on assessing patients&rsquo; symptoms and teaching mastery skills to manage dyspnea. Patients assigned to the support service reported a 16 percent improvement in breathlessness mastery as compared to usual care. These findings support early integration of palliative care to improve dyspnea control for patients with advanced lung diseases.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A review of the impact of outpatient palliative care on outcomes that included studies conducted in patients diagnosed with late-stage COPD, heart failure, and cancer concluded that palliative care services improve patient satisfaction, symptom control, quality of life, and reduced health care utilization [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/palliative-care-for-adults-with-nonmalignant-chronic-lung-disease/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A systematic review of 23 studies that were conducted in the United States, United Kingdom, Sweden, Norway, Italy, Spain, Canada, and Australia and included patients with cancer, heart failure (HF), COPD, <span class=\"nowrap\">HIV/AIDS</span> and multiple sclerosis found that use of expert home palliative care teams more than doubled the odds of dying at home [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/palliative-care-for-adults-with-nonmalignant-chronic-lung-disease/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. This review further found that home palliative care reduced the symptom burden for patients, while usual care was associated with an increase in symptoms.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Similarly, several studies suggest benefit of palliative care consultation services for patients with chronic disease. A study of 524 dying patients at five VA medical centers and affiliated nursing homes in 2006 to 2007 showed that those who received inpatient palliative care consultations had significantly better outcomes in five of six domains studied: information and communication, access to home care services, emotional and spiritual support, well-being and dignity, and care around the time of death [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/palliative-care-for-adults-with-nonmalignant-chronic-lung-disease/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. Several studies also suggest that inpatient palliative care consultations are associated with a reduction in costs of care in the hospital [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/palliative-care-for-adults-with-nonmalignant-chronic-lung-disease/abstract/27-29\" class=\"abstract_t\">27-29</a>]. Moreover, a study performed in Australia showed that community-based palliative care can reduce hospital costs for patients with multiple conditions, including COPD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/palliative-care-for-adults-with-nonmalignant-chronic-lung-disease/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>].

In the United States, the term hospice is used to describe a model of palliative care that is offered to patients with a terminal disease who are at the end of life (generally with an estimated life expectancy of six months or less) when curative or life-prolonging therapy is no longer the focus of treatment. In contrast, palliative care should be appropriately offered to patients at any time along the trajectory of any type of serious life-threatening illness, even concurrent with restorative, life-prolonging therapies. While all care that is delivered by hospice programs can be considered palliative care, not all palliative care is delivered in hospices.</p><p>Eligibility for hospice care generally requires that a physician estimate that life expectancy is six months or less.

In most jurisdictions, palliative care is provided by an interdisciplinary team of specially trained physicians, nurses, social workers, chaplains, and other specialists with advanced training in palliative care who work with a patient&rsquo;s other clinicians to provide an &quot;extra layer&quot; of support. Clinicians who are specifically trained in palliative care can provide in-depth pain and symptom management, communication regarding goals of care, and care coordination across settings and over time. Subspecialty palliative care services are most available in high-income countries, as exemplified by the United States. The availability of subspecialty palliative care services in low income countries is generally quite limited. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=benefits-services-and-models-of-subspecialty-palliative-care\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Benefits, services, and models of subspecialty palliative care&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=palliative-care-and-hospice-outside-of-the-united-states\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Palliative care and hospice outside of the United States&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Indications for a formal palliative care consultation are discussed in detail below.

Some term this &quot;primary&quot; palliative care, to distinguish it from &quot;secondary&quot; or &quot;subspecialty&quot; palliative care [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/palliative-care-for-adults-with-nonmalignant-chronic-lung-disease/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>]. This encompasses any type of supportive care that is delivered by all health care professionals caring for patients with serious life-threatening illness. Optimal palliative care for patients with chronic lung disease should ideally incorporate both primary and subspecialty palliative care. Several examples of skill sets that are appropriate for primary versus subspecialty palliative care are provided in the table (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PALC%2F107897\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef107897 \">table 3</a>). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=primary-palliative-care\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Primary palliative care&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Clinicians caring for these patients need to attain competence in providing comprehensive supportive care.

Indications for a formal palliative care consultation have not been established for patients with chronic lung disease. However, criteria for a palliative care assessment at the time of admission to the hospital are available (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F76969\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef76969 \">table 5</a>). Other criteria that may apply to outpatients with chronic lung disease are summarized in the table (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F103284\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef103284 \">table 6</a>). &#160;</p><p>Consideration of disease specific criteria (eg, COPD GOLD stage 4 or a decline in forced vital capacity [FVC] for patients with IPF), in addition to the degree of functional impairment, helps guide clinicians on when to consult specialty palliative care. For clinicians who do not integrate primary palliative care into their practice, an early consult to specialty palliative care may help guide subsequent goals of care discussions. &#160;</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2035032\"><span class=\"h2\">How to introduce palliative care to patients and families</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>It can be helpful to introduce palliative care as &quot;supportive care&quot; and explain that it focuses on symptom management and team communication about the patients&rsquo; goals and care wishes. This description helps to address the general lack of understanding about the meaning of palliative care. A study found that patients and caregivers better understood the meaning of supportive care than palliative care, which is often misperceived as end-of-life care [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/palliative-care-for-adults-with-nonmalignant-chronic-lung-disease/abstract/43\" class=\"abstract_t\">43</a>]. It is important to emphasize that palliative care is often provided in addition to a patient&rsquo;s current treatment plan. For example, a patient with COPD can receive palliative care and still choose to receive endotracheal intubation, if needed, in the event of an acute exacerbation with respiratory failure.</p><p>When thinking about the language to use to initiate a conversation about palliative care, it may be helpful to focus on aspects of that particular patient&rsquo;s symptoms or clinical course, such as progressive dyspnea, an increase in oxygen requirement, decrement in pulmonary function tests, increasing dependence on others, or a recent emergency department visit or hospitalization that may have suggested the need for a goals of care discussion or advance care planning (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F104118\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef104118 \">table 7</a>).</p><p>It may be beneficial to include family caregivers of patients with advanced lung disease in these discussions as they often need to make specific and urgent treatment decisions about life-sustaining treatment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/palliative-care-for-adults-with-nonmalignant-chronic-lung-disease/abstract/44\" class=\"abstract_t\">44</a>].

ACP enables individuals to define goals and preferences for future medical treatment and care, to discuss these goals and preferences with family and health-care providers, and to record and review these preferences if appropriate [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/palliative-care-for-adults-with-nonmalignant-chronic-lung-disease/abstract/47\" class=\"abstract_t\">47</a>]. In an ideal ACP discussion, the clinicians, patient, and his or her loved ones think through particular approaches to follow if (or when) the patient&rsquo;s health declines. This process is iterative and typically occurs longitudinally within the context of an existing and continuing medical relationship [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/palliative-care-for-adults-with-nonmalignant-chronic-lung-disease/abstract/48\" class=\"abstract_t\">48</a>]. General issues about advance care planning are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=advance-care-planning-and-advance-directives\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Advance care planning and advance directives&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Issues related to advance care planning for patients with chronic lung disease include the patient&rsquo;s diagnosis, the expected disease course, and whether the patient would want intubation and mechanical ventilation. If the patient would like a trial of mechanical ventilation, parameters for discontinuing mechanical ventilation should be included. The potential outcomes of <span class=\"nowrap\">intubation/mechanical</span> ventilation should be described to help the patient&rsquo;s decision-making. While prognostic uncertainty and variable trajectory of illness make communication about these issues difficult [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/palliative-care-for-adults-with-nonmalignant-chronic-lung-disease/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>], it is important to incorporate this uncertainty into advance care planning. (See <a href=\"#H112542889\" class=\"local\">'Disease trajectory'</a> above.)</p><p>A systematic review demonstrated that advanced care planning was acceptable and desired by most patients with chronic lung diseases and their clinicians, although engaging in advance care planning was rare [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/palliative-care-for-adults-with-nonmalignant-chronic-lung-disease/abstract/49\" class=\"abstract_t\">49</a>].</p><p>Emerging research suggests that advance care planning discussions may be facilitated by nurse-led intervention and the use of specific end of life communication tools.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A multicenter, open-label randomized trial with preference arm showed that nurse-led facilitated advance care planning is acceptable to patients with advanced respiratory disease and effective in increasing advance care planning discussions and completion of formal documents [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/palliative-care-for-adults-with-nonmalignant-chronic-lung-disease/abstract/50\" class=\"abstract_t\">50</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A randomized trial testing an end-of-life communication tool for patients with severe COPD found an increase in the occurrence and quality of these discussions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/palliative-care-for-adults-with-nonmalignant-chronic-lung-disease/abstract/51\" class=\"abstract_t\">51</a>]. However, the study was not able to demonstrate a long-term impact on the documentation of goals of care discussions or completion of advanced directives. Further research is needed to develop interventions that ensure repeated assessments of preferences for life-sustaining treatments.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2034893\"><span class=\"h4\">When to begin the discussion</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Advance care planning discussions should begin early in the disease process when the patient is well enough to participate. Patients tend to underestimate disease severity and rarely initiate a discussion about palliative care or end-of-life planning [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/palliative-care-for-adults-with-nonmalignant-chronic-lung-disease/abstract/52\" class=\"abstract_t\">52</a>]. In the month before they died, only 31 percent of patients with advanced COPD estimated their life-expectancy to be less than one year [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/palliative-care-for-adults-with-nonmalignant-chronic-lung-disease/abstract/53\" class=\"abstract_t\">53</a>]. Concerns about dying and fears of breathlessness or suffocation are highly prevalent, but are scarcely discussed with their clinicians [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/palliative-care-for-adults-with-nonmalignant-chronic-lung-disease/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>]. Preferably, these discussions should occur when the patient is relatively stable, rather than at a time of acute illness. Studies suggest most patients and their families prefer to have these conversations in a stable medical state when they are able to make clear decisions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/palliative-care-for-adults-with-nonmalignant-chronic-lung-disease/abstract/54\" class=\"abstract_t\">54</a>]. </p><p>Several transition points in chronic lung disease have been identified that should serve to prompt a discussion about goals of care and advance care planning [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/palliative-care-for-adults-with-nonmalignant-chronic-lung-disease/abstract/54-56\" class=\"abstract_t\">54-56</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The start of new or different treatments, eg, initiation of oxygen therapy </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Lack of further life-prolonging treatment options</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Functional decline </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Frequent exacerbations</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Frequent <span class=\"nowrap\">hospitalizations/emergency</span> room visits</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Referral for lung transplantation</p><p/><p>Once a transition point is identified, the clinician can choose the appropriate time and place to broach the topic, determine who should be present, and hold a meeting with the patient and family.</p><p>One barrier to initiating a discussion of palliative care is the lack of precision in determining prognosis, particularly among patients with COPD.

Eliciting information about the patient&rsquo;s perception of the impact of the disease in their life, disease severity and prognosis will guide the clinician in achieving this balance. Sensitivity to the individual patient&rsquo;s response to a discussion of these issues is essential due to the broad variation in patient responses. Discussions about prognosis can be especially difficult. Issues related to communication of prognosis in patients with advanced life-threatening illness and practical guidance for discussing prognosis are addressed elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=communication-of-prognosis-in-palliative-care\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Communication of prognosis in palliative care&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=discussing-serious-news\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Discussing serious news&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Many patients with advanced lung disease fear dyspnea crisis and suffocation. So, it is important for patients to discuss palliative care options for dyspnea and how to manage dyspnea crisis. Reassurance about a clear plan to deal with dyspnea may alleviate unspoken fears. Other relevant palliative care topics are the role of advance directives and surrogate decision-makers, preferences for location of end-of-life care and spiritual beliefs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/palliative-care-for-adults-with-nonmalignant-chronic-lung-disease/abstract/58,59\" class=\"abstract_t\">58,59</a>].

Thus, understanding a patient&rsquo;s preferences for life-sustaining treatments early in the disease course is particularly relevant. When given the opportunity, patients with chronic lung disease are able to indicate their preferences regarding life-sustaining treatments based on their expected burden of treatment and expected outcome of treatment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/palliative-care-for-adults-with-nonmalignant-chronic-lung-disease/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>]. Thus, it is important to include a discussion of prognosis after resuscitation or mechanical ventilation and potential withdrawal of life support.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Prognosis after resuscitation or mechanical ventilation</strong> &ndash; Patients with COPD tend to have a poor prognosis for returning home and living independently after in-hospital resuscitation or, to a lesser extent, mechanical ventilation for an exacerbation. A study found that among patients with COPD who received in-hospital resuscitation, only 15 percent of patients survived to hospital discharge and, among survivors, they had a median survival of only five months [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/palliative-care-for-adults-with-nonmalignant-chronic-lung-disease/abstract/60\" class=\"abstract_t\">60</a>]. Furthermore, less than 2 percent were discharged home after the hospitalization and were alive at six months [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/palliative-care-for-adults-with-nonmalignant-chronic-lung-disease/abstract/60\" class=\"abstract_t\">60</a>]. A retrospective cohort study of 4791 patients with COPD receiving long term oxygen treatment examined the outcomes of patients who received invasive mechanical ventilation for an exacerbation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/palliative-care-for-adults-with-nonmalignant-chronic-lung-disease/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. In total, 23 percent of these patients died during the hospital admission, and an additional 45 percent died in the subsequent 12 months. Two-thirds of the patients surviving hospitalization were readmitted at least once in the year following the hospital admission and more than a quarter were discharged to a nursing home or skilled nursing facility. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">For patients with IPF, prognosis after mechanical ventilation for respiratory failure is also poor. In one review that included 135 patients, the mortality was 87 percent in the intensive care unit and 94 percent at three months [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/palliative-care-for-adults-with-nonmalignant-chronic-lung-disease/abstract/61\" class=\"abstract_t\">61</a>]. Other smaller studies have reported a similar 85 percent in hospital mortality rate for invasive mechanical ventilation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/palliative-care-for-adults-with-nonmalignant-chronic-lung-disease/abstract/62,63\" class=\"abstract_t\">62,63</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Withdrawal of ventilatory support</strong> &ndash; Making an &quot;all-or-nothing&quot; decision about ventilatory support may be difficult in the early stage of an illness. The possibility of a time-limited trial of ventilatory support may allow treatment of a process like pneumonia, which is expected to be curable, but enable clinicians to withdraw ventilatory support if the patient does not improve in a reasonable amount of time as guided by the patient. Thus, it is prudent to establish the goals of care and the situations in which mechanical ventilation would be discontinued. Alternatively, patients may agree to noninvasive ventilation, but not intubation with invasive ventilation. (See <a href=\"#H2036141\" class=\"local\">'How to establish goals of care'</a> below and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=withholding-and-withdrawing-ventilatory-support-in-adults-in-the-intensive-care-unit\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Withholding and withdrawing ventilatory support in adults in the intensive care unit&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2036141\"><span class=\"h4\">How to establish goals of care</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Discussing goals of care is an important component of advance care planning, and this starts with exploring what is important to the patient.

Some patients feel that living as long as possible is most important even if it means that they have to undergo highly burdensome interventions, such as prolonged mechanical ventilation, that impair their quality of life. Other patients may want to spend their remaining time at home with their loved ones without having to go to the hospital, even if this compromises their survival. The best possible care should support patients to live the rest of their lives according to their informed wishes. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=discussing-goals-of-care\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Discussing goals of care&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Asking about the experience of living with advanced lung disease as well as previous experiences with hospital admissions is important during goals of care and advance care planning discussions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/palliative-care-for-adults-with-nonmalignant-chronic-lung-disease/abstract/64\" class=\"abstract_t\">64</a>]. The narrative of these experiences can help the clinician understand the patient&rsquo;s day-to-day disease burden, and also their expectations, hopes, and fears about their future disease experience. Once the goals have been defined, the clinician may then describe the potential burden of future treatments, possible outcomes, and the likelihood of these outcomes in the context of the patient&rsquo;s goals. Doing so will greatly facilitate decision-making for specific treatments. Hopefully, such discussion will also lead to a realistic understanding of the limits of therapy and avoidance of requests for treatments that are considered futile or medically inappropriate. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ethics-in-the-intensive-care-unit-responding-to-requests-for-potentially-inappropriate-therapies-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Ethics in the intensive care unit: Responding to requests for potentially inappropriate therapies in adults&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=palliative-care-medically-futile-and-potentially-inappropriate-therapies-of-questionable-benefit\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Palliative care: Medically futile and potentially inappropriate therapies of questionable benefit&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Gaining insight to patients&rsquo; perspectives on what is important to their quality of life not only serves as the foundation for making decisions about treatments, but can improve patients&rsquo; overall satisfaction with clinicians&rsquo; communication skills [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/palliative-care-for-adults-with-nonmalignant-chronic-lung-disease/abstract/65\" class=\"abstract_t\">65</a>]. Thus, it is important to avoid the common mistake of asking patients to make specific treatment choices, such as cardiopulmonary resuscitation or mechanical ventilation, prior to ascertaining the patient&rsquo;s overall values and goals for care.

To help clarify the goals of care, clinicians should consider which of these three categories apply to specific patients. These three categories underscore the need to elicit patient preferences and goals, communicate the rationale for NIV, and outline parameters for success and failure of NIV. Importantly, goals of care may change during the treatment of an episode of acute respiratory failure. </p><p>Studies suggest that NIV is the treatment of choice for some patients with acute respiratory failure in category 1 (such as acute exacerbations of COPD). For category 2, studies suggest that in some subgroups of patients (such as patients with COPD or heart failure) hospital survival after use of NIV for a patient who has opted to forego endotracheal intubation can be acceptable, in the 50 to 75 percent range [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/palliative-care-for-adults-with-nonmalignant-chronic-lung-disease/abstract/89,90\" class=\"abstract_t\">89,90</a>]. For patients with COPD and hypercapnia who have benefitted from NIV during hospitalization for an acute exacerbation of COPD, nocturnal NIV may be used after discharge.

Another smaller trial suggests a similar improvement in dyspnea scores between NIV and high-flow oxygen in patients with dyspnea related to advanced cancer [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/palliative-care-for-adults-with-nonmalignant-chronic-lung-disease/abstract/93\" class=\"abstract_t\">93</a>].

A qualitative study of patients with COPD, caregivers, and health care professionals identified important issues to be considered prior to initiating palliative NIV, such as the effectiveness of NIV in providing symptom relief and improved energy, patients&rsquo; and caregivers&rsquo; perceptions of the usefulness of NIV to manage dyspnea, burden of therapy and effects on quality of life (eg, discomfort of mask and pressure sores, dryness in mouth, loss of intimacy if bed partner bothered by noise of machine), and socioeconomic issues (eg, greater burden and dependence on caregivers; expense of machine, tubing, replacement masks) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/palliative-care-for-adults-with-nonmalignant-chronic-lung-disease/abstract/94\" class=\"abstract_t\">94</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H196296618\"><span class=\"h2\">Anticipating and managing &quot;dyspnea crisis&quot;</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>&quot;Dyspnea crisis&quot; is defined as a &quot;sustained and severe resting breathing discomfort that occurs in patients with advanced, often life-limiting illness and overwhelms the patient and caregivers&rsquo; ability to achieve symptom relief&quot; [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/palliative-care-for-adults-with-nonmalignant-chronic-lung-disease/abstract/95\" class=\"abstract_t\">95</a>].

If it is consistent with the goals of care, the first step in the management of chronic cough is to determine the etiology, as it is not necessarily due to the primary lung disease. As examples, among patients with interstitial lung disease, cough may be caused by etiologies such as angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors, upper airway cough syndrome, gastroesophageal reflux, or bronchiectasis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/palliative-care-for-adults-with-nonmalignant-chronic-lung-disease/abstract/101,102\" class=\"abstract_t\">101,102</a>].

The distress from expectoration of a small amount of blood-flecked sputum may be relieved by reassurance. At the other extreme, if hemoptysis is massive, it may herald a life-ending event, and witnessing what may be exsanguination requires urgent attention to all who are witnesses.

(See <a href=\"#H9323031\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The primary goal of palliative care is to improve the quality of life for the patient with a serious illness and their family through relief of emotional and physical symptoms. Thus, eligibility is based on the diagnosis of advanced, life-threatening illness requiring management of serious symptoms, social or emotional needs, or a goals-of-care discussion. (See <a href=\"#H112542927\" class=\"local\">'Use and benefits of palliative care'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Palliative care differs from hospice in the United States, where the term &quot;hospice&quot; describes a model of care focused primarily on comfort that is offered only toward the end of life, generally the last one to six months of life. Criteria for hospice eligibility are described in the tables (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F61282\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef61282 \">table 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PALC%2F87321\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef87321 \">table 2</a>). (See <a href=\"#H112543921\" class=\"local\">'What is the difference between palliative care and hospice?'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Optimal palliative care for patients with chronic lung disease incorporates both primary and secondary (subspecialty) palliative care. Basic aspects of primary palliative care can be provided by the patient&rsquo;s usual clinicians, while secondary palliative care is provided by clinicians with specialty training in palliative care. Individual patients in different stages of their illness require different services depending on their needs and preferences, as well as the palliative care skills of their clinicians. (See <a href=\"#H632048682\" class=\"local\">'What is the difference between primary and secondary (subspecialty) palliative care?'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>While patients with serious lung disease typically have a phase of gradual decline, the trajectory can change abruptly. Thus, advance care planning, including patient-clinician communication about end-of-life care, is of major importance for patients and their loved ones. (See <a href=\"#H9323062\" class=\"local\">'Clinical course and causes of death'</a> above and <a href=\"#H112543844\" class=\"local\">'Advance care planning'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Topics that are important to address during advance care planning discussions include diagnosis, prognosis, patient&rsquo;s goals of care, and values and beliefs. Only after discussing these issues, should clinicians discuss treatment preferences. In particular, it is important to avoid the common mistake of asking patients to make specific treatment choices, such as cardiopulmonary resuscitation or mechanical ventilation, prior to discussing their values and goals. (See <a href=\"#H2035752\" class=\"local\">'What topics should be discussed?'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Dyspnea is a central symptom in most advanced lung diseases. For patients receiving palliative care who have dyspnea that is refractory to specific therapies for their underlying disease, systemic opioids are the first-line agents. The usual initial dose is sustained-release <a href=\"topic.htm?path=morphine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">morphine</a> 10 mg daily with gradual individual dose titration while monitoring for adverse effects. The use of opioids for dyspnea is not associated with excess mortality. Early integration of palliative care can improve dyspnea mastery for patients with COPD and probably for patients with other chronic lung diseases. (See <a href=\"#H1459665111\" class=\"local\">'Refractory dyspnea'</a> above and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=assessment-and-management-of-dyspnea-in-palliative-care#H5404267\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Assessment and management of dyspnea in palliative care&quot;, section on 'Systemic opioids'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>&quot;Dyspnea crisis&quot; is defined as sustained and severe resting breathing discomfort that occurs in patients with advanced, life-limiting illness and often overwhelms the patient and caregivers&rsquo; ability to achieve symptom relief. The mnemonic &quot;COMFORT&quot; can be used by caregivers to remember the steps to managing a dyspnea crisis: Call for help; Observe the degree of respiratory difficulty; Medications such as inhaled bronchodilators or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=morphine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">morphine</a> may help; Fan or other measures to create air movement; Oxygen can be administered or increased; Reassure; Take your time (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F104122\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef104122 \">table 12</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F104123\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef104123 \">figure 1</a>). (See <a href=\"#H196296618\" class=\"local\">'Anticipating and managing &quot;dyspnea crisis&quot;'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Noninvasive ventilation (NIV) is sometimes used in patients with chronic lung disease to avoid intubation and mechanical ventilation and occasionally used to reduce dyspnea or treat chronic hypercapnia. Defining the goals of care before implementing NIV, either as a life-sustaining treatment or as a palliative measure, is particularly important in the care of patients with chronic lung disease. (See <a href=\"#H112542735\" class=\"local\">'Noninvasive ventilation in the setting of palliative care'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The palliative treatment of other respiratory symptoms, such as cough, sputum production, and hemoptysis, and also extrapulmonary symptoms (eg, anxiety and insomnia) can improve the patient&rsquo;s experience of their illness.
