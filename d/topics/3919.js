Intestinal motility disorders and chronic pancreatitis are estimated to account for approximately 90 percent of cases of SIBO [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/small-intestinal-bacterial-overgrowth-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/1-3\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-3</a>]. Patients may have more than one predisposing cause. As an example, the high prevalence of SIBO in older adults may be due to small intestinal dysmotility and gastric hypochlorhydria.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Motility disorders </strong>&mdash; The migrating motor complex (MMC) and in particular, phase III of the MMC clears the small bowel of debris [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/small-intestinal-bacterial-overgrowth-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. A lack of interdigestive phase III activity in patients with irritable bowel syndrome, narcotic use, intestinal pseudo-obstruction, and diabetes predisposes them to SIBO. Small bowel motility is also affected in acute or chronic radiation enteritis, amyloidosis, and scleroderma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/small-intestinal-bacterial-overgrowth-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/5-9\" class=\"abstract_t\">5-9</a>].

Patients with combined variable immunodeficiency, IgA deficiency, and acquired immunodeficiency (eg, HIV) are therefore at increased risk of SIBO.

(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diabetic-autonomic-neuropathy-of-the-gastrointestinal-tract#H9\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Diabetic autonomic neuropathy of the gastrointestinal tract&quot;, section on 'Diabetic diarrhea'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3471999398\"><span class=\"h1\">PATHOGENESIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>SIBO is usually associated with abnormally high counts of multiple organisms in the small intestine. Common species associated with SIBO include streptococci, <em>Bacteroides</em>, <em>Escherichia</em>, and <em>Lactobacillus</em> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/small-intestinal-bacterial-overgrowth-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. Inflammation is caused by invasive strains of bacteria [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/small-intestinal-bacterial-overgrowth-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. Facultative anaerobes can injure the intestinal surface by direct adherence and production of enterotoxins. Aerobic bacteria produce enzymes and metabolic products that can induce epithelial cell injury [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/small-intestinal-bacterial-overgrowth-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Intestinal effects</strong> &mdash; SIBO can cause maldigestion in the intestinal lumen, or malabsorption at the level of the intestinal microvillus membrane due to enterocyte damage. Bacterial overgrowth can also alter small bowel motility [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/small-intestinal-bacterial-overgrowth-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span><strong>Carbohydrate malabsorption </strong>&ndash; Intraluminal degradation of carbohydrates leads to the production of short-chain fatty acids (butyrate, propionate, acetate, lactate) as well as carbon dioxide, hydrogen, and methane. Enterocyte damage due to bile acids and bacteria results in diarrhea due to reduction in enterocyte disaccharidase activity and transport of monosaccharides [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/small-intestinal-bacterial-overgrowth-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. Fermentation of unabsorbed carbohydrates results in bloating, distension, and flatulence.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span><strong>Fat malabsorption</strong> &ndash; Fat malabsorption can lead to steatorrhea, weight loss, and deficiencies of fat-soluble vitamins (eg, vitamin A and D). SIBO results in deconjugation of primary bile acids [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/small-intestinal-bacterial-overgrowth-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/16,17\" class=\"abstract_t\">16,17</a>]. At physiologic pH, bile acids are fully ionized, preventing their absorption in the proximal small intestine and permitting sufficient concentrations for solubilization of dietary fat. However, deconjugated bile salts are reabsorbed by the jejunum, which may lead to fat malabsorption due to depletion of the normal bile acid pool. Bacterial deconjugation also leads to the production of lithocholic acid, which may be toxic to intestinal epithelium, resulting in impaired absorption of fat and other nutrients. Hydroxylated fatty acids (and free bile acids) also stimulate the secretion of water and electrolytes, leading to diarrhea. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Clinical features'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span><strong>Protein malabsorption </strong>&ndash; Protein malabsorption results from damage to the epithelial barrier, resulting in increased intestinal permeability, decreased mucosal uptake of amino acids, and the intraluminal degradation of protein precursors by bacteria [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/small-intestinal-bacterial-overgrowth-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. SIBO can also result in a reversible form of protein-losing enteropathy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/small-intestinal-bacterial-overgrowth-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=protein-losing-gastroenteropathy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Protein-losing gastroenteropathy&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span><strong>Vitamin deficiency and excess </strong>&ndash; Vitamin B12 deficiency in SIBO result from several different mechanisms. Although enteric bacteria synthesize cobalamin, they also successfully compete with the host for its absorption. In patients with severe SIBO, malabsorption of vitamin B12 results from mucosal damage to the ileal binding site. Only anaerobes can utilize vitamin B12 coupled to intrinsic factor. Thiamine and nicotinamide deficiency also result from bacterial utilization. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\">In contrast, folate and vitamin K levels are elevated in SIBO due to bacterial synthesis. Increased intestinal permeability also contributes to increased vitamin K levels. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Systemic effects</strong> &mdash; Production of toxins and increased intestinal permeability in SIBO have been associated with systemic complications. D-lactic acidosis is a rare neurologic syndrome in patients with SIBO associated with short bowel syndrome or a prior jejunoileal bypass. It is characterized by altered mental status ranging from confusion to coma, slurred speech, seizures, and ataxia resulting from bacterial fermentation of unabsorbed carbohydrates [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/small-intestinal-bacterial-overgrowth-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>].

Steatorrhea with greasy or bulky stools is rare and usually occurs in patients with altered anatomy (eg, blind loop syndrome) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/small-intestinal-bacterial-overgrowth-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>].

In severe cases, patients have weight loss due to diarrhea or poor oral intake. </p><p>Patients with severe SIBO in the setting of a jejunoileal bypass surgery or short bowel syndrome (SBS) may have symptoms due to associated vitamin deficiency. Patients with vitamin B12 deficiency can present with weakness, sensory ataxia, and paresthesias. Patients with tetany due to hypocalcemia can present with perioral numbness, paresthesias of the hands and feet, and muscle cramps. Children may also have metabolic bone disease due to vitamin D deficiency. In rare cases, patients with SIBO and SBS present with altered mental status due to D-lactic acidosis after a high carbohydrate meal. Symptoms can range from confusion to coma, slurred speech, seizures, and ataxia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/small-intestinal-bacterial-overgrowth-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>].

The diagnosis is established with a positive carbohydrate breath test or a bacterial concentration of &gt;10<sup>3</sup> colony forming <span class=\"nowrap\">units/mL</span> in a jejunal aspirate culture. We perform a carbohydrate breath test to diagnose SIBO as it is simple, non-invasive, and widely available. </p><p>No additional evaluation is needed to diagnose SIBO. However, we obtain additional tests to diagnose laboratory abnormalities associated with SIBO and to rule out other causes of similar symptoms (eg, celiac disease) which may co-exist with SIBO. In patients with severe diarrhea or iron deficiency anemia, we perform endoscopic evaluation with colonoscopy. The evaluation of patients with chronic diarrhea is discussed in detail, separately.

In individuals without SIBO, the administration of lactulose results in a single peak in breath <span class=\"nowrap\">hydrogen/methane</span> within two to three hours due to the metabolism of lactulose by colonic flora. In patients with SIBO, administration of lactulose results in an early peak in breath <span class=\"nowrap\">hydrogen/methane</span> levels due to metabolism by small bowel bacteria.</p><p>Glucose is rapidly absorbed from the proximal small bowel. When used as a substrate in the presence of SIBO, it is metabolized to hydrogen in the small bowel lumen prior to absorption. </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Patient preparation and test protocol</strong> &mdash; There is considerable variability in test methodology and interpretation of carbohydrate breath tests. Our recommendations are consistent with a 2017 North American consensus statement on hydrogen and methane-based breath testing in gastrointestinal disorders.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Antibiotics should be avoided four weeks prior to testing.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Prokinetic drugs and laxatives should be held for one week prior to testing.

IBS is a functional syndrome that is predominantly characterized by recurrent chronic abdominal pain. The abdominal pain in IBS, unlike SIBO, is related to defecation and is associated with a change in frequency or form (appearance) of stool.

In patients without risk factors for SIBO, we perform an upper endoscopy and colonoscopy to rule out predisposing conditions (eg, atrophic gastritis and Crohn disease). If endoscopic evaluation is unrevealing, we perform imaging of the small bowel to evaluate for partial obstruction, dilation, inflammation, diverticula, or a fistula. We perform a magnetic resonance enterography as it has the advantage of avoiding radiation exposure and has a high sensitivity for detecting small bowel strictures.

The incidence of SIBO increases with age. Several disorders predispose to SIBO by altering mucosal defenses (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F81285\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef81285 \">table 1</a>). Intestinal motility disorders and chronic pancreatitis are estimated to account for approximately 90 percent of cases of SIBO. In many cases, patients have more than one predisposing cause. (See <a href=\"#H281085201\" class=\"local\">'Epidemiology'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>SIBO can cause maldigestion in the intestinal lumen, or malabsorption at the level of the intestinal microvillus membrane due to enterocyte damage. Bacterial overgrowth can also alter small bowel motility. (See <a href=\"#H3471999398\" class=\"local\">'Pathogenesis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The majority of patients with SIBO present with bloating, flatulence, abdominal discomfort, or watery diarrhea. Steatorrhea with greasy or bulky stools is rare and usually occurs in patients with altered anatomy (eg, blind loop syndrome). Children can present with failure to gain weight. In severe cases, patients have weight loss due to diarrhea or poor oral intake. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Clinical features'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Laboratory abnormalities are usually seen in patients with SIBO that is severe or that occurs in association with an anatomic abnormality. Laboratory findings including macrocytic anemia, B12 deficiency, and the presence of fecal fat. Patients may also have low levels of thiamine and niacin, and elevated serum folate and vitamin K levels. In rare cases, patients have microcytic anemia or hypoalbuminemia. (See <a href=\"#H114230270\" class=\"local\">'Laboratory findings'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The endoscopic appearance and histopathology of the small intestine and colon is normal in most patients with SIBO. Endoscopic findings of colitis and ileitis associated with severe SIBO are nonspecific and include mucosal edema, loss of normal vascular pattern, patchy erythema, friability and ulceration. Histopathological findings associated with SIBO include villous blunting, cryptitis, intraepithelial lymphocytosis, and eosinophilia. (See <a href=\"#H19806109\" class=\"local\">'Endoscopy findings'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The diagnosis of SIBO should be suspected in patients with bloating, flatulence, abdominal discomfort, or diarrhea, and is established with a positive carbohydrate breath test or jejunal aspirate culture. We perform a carbohydrate breath test to diagnose SIBO as it is simple, non-invasive, and widely available. (See <a href=\"#H37681834\" class=\"local\">'Diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A bacterial concentration of &gt;10<sup>3</sup> colony forming <span class=\"nowrap\">units/mL</span> of jejunal aspirate is diagnostic of SIBO. However, the test requires an upper endoscopy to obtain an aspirate and the results are poorly reproducible. (See <a href=\"#H894085110\" class=\"local\">'Jejunal aspirate culture'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Carbohydrate breath tests are easy to perform, noninvasive, and inexpensive. The <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lactulose-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">lactulose</a><span class=\"nowrap\">/glucose</span> breath test is diagnostic of SIBO if any one of the following: </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>An absolute increase in hydrogen by &ge;20 ppm above baseline within 90 minutes. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>A methane level &ge;10 ppm regardless of the time during the breath test.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Most patients with established SIBO have a known underlying condition (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F81285\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef81285 \">table 1</a>). However, additional tests should be performed if the underlying etiology is unknown. An upper endoscopy and colonoscopy should also be performed to rule out predisposing conditions (eg, atrophic gastritis and Crohn disease). In patients without a clear underlying predisposing cause, imaging of the small intestine (eg, small bowel follow-through, computed <span class=\"nowrap\">tomography/magnetic</span> resonance enterography) should be performed to rule out an underlying anatomic cause of SIBO.
