It involves the colon, which is another name for the large intestine (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F66110\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef66110 \">figure 1</a>). There are 2 types of microscopic colitis, lymphocytic colitis and collagenous colitis. Both types cause the same symptoms and are treated the same way.</p><p>Microscopic colitis happens when the colon gets inflamed. But doctors don't always know what makes the colon inflamed. In some cases, the condition seems to be caused by an infection in the digestive system. In other cases, it seems to be caused by medicines. For example, a group of medicines called nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs, or &quot;NSAIDs&quot; for short, sometimes causes microscopic colitis.</p><p>Microscopic colitis happens most often in adults age 45 and older. Although the symptoms are bothersome, the condition is not life-threatening. It does not lead to serious problems, like cancer.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H867922287\"><span class=\"h1\">What are the symptoms of microscopic colitis?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Microscopic colitis causes episodes of diarrhea that is watery and not bloody. Most people have 4 to 9 watery bowel movements a day, but some people have more. Diarrhea can last weeks to months.</p><p>People sometimes have other symptoms, too. These commonly include weight loss, belly pain, or feeling very tired.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H867922302\"><span class=\"h1\">Is there a test for microscopic colitis?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Yes. Your doctor or nurse will do an exam and order different tests to exclude other causes of diarrhea and diagnose microscopic colitis. These can include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Blood tests</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Lab tests on a sample of your bowel movement</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Colonoscopy &ndash; This is a procedure that lets the doctor look at the inside of your colon. The doctor will put a thin tube with a camera and light on the end into your anus and up into your rectum and colon (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F52258\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef52258 \">figure 2</a>). During a colonoscopy, the doctor will do a test called a biopsy. For a biopsy, he or she will take small samples of tissue from your colon. Then another doctor will look at the samples under a microscope to check for microscopic colitis. A biopsy is the only test that can tell for sure whether you have microscopic colitis.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H867922340\"><span class=\"h1\">How is microscopic colitis treated?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Treatment depends on your individual situation. It usually involves one or more of the following:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Medicine changes &ndash; If your doctor thinks that your symptoms are caused by a medicine you take, he or she will recommend that you stop taking that medicine.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Anti-diarrhea medicines, such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=loperamide-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">loperamide</a> (brand name: Imodium) &ndash; These medicines reduce the number of bowel movements you have.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A steroid medicine called <a href=\"topic.htm?path=budesonide-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">budesonide</a> (brand name: Entocort) &ndash; This is not the same as the steroids some athletes take illegally. This medicine helps reduce inflammation in the colon.</p><p/><p>If these treatments don't help enough to ease your symptoms, let your doctor or nurse know. There are other medicines or treatments that might help.</p><p>Some people need to be on treatment long term. That's because symptoms sometimes come back after treatment is stopped.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H867922355\"><span class=\"h1\">More on this topic</span></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=diarrhea-in-adolescents-and-adults-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Diarrhea in adolescents and adults (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=colonoscopy-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Colonoscopy (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=celiac-disease-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Celiac disease (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=nonsteroidal-antiinflammatory-drugs-nsaids-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) (The Basics)</a></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=chronic-diarrhea-in-adults-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Chronic diarrhea in adults (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=colonoscopy-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Colonoscopy (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=celiac-disease-in-adults-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Celiac disease in adults (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=nonsteroidal-antiinflammatory-drugs-nsaids-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) (Beyond the Basics)</a></p></div><div id=\"reviewProcess\"><span>All topics are updated as new evidence becomes available and our <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/home/editorial-policy\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"policy policy_editorialpolicy\">peer review process</a> is complete.</span></div><div id=\"topicRetrievedDate\"><span class=\"emphasis\">This topic retrieved from UpToDate on: </span>Apr 03, 2018.</div><div id=\"disclaimer\">The content on the UpToDate website is not intended nor recommended as a substitute for medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.
