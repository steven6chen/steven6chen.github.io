In 1865, the first hospital-based ambulance service was developed at the Commercial Hospital in Cincinnati, Ohio. Four years later, New York City's Bellevue Hospital started the first municipal service [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prehospital-care-of-the-adult-trauma-patient/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. During the first half of the 20<sup>th</sup> century, ambulance services were most often provided by private individuals, particularly morticians as a service to families and to promote their funeral business.</p><p>Beginning in the mid-1950s in the United States, emergency medical service (EMS) systems began to mature in parallel with the burgeoning interstate highway system. Excessive speeds coupled with poorly designed vehicles had led to an increase in serious vehicular crashes, and few cities possessed the EMS systems needed to manage such patients. Subsequently, a national effort to develop EMS systems was initiated, and standards for provider education, scope of practice, equipment, vehicles, and system design were introduced [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prehospital-care-of-the-adult-trauma-patient/abstract/2,4,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,4,5</a>]. The result was a dramatic improvement in prehospital care.</p><p>This topic review will discuss prehospital care of the adult trauma patient. Discussions of specific procedures are found elsewhere.

Wide variation exists in the level and skill of treatment provided in the prehospital setting [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prehospital-care-of-the-adult-trauma-patient/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. Prehospital medicine typically consists of two levels of care: basic life support (BLS) and advanced life support (ALS).</p><p>For trauma care, basic skills include airway management (eg, maneuvers to open an airway, oral and nasal airway adjuncts, and bag-mask ventilation), cardiopulmonary resuscitation and automated external defibrillation, hemorrhage control, and fracture and spine immobilization. Emergency medical technicians (EMTs) certified at the basic level (EMT-B) can provide these services.</p><p>Systems functioning at the ALS level provide more comprehensive management, including advanced airway interventions (eg, endotracheal intubation, cricothyroidotomy), intravenous line placement and fluid administration, medication administration, cardiac monitoring and defibrillation, and needle thoracostomy. Providers certified at the paramedic level (EMT-P) can perform any of these interventions, while providers certified at the intermediate level (EMT-I) can perform a select subset. While EMS systems in most urban and suburban areas function at the ALS level of care, debate continues concerning the effectiveness of ALS interventions for traumatic emergencies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prehospital-care-of-the-adult-trauma-patient/abstract/7-10\" class=\"abstract_t\">7-10</a>].</p><p>An EMS medical director is a clinician who has undertaken specialized training and has an understanding of the capacity and extent of prehospital medical management. Directors oversee all aspects of EMS including: communications, clinical management, education, and quality improvement.</p><p>One important duty of the medical director is to develop patient care protocols, which serve as practice guidelines and standards of care for specific illnesses or injuries. Protocols may include standing orders, which enable prehospital providers to perform specified procedures or to administer medications for predefined conditions without a delay to obtain permission from a clinician.</p><p>The medical director typically also has the responsibility to develop protocols for triage and hospital notification. Such protocols ensure that receiving hospitals are adequately prepared to mobilize the resources needed to efficiently address any critically ill or injured patients being transported.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">PREHOSPITAL TRAUMA CARE</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Overview</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Three critical tasks must be rapidly performed by prehospital providers caring for trauma victims:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For the individual victim: examination with recognition of severe injuries and injuries with potential to cause rapid decompensation</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For multiple victims: triage with initiation of life-saving treatment</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Stabilization and transport to a hospital capable of addressing the identified injuries</p><p/><p>Rapid transport to the hospital is critically important, and prehospital providers must do all they can to minimize the amount of time spent on scene [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prehospital-care-of-the-adult-trauma-patient/abstract/11-15\" class=\"abstract_t\">11-15</a>]. Conflicting data exist concerning the relative importance of specific procedures in trauma management, but evidence suggests that patient mortality is lower when invasive procedures are performed in the hospital rather than en route [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prehospital-care-of-the-adult-trauma-patient/abstract/16-19\" class=\"abstract_t\">16-19</a>]. Assuming comparable transport times, studies suggest trauma victims do better when cared for by ALS providers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prehospital-care-of-the-adult-trauma-patient/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Triage</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Many forms of triage exist and a full discussion is beyond the scope of this review. Below, we provide an overview of important concepts and scoring systems used for prehospital triage of adult trauma patients. Triage of pediatric patients is reviewed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=classification-of-trauma-in-children\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Classification of trauma in children&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Triage of trauma victims is the process of rapidly and accurately evaluating patients to determine the extent of their injuries and the appropriate level of medical care required. The goal is to transport all seriously injured patients to medical facilities capable of providing appropriate care, while avoiding unnecessary transport of patients without critical injuries to trauma centers. Overall, triage tools should err on the side of reducing under-triage (ie, increasing sensitivity), at the risk of encouraging over-triage (ie, decreasing specificity). According to the American College of Surgeons, 5 percent is an acceptable under-triage rate, while acceptable over-triage rates may be as high as 50 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prehospital-care-of-the-adult-trauma-patient/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>].</p><p>Appropriate prehospital triage of trauma victims depends on a number of variables, including the nature of the incident, the number of victims, available resources, transport time, and the judgment of prehospital caretakers. As an example, triage for a motor vehicle accident with multiple victims involves determining which patients are most severely injured and ensuring that they are immediately transported to a trauma center. Priorities change during a mass casualty incident capable of overwhelming local healthcare resources. In such a circumstance, priority is placed on providing care to victims most likely to survive; victims with such severe injuries that they are unlikely to survive are given low priority because they consume a disproportionate share of resources.</p><p>Triage scoring systems have been developed to aid prehospital personnel. The ideal prehospital triage tool is simple to use, results in consistent findings when applied by different clinicians, and accurately differentiates between victims with major and minor injuries. No single best scoring system exists: the scoring system selected is based upon the type of incident, personnel, available resources, and the preference of emergency medical service (EMS) directors. Most scoring systems incorporate several types of criteria to differentiate major from minor trauma, including:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Physiologic (eg, blood pressure, level of consciousness)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Anatomic (eg, long bone fracture, surface area of burn)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Mechanistic (eg, height of fall, pedestrian hit by car)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Age and comorbidities</p><p/><p>Over the past two decades, trauma specialists have developed a number of prehospital triage scoring systems [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prehospital-care-of-the-adult-trauma-patient/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. Most incorporate simple assessments of neurologic, respiratory, and circulatory function. Examples of such triage scoring tools include the Prehospital Index, Revised Trauma Score, CRAMS score (Circulation, Respiration, <span class=\"nowrap\">Abdomen/Thorax,</span> Motor, Speech), and MGAP (Mechanism, GCS, Age, arterial Pressure) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F79522\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef79522 \">table 1</a>).</p><p>Field personnel created START (Simple Triage and Rapid Treatment) for use as a prehospital triage system utilizing assessment of ambulation, respiration, perfusion, and mental status in a stepwise fashion to determine which victims require immediate transport for definitive care. START is easy to apply and designed for mass casualty incidents when time for comprehensive evaluation is nonexistent. </p><p>Paramedic judgment is an important component of triage. One observational study found that assessment by experienced urban paramedics is as accurate in identifying critically ill trauma patients as three commonly used scoring systems [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prehospital-care-of-the-adult-trauma-patient/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. Another observational study concluded that prehospital personnel can use a trauma triage tool to identify major trauma victims accurately [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prehospital-care-of-the-adult-trauma-patient/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>].</p><p>For mass casualty incidents, prehospital triage planning should incorporate an identification system. The Medical Emergency Triage Tags (METTAG&trade;) system is perhaps best known, and is widely used across the United States. The system uses color-coded tags to identify patients and to designate their triage category: black is dead, red is critical, yellow is serious, green is not serious.</p><p>The United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has developed guidelines for mass casualty triage to promote consistent management. The CDC's SALT approach (Sort, Assess, Lifesaving interventions, Treatment and transport) was developed on the basis of available evidence and expert consensus, and incorporates variables from several triage systems (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F81002\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef81002 \">algorithm 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prehospital-care-of-the-adult-trauma-patient/abstract/25,26\" class=\"abstract_t\">25,26</a>].</p><p>Regardless of the triage system adopted, all prehospital personnel must be familiar with the system and must participate in periodic exercises to retain knowledge and skill.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Initial evaluation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Once triage is complete, the sickest viable patients are managed first. The Advanced Trauma Life Support (ATLS) evaluation guidelines put forward by the American College of Surgeons can be usefully applied in the field: primary (focused) assessments are followed by secondary (detailed) assessments. Primary assessment (ie, primary survey) follows the ABCDE pattern: Airway, Breathing, Circulation, Disability (Neurologic status), Exposure.</p><p>The prehospital provider's first task is to secure the patient's airway. If it is not secure, emergent basic airway management is performed. Interventions may include maneuvers to open and maintain the airway. Manual in-line stabilization of the cervical spine should be performed simultaneously. Airway adjuncts, such as oropharyngeal or nasopharyngeal airways, and suctioning, can be used. If breathing is labored or absent, assisted ventilations should be provided using a bag-valve mask device and high-flow oxygen. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=basic-airway-management-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Basic airway management in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Once the airway and breathing are secure, providers must manage any uncontrolled hemorrhage using direct pressure. Once hemorrhage is controlled, neurologic status is assessed. One simple assessment scheme is AVPU: Alert, responds to Voice, responds to Pain, or Unresponsive. Spinal immobilization is continuously maintained.</p><p>Next, prehospital personnel place definitive spinal immobilization (ie, rigid cervical collar and backboard). Various techniques may be used to attach the backboard, including the figure-of-eight, where straps are placed diagonally across the chest and lower extremities, or the transverse, where straps are placed straight across the torso and lower extremities. Two points bear emphasis: the immobilization technique must firmly secure the patient to the board such that they (backboard and patient) can be rolled with minimal if any patient movement. Rolling may be needed to prevent aspiration, should the patient vomit. A clinician must perform manual in-line stabilization of the cervical spine while others secure the patient's body to the backboard. Once the body is secured, prehospital personnel may definitively secure the patient's head to the backboard.</p><p>Patients trapped in a vehicle pose challenging problems for safe extrication. Special care must be taken with patients who have suspected spinal injuries, including those with an altered level of consciousness. For such patients, prehospital personnel can use special devices, such as the Kendrick Extrication Device. These short backboards effectively immobilize the mid-back and cervical region prior to moving the trapped patient. Although use of these devices may prolong scene time, the benefit may outweigh the risk for patients with potentially unstable spinal injuries.</p><p>Prehospital providers obtain vital signs as part of their assessment of patient circulation. Ideally, blood pressure measurements are obtained in each arm. Several observational studies suggest that prehospital hypotension is associated with an increased need for emergent surgery and with increased mortality [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prehospital-care-of-the-adult-trauma-patient/abstract/27-29\" class=\"abstract_t\">27-29</a>]. The presence of prehospital hypotension must be clearly communicated to the emergency department clinicians assuming care of the patient.</p><p>The final primary assessment is an evaluation of the entire patient. Prehospital providers must be compulsive about removing enough clothing to assess critical areas of the body for obvious and occult injuries.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Secondary survey</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>After completion of the initial assessment and stabilizing treatments, the prehospital provider performs a quick but thorough review of the entire body, referred to as the secondary survey. The goal is to discern and manage as appropriate any injuries missed during the primary survey.</p><p>Common pitfalls include not thoroughly inspecting the back, the axillae, the gluteal region, and pannicular folds. Such inspection is particularly important if the clinician suspects penetrating trauma. Providers must also assess for pelvic instability and, if present, attempt to provide stability and control retroperitoneal hemorrhage by applying a pelvic binder. A binder can be a prefabricated device or something as simple as a sheet wrapped tightly around the patient's pelvis and tied in place. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pelvic-trauma-initial-evaluation-and-management\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pelvic trauma: Initial evaluation and management&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Following the secondary survey, the patient should be prepared for transport. Performing full spinal immobilization is prudent; prolonging scene time to initiate intravenous lines, bandage non-hemorrhaging wounds, or splint minor fractures is unnecessary and potentially deleterious.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Airway support</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h3\">Controversies and guidelines</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Airway management techniques are discussed elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=basic-airway-management-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Basic airway management in adults&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=rapid-sequence-intubation-for-adults-outside-the-operating-room\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Rapid sequence intubation for adults outside the operating room&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=direct-laryngoscopy-and-endotracheal-intubation-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Direct laryngoscopy and endotracheal intubation in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p>While basic measures to protect the airway are valuable, definitive airway control with endotracheal intubation (ETI) is often needed for severely injured patients. Whether ETI should be performed in the prehospital setting is controversial. A systematic review found a dearth of rigorous studies addressing ETI in acutely ill and injured patients and concluded that there is &quot;no imperative&quot; to the performance of prehospital intubation in urban trauma patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prehospital-care-of-the-adult-trauma-patient/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>].</p><p>Some researchers claim prehospital ETI improves outcomes. In one retrospective case-control study performed in a large urban emergency medical services (EMS) system, researchers found that field intubation was associated with a decrease in mortality among 671 patients with severe head injury [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prehospital-care-of-the-adult-trauma-patient/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]. In this study researchers stratified patients by their Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS), but did not adjust for their Injury Severity Score, or comparable measures. A small number of studies have found a similar association between field ETI and improved survival [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prehospital-care-of-the-adult-trauma-patient/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>].</p><p>However, many researchers have found increased morbidity and mortality among patients intubated in the field and question the benefit of this practice [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prehospital-care-of-the-adult-trauma-patient/abstract/17,33-43\" class=\"abstract_t\">17,33-43</a>]. They attribute worse outcomes to delays in transport, improperly placed endotracheal tubes, improper ventilation, aspiration, and other complications. One retrospective review of 496 patients who received airway support from paramedics working in a major urban EMS system found that patients assisted with bag mask ventilation (BMV) were more likely to survive than those treated with ETI [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prehospital-care-of-the-adult-trauma-patient/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>]. After controlling for injury severity, these researchers found the survival rate of patients receiving ventilation by BMV to be 5.3 times higher than patients managed with ETI (95 percent CI 2.3-14.2). Others have found similar results [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prehospital-care-of-the-adult-trauma-patient/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>].</p><p>Whether drug-assisted intubation (DAI) or rapid sequence intubation (RSI) should be performed in the prehospital environment also remains controversial. RSI is commonly performed by air medical programs and is used successfully by some ground EMS systems [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prehospital-care-of-the-adult-trauma-patient/abstract/31,44-48\" class=\"abstract_t\">31,44-48</a>]. Nevertheless, several studies have noted many of the same complications observed with standard ETI in patients receiving RSI [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prehospital-care-of-the-adult-trauma-patient/abstract/37,49-51\" class=\"abstract_t\">37,49-51</a>]. As an example, one prospective study of prehospital RSI in patients with severe head injury, performed in a major urban EMS system, compared 209 patients treated with RSI to 627 matched controls [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prehospital-care-of-the-adult-trauma-patient/abstract/49\" class=\"abstract_t\">49</a>]. The authors found a significant increase in mortality and morbidity among patients managed with RSI. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=rapid-sequence-intubation-for-adults-outside-the-operating-room\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Rapid sequence intubation for adults outside the operating room&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Controversy about whether to perform prehospital RSI, particularly where transport times are brief, will likely persist until large prospective randomized controlled trials are conducted to determine how the technique affects patient outcomes. Until then, EMS programs incorporating RSI into their management protocols should strive to ensure their paramedics perform the procedure properly. Effective training and regular retraining, close monitoring, and regular performance of the procedure by a core group of paramedics can help accomplish this [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prehospital-care-of-the-adult-trauma-patient/abstract/52\" class=\"abstract_t\">52</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H12\" class=\"local\">'Airway training for EMS providers'</a> below.)</p><p>EMS systems that permit prehospital ETI, especially those incorporating RSI, must include protocols with procedures for confirmation of proper tube placement in the airway. Paramedics often confirm placement by auscultating bilateral breath sounds and noting absent gastric sounds, but this approach is often inaccurate and difficult to perform in the austere prehospital environment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prehospital-care-of-the-adult-trauma-patient/abstract/53\" class=\"abstract_t\">53</a>]. End-tidal CO2 (either qualitative by color change or quantitative measurement using numerical values or waveforms from in-line or side-stream devices) provides a more accurate assessment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prehospital-care-of-the-adult-trauma-patient/abstract/54,55\" class=\"abstract_t\">54,55</a>]. Pulse oximetry is also important. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=carbon-dioxide-monitoring-capnography\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Carbon dioxide monitoring (capnography)&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Prehospital ETI protocols must include a rescue device for failed airway management. Examples include the Combitube&trade; and the Laryngeal Mask Airway (LMA&trade;). Paramedics must maintain skill in employing the selected rescue device and should not hesitate to implement it should they encounter a difficult airway or fail at three attempts to place an endotracheal tube. The dangers of delayed transport and prolonged hypoxia argue against prolonged prehospital attempts at ETI.</p><p>Providing appropriate respiratory rates and tidal volumes is crucial for all trauma patients. Hyperventilation can result in hyperinflated lungs, which decreases preload and compromises cardiac output [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prehospital-care-of-the-adult-trauma-patient/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. Hyperventilation can also cause or exacerbate elevated airway pressures, predisposing to pneumothorax. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=basic-airway-management-in-adults#H17\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Basic airway management in adults&quot;, section on 'Ventilation volumes, rates, and cadence'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h3\">Head injury</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients with blunt head injury pose special problems, and debate continues concerning whether these patients should be intubated outside the hospital [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prehospital-care-of-the-adult-trauma-patient/abstract/31,35-37,49\" class=\"abstract_t\">31,35-37,49</a>]. Most important in the prehospital setting is to protect the airway and control the ventilation of head-injured patients in the least invasive manner, thereby minimizing elevations in intracranial pressure. If transport time is brief, often bag-mask ventilation (BMV) alone is sufficient. Successful BMV is critical: it provides immediate oxygenation and ensures that ventilation can be maintained should attempts at more invasive airway management fail. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=basic-airway-management-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Basic airway management in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Should prehospital providers encounter a head-injured patient with a clenched jaw or other airway-compromising conditions, the first step is to perform manual maneuvers (eg, jaw thrust) to open the airway and then provide adequate BMV. Nasal or oropharyngeal airways can help maintain airway patency. Care must be taken to maintain cervical immobilization.</p><p>In EMS systems with protocols for prehospital intubation, paramedics may determine that endotracheal intubation is needed. Intubation should be performed with speed and finesse in the head-injured patient in order to minimize airway manipulation, which can elevate intracranial pressure and exacerbate the underlying head injury.</p><p>In addition to airway protection, head-injured patients are intubated in order to control their ventilation rates and maintain their end-tidal CO2 levels between 33 and 35 mmHg. Doing so prevents elevations in intracranial pressure (ICP), thereby helping to maintain adequate cerebral perfusion pressure. Previously, hyperventilation was thought necessary to lower ICP, but this is not so. Ventilation rates typically less than 15 breaths per minute are sufficient [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prehospital-care-of-the-adult-trauma-patient/abstract/56\" class=\"abstract_t\">56</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h3\">Moving intubated patients</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The intubated patient should be moved carefully with special attention paid to preventing displacement of the endotracheal tube (ETT) and intravenous lines.

Many endotracheal tubes have been removed or displaced into the esophagus from failure to coordinate patient transport appropriately [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prehospital-care-of-the-adult-trauma-patient/abstract/57\" class=\"abstract_t\">57</a>].

As an example, gross hemorrhage may not be apparent with gunshot wounds to the thigh. In such circumstances, direct manual pressure must be applied throughout the prehospital phase of care to ensure that occult, internal bleeding is controlled as well as possible. In uncommon instances (eg, injury from an explosion, traumatic near or complete limb amputation), application of a tourniquet may be necessary to control life-threatening bleeding from a severe extremity wound.

Maintaining such an ideal blood pressure, even if it were known, would be extremely difficult in the prehospital setting. In addition, much may depend upon the clinical scenario. As examples, larger IV fluid volumes may be needed to raise the blood pressure and ensure adequate cerebral perfusion in a head-injured patient, while such volumes may be harmful in a young healthy patient with an isolated stab wound of the abdomen. Pending further research, we believe it is reasonable to withhold IV fluid during brief prehospital transport in patients with isolated penetrating torso injuries whose systolic blood pressure is &ge;90 mmHg [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prehospital-care-of-the-adult-trauma-patient/abstract/63\" class=\"abstract_t\">63</a>].</p><p>Hypertonic crystalloid has been used for the resuscitation of trauma patients, primarily in combat settings, because it is easy to store (does not require refrigeration and has a long shelf life) and entails smaller fluid loads.

Examples of such fluids include 3 percent hypertonic saline, 5 percent hypertonic saline, and the combination of hypertonic saline and 6 percent dextran-70. While hypertonic saline may be useful in the military environment where austere conditions often prevail, evidence supporting this approach in the civilian environment is lacking. The Resuscitation Outcomes Consortium (ROC) trial, which compared hypertonic saline, hypertonic saline-dextran, and isotonic saline for prehospital treatment of patients with traumatic brain injury, was stopped early using prespecified criteria because treatment with hypertonic saline failed to improve neurologic outcome or survival [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prehospital-care-of-the-adult-trauma-patient/abstract/68\" class=\"abstract_t\">68</a>].

Factors associated with fatal crashes of medical transport helicopters include flying at night and during bad weather, and post-crash fires [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prehospital-care-of-the-adult-trauma-patient/abstract/108\" class=\"abstract_t\">108</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H23\"><span class=\"h2\">Burn management</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Prehospital treatment of burn patients begins with stabilization of the airway, breathing, and circulation. Patients with signs of active or impending airway compromise should be treated with immediate endotracheal intubation. Allowing airway swelling from inhalational injury to progress without intervention can create extraordinarily difficult airway management situations, leading to increased morbidity and possibly death. Treatment of major burns is discussed in detail elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=emergency-care-of-moderate-and-severe-thermal-burns-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Emergency care of moderate and severe thermal burns in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Common signs of significant smoke inhalation injury and the potential need for intubation include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Persistent cough, stridor or wheezing</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Hoarseness</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Deep facial or circumferential neck burns</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Nares with inflammation or singed hair</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Carbonaceous sputum or burnt matter in mouth or nose</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Blistering or edema of the oropharynx</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Depressed mental status, including evidence of drug or alcohol use</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Respiratory distress</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Hypoxia or hypercapnia</p><p/><p>Providers should determine the severity (eg, full-thickness versus partial-thickness) and extent (ie, percent body surface area) of the burn. These calculations are used to determine the amount of intravenous (IV) fluid resuscitation required. Aggressive fluid resuscitation should begin immediately for any patient with burn shock or major burns.</p><p>According to the Parkland (or Baxter) formula, the fluid requirement during the initial 24 hours of treatment is 4 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/kg</span> of body weight for each percent of TBSA burned, given IV. Superficial burns are excluded from this calculation. One-half of the calculated fluid need is given in the first eight hours. IV fluid boluses to maintain blood pressure are given in addition to the calculated fluid requirements based on burn size.</p><p>Other treatments to consider, if time is available, include wound cooling and dressing. While rapid cooling is desirable and must be performed within 30 minutes to be effective, it may result in hypothermia if performed over an extensive surface area. Isolated extremity burns may be cooled immediately; more extensive burns should be covered with dry, clean sheets or other appropriate dressings. The ambulance should be heated to help prevent hypothermia. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-minor-thermal-burns\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of minor thermal burns&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Patients with significant burns should be transported directly to facilities capable of providing comprehensive burn care. If no such facility exists locally, the patient is brought to the closest hospital able to provide initial stabilization and arrange secondary transport to a designated referral burn center. According to the American Burn Association, significant burns include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Burns covering over 20 percent of total body surface area in adults, or over 10 percent in young children or the elderly</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Full-thickness burns covering over 5 percent of total body surface area</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Burns involving the face, eyes, ears, hands, feet, or perineum</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Burns crossing major joints or circumferential extremity burns</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>High voltage electrical burns</p><p/><p>Patients with burns from suspected abuse or burns associated with major trauma, and patients with comorbidities increasing the risk of infection (eg, diabetes mellitus), should be hospitalized.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H25\"><span class=\"h2\">Prehospital determination of death</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Prehospital providers may withhold life support in certain situations. As an example, providers need not provide care to patients with injuries that are incompatible with life (eg, burned beyond recognition, decapitated, blunt trauma to the abdomen <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> chest without vital signs), or those with obvious signs of death (eg, postmortem lividity, rigor mortis, or gross decomposition). Caution should be exercised when developing protocols paramedics can use to withhold care. Some states may have regulations that limit the prehospital provider's ability to make such determinations.</p><p>After resuscitation has been initiated, there may be circumstances when it is reasonable for prehospital providers to cease their efforts and pronounce the patient dead. Clinical circumstances (eg, blunt versus penetrating trauma) play a role in such decisions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prehospital-care-of-the-adult-trauma-patient/abstract/109,110\" class=\"abstract_t\">109,110</a>].</p><p>In all cases where prehospital providers pronounce death after stopping resuscitative efforts, they should perform and record the following:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Complete set of vital signs</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Cardiac monitor rhythm strip from multiple leads, including printed copies</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H26\"><span class=\"h1\">SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Three critical tasks must be rapidly performed by prehospital providers caring for trauma victims (see <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Overview'</a> above):</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>For the individual victim: examination with recognition of severe injuries and injuries with potential to cause rapid decompensation</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>For multiple victims: triage with initiation of life-saving treatment (see <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Triage'</a> above)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Stabilization and transport to a hospital capable of addressing the identified injuries. Prehospital providers must do all they can to minimize the amount of time spent on scene. (See <a href=\"#H17\" class=\"local\">'Transport'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Assessment and stabilization of the trauma victim follow the ABCDE pattern: Airway, Breathing, Circulation, Disability (Neurologic status), Exposure. The prehospital provider's first task is to secure the patient's airway. If it is not secure, emergent basic airway management is performed. Once the airway and breathing are secure, providers manage any uncontrolled hemorrhage using direct pressure. The cervical spine is immobilized to prevent injury. Proper spinal immobilization includes placement of a hard cervical collar, barriers to lateral head movement (eg, foam pads, rolled towels), and a long backboard. Vital signs are obtained. (See <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'Initial evaluation'</a> above and <a href=\"#H15\" class=\"local\">'Spinal immobilization'</a> above and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=basic-airway-management-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Basic airway management in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>After completion of the initial assessment and stabilizing treatments, the prehospital provider performs a quick but thorough review of the entire body to discern and manage any injuries missed during the primary survey. Common pitfalls include not thoroughly inspecting the back, the axillae, the gluteal region, and pannicular folds. (See <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'Secondary survey'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Prehospital endotracheal intubation (ETI) is controversial. EMS systems that permit prehospital ETI, especially those incorporating rapid sequence intubation (RSI), must include protocols and equipment (eg, End-tidal CO2 monitor) for confirmation of proper tracheal tube placement, and a rescue device for failed airway management. Paramedics must maintain skill in employing the selected rescue device and should use it if they encounter a difficult airway or fail at three attempts to place a tracheal tube. The dangers of delayed transport and prolonged hypoxia argue against prolonged prehospital attempts at ETI. (See <a href=\"#H8\" class=\"local\">'Airway support'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Providing appropriate respiratory rates and tidal volumes is crucial for all trauma patients. Hyperventilation can result in hyperinflated lungs, which decreases preload and compromises cardiac output. (See <a href=\"#H8\" class=\"local\">'Airway support'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Basic measures for controlling hemorrhage consist of direct pressure followed by pressure dressings, with elevation and pressure points used as adjuncts. (See <a href=\"#H13\" class=\"local\">'Hemorrhage control'</a> above and <a href=\"#H14\" class=\"local\">'Intravenous (IV) fluids'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Unstable pelvic injuries, such as &quot;open-book&quot; fractures involving disruption of the sacroiliac joints, are associated with retroperitoneal hemorrhage. Prehospital treatment for this injury consists of &quot;closing&quot; the fracture by securing a pelvic binder or sheet tightly around the pelvis. (See <a href=\"#H13\" class=\"local\">'Hemorrhage control'</a> above and <a href=\"#H14\" class=\"local\">'Intravenous (IV) fluids'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Burn patients with signs of airway compromise or impending compromise should be treated with immediate tracheal intubation, if the prehospital provider is skilled in the procedure. Signs of airway compromise are described in the text. Severe burn victims require aggressive fluid resuscitation. (See <a href=\"#H23\" class=\"local\">'Burn management'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Prehospital providers often fail to provide adequate analgesia. Judicious use of short-acting opioids (eg, IV <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fentanyl-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">fentanyl</a> up to 100 or 150 mcg, or IV <a href=\"topic.htm?path=morphine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">morphine</a> up to 10 or 15 mg) for patients in obvious pain is generally safe and effective, and will not mask significant injuries or alter outcome. Paramedics may treat patients with severe pain and hemodynamic instability with 25 mcg doses of IV fentanyl (or 2 mg doses of IV morphine) approximately every 10 minutes, while being prepared to give an IV fluid bolus. Paramedics should carefully monitor the respiratory and hemodynamic status of any patient receiving opioids.
