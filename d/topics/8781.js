IP is caused by loss-of-function mutations in the <em><span class=\"nowrap\">IKBKG/NEMO</em></span> (inhibitor of kappa polypeptide gene enhancer in B-cells, kinase <span class=\"nowrap\">gamma/nuclear</span> factor-kappa B essential modulator) gene, encoding the nuclear factor-kappa-B essential modulator, a regulatory protein that activates genes involved in cell survival, inflammation, and immunity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/incontinentia-pigmenti/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. </p><p>The disorder is seen almost uniformly in females, although it may occasionally occur in males with somatic mosaicism or XXY karyotype [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/incontinentia-pigmenti/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. In females, IP typically presents with a staged, linear cutaneous eruption and anomalies of teeth, hair, and nails. Approximately one-third of patients have ocular and neurologic abnormalities. Because of the involvement of skin, hair, nails, and teeth, IP can be considered a form of ectodermal dysplasia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/incontinentia-pigmenti/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1471478818\"><span class=\"h1\">EPIDEMIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>IP occurs in approximately 1:40,000 to 1:50,000 births [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/incontinentia-pigmenti/abstract/1,3\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,3</a>]. Virtually all cases are seen in females because affected males usually do not survive until birth. Males born with the condition have either somatic mosaicism or a XXY karyotype (Klinefelter syndrome) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/incontinentia-pigmenti/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3066664093\"><span class=\"h1\">PATHOGENESIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In the majority of cases, IP is due to mutations in the <em><span class=\"nowrap\">IKBKG/NEMO</em></span> (inhibitor of kappa polypeptide gene enhancer in B-cells, kinase <span class=\"nowrap\">gamma/nuclear</span> factor-kappa B essential modulator) gene, located at Xq28 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/incontinentia-pigmenti/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. These mutations occur &quot;de novo&quot; in approximately 65 percent of the IP cases. <em><span class=\"nowrap\">IKBKG/NEMO</em></span> encodes the <span class=\"nowrap\">NEMO/I-kappa-B</span> kinase (IKK)-gamma protein, a regulatory subunit of the inhibitor of the IKK complex, which activates NF-kappa B, leading to the activation of genes involved in cell survival, inflammation, and immunity. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=combined-immunodeficiencies#H18\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Combined immunodeficiencies&quot;, section on 'Defects of NF-kappa-B regulation'</a>.)</p><p>Approximately 90 percent of the <em><span class=\"nowrap\">IKBKG/NEMO</em></span> mutations in IP are recurrent or nonrecurrent deletions of exons 4 to 10 resulting in complete loss of <span class=\"nowrap\">NEMO/IKK-gamma</span> function [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/incontinentia-pigmenti/abstract/7-9\" class=\"abstract_t\">7-9</a>]. Microdeletions, missense, frameshift, nonsense, and splice-site mutations leading to complete or partial loss of <span class=\"nowrap\">NEMO/IKK-gamma</span> activity account for the remaining cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/incontinentia-pigmenti/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. Milder (hypomorphic) <em><span class=\"nowrap\">IKBKG/NEMO</em></span> mutations that impair but do not abolish NF-kappa B signaling result in males with a rare form of X-linked hypohidrotic ectodermal dysplasia associated with immunodeficiency [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/incontinentia-pigmenti/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. </p><p>Cells lacking NEMO are targets for tumor necrosis factor-induced apoptosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/incontinentia-pigmenti/abstract/11,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,12</a>]. Moreover, NEMO deficiency affects several signaling pathways associated with bone and vascular function and anatomy, as well as immune function [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/incontinentia-pigmenti/abstract/1,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,9</a>]. </p><p>It has been suggested that both ophthalmologic and neurologic abnormalities in IP may result from a developmental cerebral small-vessel disease induced by the inactivation of <em>NEMO</em> and possibly by the disruption of the transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta&ndash;activated kinase (TAK1) upstream of <em>NEMO</em> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/incontinentia-pigmenti/abstract/13-15\" class=\"abstract_t\">13-15</a>]. </p><p>The heterogeneity in the clinical presentation of IP and the apparent lack of genotype-phenotype correlation may be due to the random inactivation of the X chromosome (lyonization), which occurs early during embryogenesis and varies depending on tissues. The X-inactivation is extremely skewed in IP, favoring the elimination of the mutated <em>NEMO</em> allele in nearly 90 percent of cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/incontinentia-pigmenti/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1839186005\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL FEATURES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Due to the X-linked dominant nature of IP, virtually all patients are female. Although the condition is usually lethal for males prenatally, a few cases have been reported in males, due to somatic mosaicism or chromosomal aneuploidy XXY (Klinefelter syndrome) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/incontinentia-pigmenti/abstract/5,16,17\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,16,17</a>]. The clinical features of IP are variable, and there is no clear genotype-phenotype correlation. However, in nearly all patients, the characteristic cutaneous lesions are the first manifestation of IP.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H149959013\"><span class=\"h2\">Cutaneous findings</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In the classic presentation, the cutaneous lesions of IP present in a female infant at birth or in the first few months of life and evolve through four characteristic stages:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Stage 1 (vesicular)</strong> &ndash; Patterned tense vesicles <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> pustules, usually overlying an erythematous base, are in most cases noted at birth or shortly after on the trunk and extremities (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F111088%7EDERM%2F58769\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef111088 graphicRef58769 \">picture 1A-B</a>). These lesions seem to develop along the Blaschko lines (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F57219\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef57219 \">figure 1</a>), which represent the embryologic pathways of migration of cutaneous and appendageal cells, and persist for months [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/incontinentia-pigmenti/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. At this stage, the affected infant will often show eosinophilia on routine complete blood counts. This finding might be due to overexpression of eotaxin, a chemotactic factor for eosinophils, which may occur in the setting of <em>IKBKG</em> (inhibitor of kappa polypeptide gene enhancer in B-cells, kinase gamma) mutations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/incontinentia-pigmenti/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Stage 2 (verrucous)</strong> &ndash; Following the initial skin eruption, lesions become more papular or crusted (&quot;wart-like&quot;) and maintain their localization along the Blaschko lines (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F89806%7EDERM%2F53297\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef89806 graphicRef53297 \">picture 2A-B</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/incontinentia-pigmenti/abstract/3,19\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,19</a>]. This stage may not occur in all patients. &#160;</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Stage 3 (hyperpigmented)</strong> &ndash; By 6 to 12 months of age, infants show brown or grey-brown linear <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> swirling macules (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F111089%7EDERM%2F63009%7EDERM%2F89807\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef111089 graphicRef63009 graphicRef89807 \">picture 3A-C</a>). Stage 3 typically lasts through early adolescence or can persist into adulthood. In some cases, they will resolve completely or will be followed by a so-called fourth stage.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Stage 4 <span class=\"nowrap\">(atrophic/hypopigmented)</strong></span> &ndash; This stage is marked by hypopigmented and slightly atrophic linear <span class=\"nowrap\">macules/patches</span>. In most patients, stage 4 does not occur. &#160;</p><p/><p>The onset, duration, and degree of overlapping of these stages vary among patients; stage 1 lesions can recur during a febrile illness [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/incontinentia-pigmenti/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. </p><p>The mother of a child with IP may be asymptomatic or show subtle manifestations of the disease. These include hypopigmented, atrophic streaks along the Blaschko lines, nail dystrophy, or dental abnormalities. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3194089108\"><span class=\"h2\">Extracutaneous findings</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Delayed dentition, pegged or conical teeth, as well as anodontia or hypodontia resembling hypohidrotic ectodermal dysplasia are seen in most patients with IP. In addition, it is now recognized that other oral manifestations, such cleft or high-arched palate and decreased salivary secretion, can occur in patients with IP [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/incontinentia-pigmenti/abstract/8,21,22\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,21,22</a>]. </p><p>Scalp and body hair abnormalities are seen in over 50 percent of patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/incontinentia-pigmenti/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. These include cicatricial alopecia, sparse hair, woolly hair, and anomalies of eyebrows and eyelashes.</p><p>Nail dystrophy may develop in approximately 10 percent of patients, usually during adolescence or early adulthood [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/incontinentia-pigmenti/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. In some patients, osteolytic lesions of the underlying bone have been noted. Painful subungual dyskeratotic tumors are rarely associated with IP and are usually seen in adult patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/incontinentia-pigmenti/abstract/24-26\" class=\"abstract_t\">24-26</a>]. These tumors are frequently misdiagnosed as squamous cell carcinomas or keratoacanthomas.</p><p>Central nervous system (CNS) abnormalities occur in approximately 30 percent of IP patients and can be demonstrated by neuroimaging studies, including magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/incontinentia-pigmenti/abstract/13,27,28\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,27,28</a>]. In one report of eight infants with IP, abnormal MRI findings included patchy signal changes in the cortical gray matter and subcortical and periventricular white matter on T1- and T2-weighted sequences, which match areas with restricted diffusion on DWI, suggesting local inflammation and ischemia as well as hemorrhagic lesions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/incontinentia-pigmenti/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. </p><p>Neurologic symptoms, which include lethargy, poor feeding, seizures, and developmental delay, are often severe and noted early in life [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/incontinentia-pigmenti/abstract/8,11,29\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,11,29</a>]. CNS abnormalities are in many cases associated with ocular anomalies, including proliferative retinopathy, peripheral avascularity, and macular occlusive disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/incontinentia-pigmenti/abstract/1,30\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,30</a>].</p><p>While reports suggesting immune defects in IP patients do exist, this association is well-known in patients with the ectodermal <span class=\"nowrap\">dysplasia/immunodeficiency</span> phenotype rather than in the more typical IP patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/incontinentia-pigmenti/abstract/31,32\" class=\"abstract_t\">31,32</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H540012219\"><span class=\"h1\">PATHOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A skin biopsy may be especially helpful in the diagnosis of IP when obtained during stage 1 (vesicular). Characteristic histopathologic findings include eosinophilic spongiosis, intraepidermal vesicles containing eosinophils, and apoptotic keratinocytes in the epidermis. The pathologic changes seen in later stages are less specific, although they may show features that support the clinical diagnosis (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F109835\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef109835 \">table 1</a>). A marked melanin incontinence with numerous melanophages in the dermis is noted in stage 3 (hyperpigmented) lesions.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2731565813\"><span class=\"h1\">DIAGNOSIS</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2064139992\"><span class=\"h2\">Clinical suspicion</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>IP should be suspected in a female infant presenting with characteristic vesicular or hyperpigmented lesions occurring along the Blaschko lines (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F111088%7EDERM%2F58769\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef111088 graphicRef58769 \">picture 1A-B</a>). At later stages, although the skin features may be less obvious clinically, the presence of teeth, hair, eye, or central nervous system abnormalities should alert the clinician to the possibility of IP. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2311898494\"><span class=\"h2\">Diagnostic criteria</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Diagnostic criteria for IP were initially established in 1993 and were revised in 2014 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/incontinentia-pigmenti/abstract/2,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,8</a>]. Major clinical criteria are the typical stages of the skin eruption distributed along the Blaschko lines; minor criteria include dental anomalies, central nervous system abnormalities, alopecia or abnormal hair, nail dystrophy, palate anomalies, history of multiple male miscarriages in the mother, and typical histopathologic findings in a skin biopsy (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F109835\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef109835 \">table 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/incontinentia-pigmenti/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H540012219\" class=\"local\">'Pathology'</a> above.) </p><p>The diagnosis of IP is established by demonstrating <em><span class=\"nowrap\">IKBKG/NEMO</em></span> (inhibitor of kappa polypeptide gene enhancer in B-cells, kinase <span class=\"nowrap\">gamma/nuclear</span> factor-kappa B essential modulator)<em> </em>mutation typical for IP on genetic testing. If genetic testing is not available, at least two or more major criteria or one major and one or more minor criteria are required to establish the diagnosis. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3625481855\"><span class=\"h2\">Genetic testing</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In all cases with clinical and histopathologic findings suggesting IP, a targeted mutational analysis of deoxyribonucleic acid extracted from peripheral blood should be performed to identify the common deletion in <em><span class=\"nowrap\">IKBKG/NEMO</em></span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/incontinentia-pigmenti/abstract/33,34\" class=\"abstract_t\">33,34</a>]. Sequence analysis may be needed in those cases (approximately 10 to 15 percent) in which the common deletion is not identified. </p><p>In suspected male cases, molecular genetic testing of lesional skin should be performed to detect somatic mosaicism, if no pathogenic variant is identified by molecular testing of a blood sample. Karyotyping should be considered as well, due to the possibility of IP in the setting of chromosome aneuploidy XXY (Klinefelter syndrome) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/incontinentia-pigmenti/abstract/35,36\" class=\"abstract_t\">35,36</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2458913218\"><span class=\"h1\">DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The skin conditions that should be included in the differential diagnosis of IP depend on the stage of the IP eruption.

If the lesions are oriented along the Blaschko lines, HSV becomes less likely. Scrapings of vesicular contents for Tzanck smear, direct fluorescent antibody staining, or culture should be obtained for the diagnosis of possible HSV. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=neonatal-herpes-simplex-virus-infection-clinical-features-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Neonatal herpes simplex virus infection: Clinical features and diagnosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Staphylococcal infection</strong> &ndash; Staphylococcal skin infection should be considered in any infant presenting pustular lesions. A Gram stain and culture of pustule content should be performed to rule out <em>Staphylococcus aureus</em> infection. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=impetigo\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Impetigo&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Epidermal nevus</strong> &ndash; The second or &quot;warty&quot; stage of IP can be confused with epidermal nevus. A skin biopsy may be useful in this instance to assist with diagnosis.

Topical corticosteroids have been used successfully for severely inflamed areas [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/incontinentia-pigmenti/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>]. Patients with signs of secondary skin infection require treatment with local or systemic antimicrobial therapy. Stage 2 lesions may require emollients or topical retinoids if significant and impacting movement of digits or extremities. No treatment is generally needed for stage 3 or 4 skin lesions.</p><p>Dental consultation and management is indicated in all patients with IP at the time of teeth eruption. Orthodontic care may be needed in mild cases. Severe cases with anodontia or hypodontia require coordinated care by dentists and oral surgeons. </p><p>Ophthalmologic consultation and surveillance should be performed for all suspected and confirmed cases of IP. Laser treatment of retinal neovascularization may be indicated to prevent retinal detachment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/incontinentia-pigmenti/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>].

IP is caused by mutations in the <em><span class=\"nowrap\">IKBKG/NEMO</span> </em>(inhibitor of kappa polypeptide gene enhancer in B-cells, kinase <span class=\"nowrap\">gamma/nuclear</span> factor-kappa B essential modulator) gene, encoding a regulatory protein involved in the activation of genes involved in cell survival, inflammation, and immunity. (See <a href=\"#H613025497\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above and <a href=\"#H3066664093\" class=\"local\">'Pathogenesis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Due to the X-linked dominant nature of IP, virtually all patients are female. In the classic presentation, the cutaneous lesions of IP are first noted during the neonatal period and evolve through four stages of variable duration: vesicular (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F111088%7EDERM%2F58769\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef111088 graphicRef58769 \">picture 1A-B</a>), verrucous (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F89806%7EDERM%2F53297\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef89806 graphicRef53297 \">picture 2A-B</a>), hyperpigmented (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F111089%7EDERM%2F63009%7EDERM%2F89807\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef111089 graphicRef63009 graphicRef89807 \">picture 3A-C</a>), and <span class=\"nowrap\">atrophic/hypopigmented</span>. Lesions are typically distributed along the lines of Blaschko on the trunk and extremities. Common extracutaneous findings include dental, hair, and nail anomalies. Ocular and neurologic abnormalities occur in approximately one-third of the cases. (See <a href=\"#H1839186005\" class=\"local\">'Clinical features'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The clinical diagnosis of IP is based upon the presence in a female patient of the typical stages of the skin eruption distributed along the Blaschko lines. Minor diagnostic criteria include dental, hair, ocular, and neurologic abnormalities and typical histopathologic findings in a skin biopsy (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F109835\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef109835 \">table 1</a>). The diagnosis is confirmed by molecular genetic testing demonstrating a loss-of-function mutation in the <em><span class=\"nowrap\">IKBKG/NEMO</span> </em>gene. (See <a href=\"#H2731565813\" class=\"local\">'Diagnosis'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The management of IP depends upon the significance of the cutaneous and extracutaneous involvement. The vesicular lesions of the early stage usually require only gentle wound care with mild detergents and emollients. Topical corticosteroids may be helpful for severely inflamed areas. Dental, ophthalmologic, and neurologic consultation are indicated for all patients with IP. (See <a href=\"#H978961331\" class=\"local\">'Management'</a> above.) </p></div><div id=\"topicAgreement\">Use of UpToDate is subject to the <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/legal/license\" class=\"licenseLink\" id=\"sla_in_page\">Subscription and License Agreement</a>.</div><div id=\"references\" class=\"headingAnchor\"><h1>REFERENCES</h1><ol id=\"reference\"><li><a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/incontinentia-pigmenti/abstract/1\" class=\"nounderline abstract_t\">Swinney CC, Han DP, Karth PA.
