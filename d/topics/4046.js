Incidence increases with age and appears to be increasing overall in the United States [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-pathologic-features-and-diagnosis-of-mantle-cell-lymphoma/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. Approximately three-quarters of patients are male and Caucasians are affected almost twice as frequently as Blacks. Median age at diagnosis is 68 years.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">PATHOGENESIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Mantle cell lymphoma (MCL) is thought to have two distinct cellular origins, each giving rise to different forms of the disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-pathologic-features-and-diagnosis-of-mantle-cell-lymphoma/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]: </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Classical MCL is believed to arise from na&iuml;ve B cells that express SOX11, and typically involves lymph nodes and extranodal sites such as the gastrointestinal tract. Acquisition of additional genetic abnormalities can lead to progression to more aggressive forms of MCL with blastoid or pleomorphic morphologies. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The other type of MCL develops from antigen-experienced SOX11-negative B cells. For unclear reasons, this variant often spares lymph nodes and mainly involves the peripheral blood, bone marrow, and often spleen. These &quot;leukemic&quot; variants are often clinically indolent, but may acquire secondary abnormalities, particular <em>TP53</em> mutations, that lead to a very aggressive course.</p><p/><p>Both types of MCL are highly associated with a (11;14) translocation that dysregulates the cyclin D1 gene (<em>CCND1</em>). This cell is distinct from both the recirculating B cell of <span class=\"nowrap\">B-CLL/SLL</span> and the later centrocyte of follicular lymphoma.</p><p>Additional details regarding the pathobiology of mantle cell lymphoma are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pathobiology-of-mantle-cell-lymphoma\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pathobiology of mantle cell lymphoma&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL FEATURES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Most patients with mantle cell lymphoma (MCL) have advanced stage disease at diagnosis (70 percent). While approximately 75 percent of patients initially present with lymphadenopathy, extranodal disease is the primary presentation in the remaining 25 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-pathologic-features-and-diagnosis-of-mantle-cell-lymphoma/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. Common sites of involvement include the lymph nodes, spleen (45 to 60 percent), Waldeyer's ring, bone marrow (&gt;60 percent), blood (13 to 77 percent), and extranodal sites, such as the gastrointestinal tract, breast, pleura, and orbit [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-pathologic-features-and-diagnosis-of-mantle-cell-lymphoma/abstract/15-17\" class=\"abstract_t\">15-17</a>].</p><p>Up to one-third of patients have systemic B symptoms, such as fever, night sweats, and unintentional weight loss, at presentation (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F64113\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef64113 \">table 1</a>). The definition of systemic B symptoms is presented in more detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-presentation-and-diagnosis-of-non-hodgkin-lymphoma\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical presentation and diagnosis of non-Hodgkin lymphoma&quot;</a>.)</p><p>MCL can involve any region of the gastrointestinal tract, occasionally presenting as lymphomatous intestinal polyposis (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F64338\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef64338 \">picture 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-pathologic-features-and-diagnosis-of-mantle-cell-lymphoma/abstract/18,19\" class=\"abstract_t\">18,19</a>]. A prospective clinicopathologic study of 31 cases of gastrointestinal tract involvement found the following sites to be involved: stomach (57 percent), duodenum (52 percent), <span class=\"nowrap\">jejunum/ileum</span> (87 percent), colon (90 percent), and rectum (69 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-pathologic-features-and-diagnosis-of-mantle-cell-lymphoma/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. Lymphomatous submucosal nodules producing polypoid lesions were found in both the small bowel and colon in 28 of 31 cases. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epidemiology-clinical-features-and-types-of-small-bowel-neoplasms#H19\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Epidemiology, clinical features, and types of small bowel neoplasms&quot;, section on 'Primary gastrointestinal tract lymphoma'</a>.)</p><p>SOX11-negative forms of MCL often spare lymph nodes and instead have leukemic presentations. Splenomegaly in the absence of lymphadenopathy is common in such variants [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-pathologic-features-and-diagnosis-of-mantle-cell-lymphoma/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. Central nervous system involvement is rare overall (&lt;5 percent of cases), but is more common in patients with the leukemic variant [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-pathologic-features-and-diagnosis-of-mantle-cell-lymphoma/abstract/22-24\" class=\"abstract_t\">22-24</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h1\">MORPHOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The histologic pattern of mantle cell lymphoma (MCL) growth in lymph nodes may be diffuse, nodular, or mantle zone, or a combination of the three. Most cases are composed exclusively of small to medium-sized lymphoid cells, with slightly irregular or &quot;notched&quot; nuclei and inconspicuous nucleoli (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F86530\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef86530 \">picture 2</a>). However, the morphology can range from small, more irregular lymphocytes (mimicking the centrocytes or small cleaved cells of follicular lymphoma) to lymphoblast-like cells (in the blastoid variant, raising the question of lymphoblastic lymphoma), and even occasionally to mixtures of small and large cells or markedly atypical large cells (in the pleomorphic variant) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F86531\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef86531 \">picture 3</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F86533\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef86533 \">picture 4</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F86532\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef86532 \">picture 5</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-pathologic-features-and-diagnosis-of-mantle-cell-lymphoma/abstract/8,25-28\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,25-28</a>]. Despite the small size and bland appearance of the cells in most cases, there is often more mitotic activity than in other histologically low grade lymphomas. When malignant effusions are present, the cytologic features of the tumor cells from the effusion are similar to those seen with peripheral blood involvement. Single epithelioid histiocytes are often interspersed among the tumor cells in tissues, but clusters of histiocytes and granulomas are not seen. Transformed cells with basophilic cytoplasm (centroblast- or immunoblast-like cells) are rare or absent from typical cases, aside from residual germinal centers. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h1\">IMMUNOPHENOTYPE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Mantle cell lymphoma (MCL) cells express high levels of surface IgM and IgD and, for unknown reasons, show lambda light chain restriction in up to 80 percent of cases. They also express pan-B cell antigens (eg, CD19, CD20), CD5, and FMC7. Rare cases may be CD5- or CD23+ [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-pathologic-features-and-diagnosis-of-mantle-cell-lymphoma/abstract/29-32\" class=\"abstract_t\">29-32</a>]. A prominent, expanded irregular meshwork of follicular dendritic cells (FDCs) is found even in diffuse cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-pathologic-features-and-diagnosis-of-mantle-cell-lymphoma/abstract/25,33,34\" class=\"abstract_t\">25,33,34</a>]. SOX11, a member of the SRY-related HMG family of transcription factors, has also been proposed to be a useful marker for MCL, particularly in rare cases that do not express cyclin D1 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-pathologic-features-and-diagnosis-of-mantle-cell-lymphoma/abstract/35-37\" class=\"abstract_t\">35-37</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'Cyclin D1'</a> below.)</p><p>When MCL involves the gastrointestinal tract (lymphomatous polyposis), the tumor cells express the adhesion molecule <span class=\"nowrap\">alpha-4/beta-7</span> integrin (CD49d), which is normally involved in lymphocyte homing to the high endothelial venules in the gut-associated lymphoid tissues [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-pathologic-features-and-diagnosis-of-mantle-cell-lymphoma/abstract/38,39\" class=\"abstract_t\">38,39</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-extranodal-marginal-zone-lymphoma-of-mucosa-associated-lymphoid-tissue-malt-lymphoma\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of extranodal marginal zone lymphoma of mucosa associated lymphoid tissue (MALT lymphoma)&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Cyclin D1</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Nuclear staining for cyclin D1 (BCL1) is present in 95 percent of cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-pathologic-features-and-diagnosis-of-mantle-cell-lymphoma/abstract/40-43\" class=\"abstract_t\">40-43</a>], including those that are CD5 negative [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-pathologic-features-and-diagnosis-of-mantle-cell-lymphoma/abstract/44\" class=\"abstract_t\">44</a>]. The product of the cyclin D1 gene can be detected in the nuclei of neoplastic mantle cells in paraffin-embedded tissue sections with the immunoperoxidase technique, and is useful in distinguishing MCL from other relatively indolent B cell lymphomas, such as <span class=\"nowrap\">SLL/CLL,</span> FL, lymphoplasmacytic lymphoma, and splenic marginal zone lymphoma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-pathologic-features-and-diagnosis-of-mantle-cell-lymphoma/abstract/40,41,45\" class=\"abstract_t\">40,41,45</a>].</p><p>Cyclin D1 may be overproduced even in cases lacking the t(11;14) (see <a href=\"#H8\" class=\"local\">'Genetic features'</a> below), suggesting that other types of acquired genetic aberrations such as point mutations may also result in increased expression [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-pathologic-features-and-diagnosis-of-mantle-cell-lymphoma/abstract/42,46-48\" class=\"abstract_t\">42,46-48</a>]. However, like other lesions identified in cancer, mis-expression of this single gene is insufficient to cause MCL, as transgenic mice that overexpress cyclin D1 alone do not develop lymphoma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-pathologic-features-and-diagnosis-of-mantle-cell-lymphoma/abstract/49\" class=\"abstract_t\">49</a>].</p><p>The relationship of cyclin D1 positive MCL and cases resembling MCL that are cyclin D1 negative is unclear. In a study of 151 Japanese patients with MCL morphology, tumors that overexpressed cyclin D1 tended to be composed of larger cells with a higher mitotic index [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-pathologic-features-and-diagnosis-of-mantle-cell-lymphoma/abstract/45\" class=\"abstract_t\">45</a>]. Also, patients with cyclin D1 positive tumors tended to be older, have more involvement of the GI tract, less involvement of the orbit, a higher International Prognostic Index (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F70850\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef70850 \">table 2</a>), and a lower five-year survival (30 versus 86 percent).</p><p>On the other hand, a separate study from the United States showed that the expression profiles of cyclin D1 positive and negative &quot;MCL&quot; were very similar, and that tumors that failed to express cyclin D1 instead overexpressed either cyclin D2 or D3 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-pathologic-features-and-diagnosis-of-mantle-cell-lymphoma/abstract/50\" class=\"abstract_t\">50</a>], which are highly homologous and functionally identical to cyclin D1. In this well characterized group of cyclin D1-negative and -positive tumors, no difference in clinical behavior or outcome was observed. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pathobiology-of-mantle-cell-lymphoma#H5\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pathobiology of mantle cell lymphoma&quot;, section on 'Cell cycle progression'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h1\">GENETIC FEATURES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Immunoglobulin heavy and light chain genes are rearranged.

This translocation leads to the dysregulated expression of <em>CCND1</em>, the gene that encodes cyclin D1, which is involved in the control of the G1 phase of the cell cycle and is not normally expressed in lymphoid cells [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-pathologic-features-and-diagnosis-of-mantle-cell-lymphoma/abstract/40,60,61\" class=\"abstract_t\">40,60,61</a>].

In addition, DNA sequence analysis of MCL has identified frequent mutations involving exon 1 of the <em>CCND1</em> gene; these are of uncertain functional importance, but it is known that translation of the <em>CCND1</em> mRNA is regulated through its 5&rsquo; untranslated region, suggesting that these mutations may enhance <em>CCND1</em> expression [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-pathologic-features-and-diagnosis-of-mantle-cell-lymphoma/abstract/63\" class=\"abstract_t\">63</a>].

Some patients with this finding will prove to have disseminated MCL on further work-up; the intrafollicular component in such cases presumably represents early seeding of MCL to a partially involved node. Other patients, however, will not have evidence of MCL on further evaluation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-pathologic-features-and-diagnosis-of-mantle-cell-lymphoma/abstract/88\" class=\"abstract_t\">88</a>]. The natural history of this second group of patients is not yet known.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h2\">Chronic lymphocytic leukemia</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Both MCL and chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) are neoplasms of small to medium-sized lymphoid cells with similar immunohistochemistry. While CLL is positive for CD20, CD5, and CD23, MCL is positive for CD20 and CD5 but negative for CD23. Immunohistochemistry for cyclin D1 is very helpful in excluding CLL. Additional testing to identify the t(11;14) by FISH can also aid in the diagnosis of MCL [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-pathologic-features-and-diagnosis-of-mantle-cell-lymphoma/abstract/89\" class=\"abstract_t\">89</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-presentation-pathologic-features-diagnosis-and-differential-diagnosis-of-chronic-lymphocytic-leukemia\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical presentation, pathologic features, diagnosis, and differential diagnosis of chronic lymphocytic leukemia&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h2\">Follicular lymphoma</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>On histology, MCL can have a predominantly nodular growth pattern that resembles that of follicular lymphoma. However, in contrast to follicular lymphoma (FL), MCL cells are usually CD10-, CD5+, CD43+, and cyclin D1+. Like MCL, follicular lymphoma can present with GI involvement as lymphomatous polyposis; such tumors are also best distinguished from MCL by immunohistochemistry. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-pathologic-features-diagnosis-and-prognosis-of-follicular-lymphoma\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations, pathologic features, diagnosis, and prognosis of follicular lymphoma&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h2\">Marginal zone lymphoma (nodal or extranodal)</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Both extranodal marginal zone lymphoma (MZL) and MCL can involve the gastrointestinal tract and are neoplasms of small to medium-sized B lymphocytes. On immunophenotype, MCL expresses CD5 and cyclin D1 while extranodal MZL does not. In addition, MZL often contains monocytoid B cells and shows plasmacytic differentiation, which are not features of MCL. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-pathologic-features-and-diagnosis-of-extranodal-marginal-zone-lymphoma-of-mucosa-associated-lymphoid-tissue-malt\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations, pathologic features, and diagnosis of extranodal marginal zone lymphoma of mucosa associated lymphoid tissue (MALT)&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H16168351\"><span class=\"h2\">Lymphoblastic lymphoma</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The blastoid variant of MCL has a high mitotic rate (typically 20 to 30 per 10 high power fields) and is often comprised of intermediate-sized cells with dispersed chromatin, irregular nuclear contours, and scant cytoplasm that mimic the appearance of lymphoblastic lymphoma, which can be of B or T cell origin. These cases are easily distinguished from lymphoblastic lymphoma by immunohistochemistry, as blastoid variant MCL expresses cyclin D1 and mature B cell markers (eg, surface immunoglobulin), whereas B lymphoblastic lymphomas lack surface immunoglobulin and express TdT, and T lymphoblastic lymphomas express TdT and additional T cell markers besides CD5.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14\"><span class=\"h1\">PROGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The course of mantle cell lymphoma (MCL) is moderately aggressive and variable. Median overall survival in modern trials incorporating intensive therapy is 8 to 10 years, with no plateau in the survival curve. Shorter survival times are seen with less intensive therapy. </p><p>Multiple studies have tried to determine prognostic factors to predict which patients will have a more aggressive course [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-pathologic-features-and-diagnosis-of-mantle-cell-lymphoma/abstract/90-99\" class=\"abstract_t\">90-99</a>]. While most patients with MCL who do not begin therapy will die of their disease within a few years, a small proportion, increasingly better defined, may remain stable for years. These occasional patients with low stage (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F97479\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef97479 \">table 3</a>), low-risk (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F70850\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef70850 \">table 2</a>) disease may have an indolent course, managed by observation, splenectomy, or treatment with alkylating agents analogous to the treatment of patients with small lymphocytic lymphoma or follicular lymphoma. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=initial-treatment-of-mantle-cell-lymphoma#H2\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Initial treatment of mantle cell lymphoma&quot;, section on 'Indications for treatment'</a>.)</p><p>Several prognostic indices have been applied to patients with MCL.

Using information regarding age, performance status, lactate dehydrogenase, and leukocyte count, patients could be stratified into three risk groups (low, intermediate, and high) with significantly different estimated median overall survival (not reached, 58 months, and 37 months) and survival at five years (60, 35, and 20 percent) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F86535\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef86535 \">table 5</a>). The prognostic value of the MIPI was later confirmed in a separate cohort of 958 patients with MCL treated on prospective trials between 2004 and 2010 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-pathologic-features-and-diagnosis-of-mantle-cell-lymphoma/abstract/101\" class=\"abstract_t\">101</a>]. This latter study confirmed that the MIPI was able to identify three risk groups with significantly different estimated survival at five years (83, 63, and 34 percent). The differences in survival rates seen in this second study likely reflect differences in patient populations, available treatments, and adjunctive care. This also illustrates the importance of healthy scepticism when applying prognostic indices to the care individual patients.</p><p>The blastoid variant of MCL is reported in some studies to be more aggressive [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-pathologic-features-and-diagnosis-of-mantle-cell-lymphoma/abstract/9,30,92-95\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,30,92-95</a>], whereas patients presenting without anemia or splenomegaly [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-pathologic-features-and-diagnosis-of-mantle-cell-lymphoma/abstract/30,96\" class=\"abstract_t\">30,96</a>], those with a normal serum free light chain ratio [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-pathologic-features-and-diagnosis-of-mantle-cell-lymphoma/abstract/102\" class=\"abstract_t\">102</a>], or whose tumor cells do not overexpress cyclin D1, may have longer survival (see <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'Cyclin D1'</a> above) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-pathologic-features-and-diagnosis-of-mantle-cell-lymphoma/abstract/45\" class=\"abstract_t\">45</a>].</p><p>In one series of 52 patients with MCL, blastoid transformation occurred in 18 (35 percent), with a median survival time following transformation of four months [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-pathologic-features-and-diagnosis-of-mantle-cell-lymphoma/abstract/97\" class=\"abstract_t\">97</a>]. Sixteen of the 18 had systemic involvement with circulating blastoid cells at the time of transformation. Leukocytosis, elevated serum lactate dehydrogenase level, and high proliferative activity (as assessed by Ki-67 staining) were associated with an increased risk of this complication. In separate studies, age &gt;60 and an increased mitotic index [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-pathologic-features-and-diagnosis-of-mantle-cell-lymphoma/abstract/98\" class=\"abstract_t\">98</a>] or increased Ki-67 staining [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-pathologic-features-and-diagnosis-of-mantle-cell-lymphoma/abstract/103-105\" class=\"abstract_t\">103-105</a>] were associated with significantly worse overall survival.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15\"><span class=\"h1\">SUMMARY</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Mantle cell lymphoma (MCL) is one of the mature B cell non-Hodgkin lymphomas (NHL).

They also express pan-B cell antigens (eg, CD19, CD20), CD5, and FMC7. Nuclear staining for cyclin D1 (BCL1) is present in &gt;90 percent of cases, including those that are CD5 negative. (See <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'Immunophenotype'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Although not specific for MCL, the majority of cases will demonstrate t(11;14) by conventional cytogenetics or FISH. (See <a href=\"#H8\" class=\"local\">'Genetic features'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients suspected of having MCL should undergo tissue biopsy.
