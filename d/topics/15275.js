The benefit of TBLB was demonstrated in a series of 150 patients with suspected sarcoidosis: 88 patients had granulomas on TBLB, an additional 10 had granulomas on endobronchial biopsy, and 9 had findings diagnostic of another disease, bringing the overall rate of diagnosis to 71 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/role-of-lung-biopsy-in-the-diagnosis-of-interstitial-lung-disease/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].

They may miss the correct diagnosis when the disease is patchy or when visualization of whole pulmonary acini is needed to fully evaluate disease distribution. Examples include granulomatosis with polyangiitis (Wegener's granulomatosis) and other vasculitides that typically require examination of arteries and arterioles that are larger than those obtained by TBLB and the idiopathic interstitial pneumonias, particularly idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1840496715\"><span class=\"h3\">Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>TBLB cannot be used to make a conclusive diagnosis of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF), based on the absence of prospective studies utilizing an acceptable gold standard that demonstrates the usefulness of TBLB in the diagnosis of usual interstitial pneumonia (UIP), the histologic pattern associated with IPF [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/role-of-lung-biopsy-in-the-diagnosis-of-interstitial-lung-disease/abstract/12-15\" class=\"abstract_t\">12-15</a>]. While transbronchial biopsy is rarely sufficient to make a pathological diagnosis of UIP, a properly performed and interpreted transbronchial biopsy that is negative for an alternative diagnosis does increase the post-test probability of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis in patients who already have a high pre-test probability of IPF [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/role-of-lung-biopsy-in-the-diagnosis-of-interstitial-lung-disease/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. </p><p>The reason that TBLB is unsuccessful in the diagnosis of IPF is that the histopathologic diagnosis of UIP depends on the low power visualization of gross architectural features such as the repetitive combination of patchy fibrosis, fibroblastic foci, and microscopic honeycombing with intervening normal lung parenchyma, changes that cannot be appreciated on a transbronchial biopsy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/role-of-lung-biopsy-in-the-diagnosis-of-interstitial-lung-disease/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. Additionally, areas of more diffuse fibrotic nonspecific interstitial pneumonia (NSIP)-like fibrosis, that are commonly seen in UIP can easily be distinguished on a surgical lung biopsy, but not on a transbronchial biopsy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/role-of-lung-biopsy-in-the-diagnosis-of-interstitial-lung-disease/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. </p><p>Varying combinations of histopathologic findings suggestive of UIP, including fibroblastic foci, patchy interstitial fibrosis, and honeycombing, have been demonstrated in a minority of transbronchial biopsy studies.

We suggest not pursuing TBLB in patients suspected of having an IIP, particularly IPF (see <a href=\"#H1840496715\" class=\"local\">'Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis'</a> above). However, a potential exception is suspected cryptogenic organizing pneumonia, in which a TBLB with typical histopathologic findings might be sufficient in the appropriate clinical and radiologic context [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/role-of-lung-biopsy-in-the-diagnosis-of-interstitial-lung-disease/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>].

Infection and malignancy are the most common specific diagnoses made on surgical lung biopsy in these patients. Given the high likelihood of infection or malignancy, it is worth considering whether a less invasive method would yield a diagnosis. Diffusely metastatic pulmonary malignancy can often be diagnosed with transbronchial biopsy. Bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) identifies majority of pulmonary infections and has high sensitivity and negative predictive value with performance characteristics comparable to that of surgical lung biopsy to exclude pulmonary infections [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/role-of-lung-biopsy-in-the-diagnosis-of-interstitial-lung-disease/abstract/61,67,70,71\" class=\"abstract_t\">61,67,70,71</a>]. </p><p>When a surgical lung biopsy reveals a noninfectious and nonmalignant diagnosis, the diagnosis may not be useful therapeutically.

Factors associated with an increased mortality were male sex, older age, comorbid conditions, thoracotomy, and a provisional diagnosis of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis or rheumatic disease-related interstitial lung disease.

First, almost all of these data are retrospective and thoracotomy may have been performed instead of VATS because pleural adhesions or severe hypoxemia preclude the single lung ventilation needed for VATS. Such patients are likely to be at higher risk of complications and mortality. Second, most of the thoracotomy data comes from before 1992 and most of the VATS data comes from after 1992; improvement in intraoperative and postoperative care possibly contributed in some measure to the difference in mortalities.

If the patient is immunosuppressed or infection is suspected (eg, fever, short duration of symptoms), samples are sent for mycobacterial, fungal, and viral studies. Sending surgical biopsy specimens routinely for microbiologic testing in patients with interstitial lung disease is not necessary because culture results in this group of patients are rarely useful clinically [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/role-of-lung-biopsy-in-the-diagnosis-of-interstitial-lung-disease/abstract/107,112\" class=\"abstract_t\">107,112</a>].</p><p>Frozen sections are generally not useful in the diagnosis of diffuse parenchymal lung disease, but may be used during surgical biopsy to assess whether an adequate sample has been obtained or when malignancy is suspected. </p><p>As the sample size is small, the entirety of the transbronchial biopsy specimens not sent to microbiology should be processed and examined.

Overinflation however must be avoided as this may cause loss of pathologic features, such as washing out macrophages from the alveolar spaces.

An approach to evaluating immunocompetent adults with ILD is shown in the algorithm (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F77345\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef77345 \">algorithm 1</a>) and discussed in detail separately.

(See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Overview'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Lung biopsy is less likely to be helpful in patients with a known systemic rheumatic (connective tissue) disease or with acute respiratory failure complicating ILD.

(See <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Transbronchial lung biopsy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>TBLB are a few millimeters in size and are likely to miss diseases that are patchy or require examination of a larger area of tissue for accurate diagnosis (eg, usual interstitial pneumonitis [UIP], nonspecific interstitial pneumonia [NSIP], vasculitis). (See <a href=\"#H3887352282\" class=\"local\">'What are the diagnostic limitations?'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Typically, four to six TBLB are obtained from areas of lung that appear involved radiographically. If the lungs are uniformly involved, the lower lobe or both upper and lower lobes are biopsied. All biopsies are obtained on the same side to avoid the risk of bilateral pneumothoraces. (See <a href=\"#H20485052\" class=\"local\">'Specimen collection and diagnostic yield'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Ancillary bronchoscopic tests such as endobronchial biopsy and bronchoalveolar lavage can help improve the diagnostic yield of TBLB. For patients with hilar or mediastinal adenopathy, endobronchial ultrasound guided transbronchial needle aspiration (EBUS-TBNA) may contribute to the diagnostic yield, although general anesthesia and specialized equipment are required.
