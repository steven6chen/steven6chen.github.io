Both are part of a spectrum of neoplastic diseases known as the Ewing sarcoma family of tumors (EFT), which also includes the more differentiated peripheral primitive neuroectodermal tumor (PNET, previously called peripheral neuroepithelioma, adult neuroblastoma, and Askin's tumor of the chest wall) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/radiation-therapy-for-ewing-sarcoma-family-of-tumors/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. PNET can also present either in bone or soft tissue. Because these tumors share similar histological and immunohistochemical characteristics and unique nonrandom chromosomal translocations, they are considered to have a common origin. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epidemiology-pathology-and-molecular-genetics-of-the-ewing-sarcoma-family-of-tumors\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Epidemiology, pathology, and molecular genetics of the Ewing sarcoma family of tumors&quot;</a>.)</p><p>EFT also share important clinical features, including a peak incidence between the age of 10 and 20, a tendency towards rapid spread to lungs, bone, and bone marrow, and responsiveness to the same chemotherapeutic regimens and radiation therapy (RT). Because relapse rates are high in patients undergoing local therapy alone (80 to 90 percent), it is surmised that the majority have subclinical metastatic disease at the time of diagnosis, even in the absence of overt metastases. The routine administration of intensive multiagent chemotherapy, which can eradicate these deposits, has had a dramatic impact on outcomes. Five-year survival rates for patients with ES in the United States rose from 36 to 56 percent during the periods 1975 to 1984 and 1985 to 1994 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/radiation-therapy-for-ewing-sarcoma-family-of-tumors/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-the-ewing-sarcoma-family-of-tumors\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of the Ewing sarcoma family of tumors&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Local control at the primary tumor site can be accomplished by surgery, RT, or both. The choice of modality usually represents a tradeoff between functional result and treatment-related morbidity, particularly the risk of a secondary radiation-induced malignancy. Although modern treatment protocols emphasize surgery for optimal local control, patients who lack a function-preserving surgical option because of tumor location or extent, and those who have clearly unresectable primary tumors following induction chemotherapy are appropriate candidates for RT.</p><p>Since more than 90 percent of patients with EFT have either detectable or subclinical metastases at diagnosis, local therapy, if delivered correctly, is probably not the critical event in determining survival. However, if local therapy is delivered poorly or given in such a way that it compromises the delivery of adequate chemotherapy, survival can be greatly compromised. Moreover, local failure is associated with a very poor survival outcome [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/radiation-therapy-for-ewing-sarcoma-family-of-tumors/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].</p><p>Here we will discuss the role of RT in the local management of the EFT. Epidemiology, pathology, molecular genetics, clinical presentation, and diagnosis of these tumors, as well as surgical principles and the use of chemotherapy are presented elsewhere. Central (supratentorial) PNET tumors are also discussed elsewhere.

Historically, RT was preferred over surgery because of less acute morbidity, acceptable rates of local control (50 to 77 percent), and poor long-term prognosis, largely due to distant dissemination in the absence of effective chemotherapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/radiation-therapy-for-ewing-sarcoma-family-of-tumors/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].</p><p>The introduction of multiagent chemotherapy into the management of EFT in the 1970s led to an increase in cure rates as well as higher local control rates after RT (72 to 90 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/radiation-therapy-for-ewing-sarcoma-family-of-tumors/abstract/6-11\" class=\"abstract_t\">6-11</a>]. As more children survived their tumors, balancing long-term local disease control with long-term functional results assumed greater importance. The recognition of late effects of RT (eg, fracture, second malignant neoplasms) as well as improvements in surgical techniques resulted in a shift towards the use of surgery rather than RT.</p><p>Current protocols tailor local treatment to the individual patient with the goal of maximizing local tumor control while minimizing treatment-related morbidity. In general, patients are selected for local therapy in such a way that they are treated with surgery or RT but not both, since the combined use of surgery and RT places patients at risk for morbidity from both modalities [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/radiation-therapy-for-ewing-sarcoma-family-of-tumors/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. However, there is a role for combined therapy in some circumstances, particularly for large tumors (particularly involving the pelvis), and for cases in which resection margins are positive or close. (See <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'Adjuvant RT'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">RT versus surgery</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Both surgery and RT represent effective local treatment for Ewing sarcoma. There are no randomized trials which directly compare both modalities, and their relative roles continue to be debated. Contemporary treatment guidelines emphasize surgical resection as the local control modality of choice if it is believed that the lesion can be resected with negative margins, without excessively morbidity, and with the expectation of a reasonable functional result. Surgery is preferred for potentially resectable lesions, and for those arising in dispensable bones (eg, fibula, rib, small lesions of the hands or feet) for the following reasons:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>It avoids the risk of secondary radiation-induced sarcomas.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>An analysis of the degree of necrosis in the excised tumor can permit refinements in the estimate of prognosis. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=bone-sarcomas-preoperative-evaluation-histologic-classification-and-principles-of-surgical-management#H27\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Bone sarcomas: Preoperative evaluation, histologic classification, and principles of surgical management&quot;, section on 'Neoadjuvant chemotherapy'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In the skeletally immature child, resection may be associated with less morbidity than radiation, which can retard bone growth and cause deformity.</p><p/><p>Thus, in most cases, the decision to use RT for treatment of the primary site is made only after review of the potential surgical options for a given lesion. Patients who lack a function-preserving surgical option because of tumor location or extent, and those who have clearly unresectable primary tumors following induction chemotherapy are appropriate candidates for RT.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h3\">Influence of tumor site</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>When considering the local control strategy for an individual patient, the need to attain complete tumor eradication must be weighed against the twin goals of maximizing function and minimizing long-term morbidity. Although treatment decisions must be individualized according to the expected deficits from surgical resection at any site, the following generalizations can be made regarding the influence of tumor site on the choice of local treatment (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=bone-sarcomas-preoperative-evaluation-histologic-classification-and-principles-of-surgical-management\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Bone sarcomas: Preoperative evaluation, histologic classification, and principles of surgical management&quot;</a>):</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>It is generally agreed that surgery is preferred for lesions arising in dispensable bones (eg, fibula or rib).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Tumors affecting the long bones of the leg, distal humerus, or ulna can usually be resected and reconstructed using intercalary techniques (allografts, autografts, or metallic prostheses) or joint replacement, depending on tumor location. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=bone-sarcomas-preoperative-evaluation-histologic-classification-and-principles-of-surgical-management#H19\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Bone sarcomas: Preoperative evaluation, histologic classification, and principles of surgical management&quot;, section on 'Allografts and endoprostheses'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">On the other hand, primary tumors involving the proximal humerus and upper scapula may be best treated with RT, since limb reconstruction is difficult and shoulder morbidity may be substantial. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=bone-sarcomas-preoperative-evaluation-histologic-classification-and-principles-of-surgical-management#H10\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Bone sarcomas: Preoperative evaluation, histologic classification, and principles of surgical management&quot;, section on 'Extremity lesions: limb-sparing procedures'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients with lesions of the skull, facial bones, or vertebrae are often candidates for nonsurgical treatment because of the difficulty in achieving negative margins without substantial functional deficit [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/radiation-therapy-for-ewing-sarcoma-family-of-tumors/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A number of series report better results with surgery over RT alone for pelvic bone tumors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/radiation-therapy-for-ewing-sarcoma-family-of-tumors/abstract/14-18\" class=\"abstract_t\">14-18</a>], but this is a controversial area. Surgical treatment for pelvic sarcomas, which are often bulky, is challenging. Lesions of the iliac wing, ischium, or pubis can usually be resected after a good response to chemotherapy without substantial functional morbidity. For tumors of the periacetabular region and those that cross the sacroiliac joint, there is less enthusiasm for surgical resection given the significant resulting functional deficit. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=bone-sarcomas-preoperative-evaluation-histologic-classification-and-principles-of-surgical-management#H15\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Bone sarcomas: Preoperative evaluation, histologic classification, and principles of surgical management&quot;, section on 'Pelvic tumors'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h3\">Outcomes</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Because no randomized trial has directly compared both modalities, only a relative comparison can be made from retrospective reports and the prospective trials that have mainly tested different multiagent chemotherapy regimens. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-the-ewing-sarcoma-family-of-tumors#H4\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of the Ewing sarcoma family of tumors&quot;, section on 'Treatment for localized disease'</a>.)</p><p>In many retrospective series, rates of local control and survival are superior after surgery compared with RT alone [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/radiation-therapy-for-ewing-sarcoma-family-of-tumors/abstract/9,10,16,19-30\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,10,16,19-30</a>]. However, larger cooperative group studies have failed to reflect this advantage, and selection bias likely accounts for at least some of these results. Smaller, more favorably situated peripheral tumors are more often resected while larger, axial lesions (which have a higher rate of local failure in most series and a poorer prognosis overall [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/radiation-therapy-for-ewing-sarcoma-family-of-tumors/abstract/9,20,21,31\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,20,21,31</a>]) are referred for RT. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-presentation-staging-and-prognostic-factors-of-the-ewing-sarcoma-family-of-tumors#H14\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical presentation, staging, and prognostic factors of the Ewing sarcoma family of tumors&quot;, section on 'Tumor site and size'</a>.)</p><p>The Children's Oncology Group reported local control outcomes in patients treated with surgery, radiation, or both on three consecutive protocols using standard-dose, five-drug chemotherapy every three weeks [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/radiation-therapy-for-ewing-sarcoma-family-of-tumors/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>]. Patients who underwent surgery were significantly younger and had more appendicular primaries. Compared with surgery, radiation was associated with a higher unadjusted risk of any event (hazard ratio [HR] 1.70; 95% CI, 1.18-2.44), death (HR 1.84; 95% CI, 1.18-2.85), and local failure (HR, 2.57; 95% CI, 1.37-4.83). On multivariate analysis, compared with surgery, use of RT was associated with a higher risk for local failure (HR 2.41; 95% CI, 1.24-4.68), although there were no significant differences in event-free survival (EFS; HR 1.42; 95% CI, 0.94-2.14), overall survival (HR 1.37; 95% CI, 0.83-2.26), or distant failure (HR 1.13; 95% CI, 0.70-1.84). These data support surgical resection when appropriate. RT remains a reasonable alternative in selected patients. </p><p>RT delivery techniques may have contributed to poorer outcomes in early series. As an example, in the Cooperative Ewing Sarcoma Study (CESS)-81 trial, relapse-free survival (RFS) for patients undergoing irradiation of the primary site in the initial phase of the trial was only 55 percent, significantly lower than for surgically treated patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/radiation-therapy-for-ewing-sarcoma-family-of-tumors/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. On review, the high rate of local failure after RT alone (50 percent) was attributed to geographic &quot;miss.&quot; After a quality assurance program was initiated, local control rates improved significantly, and RFS increased to 80 percent. In a subsequent study, CESS-86, which included central quality assurance, the five-year RFS rates following chemotherapy plus either RT or surgery were 67 and 65 percent, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/radiation-therapy-for-ewing-sarcoma-family-of-tumors/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. The importance of RT dose and field planning to local control is discussed below. (See <a href=\"#H14\" class=\"local\">'Radiation treatment planning'</a> below.)</p><p>Several studies support the adequacy of RT alone for local control:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>One retrospective report included 39 patients who were treated between 1975 and 1991 at two Boston hospitals with multiagent chemotherapy and varying combinations of surgery and RT [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/radiation-therapy-for-ewing-sarcoma-family-of-tumors/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>]. Twenty had RT alone, 16 both surgery plus RT, and 3 surgery alone. Despite the use of combination chemotherapy, five-year disease-free survival (DFS) was only approximately 30 percent, emphasizing the high-risk nature of these mainly axial lesions. However, local control rates were similar among patients treated with RT alone or surgery (85 and 84 percent, respectively).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Another case series included 60 patients treated for EFT at Memorial Sloan Kettering between 1990 and 2004; 31 underwent RT as the sole modality for local control, the remainder in conjunction with surgery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/radiation-therapy-for-ewing-sarcoma-family-of-tumors/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>]. The relatively poor prognosis of this group is reflected by the fact that most were centrally located tumors (spine, pelvis, proximal extremities), 52 percent were &ge;8 cm in size, and one-third were metastatic at diagnosis.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Adult Ewing sarcoma patients who are treated with modern chemotherapy protocols and RT techniques have outcomes that are similar to those of younger patients, with anticipated local control rates of approximately 80 percent after definitive radiation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/radiation-therapy-for-ewing-sarcoma-family-of-tumors/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>]. With a median follow-up of 41 months, DFS and overall survival rates for patients with nonmetastatic disease at presentation were 70 and 86 percent, respectively. There were only nine local recurrences, five of which developed in patients who presented with overt metastases. The three-year actuarial local control rates for the entire group and those undergoing definitive RT alone were 77 and 78 percent, respectively. The presence of overt metastases emerged as the only significant adverse prognostic factor for local control, a finding that has been confirmed by others [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/radiation-therapy-for-ewing-sarcoma-family-of-tumors/abstract/9,36\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,36</a>]. Long-term treatment-related complications were minimal, and there were no secondary malignancies. (See <a href=\"#H23\" class=\"local\">'Late effects'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The relationship between local control modality (surgery, RT, or both) and the subsequent risk for local failure was examined in a subgroup of 75 patients treated for nonmetastatic pelvic EFT in US Intergroup study 0091 (IESS III), a randomized comparison of VACA (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=vincristine-conventional-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">vincristine</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=doxorubicin-conventional-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">doxorubicin</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cyclophosphamide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cyclophosphamide</a>, and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dactinomycin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">dactinomycin</a>) with or without alternating IE (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=ifosfamide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ifosfamide</a> plus <a href=\"topic.htm?path=etoposide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">etoposide</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/radiation-therapy-for-ewing-sarcoma-family-of-tumors/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>].

However, there was a trend toward improved local control in patients receiving <span class=\"nowrap\">VACA/IE</span> as compared with VACA alone (cumulative incidence of local failure 11 versus 30 percent; p = 0.06), which was present regardless of the local control modality.</p><p/><p>Although not a universal finding [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/radiation-therapy-for-ewing-sarcoma-family-of-tumors/abstract/6,34,38\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,34,38</a>], many studies suggest that smaller tumors are more likely to be locally controlled after RT alone [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/radiation-therapy-for-ewing-sarcoma-family-of-tumors/abstract/9,15,19,39-43\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,15,19,39-43</a>]. As an example, in a report of 100 patients with localized Ewing sarcoma of bone, local control rates were significantly higher after RT for the 14 lesions that were &le;100 cm<sup>3</sup> in volume compared with larger lesions (93 versus 60 percent, respectively) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/radiation-therapy-for-ewing-sarcoma-family-of-tumors/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>].

Prophylactic whole lung irradiation has not been studied in any subsequent trial, and no studies have used it in addition to modern combination chemotherapy regimens [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/radiation-therapy-for-ewing-sarcoma-family-of-tumors/abstract/52\" class=\"abstract_t\">52</a>], except in patients with lung metastases at diagnosis.

Consequently, RT was administered to the entire marrow cavity of the involved bone, and the site of gross disease boosted to a higher dose. However, an analysis of the RT fields for the Intergroup Ewing Sarcoma Study Group (IESS) trial I suggested that most relapses were at the site of initially bulky tumor [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/radiation-therapy-for-ewing-sarcoma-family-of-tumors/abstract/7,8,73\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,8,73</a>].

After preliminary analysis showed that tailored field was as effective as whole-bone RT, the randomized study was stopped and subsequent patients were treated with limited fields. At three years, the rates of local control and event-free survival were 76 and 54 percent, respectively.</p><p>IESS trial III, which opened in 1988, was the first cooperative group trial to include tailored RT ports, and the first to be carried out with modern MRI imaging of the primary site and CT-based treatment planning [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/radiation-therapy-for-ewing-sarcoma-family-of-tumors/abstract/74\" class=\"abstract_t\">74</a>]. The main randomization was between standard versus more intensive chemotherapy (VAC with or without IE). The addition of IE significantly improved five-year survival (72 versus 61 percent) and event-free survival rates (69 versus 54 percent), particularly for patients with pelvic primary tumors. Moreover, the five-cumulative rate of local recurrence either alone or with systemic relapse was 20 percent in the VAC group compared with only 7 percent in the <span class=\"nowrap\">VAC/IE</span> group. These data underscore the contribution of intensive chemotherapy to both local control and survival for patients with nonmetastatic EFT at diagnosis.

The estimated 10-year cumulative incidence of local failure was 4.4 <span class=\"nowrap\">+/-</span> 3.1 percent, with no statistical difference seen between RT treatment groups; there were no local failures in the escalated-dose RT treatment group.</p><p>This approach, if validated, has particular appeal because of the reduction in radiation target volume, which should reduce both acute and late toxicity, as well as the selective use of dose escalation for high-risk lesions &gt;8 cm, reported in multiple series to be at higher risk for local failure with conventional RT doses. Another report also suggests that patients treated with definitive radiation doses &ge;5600 centigray (cGy) had a lower incidence of local recurrence (17 versus 28 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/radiation-therapy-for-ewing-sarcoma-family-of-tumors/abstract/45\" class=\"abstract_t\">45</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H19\"><span class=\"h2\">Radiation schedule</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Conventional RT schedules usually consist of once daily RT doses of 1.8 to 2.0 Gy per fraction. Accelerated fractionation RT does not seem to improve rates of local control or survival [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/radiation-therapy-for-ewing-sarcoma-family-of-tumors/abstract/6,19,22,34,93\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,19,22,34,93</a>]. However, data from the University of Florida suggest that hyperfractionated RT (1.2 Gy twice daily with a six hour interfraction interval) may be associated with less long-term toxicity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/radiation-therapy-for-ewing-sarcoma-family-of-tumors/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>].</p><p>The series consisted of 75 patients with localized Ewing tumor of the extremity or pelvis (lower extremity, 30; upper extremity, 19; pelvis, 26) who were treated with definitive RT at the University of Florida between 1970 and 2006. RT was performed on a once-daily (40 percent, median dose was 55.2 Gy in 1.8-Gy daily fractions) or twice-daily (60 percent, median dose 55.0 Gy in 1.2 Gy twice-daily fractions) basis. Functional outcome was assessed using the Toronto Extremity Salvage Score [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/radiation-therapy-for-ewing-sarcoma-family-of-tumors/abstract/94\" class=\"abstract_t\">94</a>].</p><p>Larger tumors had significantly worse cause-specific survival (81 versus 39 percent for tumors &lt;8 cm versus &ge;8 cm), but there were no patient characteristics or treatment variables that were predictive of local failure. No fractures occurred in patients treated with hyperfractionation or with tumors of the distal extremities. Severe late complications were more frequently associated with use of &lt;8 MV photons and fields encompassing the entire bone or hemipelvis. In terms of late effects, a significantly better late effect Toronto Extremity Salvage Score was associated with biologically effective doses of &lt;91.7 Gy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/radiation-therapy-for-ewing-sarcoma-family-of-tumors/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. The authors concluded that limited field sizes with hyperfractionated high-energy RT could minimize long-term complications and provide superior functional outcomes.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H20\"><span class=\"h3\">IORT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A benefit for intraoperative radiation therapy (IORT) has been suggested in retrospective series involving a small number of patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/radiation-therapy-for-ewing-sarcoma-family-of-tumors/abstract/95,96\" class=\"abstract_t\">95,96</a>]. However, peripheral nerves are dose-limiting tissue structures for IORT, so the risk of severe neuropathy and soft tissue necrosis must be considered if this approach is used.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H21\"><span class=\"h1\">SEQUELAE OF TREATMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Potentially curative treatment of EFT is necessarily aggressive. The toxicity of RT given in conjunction with intensive chemotherapy can be separated into short-term and long-term complications. The severity of both can be limited by careful attention to technique.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H22\"><span class=\"h2\">Acute effects</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Acute reactions are those that occur during or shortly after the completion of RT. The most prominent affect tissues within the radiated field that contain rapidly dividing cells, and include desquamation of the skin, myelosuppression, mucositis, diarrhea, nausea, and cystitis. All except myelosuppression are site-specific. Severity depends upon the amount of normal tissue in the radiated field, the radiation fraction size, and the timing of chemotherapy in relation to the RT.</p><p>Many acute effects, particularly myelosuppression, are exacerbated or potentiated by the use of intensive systemic chemotherapy. As examples:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Both <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cyclophosphamide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cyclophosphamide</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ifosfamide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ifosfamide</a> can cause hemorrhagic cystitis; the amount of bladder in the treatment field should be limited to avoid compounding this problem. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cystitis-in-patients-with-cancer\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Cystitis in patients with cancer&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><a href=\"topic.htm?path=dactinomycin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Dactinomycin</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=doxorubicin-conventional-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">doxorubicin</a> act as radiation sensitizers and can enhance acute radiation toxicity. If these drugs are used as a component of systemic chemotherapy, breaks should be instituted during the RT or administration of these agents should be delayed until acute RT reactions subside. Current practice in the Children's Oncology Group (COG) studies is to administer RT concurrently with the <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ifosfamide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ifosfamide</a><span class=\"nowrap\">/<a href=\"topic.htm?path=etoposide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">etoposide</a></span> cycles of chemotherapy. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-the-ewing-sarcoma-family-of-tumors\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of the Ewing sarcoma family of tumors&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p>Acute reactions are usually self-limited and subside within 10 to 14 days of RT completion. Dry desquamation can be managed topically with emollient creams. The development of wet desquamation may require a temporary break in therapy in addition to thrice daily cleansing with warm water and mild soap, petrolatum-based ointments, nonadherent dressings, and, if patients are neutropenic, a topical antibiotic ointment or systemic antibiotics depending on the clinical scenario.</p><p>Mucositis and diarrhea are managed with supportive measures; if severe, a treatment break may be required. Patients receiving proton beam irradiation for treatment of vertebral lesions tend to have less nausea and diarrhea than those undergoing photon beam irradiation because of the lack of an exit dose to bowel anterior to the spine. Patients receiving whole lung irradiation are at risk for radiation pneumonitis. (See <a href=\"#H16\" class=\"local\">'Proton beam therapy'</a> above and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=radiation-induced-lung-injury\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Radiation-induced lung injury&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H23\"><span class=\"h2\">Late effects</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Late reactions occur months to years after completing a course of RT. Severity is not always predicted by the severity of acute effects. Late changes in normal tissues caused by RT are related to field size, the volume of normal tissues in the field, and the dose received by normal tissue. Other important factors include patient age at the time of treatment, skeletal maturity, adherence to a rehabilitation program, and whether a pathologic fracture is present at diagnosis. As examples:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Younger, prepubertal children are at greatest risk for radiation-induced arrest of bone growth [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/radiation-therapy-for-ewing-sarcoma-family-of-tumors/abstract/97\" class=\"abstract_t\">97</a>].

RT-induced osteosarcomas and therapy-related (alkylating agents, epidophyllotoxins) leukemias predominate.

The magnitude of risk is variable [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/radiation-therapy-for-ewing-sarcoma-family-of-tumors/abstract/50,78,101-103,105-107\" class=\"abstract_t\">50,78,101-103,105-107</a>]. Early data suggested that the cumulative risk of a secondary sarcoma after treatment for EFT was approximately 35 percent at 10 years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/radiation-therapy-for-ewing-sarcoma-family-of-tumors/abstract/106\" class=\"abstract_t\">106</a>]. The Late Effects Study Group, examining the late effects of treatment for childhood cancer, reported an estimated cumulative incidence of secondary sarcomas after treatment of EFT that approached 22 percent at 20 years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/radiation-therapy-for-ewing-sarcoma-family-of-tumors/abstract/102\" class=\"abstract_t\">102</a>]. These and other investigators identified RT dose as the major predisposing factor for development of a radiation-induced sarcoma, particularly above 60 Gy.</p><p>Subsequent experience with protocols utilizing lower doses of RT and tailored RT fields suggest that the magnitude of the risk is somewhat lower [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/radiation-therapy-for-ewing-sarcoma-family-of-tumors/abstract/50,78,103,107\" class=\"abstract_t\">50,78,103,107</a>].

The cumulative RT doses were none, 21 to 48, 48 to 60, and &gt;60 Gy in 8, 23, 45, and 24 percent, respectively. Overall, 16 children developed second malignancies, which included 10 sarcomas. The estimated cumulative risk at 20 years was 9.2 percent for any malignancy, and 6.5 percent for a secondary sarcoma. The median time to the diagnosis of the second malignancy after completion of therapy was 7.6 years. All the secondary sarcomas occurred near or at the primary site of the Ewing sarcoma and within the primary irradiated field. As has been noted by others, the cumulative incidence of secondary sarcoma was radiation dose-dependent. No secondary sarcomas developed among patients who had received less than 48 Gy, while the absolute risk of secondary sarcoma was 130 cases per 10,000 person-years of observation among patients who had received &ge;60 Gy.

Both are part of a spectrum of neoplastic diseases known as the Ewing sarcoma family of tumors (EFT), which also includes the more differentiated peripheral primitive neuroectodermal tumor (PNET). These entities share important clinical features, including a tendency towards rapid spread to lungs, bone, and bone marrow, and responsiveness to the same chemotherapeutic regimens and radiation therapy (RT). Because relapse rates are high in patients undergoing local therapy alone (80 to 90 percent), it is surmised that the majority have subclinical metastatic disease at the time of diagnosis, even in the absence of overt metastases. Intensive multiagent chemotherapy can eradicate these deposits, and is a critical component of therapy for both localized and advanced disease. (See <a href=\"#H1\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H26\"><span class=\"h2\">Localized disease</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>For patients with localized EFT, local and systemic therapy are both necessary to achieve cure. (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'General principles'</a> above and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-the-ewing-sarcoma-family-of-tumors#H4\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of the Ewing sarcoma family of tumors&quot;, section on 'Treatment for localized disease'</a>.)</p><p>Either surgery or RT can provide effective local control. Contemporary treatment guidelines emphasize surgical resection as the modality of choice if it is believed that the lesion can be resected with negative margins, without excessively morbidity, and with the expectation of a reasonable functional result. A major advantage of surgery is the lack of association with treatment-related sarcomas. For patients who lack a function-preserving surgical option because of tumor location or extent, and those who have clearly unresectable primary tumors following induction chemotherapy, we recommend RT (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=1\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1A</a>). (See <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'RT versus surgery'</a> above.)</p><p>Although the indications for adjuvant RT are not firmly established in patients undergoing surgery for localized EFT, we suggest adjuvant RT in the following circumstances (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>)&nbsp;(see <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'Adjuvant RT'</a> above):</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Bulky tumors in difficult sites (eg, the pelvis); in this setting, RT can be given either preoperatively or postoperatively, based upon institutional protocols and experience</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>If there is residual microscopic or gross disease after surgery, or inadequate surgical margins (ie, a marginal or intralesional resection as compared with a wide or radical excision)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients who are left with significant amounts of viable tumor in the resected specimen following neoadjuvant chemotherapy who have less than wide surgical margins</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Adjuvant hemithorax irradiation is indicated in patients with high-risk chest wall primary tumors (close or involved margins, initial pleural effusion, pleural infiltration, and intraoperative contamination of the pleural space)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H27\"><span class=\"h2\">Advanced disease</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Although prognosis is clearly worse than for localized disease, a subset of patients who present with overt metastatic disease can be cured, particularly if they have limited pulmonary metastases. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-the-ewing-sarcoma-family-of-tumors#H9\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of the Ewing sarcoma family of tumors&quot;, section on 'Treatment for metastatic disease'</a>.)</p><p>For patients with metastatic EFT, we suggest RT rather than surgery for treatment of the primary site in most patients (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=5\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2B</a>). Surgery could be reconsidered in selected patients if chemotherapy results in significant volume reduction, particularly if areas of small volume metastatic disease are also amenable to surgical resection. (See <a href=\"#H9\" class=\"local\">'RT for metastatic disease'</a> above.)</p><p>The role of whole lung irradiation after resection of pulmonary metastases is unclear. Nevertheless, because of the potential for reduced pulmonary relapse and improved event-free survival, and the low rate of pulmonary toxicity, we suggest bilateral low-dose lung irradiation (15 to 18 Gy) even if all lesions are resected or completely respond to chemotherapy (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>).
