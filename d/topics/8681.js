An overview of the various bariatric procedures and their complications and the role of endoscopic management of gastrointestinal complications of the most common bariatric surgical procedures are presented separately.

Before initiating a diet, most bariatric surgeons who obtain imaging following bariatric procedures that involve an anastomosis or stapling get an upper gastrointestinal series (UGI) series on postoperative day one. The advantage of this approach is that any leak, if present, can be addressed quickly. However, some surgeons only perform postoperative imaging selectively, based upon the patient's clinical progress [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/imaging-studies-after-bariatric-surgery/abstract/4-6\" class=\"abstract_t\">4-6</a>].</p><p>A systematic review evaluated the sensitivity and specificity of UGI from data obtained from 19 studies involving 10,139 patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/imaging-studies-after-bariatric-surgery/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. UGI had an overall sensitivity of 54 percent and a specificity of 100 percent for detecting anastomotic leak within two days of bariatric surgery. The threshold used to distinguish between positive and negative test results varied between institutions. Given the moderate sensitivity, the authors of this study suggested that treating marginal radiological evidence of leakage as presumptively positive maximizes the clinical utility of UGI. Although a majority of articles show that UGI series are better for identifying leak following bariatric surgery, a later study found better sensitivity and specificity with abdominal computed tomography (CT) compared with UGI (100 versus 95 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/imaging-studies-after-bariatric-surgery/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. Irrespective of imaging modality chosen, any clinical suspicion of leak warrants investigation.</p><p>When bariatric surgery patients present with complaints of heartburn, nausea or vomiting, abdominal pain, or weight loss failure, imaging studies should be obtained to ensure prompt diagnosis of infection, obstruction, ischemia, or mechanical or technical failures of an operation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/imaging-studies-after-bariatric-surgery/abstract/9,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,10</a>]. Radiologic examination of severely obese patients can be technically difficult because of patient size, resulting in suboptimal imaging [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/imaging-studies-after-bariatric-surgery/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>].</p><p>Radiologic evaluation and endoscopy are complementary studies, and endoscopy is often necessary for diagnostic certainty in bariatric patients with postoperative complications [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/imaging-studies-after-bariatric-surgery/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. Usually, imaging is performed first and then a decision about proceeding to endoscopy is made based upon the imaging findings and the patient&rsquo;s symptoms.

The gastric band is connected to an infusion port placed in the subcutaneous tissue. The band diameter and degree of gastric restriction can be adjusted via the port by withdrawing or injecting saline from the port.

Normally, the band points to the 2 o&rsquo;clock and 8 o&rsquo;clock position on x-ray (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F75937\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef75937 \">image 1</a>).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H796902994\"><span class=\"h2\">Abnormalities on imaging after LAGB</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Most of the complications of LAGB are due to a band that is too tight, slips into the wrong position, or erodes through the stomach wall. A tight band can lead to symptoms of heartburn, nausea, vomiting, or abdominal pain. Another cause of abdominal pain and complications after LAGB is disconnected port tubing, which can migrate and lead to obstruction or compression of other organs. Rarely, acute abdominal pain is caused by erosion and perforation following placement of a gastric band. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=late-complications-of-bariatric-surgical-operations#H40\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Late complications of bariatric surgical operations&quot;, section on 'Gastric banding'</a>.)</p><p>For patients who have complications after gastric banding, an abdominal x-ray with posteroanterior and oblique views and an esophagram with a water-soluble contrast (eg, Gastrografin) will provide the most useful diagnostic information [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/imaging-studies-after-bariatric-surgery/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. These tests can detect band slippage, gastric prolapse, pouch dilation, esophageal dilation or spasm, or a hiatal hernia. A computed tomography (CT) scan may also be needed if the patient&rsquo;s symptoms do not seem to be related to the gastric band, or if a diagnosis is not made with plain films or esophagram.</p><p>Endoscopy is also useful for detection of band erosion. Endoscopic findings after bariatric surgery are discussed elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=endoscopy-in-patients-who-have-undergone-bariatric-surgery#H8\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Endoscopy in patients who have undergone bariatric surgery&quot;, section on 'Laparoscopic adjustable gastric banding'</a>.)</p><p>The imaging findings for complications after LAGB are discussed below.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H168815156\"><span class=\"h3\">Band slippage and gastric prolapse</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Gastric prolapse is caused by band slippage and migration of the stomach above the band, which causes varying degrees of gastric obstruction associated with pain in the left upper quadrant, left chest, or back. Gastric prolapse can be identified on an abdominal x-ray by the axis of the band if it has shifted from the usual &quot;2 to 8 o'clock&quot; to a more horizontal &quot;10 to 4 o'clock&quot; position (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F56993\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef56993 \">image 2</a>). An esophagram will demonstrate the outline of the pouch with rugal folds above the band (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F81074\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef81074 \">figure 2</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F59420\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef59420 \">image 3</a>). </p><p>If a prolapse is identified and pain persists after the band is loosened, urgent surgical exploration to reposition, replace, or remove the band is indicated. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=late-complications-of-bariatric-surgical-operations#H44\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Late complications of bariatric surgical operations&quot;, section on 'Band slippage and gastric prolapse'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H20337807\"><span class=\"h3\">Pouch dilation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In contrast to gastric prolapse, which is associated with gastric obstruction, pouch dilation is enlargement of the gastric pouch without obstruction and without any change in the angle of the band [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/imaging-studies-after-bariatric-surgery/abstract/13,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,14</a>]. Pouch enlargement is caused by overinflation of the band or overeating. The diagnosis is made on UGI series (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F73273\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef73273 \">image 4</a>). </p><p>Pouch dilation will usually respond to nonoperative treatment with band deflation, a low calorie diet, and small portion sizes for four to six weeks. The band can then be reinflated incrementally. If this is unsuccessful and the pouch does not return to its original size, surgical removal or replacement is indicated [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/imaging-studies-after-bariatric-surgery/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H20337824\"><span class=\"h3\">Esophageal dilation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Esophageal dilation proximal to the band device or &quot;pseudoachalasia syndrome&quot; may develop when the band is too tight or with excessive amounts of food intake (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F52070\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef52070 \">image 5</a>). Typically, patients with esophageal dilation present with food and saliva intolerance, reflux, and epigastric discomfort. Patients can also experience substernal chest pain. An esophagram usually identifies both esophageal and pouch dilation (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F73273\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef73273 \">image 4</a>). </p><p>The treatment for a tight band is to deflate the band and allow the esophagus or stomach to regain its tone. If loosening the band does not resolve the symptoms, band removal is required.

Esophageal spasm can accompany esophagitis from reflux, when the band is too loose, or can reflect an underlying esophageal motility disorder [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/imaging-studies-after-bariatric-surgery/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. Radiographic findings are variable in patients suspected of having esophageal spasms and may demonstrate severe nonperistaltic contractions, which may produce striking abnormalities in the <a href=\"topic.htm?path=barium-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">barium</a> column, termed &quot;rosary bead&quot; or &quot;corkscrew&quot; esophagus (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F69821\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef69821 \">image 6</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RADIOL%2F93739\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef93739 \">image 7</a>). However, esophageal spasm is difficult to capture on imaging and the diagnosis should be based upon associated clinical and manometric findings. The treatment of esophageal spasm is discussed elsewhere.

In such cases, a radiograph will show the tubing separated from the port. The abdominal quadrant where the end of the tubing lies often corresponds with the patient&rsquo;s pain. The tubing can also migrate and cause obstructive symptoms by wrapping around intra-abdominal organs, or around the base of the mesentery (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F77520\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef77520 \">image 10</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F56114\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef56114 \">image 11</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F57587\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef57587 \">image 12</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/imaging-studies-after-bariatric-surgery/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>].</p><p>Disconnected or migrated tubing requires surgical repair.

In such cases, an acute abdominal series demonstrates free air and an upper GI series demonstrates leakage of contrast (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F70228\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef70228 \">image 13</a>).

In such cases, patients tend to eat softer foods that are easier to swallow but are more calorically dense. A limited UGI, which visualizes the esophagus and stomach but does not follow contrast into the small bowel, will show reflux of the contrast material into the esophagus and may show thickening of the esophageal folds, ulcerations, or strictures. However, radiography is not diagnostic because reflux can be provoked in normal patients as well. If esophageal reflux is suspected, endoscopy is generally indicated to confirm the diagnosis.

A RYGB procedure results in three &quot;limbs&quot;: the Roux limb, which is anastomosed to the stomach; the biliopancreatic (BP) limb, which is anastomosed to the Roux limb; and the common channel (CC), which continues to the terminal ileum and cecum [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/imaging-studies-after-bariatric-surgery/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].

This comparison allows fast and reliable identification of a pouch that is too large or too small. The gastric pouch can extend towards the spleen on an UGI series and may be misdiagnosed as a leak. It is important to ensure that this region of the pouch empties on subsequent views to make this determination.</p><p>Contrast medium in the jejunal limb should demonstrate normal mucosal folds and motility. The duodenum, the excluded stomach, and the distal anastomosis are difficult to visualize on the UGI series. It is not unusual for the Roux limb to be slightly dilated up to 3 cm post gastric bypass, presumably due to the division of the small bowel to create the Roux-en-Y. Narrowing of the gastrojejunostomy with delayed pouch emptying is usually a sign of normal postoperative edema [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/imaging-studies-after-bariatric-surgery/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>].</p><p>CT scan imaging after gastric bypass will identify the gastric pouch, the position of the Roux limb (antecolic antegastric, retrocolic antegastric, or retrocolic retrogastric), the size of the remnant stomach, and the position and size of the three limbs (Roux, BP, and CC) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F68770\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef68770 \">image 15</a>).
