Additionally, the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices recommends influenza vaccine administration for all children &ge;6 months [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/febrile-infant-younger-than-90-days-of-age-outpatient-evaluation/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. While vaccination for influenza does not directly impact the youngest infants, older children serve as the most effective vectors of disease transmission in the community. Consequently, the epidemiology of influenza in the youngest infants is likely affected by the vaccination of older children and adult family members.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3184308131\"><span class=\"h2\">Viral infection</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Surveillance for viral infection in the first year of life indicates that it occurs commonly in young infants and that the first infection is often asymptomatic [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/febrile-infant-younger-than-90-days-of-age-outpatient-evaluation/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Viral infection is also the most common cause of fever in young infants. Depending upon the specific pathogen and type of diagnostic testing, viral infections have been documented in up to 58 percent of young febrile infants while bacterial infections account for 10 to 15 percent of pathogens although molecular testing may reflect prior asymptomatic disease rather than the causative pathogen for some viruses [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/febrile-infant-younger-than-90-days-of-age-outpatient-evaluation/abstract/3-5\" class=\"abstract_t\">3-5</a>]. Based upon one study of over 4000 febrile young infants undergoing molecular respiratory virus testing, human rhinovirus is detected most frequently followed by respiratory syncytial virus, influenza, and parainfluenza [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/febrile-infant-younger-than-90-days-of-age-outpatient-evaluation/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. </p><p>Neonates with viral infection remain at high risk for concomitant invasive bacterial illness. Infants 29 to 90 days of age have a lower risk of invasive bacterial illness but still remain at significant risk for urinary tract infection.

Although not classically described in the literature of the early 1990s, the attention to community-acquired <em>Staphylococcus aureus</em> has made pustulosis a relevant disease entity to be considered in skin and soft tissue infections in neonates [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/febrile-infant-younger-than-90-days-of-age-outpatient-evaluation/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].</p><p>More recently, the focus on the specific type infection (eg, UTI, bacteremia, or meningitis) has replaced the general concept of SBI in terms of evaluation and management secondary to the overall decreased prevalence of bacterial infections in the febrile infant and the unique nature of risk attributed to the specific type of infection.

As an example, in an observational study of 98 infants younger than 90 days of age, patients with a temperature &ge;40&deg;C had a 29 percent absolute increase in the frequency of SBI (38 versus 9 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/febrile-infant-younger-than-90-days-of-age-outpatient-evaluation/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Rectal temperature &ge;38.6&deg;C (101.5&deg;F)</strong> &ndash; The risk for bacterial etiology appears to increase with increasing fever (historically defined in the literature for infants of &gt;38.0&deg;C or &gt;38.5&deg;C) despite a decrease in the incidence of invasive disease across all ages following the introduction of conjugate vaccines. (See <a href=\"#H876678777\" class=\"local\">'Etiology'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Although increasing temperatures may increase risk, thresholds merely represent cutoffs described in the literature for the purposes of research; true risk is a continuum.

As an example, in an observational cohort study that identified children 3 years of age or younger and included 50 immunized and 67 unimmunized infants 0 to 90 days of age, the rates of bacterial infection were significantly higher among unimmunized febrile young infants 0 to 90 days of age (7 percent unimmunized versus 0 percent, respectively). In addition, there were no cases of pneumococcal bacteremia in any of the infants who had received at least one dose of heptavalent pneumococcal vaccine or the 22 unimmunized infants younger than 28 days.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Prematurity (gestational age younger than 37 weeks)</strong> &ndash; Because of their immature immune protective mechanisms, premature infants are at a much higher risk for IBI. For example, premature infants have rates of sepsis that are approximately 10 to 12 times that of term infants, including late-onset sepsis. Thus, febrile young infants who are premature should be regarded as being at an increased risk for invasive bacterial infection.
