Meningitis happens when the lining that covers the brain and spinal cord (called the &quot;meninges&quot;) gets inflamed or infected. This can occur after a person has an infection in another part of the body. The germs can travel through the blood to the lining of the brain and spinal cord.</p><p>There are 2 main types of meningitis, depending on which germs are causing the infection. Viruses cause viral meningitis, and bacteria cause bacterial meningitis. Doctors sometimes use the term &quot;aseptic meningitis&quot; when talking about meningitis caused by a germ that does <strong>not</strong> show up in routine cultures. (Culture means a doctor takes a sample of your blood or spinal fluid, then studies it to see what grows.) This includes meningitis due to viruses as well as certain bacteria, for example, the bacteria that cause Lyme disease. It also includes meningitis from other causes, such as certain medicines or cancers.</p><p>It is important that doctors figure out what kind of meningitis a person has. That's because bacterial meningitis is a medical emergency. It can lead to brain problems or even death. Viral meningitis is serious, but not usually as serious as bacterial meningitis. People usually recover from viral meningitis within 1 to 2 weeks without any long-term problems.</p><p>Both viral and bacterial meningitis can have the same symptoms. So the only way a doctor can know for sure which type of meningitis someone has is to do tests in the hospital.</p><p>This article discusses viral meningitis.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10925624\"><span class=\"h1\">What are the symptoms of viral meningitis?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Common symptoms include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Fever</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Headache</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Stiff neck &ndash; This is most often seen in adults and children. Babies might not get a stiff neck.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Nausea or vomiting</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Having light bother a person's eyes</p><p/><p>Babies can also have other symptoms, including:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Not feeding well</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Being more sleepy or fussy than usual</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A bulging soft spot on the skull</p><p/><p>People can have other symptoms, too, depending on the virus that's causing the infection. These can include diarrhea, a runny nose, sore throat, muscle aches, cough, or a rash. A rash can also happen with bacterial meningitis.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10925639\"><span class=\"h1\">Should I see a doctor or nurse?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Yes. If you have a fever, headache, and stiff neck, go to the emergency room right away. If you think that your child has meningitis, bring him or her to the emergency room right away.</p><p>It's very important to go to the hospital if you think you or your child has meningitis. That's because the only way a doctor can make sure someone has viral meningitis &ndash; and not life-threatening bacterial meningitis &ndash; is to do tests in the hospital.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10925654\"><span class=\"h1\">Will I have tests?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Yes. Your doctor or nurse will learn about your symptoms and do an exam. He or she will do tests to find out if you have meningitis and which virus is causing it. The tests can include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Blood tests</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A lumbar puncture (sometimes called a &quot;spinal tap&quot;) &ndash; During this procedure, a doctor puts a thin needle into your lower back and removes a small amount of spinal fluid. Spinal fluid is the fluid that surrounds the brain and spinal cord. He or she will do lab tests on the spinal fluid.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A CT scan of the brain &ndash; This is an imaging test that creates pictures of the brain.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Other tests &ndash; For example, the doctor can use a cotton swab to collect a sample from the back of the throat. Then he or she can do lab tests on the sample.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10925670\"><span class=\"h1\">How is viral meningitis treated?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Treatment for viral meningitis usually includes:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Resting</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Drinking fluids or getting fluids into a vein through a tube called an &quot;IV&quot;</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Taking an over-the-counter medicine to treat a fever or headache</p><p/><p>Viral meningitis is <strong>not</strong> treated with antibiotics. This is because antibiotics treat bacterial infections, and not viral infections.</p><p>Your doctor might recommend other treatment, depending on the virus that's causing the infection. Some viruses can be treated with &quot;antiviral&quot; medicines.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10925685\"><span class=\"h1\">Can meningitis be spread from one person to another?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Yes. The viruses that cause meningitis can be spread from one person to another. But even if you catch the virus, it doesn't usually lead to meningitis.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10925702\"><span class=\"h1\">Can viral meningitis be prevented?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>To help lower the chance of getting viral meningitis, you can:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Make sure that you and your children get the vaccines your doctor recommends. Vaccines can prevent certain serious or deadly infections.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Wash your hands often, especially after you change a diaper or use the bathroom, and before you eat.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Avoid sharing cups or silverware, especially with people who are sick.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Avoid getting bitten by mosquitoes. Some mosquitoes carry viruses that can infect you and lead to meningitis.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10925717\"><span class=\"h1\">More on this topic</span></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=meningitis-in-children-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Meningitis in children (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=bacterial-meningitis-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Bacterial meningitis (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=fever-in-children-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Fever in children (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=headaches-in-adults-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Headaches in adults (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=vaccines-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Vaccines (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=vaccines-for-babies-and-children-age-0-to-6-years-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Vaccines for babies and children age 0 to 6 years (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=giving-your-child-over-the-counter-medicines-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Giving your child over-the-counter medicines (The Basics)</a></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=meningitis-in-children-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Meningitis in children (Beyond the Basics)</a></p></div><div id=\"reviewProcess\"><span>All topics are updated as new evidence becomes available and our <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/home/editorial-policy\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"policy policy_editorialpolicy\">peer review process</a> is complete.</span></div><div id=\"topicRetrievedDate\"><span class=\"emphasis\">This topic retrieved from UpToDate on: </span>Apr 02, 2018.</div><div id=\"disclaimer\">The content on the UpToDate website is not intended nor recommended as a substitute for medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.
