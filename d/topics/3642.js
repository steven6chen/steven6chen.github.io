A cleft lip is an opening or split in the upper lip. A cleft palate is an opening or split the roof of the mouth (called the palate). A baby can be born with one or both of these conditions.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H25333032\"><span class=\"h1\">What are the symptoms of cleft lip and cleft palate?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Some babies with a cleft lip have a small notch in their upper lip. Others have a larger opening or hole that goes all the way to the bottom of their nose (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F83213\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef83213 \">figure 1</a>).</p><p>A cleft palate can be in the front or back of the roof of the mouth, on one or both sides.</p><p>Babies with these problems can have trouble nursing or drinking from a bottle.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H25333047\"><span class=\"h1\">Is there a test for cleft lip and cleft palate?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In some cases, a cleft lip can be seen on an ultrasound, an imaging test doctors use to check on the baby during pregnancy. An ultrasound creates pictures of the baby inside the uterus.</p><p>It is more difficult to see a cleft palate on an ultrasound.</p><p>If an ultrasound shows that your baby has a cleft lip or palate, the person doing the ultrasound will check the baby for other birth defects. Your doctor or midwife might suggest a test called &quot;amniocentesis.&quot; During amniocentesis, a doctor puts a needle into the mother's uterus and removes some of the fluid that is around the baby. The fluid is then tested to check for problems with the baby's genes.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H25333062\"><span class=\"h1\">How are cleft lip and cleft palate treated?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Most of the time, surgery can fix a cleft lip and a cleft palate. For cleft lip, doctors usually do surgery in the first few months of life, or at least before the child turns 1 year old. For cleft palate, doctors should do surgery before the child is 18 months old. But the timing of the surgery is different for every child. And some children might need more than one surgery.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H25333077\"><span class=\"h1\">Will my child have problems as he or she grows up?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Your child might need other surgeries as he or she grows. Even after surgery, children with cleft lip or cleft palate might have other problems, including:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Missing, extra, or crooked teeth &ndash; Many children need braces after their permanent teeth grow in.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Trouble speaking &ndash; Some children need to work with a speech therapist to help them learn to speak clearly.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Ear infections and hearing loss &ndash; For children who get many ear infections, the doctor might suggest placing a small tube in the eardrum. These tubes help prevent ear infections and might help the child hear better.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H25333092\"><span class=\"h1\">Can cleft lip and cleft palate be prevented?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Maybe. Women might be more likely to give birth to a child with a cleft lip or cleft palate if they do certain things during pregnancy, including:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Take certain medicines such as:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Medicines used to treat seizures</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span><a href=\"topic.htm?path=methotrexate-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">Methotrexate</a>, which is used to treat cancer and other diseases</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Smoke cigarettes</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Drink alcohol</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Not get enough &quot;<a href=\"topic.htm?path=folic-acid-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">folic acid</a>,&quot; a type of vitamin</p><p/><p>Women who are pregnant or planning to get pregnant should take a &quot;prenatal&quot; multivitamin that has at least 400 micrograms of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=folic-acid-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">folic acid</a>.
