Compared with laparotomy, laparoscopy can reduce postoperative pain, result in shorter recovery time, allow smaller incisions, and reduce the postoperative stress response. Laparoscopy requires insufflation of intraperitoneal or extraperitoneal gas, usually carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>), to create space for visualization and surgical maneuvers.</p><p>Robotic surgery is usually performed laparoscopically and is commonly used for gynecologic and urologic surgery.</p><p>Anesthetic concerns for patients undergoing laparoscopic and robotic surgery differ from those for patients undergoing open abdominal surgery. They include the physiologic effects of the pneumoperitoneum, absorption of CO<sub>2</sub>, and positioning required for surgery. In addition, some laparoscopic procedures take longer than the open alternative.</p><p>This topic will discuss the anesthetic management of patients having laparoscopic and robotic abdominal surgery. Advantages and disadvantages of laparoscopy and robotic surgery, technical aspects of these techniques, and surgical complications are discussed separately.

CO<sub>2</sub> insufflation can be performed blindly using a Veress needle or by placement of a port under direct vision through a small subumbilical incision. The gas source is connected to the needle or port; intraabdominal pressure (IAP) is monitored as gas is insufflated, aiming for a pressure &le;15 mmHg to minimize physiologic effects. For laparoscopic prostatectomy, which is performed in steep Trendelenburg position, the European Association for Endoscopic Surgery recommends IAP below 12 mmHg [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anesthesia-for-laparoscopic-and-abdominal-robotic-surgery-in-adults/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p>After insufflation, a port is placed, and the laparoscope is inserted. Under direct intraabdominal vision, further instrument ports are placed. The surgeon uses a video monitor connected to the laparoscope to see intraabdominal contents and perform the procedure.</p><p>In some cases, laparoscopy is used to assist dissection, after which an incision is made to complete the procedure. In others, a larger port is placed to allow the surgeon to insert one hand to assist the procedure.</p><p>The most commonly used robotic system occupies a lot of space in the operating room, and consists of a surgeon&rsquo;s control console, a tower holding the optical system, and patient-side cart with robotic arms (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ANEST%2F104766\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef104766 \">figure 1</a>). For robotic surgery, once the pneumoperitoneum is created, multiple ports are placed for insertion of the camera and robotic arms, which are connected to the patient-side cart. The surgeon operates the camera and the robotic arms from the control console, remote from the patient, while an assistant is at the patient&rsquo;s side for suctioning, retraction, and passage of suture or sponges in and out of the abdomen.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H185172564\"><span class=\"h1\">PREOPERATIVE EVALUATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A medical history and anesthesia-directed physical examination should be performed for all patients who undergo anesthesia. In anticipation of laparoscopy, we focus the preoperative evaluation on those medical conditions that may affect the response to physiologic changes associated with laparoscopy and the surgical procedure. The laparoscopic approach is used for surgical procedures with a range of risks of perioperative cardiac and pulmonary adverse events and surgical complications. As examples, diagnostic laparoscopy may be a brief procedure with minimal tissue trauma, while laparoscopic radical hysterectomy requires extensive dissection, may take a number of hours, and can result in significant blood loss.</p><p>We believe that preoperative evaluation for laparoscopic procedures should be the same as it would be for the equivalent open procedure. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-of-preoperative-pulmonary-risk\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation of preoperative pulmonary risk&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-of-cardiac-risk-prior-to-noncardiac-surgery\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation of cardiac risk prior to noncardiac surgery&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10521848\"><span class=\"h1\">PHYSIOLOGIC EFFECTS OF LAPAROSCOPY</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10522071\"><span class=\"h2\">Cardiovascular changes</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The cardiovascular changes during laparoscopy are variable and dynamic (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ANEST%2F105517\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef105517 \">table 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anesthesia-for-laparoscopic-and-abdominal-robotic-surgery-in-adults/abstract/2-5\" class=\"abstract_t\">2-5</a>]. These effects are generally well tolerated by healthy patients. However, significant intraoperative cardiac dysfunction can occur in older patients and in those with cardiopulmonary disease (eg, congestive heart failure, pulmonary hypertension, valvular heart disease). Studies of hemodynamic events during laparoscopy in patients with significant cardiopulmonary disease have reported an increase in mean arterial pressure (MAP), systemic vascular resistance (SVR), and central venous pressure (CVP), with decreases in cardiac output (CO) and stroke volume (SV) during peritoneal insufflation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anesthesia-for-laparoscopic-and-abdominal-robotic-surgery-in-adults/abstract/6-10\" class=\"abstract_t\">6-10</a>]. Compared with healthy patients, those with cardiopulmonary disease may require more pharmacologic interventions and more intensive monitoring to respond to these changes.</p><p>Cardiovascular changes during laparoscopy relate to the increase in intraabdominal pressure (IAP) associated with carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>) insufflation, effects of positioning, and of absorption of CO<sub>2</sub>, as follows:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Effects of pneumoperitoneum </strong>&ndash; Pneumoperitoneum and the associated increase in IAP result in neuroendocrine and mechanical effects on cardiovascular physiology.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span><strong>Neuroendocrine effects</strong> &ndash; Increase in IAP results in catecholamine release and activation of the renin&ndash;angiotensin system with vasopressin release [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anesthesia-for-laparoscopic-and-abdominal-robotic-surgery-in-adults/abstract/11-13\" class=\"abstract_t\">11-13</a>]. This increases MAP in most patients and may contribute to increases in SVR and pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anesthesia-for-laparoscopic-and-abdominal-robotic-surgery-in-adults/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\">Vagal stimulation, from insertion of the Veress needle or peritoneal stretch with gas insufflation, can result in bradyarrhythmias. Bradycardia is common in this setting, while atrioventricular dissociation, nodal rhythm, and asystole have been reported [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anesthesia-for-laparoscopic-and-abdominal-robotic-surgery-in-adults/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span><strong>Mechanical effects</strong> &ndash; Mechanical aspects of laparoscopy are dynamic; the resulting cardiovascular effects depend on the patient&rsquo;s preexisting volume status, insufflation pressure, and position. Compression of arterial vasculature with pneumoperitoneum increases SVR and PVR, with variable effects on CO and blood pressure (BP) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anesthesia-for-laparoscopic-and-abdominal-robotic-surgery-in-adults/abstract/11-13\" class=\"abstract_t\">11-13</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\">Hypercarbia caused by CO<sub>2</sub> absorption may also increase SVR and PVR; in most cases, minute ventilation is increased to prevent hypercarbia, but the required increase in intrathoracic pressure may further increase SVR and PVR.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\">Cardiovascular effects tend to resolve quickly as pneumoperitoneum is maintained. A study of hemodynamic data in 38 patients who underwent laparoscopic cholecystectomy reported decreases in cardiac index, SV, and left ventricular (LV) end-diastolic volume after insufflation of CO<sub>2</sub> to 15 mmHg, with normalization of all values within 15 minutes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anesthesia-for-laparoscopic-and-abdominal-robotic-surgery-in-adults/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Effects of positioning</strong> &ndash; Laparoscopic surgery is often performed in head-up (eg, for cholecystectomy) or head-down (eg, pelvic surgery) positions to allow the intraabdominal organs to fall away from the surgical field. Extremes of position can affect cardiovascular function.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span><strong>Head up</strong> &ndash; The head-up position (ie, reverse Trendelenburg) leads to venous pooling, tends to reduce venous return to the heart [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anesthesia-for-laparoscopic-and-abdominal-robotic-surgery-in-adults/abstract/12,17\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,17</a>], and may result in hypotension, especially in patients who are hypovolemic.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span><strong>Head down</strong> &ndash; The-head down position (ie, Trendelenburg) position increases venous return and cardiac filling pressures. A study of the hemodynamic effects of laparoscopy included 16 patients who underwent laparoscopic radical prostatectomy with 12 mmHg intraabdominal pressure and a 45 degree Trendelenburg position [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anesthesia-for-laparoscopic-and-abdominal-robotic-surgery-in-adults/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. CVP, mean pulmonary artery pressure, and pulmonary capillary wedge pressure increased two- to threefold, and mean arterial BP (ABP) increased by 35 percent, without changes in CO, heart rate (HR), or SV. Cardiac filling pressures normalized immediately after surgery.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Effects of hypercarbia</strong> &ndash; Absorption of CO<sub>2</sub> during laparoscopy can have direct and indirect cardiovascular effects. The direct effects of hypercarbia and associated acidosis include decreased cardiac contractility, sensitization to arrhythmias, and systemic vasodilation. Indirect effects are the result of sympathetic stimulation, and include tachycardia and vasoconstriction, which may counteract vasodilation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anesthesia-for-laparoscopic-and-abdominal-robotic-surgery-in-adults/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>].

These changes can result from increased IAP with pneumoperitoneum and from absorption of CO<sub>2</sub>.</p><p>During laparoscopy, minute ventilation must be increased to compensate for absorption of CO<sub>2</sub>. Hyperventilation may be difficult for patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), asthma, and in morbidly obese patients, especially in Trendelenburg position. In patients with COPD and in older patients, end-tidal CO<sub>2</sub> (ETCO<sub>2</sub>) may not accurately reflect arterial partial pressure of CO<sub>2</sub>; in such patients, arterial blood gases may be required to monitor ventilation.</p><p>The absorption and elimination of CO<sub>2</sub> in the morbidly obese appears to be similar to nonobese patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anesthesia-for-laparoscopic-and-abdominal-robotic-surgery-in-adults/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. Arterial oxygenation decreases and alveolar&ndash;arterial oxygen gradient increases in obese anesthetized patients when placed in Trendelenburg position, though CO<sub>2</sub> insufflation tends to slightly reverse these effects [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anesthesia-for-laparoscopic-and-abdominal-robotic-surgery-in-adults/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>].</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Changes in pulmonary mechanics</strong> &ndash; Pneumoperitoneum causes cephalad displacement of the diaphragm and mediastinal structures, which reduces functional residual capacity (FRC) and pulmonary compliance, resulting in atelectasis and increased peak airway pressures. These effects are exacerbated with steep Trendelenburg positioning (eg, during pelvic surgery) and are reduced with reverse Trendelenburg positioning (eg, during cholecystectomy and gastric surgery). The changes in pulmonary compliance may be less with retroperitoneal insufflation (eg, during renal or adrenal procedures) compared with intraperitoneal insufflation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anesthesia-for-laparoscopic-and-abdominal-robotic-surgery-in-adults/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>CO</strong><strong><sub>2</sub></strong><strong> absorption</strong><sub> </sub>&ndash;<strong> </strong>CO<sub>2</sub> is highly soluble and is rapidly absorbed into the circulation during insufflation for laparoscopy. CO<sub>2</sub> absorption increases quickly and reaches a plateau at approximately 60 minutes of insufflation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anesthesia-for-laparoscopic-and-abdominal-robotic-surgery-in-adults/abstract/20-22\" class=\"abstract_t\">20-22</a>]. Ventilation must be increased to maintain normal end-tidal and arterial partial pressure of CO<sub>2 </sub>(<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ANEST%2F105217\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef105217 \">figure 2</a>). (See <a href=\"#H10521908\" class=\"local\">'Mechanical ventilation'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Surgical technique may influence the degree of CO<sub>2</sub> absorption. Multiple studies have found that subcutaneous emphysema, a possible complication of laparoscopy, is associated with increased absorption of CO<sub>2</sub> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anesthesia-for-laparoscopic-and-abdominal-robotic-surgery-in-adults/abstract/21-23\" class=\"abstract_t\">21-23</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H10521950\" class=\"local\">'Subcutaneous emphysema'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Subcutaneous emphysema may be more common during retroperitoneal insufflation of CO<sub>2</sub> compared with intraperitoneal insufflation, but it is not clear whether the retroperitoneal approach itself increases CO<sub>2</sub> absorption. Findings from studies that compared CO<sub>2</sub> absorption with these two techniques without subcutaneous emphysema have reported conflicting results [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anesthesia-for-laparoscopic-and-abdominal-robotic-surgery-in-adults/abstract/21-24\" class=\"abstract_t\">21-24</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong><span class=\"nowrap\">Ventilation/perfusion</span> matching</strong> &ndash; The reduction in FRC and atelectasis associated with laparoscopy may theoretically lead to shunting and <span class=\"nowrap\">ventilation/perfusion</span> mismatch; however, in healthy patients, these effects are minimal and well tolerated, even with steep Trendelenburg positioning [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anesthesia-for-laparoscopic-and-abdominal-robotic-surgery-in-adults/abstract/4,5,25\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,5,25</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Endotracheal tube</strong> &ndash;<strong> </strong>Pneumoperitoneum and Trendelenburg positioning may cause cephalad movement of the carina, which can result in mainstem endobronchial migration of the endotracheal tube, hypoxia, and high inspiratory pressure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anesthesia-for-laparoscopic-and-abdominal-robotic-surgery-in-adults/abstract/26,27\" class=\"abstract_t\">26,27</a>].

Thus, the overall effects on splanchnic circulation are not clinically significant [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anesthesia-for-laparoscopic-and-abdominal-robotic-surgery-in-adults/abstract/29,30\" class=\"abstract_t\">29,30</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Renal blood flow</strong> &ndash; The creation of a pneumoperitoneum results in reduction in renal perfusion and urine output associated with renal parenchymal compression, reduced renal vein flow, and increased levels of vasopressin [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anesthesia-for-laparoscopic-and-abdominal-robotic-surgery-in-adults/abstract/31-33\" class=\"abstract_t\">31-33</a>]. When IAP is kept under 15 mmHg, renal function and urine output generally normalize soon after pneumoperitoneum deflation, without histologic evidence of pathologic changes.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">The effects of laparoscopy on renal function for patients with preexisting renal disease have not been studied. In most cases, we believe that the benefits of a minimally invasive surgical approach outweigh theoretical concerns about the effect of increased intraabdominal pressure on renal function.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Cerebral blood flow</strong> &ndash; Increased intraabdominal and intrathoracic pressures, hypercarbia, and Trendelenburg positioning can all increase cerebral blood flow (CBF) and intracranial pressures (ICP) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anesthesia-for-laparoscopic-and-abdominal-robotic-surgery-in-adults/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>]. In healthy patients undergoing prolonged pneumoperitoneum and steep Trendelenburg position, cerebral oxygenation and cerebral perfusion remain within safe limits [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anesthesia-for-laparoscopic-and-abdominal-robotic-surgery-in-adults/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>]. In patients with intracranial mass lesions or significant cerebrovascular disorders (eg, carotid atherosclerosis and cerebral aneurysm), the increase in ICP may have clinical consequences.

Further monitoring (eg, continuous intraarterial pressure) should be added as required by the patient&rsquo;s medical condition, the expected blood loss, and the duration of surgery.</p><p>All patients require placement of at least one venous catheter for anesthesia. The need for additional or high-capacity venous access should be dictated by the expected blood loss.</p><p>Many robotic procedures and some laparoscopic procedures are performed with the patient&rsquo;s arms tucked at the sides, limiting access for blood sampling, placement of an arterial catheter, or additional venous access during the procedure.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10521884\"><span class=\"h2\">Induction of anesthesia</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A variety of medications and techniques can be used for induction of anesthesia and are chosen based on patient factors. For most adults, intravenous (IV) induction is performed. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=general-anesthesia-induction\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;General anesthesia: Induction&quot;</a>.)</p><p>After induction, the eyes should be closed and covered (ie, with tape or adhesive transparent dressing) to avoid corneal damage.

A cuffed endotracheal tube allows the use of positive end expiratory pressure (PEEP) and the high peak airway pressures that may be required during pneumoperitoneum, especially with Trendelenburg positioning.</p><p>SGAs are commonly used for airway management for anesthesia and can be used with positive pressure ventilation. The use of SGAs for laparoscopy is controversial. These devices do not fully protect against aspiration of stomach contents and are ordinarily used with lower peak inspiratory pressures. However, there are a number of studies and case reports describing the safe use of second-generation SGAs for laparoscopic procedures [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anesthesia-for-laparoscopic-and-abdominal-robotic-surgery-in-adults/abstract/43-46\" class=\"abstract_t\">43-46</a>]. Second-generation SGAs allow the use of higher airway pressure without leak and have esophageal vents to minimize the chance of aspiration.

In addition, any of the positions used for open procedures may be required (ie, lithotomy, lateral decubitus, operating room [OR] table flexion or rotation). The arms are often tucked at the patient&rsquo;s sides for laparoscopic and robotic surgery. As for all longer surgical procedures, a goal for positioning and padding is the prevention of injuries to peripheral nerves and bony prominences. Pressure points should be padded, as should the plastic connectors on IV tubing and monitoring devices. (See <a href=\"#H10521980\" class=\"local\">'Complications related to positioning'</a> below.)</p><p>Positioning devices are often used to avoid having the patient slide on the operating table with steep Trendelenburg or reverse Trendelenburg positioning. A foot support attached to the end of the operating table is used for laparoscopic cholecystectomy and other procedures that require reverse Trendelenburg positioning.</p><p>Nonslip padding, cross-body taping, and padded shoulder supports are options for steep Trendelenburg positioning. We use nonslip padding with cross-body taping (ie, tape attached to the operating table from over the shoulder to near the opposite hip). We test for sliding with maximal Trendelenburg positioning prior to surgical prep and drape and confirm that taping does not restrict chest excursion or affect ventilation.</p><p>For robotic surgery, once the robotic device is docked with the arms connected to the instruments, the position of the operating table <strong>must not</strong> be changed.

The speed of reversal with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=neostigmine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">neostigmine</a> depends on the degree of block; if deep block is maintained until the end of the procedure, reversal may not be complete after the brief wound closure of most laparoscopic procedures, and emergence and extubation may be delayed. Where <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sugammadex-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">sugammadex</a> is available, even deep block can be reversed quickly. As with any general anesthetic, reversal of NMBAs must be confirmed objectively prior to tracheal extubation, preferably with a quantitative train-of-four monitor.

Therefore, dynamic indicators such as stroke volume (SV) or systolic pressure variation are preferred. Optimization of dynamic indicators can be achieved by administration of small fluid boluses as necessary. Use of invasive or noninvasive monitors for goal-directed therapy in laparoscopic procedures remains controversial. The cardiopulmonary changes resulting from intraabdominal CO<sub>2</sub> insufflation interfere with interpretation of the dynamic variables (eg, SV variation, pulse pressure variation, systolic pressure variation).

In rare cases, gas can track into the thorax and mediastinum, thereby resulting in capnothorax, capnomediastinum, and capnopericardium [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anesthesia-for-laparoscopic-and-abdominal-robotic-surgery-in-adults/abstract/91\" class=\"abstract_t\">91</a>] (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ANEST%2F105519\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef105519 \">table 6</a>).

When hypercarbia occurs despite hyperventilation, the patient should be examined for signs of subcutaneous gas over the abdomen, chest, and neck. If crepitus or swelling is found, the surgeon should be notified; readjustment of ports, reduction of insufflation pressure, or conversion to open surgery may be required.</p><p>In most cases, subcutaneous emphysema resolves after the abdomen is deflated, and no specific intervention is required. When crepitus or swelling occurs in the head, neck, or upper chest, the potential for airway compromise after extubation is increased, especially for patients who may be edematous after prolonged procedures in Trendelenburg position. In most cases, subcutaneous CO<sub>2</sub> is superficial and does not compromise the airway lumen. When external swelling is severe, options include the following:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Laryngoscopy to assess airway edema while the patient is anesthetized.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Extubation over a tube changer.

Healthy patients are able to increase ventilation to eliminate CO<sub>2</sub>, but those with chronic lung disease or with opioid-induced respiratory depression can remain hypercarbic and acidotic early in the postoperative period. Somnolence, hypertension, and tachycardia may occur.</p><p>For symptomatic patients with subcutaneous emphysema of the head and neck region, a postoperative chest radiograph should be performed to rule out capnothorax. Patients with significant subcutaneous emphysema should be observed in the post-anesthesia care unit (PACU) for several hours, until swelling begins to subside and vital signs are normal.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10521956\"><span class=\"h3\">Capnothorax</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Capnothorax, although rare, can be potentially life-threatening [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anesthesia-for-laparoscopic-and-abdominal-robotic-surgery-in-adults/abstract/85,94\" class=\"abstract_t\">85,94</a>]. Causes of capnothorax are presented in a table (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ANEST%2F105519\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef105519 \">table 6</a>). Capnothorax should be suspected in the setting of an unexplained increase in airway pressure, hypoxemia, and hypercapnia, especially during Nissen fundoplication. Other signs suggestive of capnothorax include subcutaneous emphysema of the head and neck, inequality in chest expansion, reduced air entry, and a bulging diaphragm (visualized by directing the videoscope towards the diaphragm) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anesthesia-for-laparoscopic-and-abdominal-robotic-surgery-in-adults/abstract/95\" class=\"abstract_t\">95</a>]. If necessary, a chest radiograph or transthoracic ultrasound can confirm the diagnosis of capno- or pneumothorax [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anesthesia-for-laparoscopic-and-abdominal-robotic-surgery-in-adults/abstract/96\" class=\"abstract_t\">96</a>].</p><p>In this setting, treatment depends on the patient&rsquo;s hemodynamic and respiratory status and the stage of the surgery. If stable, reduction of insufflation pressure, hyperventilation, and increase in PEEP may be sufficient; CO<sub>2</sub> is resorbed quickly after even large capnothorax. In one reported case of near total capnothorax during Nissen fundoplication, the gas resorbed within one hour postoperatively, with no specific treatment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anesthesia-for-laparoscopic-and-abdominal-robotic-surgery-in-adults/abstract/95\" class=\"abstract_t\">95</a>].</p><p>However, hemodynamic compromise can occur, requiring placement of an intrathoracic needle or a chest tube for decompression and to allow completion of surgery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anesthesia-for-laparoscopic-and-abdominal-robotic-surgery-in-adults/abstract/97-100\" class=\"abstract_t\">97-100</a>]. If tension capnothorax persists despite these measures, conversion to open surgery may be required.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10521962\"><span class=\"h3\">Capnomediastinum and capnopericardium</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Capnomediastinum and capnopericardium, although rare, can be associated with significant hemodynamic compromise. Risk factors for these complications are similar to the risk factors for capnothorax. The diagnosis is made by chest radiograph (ie, air is visible in the mediastinum or pericardium). Management depends on the degree of hemodynamic compromise. In most patients, deflation of the pneumoperitoneum and close observation is adequate, while others might require supportive therapy along with hyperventilation.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10521968\"><span class=\"h3\">Gas embolism</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Venous gas embolism is extremely common during laparoscopy, though clinically significant emboli are rare. Studies using transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) during laparoscopic surgery have reported an incidence of subclinical gas embolism between 17 and 100 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anesthesia-for-laparoscopic-and-abdominal-robotic-surgery-in-adults/abstract/101-104\" class=\"abstract_t\">101-104</a>].</p><p>In this setting, gas embolism can occur via two mechanisms. Rarely, direct venous injection of CO<sub>2</sub> with the Veress needle can result in rapid, high-volume CO<sub>2</sub> embolism at the time of abdominal insufflation. Alternatively, CO<sub>2</sub> entrainment is possible if a vein is severed or disrupted during surgery, allowing the gas under pressure access to the circulation.</p><p>Signs of gas embolism include unexplained hypotension, abrupt reduction of ETCO<sub>2</sub>, hypoxemia, and arrhythmias. The electrocardiogram (ECG) may show right heart strain with a widened QRS complex. Paradoxical embolism through a patent foramen ovale (PFO) or atrial septal defect (ASD) can occur, with cerebral or coronary ischemia.</p><p>If gas embolism is suspected, the abdomen should be deflated to reduce CO<sub>2</sub> entrainment, and ventilation should be increased to reduce the size of CO<sub>2</sub> bubbles, though hyperventilation may worsen hypotension. Since gas embolism results from a vascular injury, hemorrhage is possible when the intraabdominal pressure is reduced. Therefore, re-insufflation or open surgery may be required to stop hemorrhage if hemodynamic instability persists.</p><p>Treatment is otherwise supportive, with fluid and vasopressor administration and, if necessary, cardiopulmonary resuscitation. The left-lateral, head-down position may allow the gas bubble to float to the apex of the right heart, away from the pulmonary artery.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10521974\"><span class=\"h2\">Complications from surgical instrumentation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Complications of surgical instrumentation can occur during abdominal access or during the surgical procedure. The complications of most concern to the anesthesiologist include vascular and abdominal organ injury, both of which can result in significant hemorrhage.</p><p>Up to half of serious surgical complications occur during placement of the Veress needle or an access port [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anesthesia-for-laparoscopic-and-abdominal-robotic-surgery-in-adults/abstract/105\" class=\"abstract_t\">105</a>]. Therefore, significant injury and major hemorrhage can occur even during relatively low-risk procedures (eg, diagnostic laparoscopy, laparoscopic appendectomy). In this setting, surgical access to a bleeding vessel or organ may take time; BP should be supported with IV fluid and vasopressor administration, as necessary.</p><p>As with open surgical procedures, injury to intraabdominal structures can occur during dissection. Bleeding may be less obvious during laparoscopy than it is during open procedures. The view of the surgical field is limited, and blood can pool away from the surgical field when patients are in head-up or head-down position. Signs of hypovolemia (ie, hypotension, tachycardia) may suggest occult bleeding and should be brought to the surgeon&rsquo;s attention.</p><p>The incidence, risk factors, and technical aspects of surgical complications are discussed in more detail separately.

Pressure points, plastic tubing connectors, monitoring cables, and leg supports for lithotomy positioning should all be padded. With steep Trendelenburg positioning, the arms should be positioned without caudad pull on the shoulders in order to reduce the chance of brachial plexus stretch injury.</p><p>Shoulder braces may be used to prevent sliding during Trendelenburg positioning; their use has been associated with brachial plexus injury in this setting, though the incidence is unknown [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anesthesia-for-laparoscopic-and-abdominal-robotic-surgery-in-adults/abstract/108\" class=\"abstract_t\">108</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10521986\"><span class=\"h1\">SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The laparoscopic approach has become the standard of care for many surgical procedures. Robotic surgery is typically performed laparoscopically; anesthetic concerns for conventional laparoscopy and robotic surgery are similar.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Laparoscopy requires insufflation of CO<sub>2</sub> to create space for visualization and surgical maneuvers. The associated increase in intraabdominal pressure (IAP), along with absorption of CO<sub>2</sub> and effects of surgical positioning, result in neuroendocrine and mechanical changes that affect cardiopulmonary function. (See <a href=\"#H10521848\" class=\"local\">'Physiologic effects of laparoscopy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Cardiopulmonary physiologic changes include the following:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Cardiovascular changes &ndash; Increased systemic vascular resistance (SVR), arterial blood pressure (ABP), and cardiac filling pressures. (See <a href=\"#H10522071\" class=\"local\">'Cardiovascular changes'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Pulmonary changes &ndash; Increased intrathoracic pressure, reduced functional residual capacity (FRC), and increased airway pressures. (See <a href=\"#H255926960\" class=\"local\">'Pulmonary changes'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We perform general anesthesia with endotracheal intubation for laparoscopy, though others have used regional anesthesia safely for short laparoscopic procedures. (See <a href=\"#H185172803\" class=\"local\">'Choice of anesthetic'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>When indicated, we administer <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nitrous-oxide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">nitrous oxide</a> (N<sub>2</sub>O) as part of a balanced general anesthetic, along with prophylaxis for postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV). (See <a href=\"#H512850405\" class=\"local\">'Use of nitrous oxide'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For laparoscopy, we administer neuromuscular blocking agents (NMBAs) based on clinical need, aiming for the least degree of block necessary for the clinical situation. For robotic surgery, we maintain deep neuromuscular blockade (ie, one twitch with train-of-four peripheral nerve stimulator) until the robotic device is undocked. (See <a href=\"#H10521896\" class=\"local\">'Neuromuscular blockade'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We ventilate with a fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO<sub>2</sub>) of 0.5, a starting tidal volume of 6 to 8 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/kg</span> ideal body weight, with positive end expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 5 to 10 cmH<sub>2</sub>O, and at a respiratory rate of 8 <span class=\"nowrap\">breaths/minute,</span> adjusted to maintain end tidal CO<sub>2</sub> (ETCO<sub>2</sub>) at approximately 40 mmHg and oxygen saturation (SaO<sub>2</sub>) &gt;90 percent. We modify ventilation during laparoscopy as follows:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>For peak pressures over 50 mmHg, we ventilate with pressure control with volume guarantee. (See <a href=\"#H10521908\" class=\"local\">'Mechanical ventilation'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>For hypoxia (ie, SaO<sub>2</sub> &lt;90 percent), we increase the FiO<sub>2</sub>,<sub> </sub>auscultate bilaterally for breath sounds, and<sub> </sub>perform a recruitment maneuver (maintain peak airway pressures at 30 cmH<sub>2</sub>O for 20 to 30 seconds if ABPs permit); if oxygenation improves, we increase PEEP values and perform periodic recruitment maneuvers (eg, every 30 minutes). (See <a href=\"#H10521944\" class=\"local\">'Pulmonary complications'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>If hypoxemia <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> high peak airway pressures persist, for patients in Trendelenburg position, we reduce the degree of tilt <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> reduce the insufflation pressure (eg, from 15 to 12 mmHg).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>For hypercarbia (ie, ETCO<sub>2 </sub>&gt;50 mmHg) despite hyperventilation, we examine for signs of subcutaneous emphysema. (See <a href=\"#H10521950\" class=\"local\">'Subcutaneous emphysema'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>If hypercarbia <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> hypoxia persist, we discuss conversion to open surgery.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Laparoscopic surgery results in less pain than the corresponding open procedure. We follow a multimodal approach to postoperative pain control, including <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acetaminophen-paracetamol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">acetaminophen</a>, nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs, and <span class=\"nowrap\">local/regional</span> analgesia, with the addition of opioid medication only as necessary. (See <a href=\"#H10521926\" class=\"local\">'Plan for postoperative pain management'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We suggest prophylaxis for PONV for all patients who undergo laparoscopy (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). We use the following approach (see <a href=\"#H10521920\" class=\"local\">'Nausea and vomiting prophylaxis'</a> above):</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>All patients &ndash; We administer <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dexamethasone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">dexamethasone</a> (4 to 8 mg IV after induction) and 5-HT<sub>3</sub> antagonists (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ondansetron-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ondansetron</a> 4 mg at the end of surgical procedure).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>High-risk patients &ndash; For patients at very high risk of PONV (eg, history of motion sickness, history of previous PONV, high opioid requirements for pain relief), we administer additional antiemetic therapy with preoperative transdermal <a href=\"topic.htm?path=scopolamine-hyoscine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">scopolamine</a> (1.5 mg transdermal patch) or a neurokinin<sub>1</sub> (NK<sub>1</sub>) antagonist (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=aprepitant-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Aprepitant</a> 80 mg orally). In addition, we use total intravenous anesthesia (TIVA) with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=propofol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">propofol</a>.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Rescue therapy &ndash; For rescue therapy in the immediate postoperative period, we administer low-dose <a href=\"topic.htm?path=promethazine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">promethazine</a> (6.25 mg IV, slowly) or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dimenhydrinate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">dimenhydrinate</a> (1 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> IV).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Rare but significant complications can occur during laparoscopy, including traumatic vascular and organ injury, CO<sub>2</sub> embolism, capnothorax, and capnomediastinum.
