One lung ventilation (OLV) refers to mechanical separation of the two lungs to allow ventilation of only one lung, while the other lung is compressed by the surgeon or allowed to passively deflate. OLV is a standard approach to facilitate surgical exposure for pulmonary and other thoracic surgeries, or may be used to isolate a pathologic from a healthy lung to prevent soiling or to allow differential ventilation.</p><p>This topic will discuss the general principles and physiology of OLV, its management, and complications.

During normal ventilation, ventilation and perfusion are well matched anatomically, because dependent portions of the lungs receive both greater blood flow (a result of gravity) and greater ventilation (from gravitational effects on lung compliance). The initiation of OLV stops all ventilation to one lung, which would create a 50 percent right-to-left shunt and relative hypoxemia if perfusion were unchanged. However, the actual shunt fraction is usually only 20 to 30 percent for the following reasons [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/one-lung-ventilation-general-principles/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Surgical manipulation of the atelectatic lung obstructs vascular flow to the non-ventilated lung.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Lateral positioning of the patient leads to a gravitational increase in perfusion to the dependent, ventilated lung.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction (HPV) modulates the blood flow to hypoxic regions of the lungs.</p><p/><p>HPV reduces shunt flow through the nonventilated lung by 40 to 50 percent during OLV, moderating the degree of hypoxemia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/one-lung-ventilation-general-principles/abstract/2,3\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,3</a>]. Alveolar hypoxia triggers the pulmonary vessels to constrict, directing blood away from <span class=\"nowrap\">poorly/nonventilated</span> areas to better ventilated segments, thereby improving <span class=\"nowrap\">ventilation/perfusion</span> matching. Clinically, HPV is proportional to the degree of local hypoxia, and is triggered primarily in response to an alveolar oxygen partial pressure (PaO<sub>2</sub>) less than 100 mmHg [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/one-lung-ventilation-general-principles/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. The onset of HPV is two-phase with an initial rapid onset phase (minutes) and a delayed phase (hours). When oxygenation and ventilation is reestablished, the attenuation of HPV follows a reverse two-phase pattern and may not completely return to normal for several hours [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/one-lung-ventilation-general-principles/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. This is an important consideration in the case of bilateral sequential thoracic procedures, such as bilateral wedge resections for lung metastases, in which patients tend to desaturate more during the OLV of the second lung.</p><p>A number of anesthetic factors may influence the extent of HPV, some of which may be controlled by the management of the anesthetic.</p><p>HPV is potentiated (causing less shunt, improving oxygenation) by [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/one-lung-ventilation-general-principles/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Metabolic and respiratory acidosis</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Hypercapnia</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Mild decreased mixed venous oxygenation</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Hyperthermia</p><p/><p>HPV is decreased (causing increased shunt, worsening oxygenation) by:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Metabolic and respiratory alkalosis</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Hypocapnia</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Hypothermia</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Increased left atrial pressure</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Administration of a volatile inhalation anesthetic at a dose &gt;1 minimum alveolar concentration (MAC)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Hemodilution</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H975116067\"><span class=\"h1\">IMPROVING DEFLATION OF THE NONVENTILATED LUNG</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>After placement of a lung isolation device to achieve OLV, expedited deflation of the nonventilated lung improves surgical access.
