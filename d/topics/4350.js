However, there is no consensus on how to accurately evaluate children for insulin resistance. In research settings the standard technique is the hyperinsulinemic euglycemic clamp, but this technique is too invasive for clinical purposes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/comorbidities-and-complications-of-obesity-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>].</p><p>Insulin resistance is a state in which a given concentration of insulin is associated with subnormal glucose response [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/comorbidities-and-complications-of-obesity-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. A number of surrogate measures have been described, including the homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/comorbidities-and-complications-of-obesity-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>], the fasting glucose-to-insulin ratio (FGIR) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/comorbidities-and-complications-of-obesity-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/25-27\" class=\"abstract_t\">25-27</a>], and the quantitative insulin sensitivity check index (QUICKI) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F71901\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef71901 \">table 2</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/comorbidities-and-complications-of-obesity-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>].

In the study described above, 4 percent of adolescents with BMI &ge;95<sup>th</sup> percentile for age and sex had asymptomatic T2DM [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/comorbidities-and-complications-of-obesity-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. Early diagnosis is imperative because aggressive treatment can slow the development of complications including progressive neuropathy, retinopathy, nephropathy, and atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/comorbidities-and-complications-of-obesity-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>]. Moreover, individuals who present with T2DM during adolescence appear to have more rapid progression of diabetes-related complications as compared with those who present later in life. As an example, among adolescent patients with newly diagnosed T2DM, a large percentage had comorbidities (13.0 percent had microalbuminuria, 80.5 percent had dyslipidemia, and 13.6 percent had hypertension) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/comorbidities-and-complications-of-obesity-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>].</p><p>A large study of young men in Israel showed an association between BMI during adolescence and T2DM during adulthood, as expected [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/comorbidities-and-complications-of-obesity-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>]. Of note, this association was seen even within the range of BMI that is considered normal. Interestingly, the association disappeared after adjusting for BMI during adulthood, suggesting that T2DM is primarily associated with obesity at or near the time of diagnosis, rather than the effects of chronic obesity since childhood. Similarly, a large longitudinal study found that individuals who were overweight or obese during childhood but who were not obese as adults had similar risk for T2DM as individuals who were never obese [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/comorbidities-and-complications-of-obesity-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>]. By contrast, individuals with persistent obesity from childhood through adulthood had a significantly increased risk of T2DM in adulthood (RR 5.4; 95% CI 3.4-8.5). </p><p>T2DM is diagnosed based on marked abnormalities of FPG, A1C, or OGTT, as outlined in the table (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F61853\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef61853 \">table 3</a>).

Clustering of cardiovascular risks also occurs in children and adolescents, particularly those who are overweight or obese [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/comorbidities-and-complications-of-obesity-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/42,43\" class=\"abstract_t\">42,43</a>].

However, because puberty is associated with changes in several of the traits that characterize metabolic syndrome, there is considerable instability to the diagnosis. In one study, about half of the adolescents initially classified as having metabolic syndrome lost the diagnosis during a three-year observation period, while others acquired the diagnosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/comorbidities-and-complications-of-obesity-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/47\" class=\"abstract_t\">47</a>]. The long-term implications of the metabolic syndrome in children and adolescents are unknown. As a result, screening and treatment should be focused on the individual cardiometabolic risk factors (obesity, dysglycemia, dyslipidemia and hypertension), while recognizing that these are often clustered together [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/comorbidities-and-complications-of-obesity-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/43\" class=\"abstract_t\">43</a>]. </p><p>Several different schemes have been used to define the metabolic syndrome in adolescents (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F66120\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef66120 \">table 4</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/comorbidities-and-complications-of-obesity-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/48,49\" class=\"abstract_t\">48,49</a>].

The prevalence depends upon the population (ie, referral, community, ethnic group) and the definition of NAFLD used in the study (eg, height of aminotransferase elevation <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> ultrasonographic findings), as illustrated by the following reports:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In an autopsy study of 742 children and adolescents, the prevalence of fatty liver was 9.6 percent overall, and 38 percent in obese children [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/comorbidities-and-complications-of-obesity-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/105\" class=\"abstract_t\">105</a>]. Histologic evidence of steatohepatitis was seen in 23 percent of the subjects with fatty liver, or 3 percent of the population overall. Of note, fatty liver was strongly associated with race, independent of obesity: Hispanic youths had a fivefold increase in risk for fatty liver as compared with black youths, after adjustment for BMI.

However, they may have right upper quadrant pain, hepatomegaly [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/comorbidities-and-complications-of-obesity-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/108,109\" class=\"abstract_t\">108,109</a>], or nonspecific symptoms such as abdominal discomfort, weakness, fatigue or malaise. They rarely have signs of liver disease: palmar erythema, spider angiomata, muscular wasting, jaundice, or encephalopathy. Laboratory abnormalities include elevations in liver transaminases (alanine aminotransferase [ALT], and aspartate aminotransferase [AST]), alkaline phosphatase, and gamma glutamyl transpeptidase (GGT) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/comorbidities-and-complications-of-obesity-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/92,95,110-112\" class=\"abstract_t\">92,95,110-112</a>]. These abnormalities resolve with weight loss [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/comorbidities-and-complications-of-obesity-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/110,113\" class=\"abstract_t\">110,113</a>].</p><p>It is important to note that liver transaminases have only moderate sensitivity for detecting clinically significant NAFLD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/comorbidities-and-complications-of-obesity-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/104,114\" class=\"abstract_t\">104,114</a>]. As an example, in a large study of children and adolescents with suspected NAFLD who underwent liver biopsy, fibrosis was seen in 12 percent of those with normal ALT and in 54 percent on those with mildly elevated ALT (defined as ALT 26 to 50 <span class=\"nowrap\">U/L</span> in boys and 23 to 44 <span class=\"nowrap\">U/L</span> in girls) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/comorbidities-and-complications-of-obesity-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/115\" class=\"abstract_t\">115</a>]. Advanced fibrosis (bridging fibrosis or cirrhosis) was seen in none of the children with normal ALT, 9 percent of those with mildly elevated ALT and 15 percent of those with significantly elevated ALT (defined as ALT &ge;50 <span class=\"nowrap\">U/L</span> in boys, and &ge;44 <span class=\"nowrap\">U/L</span> in girls). Thus, biochemical tests are only moderately helpful in predicting the presence or severity of NAFLD. When making decisions about whether or when to proceed to liver biopsy, the biochemical tests should be interpreted in the context of other risk factors that predict severity of NAFLD, which include degree of obesity, clinical symptoms and signs of insulin resistance (eg, acanthosis nigricans), ethnicity (eg, Hispanic), and obstructive sleep apnea [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/comorbidities-and-complications-of-obesity-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/116\" class=\"abstract_t\">116</a>]. Moreover, the upper limit of normal for ALT should be around 26 for boys, and 22 for girls, as determined from healthy lean children in the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/comorbidities-and-complications-of-obesity-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/117\" class=\"abstract_t\">117</a>]. These values are substantially lower than the upper limits reported in most pediatric hospital laboratories. &#160;</p><p>Imaging may confirm the presence of fatty liver, indicated by increased echogenicity on ultrasonography [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/comorbidities-and-complications-of-obesity-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/110,118,119\" class=\"abstract_t\">110,118,119</a>]. Advanced techniques for magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) provide a more accurate measure of steatosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/comorbidities-and-complications-of-obesity-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/104,120\" class=\"abstract_t\">104,120</a>]. However, the severity of hepatic steatosis does not correlate with clinical features, the degree of elevation of liver transaminases, or inflammatory features on histology (steatohepatitis) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/comorbidities-and-complications-of-obesity-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/109,119,121,122\" class=\"abstract_t\">109,119,121,122</a>]. Because of low sensitivity and specificity for steatohepatitis, the clinical utility of ultrasonography or MRI for the diagnosis of fatty liver disease is questionable [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/comorbidities-and-complications-of-obesity-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/123,124\" class=\"abstract_t\">123,124</a>]. However, we and many other providers use imaging to confirm the presence of fatty liver, and to look for features that demand a more intensive evaluation. As examples, the presence of splenomegaly or liver nodularity suggest more advanced liver disease, and call for a thorough evaluation, including liver biopsy. Newer imaging methods such as elastography (which measures liver stiffness) show some promise in distinguishing patients with fibrosis from those with simple steatosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/comorbidities-and-complications-of-obesity-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/125,126\" class=\"abstract_t\">125,126</a>]. However, the approach is not widely available and has not been extensively studied in NAFLD. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epidemiology-clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-nonalcoholic-fatty-liver-disease-in-adults#H19331226\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Epidemiology, clinical features, and diagnosis of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease in adults&quot;, section on 'Radiographic examinations'</a>.) </p><p>The indications for liver biopsy for suspected NAFLD have not been established in either children or adults, and remain controversial [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/comorbidities-and-complications-of-obesity-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/95,104\" class=\"abstract_t\">95,104</a>]. Liver biopsy is the only way to reliably distinguish between simple steatosis, steatohepatitis, and fibrosis, and can also be helpful in excluding other causes of elevated serum aminotransferases. On the other hand, because there is no specific treatment for NAFLD other than weight management right now, the results of a liver biopsy are not likely to provide clinical benefit. Therefore, the benefits of performing a liver biopsy may not outweigh the costs and risks, unless there are specific features that suggest more severe or progressive liver disease, or that raise concerns about an alternate cause of the liver disease which requires evaluation by liver biopsy. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epidemiology-clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-nonalcoholic-fatty-liver-disease-in-adults#H34933599\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Epidemiology, clinical features, and diagnosis of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease in adults&quot;, section on 'Role of liver biopsy'</a>.)</p><p>In our practice, we use the following approach in patients with obesity and elevated serum aminotransferases: </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>If ALT is greater than twice the upper limit of normal, we screen for viral hepatitis (anti-hepatitis C antibodies, and hepatitis Bs antigen [HBsAg]), Wilson disease (ceruloplasmin) and alpha 1 antitrypsin deficiency (serum alpha 1 antitrypsin level, and also &quot;pi&quot; typing or phenotype) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/comorbidities-and-complications-of-obesity-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/95\" class=\"abstract_t\">95</a>]. Autoimmune hepatitis can be screened for with autoimmune antibodies (anti-nuclear antibodies [ANA], anti-liver-kidney-muscle antibodies [anti-LKM], and anti-mitochondrial antibodies [AMA]), and a total immunoglobulin G (IgG) level, and by inquiring about a family history of autoimmune disease. Of note, positive serum autoimmune antibodies are seen in about 20 percent of children and adults with NAFLD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/comorbidities-and-complications-of-obesity-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/127\" class=\"abstract_t\">127</a>]. Therefore, low-positive titers (eg, ANA 1:40) do not exclude the diagnosis of NAFLD, but patients with high-positive titers should be further evaluated for the possibility of autoimmune hepatitis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/comorbidities-and-complications-of-obesity-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/128\" class=\"abstract_t\">128</a>].
