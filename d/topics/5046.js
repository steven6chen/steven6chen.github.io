The low-dose dexamethasone suppression tests are used to assess nonsuppressible cortisol production by adrenal incidentalomas and to differentiate patients with Cushing's syndrome of any cause from patients who do not have Cushing's syndrome. The high-dose dexamethasone suppression tests help to distinguish patients with Cushing's disease (Cushing's syndrome caused by pituitary hypersecretion of corticotropin [ACTH]) from most patients with the ectopic ACTH syndrome (Cushing's syndrome caused by nonpituitary ACTH-secreting tumors).</p><p>This topic will review the basic principles of the <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dexamethasone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">dexamethasone</a> suppression tests.

Dexamethasone is a potent glucocorticoid, about 30 to 40 times more potent than cortisol. Thus, the average daily maintenance dose of dexamethasone for a patient with adrenal insufficiency is 0.5 mg, versus 20 mg for <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hydrocortisone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">hydrocortisone</a>.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Dexamethasone and steroid measurements</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Measurements of serum, salivary, and urinary cortisol by current assays are <strong>unaffected</strong> by the presence of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dexamethasone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">dexamethasone</a>. Antibodies used in current cortisol immunoassays are directed toward the D ring of the molecule and react very poorly with dexamethasone, which has a 16-alpha-methyl modification of the D ring.

The high-dose tests are <strong>not</strong> used to make the diagnosis of CS. They are used after the diagnosis of CS is made to distinguish patients with Cushing's disease (CS caused by pituitary hypersecretion of ACTH) from patients with ectopic ACTH syndrome (CS caused by nonpituitary ACTH-secreting tumors).

In humans, dexamethasone has no inhibitory effect on steroid production when exogenous ACTH is infused [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dexamethasone-suppression-tests/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p>If the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis is normal, any supraphysiologic dose of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dexamethasone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">dexamethasone</a> is sufficient to suppress pituitary ACTH secretion. This should lead to reductions in cortisol secretion and its concentration in serum, saliva, as well as in the 24-hour urine excretion.</p><p>Two main protocols are used. No special precautions are required, as side effects are virtually absent, and either test can be conducted on an outpatient basis by a compliant patient.

In this protocol, the total dose given during the test is 16 mg. This test is sometimes referred to as the two-day, 8 mg test, which refers to the number of days and the total daily dose (8 mg). In practice, this test is often performed immediately after completing the low-dose dexamethasone suppression test (if the test is positive) and no intervening baseline urine collection is obtained. The urine collections are assayed for urinary free cortisol and creatinine.

About 70 percent suppress urinary cortisol excretion by more than 90 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dexamethasone-suppression-tests/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>].

Differentiation between Cushing's disease and ectopic ACTH or ACTH-independent Cushing's syndrome can be made on the basis of a 50 percent decrease in plasma cortisol that occurs following dexamethasone infusion in patients with Cushing's disease. However, similar to the oral high-dose dexamethasone suppression test, specificity is incomplete, as some patients with Cushing's disease fail to suppress cortisol in response to dexamethasone and some benign ectopic ACTH cases do suppress cortisol in response to dexamethasone. Less than 5 percent of patients with Cushing's disease fail to suppress cortisol with oral or IV high doses of dexamethasone (usually patients with large corticotroph tumors), whereas doses &gt;16 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day</span> may cause suppression in such patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dexamethasone-suppression-tests/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>].

The creatinine value provides reliable information about the reproducibility of a series of urine collections and some information about the completeness of an isolated collection. In adults under the age of 50 years, daily creatinine excretion should be 20 to 25 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> (177 to 221 <span class=\"nowrap\">&micro;mol/kg)</span> lean body weight in men and 15 to 20 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> (133 to 177 <span class=\"nowrap\">&micro;mol/kg)</span> lean body weight in women. From the ages of 50 to 90 years, there is a progressive 50 percent decline in creatinine excretion (to about 10 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> in men), due primarily to a fall in muscle mass (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=calculation-of-the-creatinine-clearance\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Calculation of the creatinine clearance&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=collection-of-a-24-hour-urine-specimen-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">&quot;Patient education: Collection of a 24-hour urine specimen (Beyond the Basics)&quot;</a>). The use of serum rather than urinary endpoints obviates this source of error.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Elevated corticosteroid-binding globulin &ndash; Women taking exogenous estrogens may have elevated corticosteroid-binding globulin (CBG) levels with concomitantly increased serum cortisol values. This may result in an apparent lack of suppression. Theoretically, in this setting, salivary cortisol values would show normal suppression. It may be prudent to measure CBG in women taking estrogens, and to repeat the test after their discontinuation in patients who have a high CBG value and do not suppress cortisol normally.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Variation in hormone secretion &ndash; Day-to-day variation can occur in hormone secretion by tumors, particularly by malignant pituitary and nonpituitary corticotropin (ACTH)-secreting and cortisol-secreting adrenocortical tumors. This problem can be detected by serial baseline 24-hour urine steroid [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dexamethasone-suppression-tests/abstract/43-45\" class=\"abstract_t\">43-45</a>] or salivary cortisol [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dexamethasone-suppression-tests/abstract/46\" class=\"abstract_t\">46</a>] determinations (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=measurement-of-cortisol-in-serum-and-saliva\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Measurement of cortisol in serum and saliva&quot;</a>). Measurement of cortisol in scalp hair can also reflect the historical timeline of cyclic hypercortisolism and is promising in this regard [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dexamethasone-suppression-tests/abstract/47\" class=\"abstract_t\">47</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Variation in <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dexamethasone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">dexamethasone</a> intake or metabolism &ndash; Failure of the patient to take the dexamethasone or abnormal metabolism of the dexamethasone can interfere with interpretation of the test.

These errors can be detected by measuring serum dexamethasone at the appropriate interval after the last dose.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Several glucocorticoid receptor polymorphisms have been identified that confer increased glucocorticoid sensitivity. Individuals with either the N363S or BclI polymorphisms have greater serum cortisol reduction after <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dexamethasone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">dexamethasone</a> administration. In contrast, the <span class=\"nowrap\">ER22/23EK</span> and A3669G polymorphisms are associated with decreased glucocorticoid sensitivity and relative glucocorticoid resistance [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dexamethasone-suppression-tests/abstract/50\" class=\"abstract_t\">50</a>]. These glucocorticoid polymorphisms are not determined on a clinical basis but may be implicated in some false positive or negative response to dexamethasone tests.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14\"><span class=\"h2\">Unusual responses</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Urinary steroid excretion of most patients with Cushing's disease is suppressed by high-dose <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dexamethasone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">dexamethasone</a>. Resistance to suppression is more common in patients with higher baseline ACTH and cortisol secretion. In less than five percent of patients with Cushing's disease, for example, higher doses of dexamethasone (16 to 100 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day)</span> are required to produce significant suppression. These patients tend to have large tumors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dexamethasone-suppression-tests/abstract/51-53\" class=\"abstract_t\">51-53</a>].</p><p>Higher <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dexamethasone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">dexamethasone</a> doses should be considered in patients with a pituitary macroadenoma and ACTH-dependent Cushing's syndrome whose response to standard high-dose dexamethasone suppression is substantial, but equivocal. Further suppression at higher doses of dexamethasone is convincing evidence of a pituitary ACTH source, in which case petrosal sinus sampling would not be indicated. In one study, only 3 of 19 patients with Cushing's disease failed to suppress serum cortisol after both 8 and 32 mg dexamethasone [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dexamethasone-suppression-tests/abstract/54\" class=\"abstract_t\">54</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15\"><span class=\"h2\">Paradoxical responses to dexamethasone</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A paradoxical increase in urinary free cortisol during the sequential low-dose (2 mg) and high-dose (8 mg) six-day <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dexamethasone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">dexamethasone</a> suppression testing (the Liddle test) was found in 9 of 13 patients with primary pigmented nodular adrenocortical disease (PPNAD) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dexamethasone-suppression-tests/abstract/55\" class=\"abstract_t\">55</a>]. In this study, no paradoxical increase in cortisol was seen in nine patients with macronodular adrenal disease, but it was observed in 3 of 15 patients with a unilateral adenoma. This delayed &quot;paradoxical&quot; response can be useful diagnostically to identify otherwise asymptomatic carriers in familial forms of PPNAD or Carney complex or to distinguish PPNAD from other adrenocortical tumors.
