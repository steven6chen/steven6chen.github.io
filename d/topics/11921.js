Another word for sexual development is &quot;puberty.&quot;</p><p>The biggest changes during puberty are that boys' and girls' bodies:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Grow taller &ndash; Children usually grow a lot in a short amount of time. This is called a &quot;growth spurt.&quot;</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Become more like adults' bodies &ndash; As a child's body changes to an adult's body, it becomes possible for a girl to get pregnant and for a boy to get a girl pregnant.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H26561260\"><span class=\"h1\">What causes puberty?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Puberty is caused by hormones in the body. These hormones come from the brain as well as organs called the ovaries (in girls) and the testicles (in boys) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F80271\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef80271 \">figure 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F68075\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef68075 \">figure 2</a>). The ovaries make a hormone called &quot;estrogen.&quot; The testicles make a hormone called &quot;testosterone.&quot; Estrogen and testosterone cause many of the changes in the body.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H26561275\"><span class=\"h1\">When does puberty usually start?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Puberty starts at different times in different children. Girls usually start puberty between ages 9 and 12. Boys usually start puberty between ages 10 and 13. But it can be normal for children to start puberty before or after these ages. The exact time a child starts puberty depends on different factors, including his or her genes, nutrition, and weight.</p><p>It's helpful to talk to your child before puberty starts. Let him or her know what body changes to expect and that these changes are normal.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H26561290\"><span class=\"h1\">What changes happen in girls?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The changes that happen during puberty in girls are:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The breasts grow bigger. In many girls, this is the first sign of puberty.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Hair grows in the genital area (pubic hair), under the arms, and on the legs. In some girls, pubic hair is the first sign of puberty.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Girls start to get their monthly periods. Monthly periods usually start within 2 years after the breasts or pubic hair start growing. When a girl first starts getting her period, she might not get one every month. It is normal for a period to skip a month, or come 2 times in 1 month. Some girls feel bloated or have mood changes right before they get their period.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Girls can have white or clear vaginal discharge. Vaginal discharge is the term doctors use to describe the small amount of fluid that comes out of the vagina.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H26561305\"><span class=\"h1\">What changes happen in boys?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The changes that happen during puberty in boys are:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The testicles get bigger. This is usually the first change that happens.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The penis gets longer and wider.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Hair grows in the genital area (pubic hair), on the face, and under the arms.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The voice changes.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Boys can ejaculate a small amount of sperm at night while they sleep. This is sometimes called a &quot;wet dream.&quot;</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The breasts can get slightly bigger. This usually goes away over time.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H26561320\"><span class=\"h1\">What other changes can happen during puberty?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Other changes that can happen are listed below. These things are all normal, but some can be bothersome or embarrassing to your child. They include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pimples (acne) &ndash; To help prevent pimples, your child can wash his or her face twice a day with a gentle non-soap facial skin cleanser. You can also ask your child's doctor or nurse for advice on how to treat pimples.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Sweating under the armpits and body odor &ndash; Puberty is the time that most children start using an antiperspirant or deodorant.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Eyesight changes &ndash; Children who wear glasses usually start needing them during puberty.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Mood changes or mood swings</p><p/><p>During puberty, many teens start having sexual feelings and might start having sex. But even though their bodies look grown up, their thoughts and feelings are not always grown up. Because of this, many teens don't use protection during sex, such as a condom. This can lead to pregnancy or getting an infection from sex.</p><p>Talk to your teen about how to avoid pregnancy or infections from sex. The only sure way to prevent these things is not to have sex. If teens do have sex, they can lower their chance of an unplanned pregnancy by using birth control. But some types of birth control do not protect against infections from sex. To lower the chance of getting an infection, teens should use a condom every time they have sex.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H26561334\"><span class=\"h1\">More on this topic</span></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=early-puberty-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Early puberty (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=late-puberty-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Late puberty (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=teen-sexuality-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Teen sexuality (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=acne-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Acne (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=choosing-birth-control-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Choosing birth control (The Basics)</a></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=adolescent-sexuality-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Adolescent sexuality (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=acne-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Acne (Beyond the Basics)</a></p></div><div id=\"reviewProcess\"><span>All topics are updated as new evidence becomes available and our <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/home/editorial-policy\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"policy policy_editorialpolicy\">peer review process</a> is complete.</span></div><div id=\"topicRetrievedDate\"><span class=\"emphasis\">This topic retrieved from UpToDate on: </span>Apr 03, 2018.</div><div id=\"disclaimer\">The content on the UpToDate website is not intended nor recommended as a substitute for medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.
