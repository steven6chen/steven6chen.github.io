Pregnancy may be associated with changes in the course of asthma, and asthma may affect the outcome of pregnancy. When considering the use of asthma medications in a pregnant woman, the potential risk of a drug must be balanced against the effects of untreated asthma. </p><p>The management of asthma in pregnancy, including the safety data for specific asthma medications, general management, and recommended pharmacotherapy for acute and chronic asthma in pregnancy, is reviewed here. An overview of asthma management and the physiology and clinical course of asthma in pregnancy are discussed separately.

In the United States, major congenital anomalies occur in 2 to 4 percent of live-born infants. An overview of congenital malformations and a discussion of genetic and environmental causes are provided separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=birth-defects-approach-to-evaluation\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Birth defects: Approach to evaluation&quot;</a>.)</p><p>There is a small but significant increase in complications of pregnancy in asthmatic women [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-asthma-during-pregnancy/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. A large representative study suggests that asthmatic patients, on average, have a 15 to 20 percent increased risk of perinatal mortality, preeclampsia, preterm delivery, or low birth weight infants compared with non-asthmatic women, and that patients with more severe asthma have a 30 to 100 percent increased risk (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F59809\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef59809 \">table 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-asthma-during-pregnancy/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. </p><p>For many years, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has used five categories (A, B, C, D, and X) to describe a drug's potential for causing adverse effects during pregnancy (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DRUG%2F50021\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef50021 \">table 2</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-asthma-during-pregnancy/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. The categories are based upon the results of animal studies, human data, and consideration of whether the benefit of the drug's use during pregnancy outweighs the risk. The FDA has begun the phase-out of pregnancy risk categories from prescription drug labeling and now requires information from available human and animal studies about (1) known or potential maternal or fetal risks, (2) dose adjustments needed during pregnancy and the postpartum period, and (3) <span class=\"nowrap\">benefit/risk</span> considerations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-asthma-during-pregnancy/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. While new medications include this information, the process of updating existing medications will likely take several years. In the interim, it is useful to have an understanding of the various categories. </p><p>None of the currently available asthma medications meets the requirements for category A (controlled studies in pregnant women show no risk). Most category B drugs are labeled as such because of reassuring animal studies without &quot;adequate and controlled&quot; human data. One may wish to choose a class B versus a class C drug (risk cannot be ruled out) among equally effective alternatives due to the reassuring animal studies. Among commonly used asthma medications, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=budesonide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">budesonide</a> (inhaled and intranasal) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-asthma-during-pregnancy/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>], <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cromolyn-sodium-cromoglicate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cromolyn</a> sodium, and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=omalizumab-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">omalizumab</a> are assigned category B. Category D provides a strong relative contraindication to use in pregnancy, and category X drugs should not be used. Of note, a drug that has a strong relative contraindication to use in the first trimester may have a good safety profile when used later in pregnancy when organogenesis has been completed (eg, palate has closed).</p><p>In addition to the safety of the medication itself, a topical (inhaled) medication would appear to be preferable to a systemic one due to reduced likelihood of systemic circulation and transplacental transfer to the fetus. An older medication with a &quot;track record&quot; may be preferable to a newer one. Finally, absolute and relative efficacy must also be considered in the choice of a medication for use during pregnancy.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2398855005\"><span class=\"h1\">MAINTAINING ASTHMA CONTROL</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Asthma may improve, worsen, or remain unchanged in severity during pregnancy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-asthma-during-pregnancy/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].

For each pregnant woman, the potential risks of gestational oral glucocorticoids must be balanced against the risks to the mother or infant of inadequately treated asthma.

The rate of congenital malformations was not different from that of the general population (3.8 versus 3.5 percent). Additional data from the Swedish Medical Birth Registry reported no clinically significant effects of inhaled budesonide on fetal mortality, gestational age, or fetal growth [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-asthma-during-pregnancy/abstract/52\" class=\"abstract_t\">52</a>]. Based largely upon these findings, budesonide is currently the only inhaled glucocorticoid with a pregnancy category B rating [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-asthma-during-pregnancy/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a population-based study using the United Kingdom's Clinical Practice Research Datalink, the risk of major congenital malformation (MCM) was assessed among 5362 pregnancies with inhaled glucocorticoid exposure during the first trimester and known fetal outcomes at one year of age [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-asthma-during-pregnancy/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>].

The strength of this observation is limited because the study was underpowered to assess the risk of specific malformations, such as cleft palate, which has been associated with maternal use of systemic glucocorticoids. In addition, the authors could not exclude the possibility that greater asthma severity contributed to the overall increased risk of malformations. Benefit-risk considerations favor the use of high dose inhaled glucocorticoids over a lower dose when needed for asthma control to avoid the use of systemic oral glucocorticoids, with the potential risks listed above.

Measurement of expiratory airflow with a peak flow meter (or spirometer) is the best method for objective assessment of the severity of an asthma attack. Peak flow measurements can also be used to monitor a patient's response to treatment and as a predictive marker for the possibility of hypercapnia. Normal values for peak expiratory flow are not significantly altered by pregnancy.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">The changes in blood gases that occur secondary to acute asthma during pregnancy are superimposed on the &quot;normal&quot; respiratory alkalosis of pregnancy. Thus, an arterial carbon dioxide tension (PaCO<sub>2</sub>) &gt;35 mmHg or an arterial oxygen tension (PaO<sub>2</sub>) &lt;70 mmHg associated with acute asthma represent more severe compromise during pregnancy than in the non-gravid state.
