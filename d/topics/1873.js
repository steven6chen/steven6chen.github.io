The extent of benefit partly depends on the intensity and duration of prior tobacco smoke exposure. Smokers who stop smoking can be expected to live longer and are less likely to develop tobacco-related diseases, including coronary heart disease, cancer, and pulmonary disease. Smokers also benefit from quitting smoking even after the development of smoking-related diseases, such as coronary heart disease or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H64327338\"><span class=\"h2\">All-cause mortality</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Up to one-half of all smokers can be expected to die from a tobacco-related illness [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/benefits-and-risks-of-smoking-cessation/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].

However, few data are available that support a strategy for a reduction in smoking, compared with complete cessation. Smoking reduction remains controversial as a strategy for reducing the health risks of smokers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/benefits-and-risks-of-smoking-cessation/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>]. Complete smoking cessation is preferable.</p><p>Health risks are found even with consistent low-level smoking (10 or fewer cigarettes a day). A prospective cohort study of people aged 59 to 82 years at baseline found all-cause mortality and cancer incidence were higher among consistent low-level smokers than never-smokers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/benefits-and-risks-of-smoking-cessation/abstract/34,35\" class=\"abstract_t\">34,35</a>]. Those who smoked 1 to 10 cigarettes daily had higher all-cause mortality (hazard ratio [HR] 1.87, 95% CI 1.64-2.13); even those who smoked &lt;one cigarette daily had an elevated risk (HR 1.64, 95% CI 1.07-2.51) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/benefits-and-risks-of-smoking-cessation/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>].

Quitting smoking lowered their risks; the younger they were when quitting, the lower their risks.</p><p>Data are inconsistent as to whether reducing cigarette smoking from higher to lower levels is associated with improved outcomes. At least two prospective cohort studies found that smokers who reduced smoking by at least 50 percent had no change in all-cause mortality, whereas those who quit smoking completely had decreased risks of all-cause mortality [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/benefits-and-risks-of-smoking-cessation/abstract/36,37\" class=\"abstract_t\">36,37</a>]. However, another cohort study did find reduced risk for mortality associated with smoking reduction (HR 0.85, 95% CI 0.77-0.95); the benefit with smoking reduction was mainly seen in heavy smokers and was mainly due to a reduction in cardiovascular mortality [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/benefits-and-risks-of-smoking-cessation/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>].

This is because even low levels of tobacco smoke exposure increase cardiovascular risk.

Nicotine withdrawal symptoms include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Increased appetite or weight gain</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Dysphoric, depressed mood, or anhedonia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/benefits-and-risks-of-smoking-cessation/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>]</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Insomnia</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Irritability, frustration, or anger</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Anxiety</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Difficulty concentrating</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Restlessness</p><p/><p>These factors should be addressed so that smokers will know what to expect and how to respond if these symptoms occur. Smoking cessation medications, including nicotine replacement therapy, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=bupropion-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">bupropion</a>, and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=varenicline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">varenicline</a>, relieve the symptoms of nicotine withdrawal (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pharmacotherapy-for-smoking-cessation-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pharmacotherapy for smoking cessation in adults&quot;</a>). Nonpharmacologic approaches can also help to manage nicotine withdrawal symptoms. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=behavioral-approaches-to-smoking-cessation\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Behavioral approaches to smoking cessation&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H30936473\"><span class=\"h2\">Weight gain</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Weight gain commonly occurs after cessation of smoking. Weight gain is a principal fear of those who are considering smoking cessation, especially women. The mechanisms behind weight gain appear to be decreased metabolic rate, increased activity of lipoprotein lipase, changes in food preferences, and increased caloric intake [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/benefits-and-risks-of-smoking-cessation/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>]. Weight gain of 1 to 2 kg in the first two weeks is usually followed by an additional 2 to 3 kg weight gain over the next four to five months [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/benefits-and-risks-of-smoking-cessation/abstract/42,43\" class=\"abstract_t\">42,43</a>]. The average total weight gain is 4 to 5 kg, but may be much greater. Ten percent or more of quitters may gain over 13 kg after smoking cessation. In general, the amount of weight gain is greater in women than men, nonwhites compared with whites, and heavier smokers compared with lighter smokers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/benefits-and-risks-of-smoking-cessation/abstract/44\" class=\"abstract_t\">44</a>].</p><p>While there are well-recognized health hazards of obesity (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overweight-and-obesity-in-adults-health-consequences\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overweight and obesity in adults: Health consequences&quot;</a>), these are outweighed by the health benefits of quitting smoking, which are much larger than the additional risk conferred by the weight gain. Behavioral counseling that addresses weight gain, including dietary or physical activity interventions, has some success in limiting weight gain (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=behavioral-approaches-to-smoking-cessation\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Behavioral approaches to smoking cessation&quot;</a>). Weight gain can also be temporarily blunted in smokers who quit with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=bupropion-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">bupropion</a>, an antidepressant medication effective for smoking cessation. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pharmacotherapy-for-smoking-cessation-in-adults#H451502936\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pharmacotherapy for smoking cessation in adults&quot;, section on 'Bupropion'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H30936480\"><span class=\"h2\">Depression</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Nicotine withdrawal syndrome includes symptoms of depression and anxiety, particularly in those with a history of psychiatric illness. In patients with documented depression, smoking cessation has been reported to trigger depressive episodes that require behavioral counseling, antidepressant medication, or both [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/benefits-and-risks-of-smoking-cessation/abstract/45,46\" class=\"abstract_t\">45,46</a>]. However, despite this increase in depressive symptoms, subsequent studies have found that the benefits of smoking cessation outweigh the risks in patients with psychiatric illness [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/benefits-and-risks-of-smoking-cessation/abstract/47,48\" class=\"abstract_t\">47,48</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=unipolar-depression-in-adults-assessment-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Unipolar depression in adults: Assessment and diagnosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p>It is unclear if smoking cessation causes depression in smokers who do not have psychiatric illness at baseline. In one large cohort of smokers without depression or anxiety, there was no increase in symptoms of depression or anxiety after quitting tobacco use [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/benefits-and-risks-of-smoking-cessation/abstract/49\" class=\"abstract_t\">49</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H64327938\"><span class=\"h2\">Cough and mouth ulcers</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A temporary increase in cough and aphthous ulcers can occur in the first few weeks after stopping smoking [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/benefits-and-risks-of-smoking-cessation/abstract/50-52\" class=\"abstract_t\">50-52</a>]. The pathophysiology is not well-understood. Coughing and aphthous ulcers generally resolve several weeks after the quit date. Individuals with bronchitis who quit may also report an increase in cough, but the most common experience is a decrease is symptoms as noted above [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/benefits-and-risks-of-smoking-cessation/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H30936501\"><span class=\"h1\">COST-EFFECTIVENESS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Smoking cessation interventions, including both counseling and medications, are highly cost-effective when compared with other commonly accepted preventive health practices (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F78943\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef78943 \">table 3</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/benefits-and-risks-of-smoking-cessation/abstract/53,54\" class=\"abstract_t\">53,54</a>]. One study examined several smoking cessation strategies with and without nicotine replacement and calculated an approximate cost of USD $2587 per net year of life gained, based upon published estimates of success and mortality differences for smokers and nonsmokers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/benefits-and-risks-of-smoking-cessation/abstract/54\" class=\"abstract_t\">54</a>]. A second study examined smokers at a single institution who completed an initial 60-minute nicotine dependence consultation and six two-hour evening sessions devoted to smoking cessation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/benefits-and-risks-of-smoking-cessation/abstract/53\" class=\"abstract_t\">53</a>]. The cohort was followed for one year, and based upon quit rates at that time and published mortality rates by age, sex, smoking status, and number of years since quitting, a mathematical model estimated a cost of USD $6828 per net year of life gained. Both of these estimates are considerably more favorable than those of other common interventions. As one example, treatment of mild hypertension costs approximately USD $24,000 per net year of life gained [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/benefits-and-risks-of-smoking-cessation/abstract/55\" class=\"abstract_t\">55</a>].</p><p>Subsequent studies have found several behavioral and pharmacologic therapies for smoking cessation to be cost-effective [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/benefits-and-risks-of-smoking-cessation/abstract/56\" class=\"abstract_t\">56</a>].

Up to one-half of all regular smokers can be expected to die from a tobacco-related illness. The most important causes of smoking-related mortality are atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, lung cancer, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). (See <a href=\"#H87359850\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Smoking cessation is associated with substantial health benefits, including a reduced risk of coronary heart disease, cancer, pulmonary disease, infections, and hip fracture. Smokers also benefit from quitting smoking even after the development of smoking-related diseases, such as coronary heart disease or COPD. (See <a href=\"#H2589684\" class=\"local\">'Benefits of smoking cessation'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Smoking cessation is associated with a mortality benefit for both men and women of all ages. Stopping smoking before age 40 is associated with a larger decline in premature mortality than stopping at a later age. (See <a href=\"#H64327338\" class=\"local\">'All-cause mortality'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Smoking cessation often leads to nicotine withdrawal symptoms, including increased appetite, weight gain, depressive symptoms, anxiety, insomnia, irritability, difficulty concentrating, and restlessness. Nicotine withdrawal symptoms are temporary and can be treated by pharmacologic or behavioral treatments. (See <a href=\"#H30936451\" class=\"local\">'Risks of smoking cessation'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Since tobacco use is both a learned behavior and a physical addiction to nicotine for the majority of smokers, the most effective way to promote smoking cessation is to combine both behavioral and pharmacologic therapies, which have a higher quit rate than either therapy alone.
