These antibodies were initially believed to be associated with Ross River virus infections. By 1985, however, antineutrophil cytoplasmic autoantibodies (ANCA) had been linked to granulomatosis with polyangiitis (GPA) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-spectrum-of-antineutrophil-cytoplasmic-autoantibodies/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Within several more years, a relationship among ANCA, GPA, microscopic polyangiitis (MPA), and &quot;renal-limited&quot; vasculitis (pauci-immune glomerulonephritis without evidence of extrarenal disease) had been established [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-spectrum-of-antineutrophil-cytoplasmic-autoantibodies/abstract/3,4\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,4</a>]. ANCA are also present in a substantial subset (approximately 40 percent) of patients with eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis (Churg-Strauss, abbreviated as EGPA) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-spectrum-of-antineutrophil-cytoplasmic-autoantibodies/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. ANCA testing plays a critical role in the diagnosis and classification of vasculitides, even as debate about their ultimate importance in the pathogenesis and pathophysiology of these conditions continues.</p><p>Following a brief discussion of certain technical issues related to the performance of ANCA assays, a review of the disease associations of ANCA and clinical utility of ANCA testing will be presented here. The role of ANCA in the pathogenesis of GPA and related vasculitides is discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pathogenesis-of-granulomatosis-with-polyangiitis-and-related-vasculitides\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pathogenesis of granulomatosis with polyangiitis and related vasculitides&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">TECHNICAL ISSUES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Two types of antineutrophil cytoplasmic autoantibody (ANCA) assays are in wide use:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Indirect immunofluorescence assay, using alcohol-fixed buffy coat leukocytes</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), using purified specific antigens</p><p/><p>Of these two techniques, the immunofluorescence assay is more sensitive, and the ELISA is more specific. The optimal approach to clinical testing for ANCA is therefore to perform both immunofluorescence, if available, and ELISA to detect antibodies against the vasculitis-specific target antigens [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-spectrum-of-antineutrophil-cytoplasmic-autoantibodies/abstract/6,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,7</a>]. However, ANCA testing is not standardized, and therefore, the sensitivity and specificity will vary among laboratories; there are also no standardized reference values for normal. Ultimately, standardized testing with a highly sensitive and specific ELISA may replace the strategy of immunofluorescence followed by ELISA. (See <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Pitfalls of interpreting immunofluorescence results'</a> below.)</p><p>In vasculitis, the two relevant target antigens are proteinase 3 (PR3) and myeloperoxidase (MPO). Both PR3 and MPO are located in the azurophilic granules of neutrophils and the peroxidase-positive lysosomes of monocytes. Antibodies with target specificities for PR3 and MPO are called &quot;PR3-ANCA&quot; and &quot;MPO-ANCA,&quot; respectively.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Immunofluorescence patterns in vasculitis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>When the sera of patients with ANCA-associated vasculitis are incubated with ethanol-fixed human neutrophils, two major immunofluorescence patterns are observed (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEPH%2F66748%7ENEPH%2F78968\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef66748 graphicRef78968 \">picture 1A-B</a>):</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>With the cytoplasmic ANCA (C-ANCA) pattern, the staining is diffuse throughout the cytoplasm. In most cases, antibodies directed against PR3 cause this pattern [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-spectrum-of-antineutrophil-cytoplasmic-autoantibodies/abstract/8,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,9</a>], but MPO-ANCA can occasionally be responsible.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The perinuclear ANCA (P-ANCA) pattern results from a staining pattern around the nucleus, which represents an artifact of ethanol fixation. With ethanol fixation of the neutrophil substrate, positively charged granule constituents rearrange themselves around the negatively charged nuclear membrane, leading to perinuclear fluorescence [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-spectrum-of-antineutrophil-cytoplasmic-autoantibodies/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Among patients with vasculitis, the antibody responsible for this pattern is usually directed against MPO (and, only occasionally, PR3).</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Immunofluorescence patterns in nonvasculitic conditions</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Atypical ANCA patterns may be observed on immunofluorescence testing in patients with immune-mediated conditions other than systemic vasculitis (eg, connective tissue disorders, inflammatory bowel disease, and autoimmune hepatitis). These atypical ANCA patterns may be confused with P-ANCA patterns. However, ELISA testing for antibodies against MPO or PR3 is negative in such cases.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Pitfalls of interpreting immunofluorescence results</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>For several reasons, caution is required in the interpretation of both positive C- and P-ANCA immunofluorescence patterns:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>There is a subjective component to the interpretation of immunofluorescence assays because the tests are based upon visual interpretation of the immunofluorescence pattern; this is sometimes not straightforward. Thus, the positive or negative predictive value of a given test result depends upon the experience of the individual who performs the assay. The positive and negative predictive values are likely to be better with results from a research laboratory than with a commercial assay, but variability exists in all laboratories [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-spectrum-of-antineutrophil-cytoplasmic-autoantibodies/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>ANCA testing remains unstandardized, and there are no references for normal ranges. In evaluating the utility of ANCA testing in clinical practice, it must be borne in mind that most studies of ANCA serologies have been performed at tertiary care centers using research laboratories focused on ANCA testing. Translating the test characteristics from the environments of research laboratories to clinical practice must be done with caution.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Immunofluorescence results are not highly specific for the diagnosis of vasculitis. The C-ANCA pattern has a greater specificity than the P-ANCA pattern for vasculitis (see <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'Disease associations'</a> below). However, in one series of consecutive assays from a tertiary care center, even positive C-ANCA immunofluorescence results were associated with vasculitis in only 50 percent of patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-spectrum-of-antineutrophil-cytoplasmic-autoantibodies/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Antibodies to a host of azurophilic granule proteins can cause a P-ANCA staining pattern. These include antibodies directed against lactoferrin, elastase, cathepsin G, <span class=\"nowrap\">bactericidal/permeability</span> inhibitor, catalase, lysozyme, beta-glucuronidase, and others. A positive P-ANCA immunofluorescence staining pattern may also be detected in a wide variety of inflammatory illnesses and has a low specificity for vasculitis. A positive immunofluorescence assay should therefore always prompt testing by ELISA to determine the specific antibody (or antibodies) responsible for the pattern.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Because of the frequent difficulty in distinguishing the P-ANCA pattern of immunofluorescence from that caused by antinuclear antibodies (ANA), individuals with ANA frequently have &quot;false-positive&quot; results on ANCA testing by immunofluorescence. Typically, in patients who have a positive ANA, a positive P-ANCA is a false positive. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">To avoid false-positive P-ANCA tests, immunofluorescence assays should be routinely performed on both formalin- and ethanol-fixed substrates. This is because formalin-fixed neutrophils prevent the rearrangement of charged cellular components around the nucleus. The use of both cell substrates permits the distinction between antibodies causing a &quot;true&quot; P-ANCA pattern and those directed against the nuclear antigens (ANA). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=measurement-and-clinical-significance-of-antinuclear-antibodies\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Measurement and clinical significance of antinuclear antibodies&quot;</a>.) </p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Enzyme-linked immunoassays</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Specific ELISAs for antibodies to PR3 and MPO are commercially available and should be part of any standardized approach to the testing for ANCA. PR3-ANCA and MPO-ANCA are associated with substantially higher specificities and positive predictive values than the immunofluorescence patterns to which they usually correspond (C- and P-ANCA, respectively) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-spectrum-of-antineutrophil-cytoplasmic-autoantibodies/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. However, errors can be made if these tests are not performed in experienced laboratories. ELISAs for other antigens are also available, but the indications for their use are unclear.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h1\">DISEASE ASSOCIATIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Antineutrophil cytoplasmic autoantibodies (ANCA) are associated with many cases of granulomatosis with polyangiitis (GPA), microscopic polyangiitis (MPA), eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis (EGPA, Churg-Strauss), &quot;renal-limited&quot; vasculitis, and certain drug-induced vasculitis syndromes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-spectrum-of-antineutrophil-cytoplasmic-autoantibodies/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. In these conditions, ANCA consistently have specificities for either proteinase 3 (PR3) or myeloperoxidase (MPO) but almost never for both. One condition commonly associated with &quot;dual positivity&quot; for PR3- and MPO-ANCA is levamisole exposure, usually in the context of using cocaine (greater than 50 percent of illegally sold cocaine in the United States is contaminated with levamisole). Levamisole can cause a unique vasculopathy associated with gangrenous skin lesions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-spectrum-of-antineutrophil-cytoplasmic-autoantibodies/abstract/14,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">14,15</a>]. </p><p>In contrast to these conditions, classic polyarteritis nodosa (PAN) is not associated with PR3- or MPO-ANCA, and the presence of one of these antibodies suggests an alternative diagnosis. ANCA that have different antigen specificities may be detected in a variety of gastrointestinal and other rheumatic disorders, particularly by immunofluorescence.</p><p>There is a growing consensus that the more clinically and scientifically useful distinction among patients with ANCA-associated vasculitis is positivity for PR3-ANCA or MPO-ANCA, rather than the clinical distinction between GPA and MPA. In one study of patients with GPA or MPA, for example, PR3-ANCA was more commonly associated with ear, nose, throat, and respiratory tract disease, whereas MPO-ANCA was more commonly associated with renal, cutaneous, and pulmonary manifestations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-spectrum-of-antineutrophil-cytoplasmic-autoantibodies/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Granulomatosis with polyangiitis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Approximately <strong>90 percent</strong> of patients with active, generalized GPA are ANCA positive. There is clearly a small subset of patients with active, generalized GPA who do not have ANCA. Furthermore, in limited forms of the disease (such as subsets in which upper respiratory tract disease predominates and renal involvement is absent), up to 40 percent of patients may be ANCA negative. Thus, the absence of ANCA <strong>does not</strong> exclude the diagnosis of GPA. In large measure, the sensitivity of PR3-ANCA for GPA is related to activity of disease at the time of sampling [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-spectrum-of-antineutrophil-cytoplasmic-autoantibodies/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>].</p><p>Among patients who have GPA with ANCA, 80 to 90 percent have PR3-ANCA. The remainder of ANCA-positive GPA patients have MPO-ANCA. Necrotizing granulomatous inflammation, the histopathologic hallmark of GPA, has been reported in both PR3- and MPO-ANCA-positive individuals. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pathogenesis-of-granulomatosis-with-polyangiitis-and-related-vasculitides\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pathogenesis of granulomatosis with polyangiitis and related vasculitides&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h2\">Microscopic polyangiitis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Nearly 90 percent of patients with MPA are ANCA positive [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-spectrum-of-antineutrophil-cytoplasmic-autoantibodies/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. In contrast to GPA, most ANCA-positive patients with MPA have MPO-ANCA, with a minority having PR3-ANCA. Because PR3-ANCA or MPO-ANCA may occur in both GPA and MPA, these diseases cannot be distinguished on the basis of ANCA specificity. Data pertaining to ANCA and MPA are also complicated by the lack of consensus concerning the definition of MPA. The distinction between GPA and MPA is important chiefly because of differential tendencies to flare. Although both diseases may flare after the achievement of remission, GPA is substantially more likely to relapse [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-spectrum-of-antineutrophil-cytoplasmic-autoantibodies/abstract/16,19,20\" class=\"abstract_t\">16,19,20</a>].

Whereas nearly 90 percent of patients with MPA are ANCA positive, classic PAN is <strong>not</strong> associated with antibodies to either PR3 or MPO. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-polyarteritis-nodosa-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of polyarteritis nodosa in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h2\">Renal-limited vasculitis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Pauci-immune vasculitis limited to the kidney is characterized by necrotizing glomerulonephritis with little or no deposition of immunoreactants (IgG, IgM, IgA, and complement components).

Although variable from study to study, approximately 50 percent of patients with EGPA are ANCA positive, with the percentage being somewhat higher in those with active, untreated disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-spectrum-of-antineutrophil-cytoplasmic-autoantibodies/abstract/5,25\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,25</a>]. MPO-ANCA is substantially more common among patients with EGPA who are also ANCA positive. As an example, in one series, 40 of 102 patients with EGPA were ANCA positive, and 29 (73 percent) had specificity for MPO-ANCA [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-spectrum-of-antineutrophil-cytoplasmic-autoantibodies/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. In a second study, 38 of 43 ANCA-positive patients with EGPA were tested for MPO and PR3; MPO was identified in 34 patients (79 percent), and PR3 was identified in none [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-spectrum-of-antineutrophil-cytoplasmic-autoantibodies/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].</p><p>Some studies suggest the possibility of clinical differences among patients with EGPA who are ANCA positive as opposed to ANCA negative [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-spectrum-of-antineutrophil-cytoplasmic-autoantibodies/abstract/5,26\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,26</a>]. ANCA-positive patients are more likely to have glomerulonephritis, alveolar hemorrhage, and neurologic disease, whereas ANCA-negative patients are more likely to have cardiac and other pulmonary involvement. However, the state of the literature is far from a consensus on this point. There is certainly overlap in clinical presentations among patients with and without ANCA (as is true in GPA and MPA).

MPO-ANCA, PR3-ANCA, or both were detected in 22, 1, and 4 sera, respectively.</p><p/><p>In general, patients who are positive for both anti-GBM autoantibodies and ANCA have a higher risk of relapse than patients positive only for anti-GBM autoantibodies.

Others present with disease features that are uncommon to anti-GBM autoantibody disease but quite typical of systemic vasculitis (purpura, arthralgias, and granulomatous inflammation), suggesting the concurrence of two disease processes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-spectrum-of-antineutrophil-cytoplasmic-autoantibodies/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. In some studies, the presence of both antibodies was associated with a worse renal prognosis than was the presence of either antibody alone [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-spectrum-of-antineutrophil-cytoplasmic-autoantibodies/abstract/32,33\" class=\"abstract_t\">32,33</a>]. In a retrospective study of kidney biopsies with crescentic glomerulonephritis, the histology of double-positive (MPO-ANCA and anti-GBM autoantibody) patients was indistinguishable from the histology of MPO-ANCA alone [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-spectrum-of-antineutrophil-cytoplasmic-autoantibodies/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>].</p><p>In patients with both ANCA and anti-GBM autoantibodies, the relationship between the two antibodies is unknown. The antigen specificity for the anti-GBM autoantibodies is the same as in patients with anti-GBM autoantibody disease alone, suggesting that the inciting antigen is the same [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-spectrum-of-antineutrophil-cytoplasmic-autoantibodies/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>].</p><p>However, the production of ANCA appears to precede that of anti-GBM autoantibodies at least in some patients. This was demonstrated in an analysis of stored serum samples that had been obtained at the time of enlistment and every other year thereafter from 30 United States military personnel who subsequently developed anti-GBM disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-spectrum-of-antineutrophil-cytoplasmic-autoantibodies/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>]. Patients who were diagnosed with anti-GBM disease and healthy controls were identified from the military database and serum samples obtained from the Department of Defense Stored Serum Repository. Compared with matching controls, a greater number of patients with anti-GBM disease had PR3-ANCA and MPO-ANCA levels detected in multiple serum samples that had been obtained in the years preceding the onset of disease (82 versus 14 percent in controls for PR3-ANCA, and 73 versus 27 percent in controls for MPO-ANCA). In all cases, ANCA antibodies were detected in earlier samples than anti-GBM autoantibodies, which were detected months, but not years, prior to the onset of clinical symptoms. These data suggest the possibility that the pulmonary or renal damage caused by ANCA may lead to secondary anti-GBM autoantibody formation.

In one study of 209 patients with hyperthyroidism, 13 (6 percent) were positive for either MPO- or PR3-ANCA or for ANCA directed against human leukocyte elastase [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-spectrum-of-antineutrophil-cytoplasmic-autoantibodies/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>]. The presence of ANCA was highly associated with treatment with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=propylthiouracil-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">propylthiouracil</a> and related antithyroid drugs (odds ratio 11.8, 95% CI of 1.5 to 93.3). ANCA positivity with glomerulonephritis developed in approximately one-third (4 of 13). The presence of ANCA with or without vasculitis is associated with previous treatment with antithyroid drugs, possibly after many years of exposure.

For patients with both positive immunofluorescence tests and positive ELISA tests, the positive predictive value increased to 88 percent.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H25\"><span class=\"h2\">Does a negative ANCA assay exclude a small-vessel vasculitis (GPA, MPA, EGPA, and renal-limited disease)?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Up to 40 percent of patients with nonorgan-threatening and nonlife-threatening granulomatosis with polyangiitis (GPA), and 10 percent of those with severe GPA, do not have a positive ANCA. A negative ANCA assay therefore does <strong>not</strong> exclude GPA. In addition, 30 percent of all patients with microscopic polyangiitis (MPA) and perhaps 50 percent of those with eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis (Churg-Strauss, abbreviated as EGPA) are also ANCA negative. Some patients with a negative ANCA despite clinical and histologic features of ANCA-associated vasculitis may have an MPO-ANCA that cannot be detected by routine laboratory testing, because it is masked by circulating fragments of enzymatically degraded ceruloplasmin, which may be elevated in patients with active disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-spectrum-of-antineutrophil-cytoplasmic-autoantibodies/abstract/76\" class=\"abstract_t\">76</a>]. </p><p>Also, ANCA status may change over time; a patient who is ANCA negative upon presentation with constitutional symptoms and pulmonary infiltrates may become PR3-ANCA positive upon the development of more generalized disease (eg, the occurrence of glomerulonephritis). A negative test for ANCA may therefore create a false sense of security.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H26\"><span class=\"h2\">Does a positive ANCA obviate the need for confirmation of the diagnosis by tissue biopsy?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The predictive value of ANCA testing depends heavily upon the clinical presentation of the patient in whom the test is performed. As an example, the finding of an elevated ANCA titer in a patient presenting with acute or rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis predicts the presence of GPA, MPA, or idiopathic necrotizing glomerulonephritis with an accuracy that approaches 98 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-spectrum-of-antineutrophil-cytoplasmic-autoantibodies/abstract/8,77\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,77</a>]. However, the diagnostic accuracy of ANCA is substantially lower in patients whose clinical features are less compelling, such as those with only chronic sinusitis as a complaint.</p><p>The diagnostic accuracy of ANCA was evaluated in a large multicenter European collaborative study. Investigators compared 169 newly diagnosed and 189 previously diagnosed patients with idiopathic systemic vasculitis or rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis with 184 disease controls (including those with other vasculitides, such as giant cell or Takayasu arteritis, or nonvasculitic glomerulonephritides) and 740 healthy controls [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-spectrum-of-antineutrophil-cytoplasmic-autoantibodies/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. Both indirect immunofluorescence testing and specific anti-PR3 and anti-MPO ELISAs were performed. The following results were reported:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In GPA, the sensitivity of C-ANCA, P-ANCA, anti-PR3, and anti-MPO was 64, 21, 66, and 24 percent, respectively. In microscopic polyarteritis, the sensitivities were 23, 58, 26, and 58 percent, respectively.

The sensitivity of either C-ANCA plus anti-PR3 or P-ANCA plus anti-MPO was 73, 67, and 82 percent for GPA, MPA, and pauci-immune crescentic glomerulonephritis, respectively. Specificity was <strong>99 percent</strong> for both combinations.</p><p/><p>The issue of whether treatment can be undertaken without tissue biopsy is controversial. Some clinicians undertake treatment without tissue biopsy in selected cases in which the clinical presentation is highly consistent with pauci-immune vasculitis and in which the results of ANCA testing are unequivocal (eg, both C-ANCA and PR3-ANCA positive).</p><p>However, we believe that, unless the clinical setting indicates an extremely high probability of vasculitis, then all reasonable attempts to confirm clinical suspicions with histopathological proof should be undertaken before committing patients to long-term treatment with potentially toxic medications, particularly since the ability to make the clinical diagnosis will vary widely with the experience of the clinician. If a biopsy cannot be immediately obtained, therapy should not be delayed, but a biopsy should be obtained as soon as possible after initiation of therapy. The initiation of therapy without a confirmatory biopsy may be appropriate in selected circumstances, such as the severely ill ventilator-dependent patient without extrapulmonary involvement in whom the performance of a lung biopsy to obtain adequate tissue may result in significant morbidity or mortality. Even in this setting, an attempt should be made to confirm the diagnosis by tissue biopsy once the patient is stable, especially if there remains clinical uncertainty about the diagnosis.</p><p>The importance of performing renal biopsies in many clinical settings is emphasized by the finding of a study that combined the results of the European collaborative study [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-spectrum-of-antineutrophil-cytoplasmic-autoantibodies/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>] with those from nearly 4200 consecutive patients from the University of North Carolina group [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-spectrum-of-antineutrophil-cytoplasmic-autoantibodies/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. The predictive value of serologic testing was assessed based upon a sensitivity and specificity of 72.5 and 98.4 percent, respectively (values similar to those obtained with combined indirect immunofluorescence and ELISA testing).

Thus, more than one-half of all such patients with positive ANCA serologies do not have a pauci-immune crescentic glomerulonephritis by renal biopsy, and therefore, reliance upon ANCA testing alone could lead to an unacceptably high rate of misdiagnosis. Conversely, it is also possible that patients with a positive ANCA serology and hematuria who do not have rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis have focal disease that may be missed by kidney biopsy. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">In contrast to a positive ANCA serology, a negative ANCA serology in patients without rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis is associated with a negative predictive value of <strong>99 percent</strong> (ie, 99 percent of those with negative ANCA serologies did <strong>not</strong> have a pauci-immune glomerulonephritis on renal biopsy). In this setting, therefore, negative ANCA serologies lend considerable confidence to the exclusion of pauci-immune glomerulonephritis.</p><p/><p>In summary, biopsy is still required to document the presence or absence of a pauci-immune crescentic glomerulonephritis in ANCA-positive patients in whom the tissue diagnosis cannot be confirmed less invasively (eg, biopsy of a skin or nasal lesion). As previously mentioned, many assays available are not sufficiently accurate, and the potential toxicity of present therapies for ANCA-positive diseases is too great to rely upon serology alone.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H27\"><span class=\"h2\">Does a rise in ANCA titers predict a disease flare?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>This has been a controversial area in the literature almost since ANCA were first identified in the 1980s. However, several rigorous studies have demonstrated that elevations in the titers of ANCA do <strong>not</strong> predict disease flares in a timely manner [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-spectrum-of-antineutrophil-cytoplasmic-autoantibodies/abstract/78-81\" class=\"abstract_t\">78-81</a>]. The largest of these studies was performed on a clinical trial cohort of 180 patients (Wegener's Granulomatosis <a href=\"topic.htm?path=etanercept-including-biosimilars-of-etanercept-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Etanercept</a> Trial [WGET] Research Group, 2005), with serum samples drawn at three-month intervals and ANCA assays performed at the Mayo Clinic [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-spectrum-of-antineutrophil-cytoplasmic-autoantibodies/abstract/78\" class=\"abstract_t\">78</a>]. The following findings were observed:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Among patients who were PR3-ANCA positive compared with negative at baseline, there were no differences in the median time to relapse, disease activity score [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-spectrum-of-antineutrophil-cytoplasmic-autoantibodies/abstract/82\" class=\"abstract_t\">82</a>], or organ involved at relapse. Decreases in PR3-ANCA levels were not associated with a shorter time to remission, and increases were not associated with relapse.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Relapses occurred among 46 of 101 patients (46 percent) who were mature-PR3-ANCA positive at baseline and achieved remissions of at least six months' duration. However, the proportion of patients who experienced a disease flare within one year of an elevation in ANCA titer was only 40 percent.</p><p/><p>Other studies have come to slightly different conclusions, indicating that persistently high or rising titers of ANCA are associated with an increased risk of disease relapse [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-spectrum-of-antineutrophil-cytoplasmic-autoantibodies/abstract/83-86\" class=\"abstract_t\">83-86</a>]. However, even in those studies, the temporal relationship between a rise in ANCA titer and the occurrence of a disease flare was poor. As an example, in a prospective study of 100 ANCA-positive patients observed over a two-year period, relapse did not occur in 43 and 29 percent of those with a rise in ANCA titers by immunofluorescence and in PR3-ANCA titers by ELISA, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-spectrum-of-antineutrophil-cytoplasmic-autoantibodies/abstract/83\" class=\"abstract_t\">83</a>].</p><p>In addition, a meta-analysis of 18 studies found that neither a rise in ANCA titer nor a persistently elevated ANCA titer were strong predictors of a subsequent disease flare [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-spectrum-of-antineutrophil-cytoplasmic-autoantibodies/abstract/87\" class=\"abstract_t\">87</a>]. Therapies for relapsed ANCA-associated vasculitis (often, high doses of glucocorticoids and cytotoxic agents) carry substantial risk, including severe infections, cystitis, bladder cancer, lung fibrosis (rarely), and death. Treating all patients with increases in ANCA titers would result in unnecessary risks of toxicity in a substantial percentage of patients, nearly 30 percent in the study mentioned above. Because of these concerns, using a rise in ANCA titer as the sole parameter to justify altering immunosuppressive therapy <strong>cannot</strong> be endorsed. </p><p>A reasonable recommendation is to closely follow patients with rising ANCA titers but not to alter their therapy unless there are clear clinical signs of active disease. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=major-side-effects-of-inhaled-glucocorticoids\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Major side effects of inhaled glucocorticoids&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=general-toxicity-of-cyclophosphamide-in-rheumatic-diseases\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;General toxicity of cyclophosphamide in rheumatic diseases&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H28\"><span class=\"h2\">Does a persistently negative ANCA assure disease quiescence?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>If a patient was ANCA positive during a period of active disease, a persistently ANCA-negative status is consistent with, but not absolutely proof of, remission. The same meta-analysis that examined the value of persistently positive ANCA titers discussed above also analyzed the value of persistently negative titers and found that this scenario should not lead to a change in therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-spectrum-of-antineutrophil-cytoplasmic-autoantibodies/abstract/87\" class=\"abstract_t\">87</a>]. Similarly, another study reported that 37 of 100 patients with ANCA-associated vasculitis suffered flares during the period of observation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-spectrum-of-antineutrophil-cytoplasmic-autoantibodies/abstract/83\" class=\"abstract_t\">83</a>]. Of these, three (8 percent) were ANCA negative at the time of relapse.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H424851931\"><span class=\"h1\">SOCIETY GUIDELINE LINKS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Links to society and government-sponsored guidelines from selected countries and regions around the world are provided separately.

ANCA are also present in a substantial subset of patients with eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis (Churg-Strauss, abbreviated as EGPA) and certain drug-induced vasculitis syndromes. ANCA testing plays a critical role in the diagnosis and classification of vasculitides, even as debate about their ultimate importance in the pathogenesis and pathophysiology of these conditions continues. (See <a href=\"#H1\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Two types of ANCA assays are in wide use: indirect immunofluorescence assay; and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). In vasculitis, the two relevant target antigens detected by ELISA are proteinase 3 (PR3) and myeloperoxidase (MPO). Specific ELISAs for antibodies to PR3 and MPO are commercially available and should be part of any standardized approach to the testing for ANCA. PR3-ANCA and MPO-ANCA are associated with substantially higher specificities and positive predictive values than the immunofluorescence patterns to which they usually correspond (cytoplasmic [C]- and perinuclear [P]-ANCA, respectively). (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Technical issues'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>ANCA are associated with a variety of disorders (see <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'Disease associations'</a> above): </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>GPA &ndash; Approximately 90 percent of patients with active, generalized GPA are ANCA positive. Among patients who have GPA with ANCA, 80 to 90 percent have PR3-ANCA. (See <a href=\"#H8\" class=\"local\">'Granulomatosis with polyangiitis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>MPA &ndash; Nearly 90 percent of patients with MPA are ANCA positive, and most ANCA-positive patients with MPA have MPO-ANCA. (See <a href=\"#H9\" class=\"local\">'Microscopic polyangiitis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Renal-limited vasculitis &ndash; The majority of patients with renal-limited vasculitis are ANCA positive, with 75 to 80 percent having MPO-ANCA. (See <a href=\"#H10\" class=\"local\">'Renal-limited vasculitis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>EGPA &ndash; ANCA, both PR3 and MPO, have been detected with variable frequencies in patients with EGPA. Among such patients, the vast majority have MPO-ANCA. (See <a href=\"#H11\" class=\"local\">'Eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis (Churg-Strauss)'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Other glomerular disorders &ndash; Between 10 and 40 percent of patients with anti-glomerular basement membrane (GBM) autoantibody disease are ANCA positive at the time of diagnosis, and ANCA is usually directed against MPO rather than PR3. In addition to anti-GBM autoantibody disease, ANCA-associated glomerular disease has also been described to coexist with a variety of other disorders including membranous nephropathy, lupus nephritis, IgA nephropathy, and bacterial infection-related glomerulonephritis (mostly poststreptococcal and Staphylococcus associated). (See <a href=\"#H12\" class=\"local\">'Anti-GBM autoantibody disease'</a> above and <a href=\"#H19762502\" class=\"local\">'Other concurrent glomerular diseases'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Drug-induced ANCA-associated vasculitis &ndash; Certain medications may induce forms of vasculitis associated with ANCA (mostly MPO), including <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hydralazine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">hydralazine</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=propylthiouracil-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">propylthiouracil</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methimazole-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">methimazole</a>, carbimazole, and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=minocycline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">minocycline</a>.

(See <a href=\"#H13\" class=\"local\">'Drug-induced ANCA-associated vasculitis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Other &ndash; ANCA may also be seen with nonvasculitic rheumatic disorders, autoimmune gastrointestinal disorders (such as ulcerative colitis), cystic fibrosis, levamisole (which is sometimes a contaminant in cocaine) exposure, and bacteremia and other infections. (See <a href=\"#H19\" class=\"local\">'Nonvasculitic rheumatic disorders'</a> above and <a href=\"#H20\" class=\"local\">'Autoimmune gastrointestinal disorders'</a> above and <a href=\"#H21\" class=\"local\">'Cystic fibrosis'</a> above and <a href=\"#H265754241\" class=\"local\">'Cocaine and levamisole'</a> above and <a href=\"#H1212699933\" class=\"local\">'Bacteremia and other infections'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The results of ANCA testing must be considered in the clinical context, and the diagnosis of vasculitis or glomerulonephritis often requires a tissue biopsy. A negative ANCA test does not exclude the diagnosis of GPA, MPA, or renal-limited vasculitis, and a positive test does not necessarily establish the diagnosis (unless the clinical presentation is highly suggestive of a vasculitis). In addition, among ANCA-positive patients with GPA or MPA, a rising titer does not definitively indicate increasing disease activity, and a titer that becomes negative does not guarantee disease quiescence.
