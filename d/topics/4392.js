This may be due in part to the loss of opsonizing factors, which may specifically increase susceptibility to encapsulated bacterial infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complications-of-nephrotic-syndrome-in-children/abstract/3,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,5</a>]. In addition, ascites and pleural effusions provide a natural culture media for bacterial growth. Thus, as noted in the above study, pneumonia, empyema, and peritonitis are infections seen in children with nephrotic syndrome [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complications-of-nephrotic-syndrome-in-children/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].</p><p>In a retrospective review, 24 episodes of peritonitis occurred in 351 children with nephrotic syndrome over a 10-year period from 1970 to 1980 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complications-of-nephrotic-syndrome-in-children/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. <em>Streptococcus pneumoniae was</em> the most common infectious agent, seen in 12 patients, followed by <em>Escherichia coli </em>in six, and negative cultures in four. Peritoneal signs of irritation were present in all patients, including in 16 who were receiving corticosteroid therapy.</p><p>In a retrospective study, eight episodes of peritonitis in seven patients over a five-year period were reported in 268 patients with nephrotic syndrome that was initially diagnosed as steroid sensitive [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complications-of-nephrotic-syndrome-in-children/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. In three cases the causative microorganism was identified as <em>S. pneumoniae</em>, <em>Streptococcus hemolyticus</em>, and <em>alpha-hemolytic Streptococcus</em>.</p><p>Sepsis, meningitis, and cellulitis are other serious infections that can occur in children with nephrotic syndrome [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complications-of-nephrotic-syndrome-in-children/abstract/9,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,10</a>]. Although not as serious, urinary tract infections are common [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complications-of-nephrotic-syndrome-in-children/abstract/6,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,11</a>].</p><p>Prior to 1940, the mortality rate in children with nephrotic syndrome was 40 percent, primarily due to infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complications-of-nephrotic-syndrome-in-children/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. Although the mortality rate has been significantly reduced with the introduction of corticosteroid treatment and antibiotics [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complications-of-nephrotic-syndrome-in-children/abstract/13,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,14</a>], infection still remains a cause of death in children with nephrotic syndrome. This was illustrated in an International Study of Kidney Disease in Children report of 10 deaths in a group of 389 children with minimal change disease (MCD) who were seen between 1967 and 1976 and were followed for 5 to 15 years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complications-of-nephrotic-syndrome-in-children/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. Six of the deaths were due to infection, five were from sepsis (peritonitis as the primary site of infection in two), and one was due to peritonitis with pancreatitis. <em>S. pneumoniae </em>was isolated in two cases and <em>E. coli</em> in two other cases.</p><p>Because children with nephrotic syndrome are at increased risk for serious complications and potentially death from pneumococcal infection, they should receive 23-valent polysaccharide (PPSV23) pneumococcal vaccine if not previously immunized. Pneumococcal vaccine is effective even in children receiving high doses of steroids and it is not associated with an increased risk of relapse [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complications-of-nephrotic-syndrome-in-children/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>].

In a retrospective study of 326 children with nephrotic syndrome from any cause diagnosed between 1999 and 2006, 9 percent had one thromboembolic event (TEE), resulting in an overall incidence of 20.4 patients with TEEs per 1000 patient-years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complications-of-nephrotic-syndrome-in-children/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. The median time to TEE was approximately 71 days after diagnosis of nephrotic syndrome. Deep venous thrombosis was the most common TEE and was associated with the use of a central venous catheter. Multivariate analysis demonstrated that the risk of TEE was greater in children older than 12 years of age, and increased with increasing urinary protein excretion.</p><p>However, the true incidence of TEE may be higher, as many TEEs are asymptomatic. This was illustrated in a case series of 16 children with steroid-dependent minimal change disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complications-of-nephrotic-syndrome-in-children/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. Evaluation by ventilation-perfusion scans showed defects consistent with pulmonary embolism in 7 patients, residual changes in 10, and normal findings in only 9. In another study using dual energy computed tomography (CT) pulmonary angiography, 28 percent of children with nephrotic syndrome without respiratory symptoms had subclinical pulmonary embolism [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complications-of-nephrotic-syndrome-in-children/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>].</p><p>Both arterial and venous thromboses have been reported in children with nephrotic syndrome, although venous thrombosis complication accounted for most of the cases. [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complications-of-nephrotic-syndrome-in-children/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>].

Otherwise, renal vein thrombosis is rare in children with nephrotic syndrome, especially in comparison with adults. However, some children develop acute complete venous occlusion, which is characterized clinically by the sudden onset of macroscopic hematuria, flank pain <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> tenderness, and, in children with bilateral disease, acute renal failure. In such cases, Doppler ultrasonography shows an increase in kidney size and the absence of blood flow in the renal vein.
