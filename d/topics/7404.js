The cause of FD is unknown; it is speculated that the disease reflects an abnormal response to bacteria, particularly <em>Staphylococcus aureus</em>.</p><p>FD usually occurs in adults. In addition to hair loss and pustular lesions, affected patients may experience associated pruritus or pain. Systemic antibiotic therapy is the mainstay of treatment. The response to treatment is variable and relapse is common.</p><p>The clinical features, diagnosis, and management of FD will be reviewed here. Other cicatricial alopecias are reviewed separately. Of note, FD is distinct from keratosis follicularis spinulosa decalvans, a rare genetic disorder characterized by keratotic follicular papules and cicatricial alopecia. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-and-diagnosis-of-hair-loss#H1871427\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation and diagnosis of hair loss&quot;, section on 'Cicatricial alopecia'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3166112\"><span class=\"h1\">CLASSIFICATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Folliculitis decalvans (FD) is classified as a primary cicatricial alopecia, a group of disorders in which an inflammatory process targets the hair follicle, resulting in follicular destruction and permanent hair loss. This is in contrast to secondary cicatricial alopecia, in which scarring processes in the skin incidentally destroy hair follicles. FD was further classified as a <strong>primary neutrophilic cicatricial alopecia</strong> in a classification scheme created by the participants of a 2001 workshop on cicatricial alopecia sponsored by the North American Hair Research Society [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/folliculitis-decalvans/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. This classification system was based upon the type of inflammatory infiltrate associated with specific subtypes of cicatricial alopecia. The classification of cicatricial and noncicatricial alopecias is reviewed in detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-and-diagnosis-of-hair-loss#H638327\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation and diagnosis of hair loss&quot;, section on 'Classification'</a>.)</p><p>Although the term &quot;folliculitis decalvans&quot; was coined by Brocq in 1905 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/folliculitis-decalvans/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>], earlier reports of what was likely FD date back to the late 1800s [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/folliculitis-decalvans/abstract/3,4\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,4</a>]. For several decades, there was much diagnostic confusion between FD and other cicatricial alopecias [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/folliculitis-decalvans/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H472589766\"><span class=\"h1\">EPIDEMIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>It is generally accepted that folliculitis decalvans (FD) is a rare disease; however, data on the epidemiology of FD in the general population are lacking. North American centers specialized in the treatment of alopecia have found FD in a minority of patients presenting cicatricial alopecia:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a series of 358 patients with biopsy-proven cicatricial alopecia evaluated at a center in Texas, 9 percent were given a diagnosis of FD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/folliculitis-decalvans/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a retrospective study of 112 patients diagnosed with primary cicatricial alopecia in Vancouver, British Colombia, 11 percent had a diagnosis of FD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/folliculitis-decalvans/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].</p><p/><p>Findings from the author's practice support these observations; in 2012, 5 of 64 patients (8 percent) with cicatricial alopecia evaluated by the author had FD. The patients with FD represented a relatively small proportion of all patients who presented for the evaluation of hair loss; FD accounted for 1.6 percent of all hair loss patients seen.</p><p>Both men and women develop FD. However, most case series demonstrate a male predominance, with male to female ratios ranging from 1.3:1 to 6.5:1 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/folliculitis-decalvans/abstract/7-13\" class=\"abstract_t\">7-13</a>]. Classic FD has not been reported in children. However, tufted folliculitis, a condition that may be a clinical variant of FD or a distinct entity, has been reported in a 10-year-old child and a 17-year-old child [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/folliculitis-decalvans/abstract/9,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,14</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H472589778\" class=\"local\">'Clinical features'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H472589772\"><span class=\"h1\">PATHOGENESIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The cause of folliculitis decalvans (FD) is unknown. Although <em>Staphylococcus aureus</em> is frequently found in cultures taken from pustules from sites of FD, FD is not considered to be a simple bacterial infection. The most accepted theory for the pathogenesis of FD is the concept that FD is caused by staphylococcal superantigens that bind to class II major histocompatability complex (MHC) proteins, causing nonspecific activation of T lymphocytes, resulting in release of cytokines and follicular destruction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/folliculitis-decalvans/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. </p><p>Other proposed contributors to the development of FD include defects in cell-mediated immunity or leukocyte function (eg, a defect that results in intracellular persistence of organisms after phagocytosis) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/folliculitis-decalvans/abstract/6,16\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,16</a>], an autoimmune process [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/folliculitis-decalvans/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>], a genetically-determined immune deficiency [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/folliculitis-decalvans/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>], pathogenic biofilms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/folliculitis-decalvans/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>], and a congenital abnormality of follicular orifices [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/folliculitis-decalvans/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. In support of a role for genetic susceptibility in a subset of patients with FD, several familial cases have been reported [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/folliculitis-decalvans/abstract/19-21\" class=\"abstract_t\">19-21</a>].</p><p>The immunologic events that may contribute to FD were investigated in a study in which biopsy specimens from newly diagnosed patients with FD and other scalp disorders were evaluated with immunohistochemical stains [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/folliculitis-decalvans/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. The major findings of this study included: CD4+ T cells outnumbered CD8+ T cells in the inflammatory infiltrate in FD, cytokine expression patterns suggested both Th1 and Th2 mediated immune responses in FD, IL-8 and ICAM-1 expression in the follicular epithelium may contribute to neutrophil recruitment in FD, and fibrogenic cytokines such as FGF-beta and TGF-beta may play a role in FD-related scarring. Unexpectedly, the study also found only weak to moderate expression of IL-1 beta and TNF-alpha, cytokines strongly associated with superantigen stimulation, in specimens from sites of FD. Additional research is necessary to clarify the pathogenic mechanisms that lead to the development of FD.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H472589778\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL FEATURES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The key clinical features of active folliculitis decalvans (FD) are (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F91503%7EDERM%2F87488\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef91503 graphicRef87488 \">picture 1A-B</a>):</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>One or more confluent areas of scarring alopecia on the scalp</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Multiple pustules (with or without inflammatory papules) on the scalp, particularly at the periphery of areas of alopecia </p><p/><p>FD may involve any area of the scalp and multifocal involvement on the scalp is common [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/folliculitis-decalvans/abstract/7,16\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,16</a>]. While there are case reports of FD in places other than the scalp, such as the beard, face, and nape of the neck, this is uncommon [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/folliculitis-decalvans/abstract/7,22,23\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,22,23</a>]. </p><p>The patches of alopecia exhibit the smooth surface and absent follicular orifices that are characteristic signs of cicatricial alopecia. This contrasts with noncicatricial alopecia, in which the follicular orifices are characteristically preserved. The patches of alopecia gradually enlarge as the disease progresses. </p><p>In addition to crops of pustules and inflammatory papules at the periphery of areas of alopecia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/folliculitis-decalvans/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>], tufted hairs (4 to 20 hair shafts emerging from a single follicular orifice) also may be present, a feature referred to as &quot;tufted folliculitis&quot; (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F91505%7EDERM%2F87489\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef91505 graphicRef87489 \">picture 2A-B</a>). Tufted folliculitis is not exclusive to FD and may be seen in other forms of cicatricial alopecia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/folliculitis-decalvans/abstract/6,24\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,24</a>]. There is disagreement about whether patients in whom tufted folliculitis is the predominating feature have a clinical variant of FD or whether tufted folliculitis is a distinct disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/folliculitis-decalvans/abstract/6,9,10,25,26\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,9,10,25,26</a>]. </p><p>Perifollicular scale extending onto the hair shaft may be visible in patients with FD. Tunneling of hair shafts beneath the skin surface is an additional feature that may be present (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F91506\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef91506 \">picture 2C</a>). Perifollicular scale may be seen in other forms of lymphocytic or neutrophilic cicatricial alopecia. In contrast, tunneling of hair shafts typically is limited to neutrophilic cicatricial alopecia. </p><p>The clinical findings of FD may be asymptomatic or accompanied by pruritus or pain. Purulent discharge and spontaneous bleeding from affected areas are additional bothersome symptoms that may be present.</p><p>The appearance of quiescent or partially treated FD differs from active disease (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F91506\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef91506 \">picture 2C</a>). These patients lack pustules and may present only with scarring alopecia and perifollicular erythema or scale. At this stage, clinical distinction between FD and primary lymphocytic cicatricial alopecias can be difficult.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H31147347\"><span class=\"h1\">HISTOPATHOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The biopsy findings of folliculitis decalvans (FD) are variable and change with disease activity. There are no pathognomonic findings.</p><p>The major histologic feature of early, active disease is follicular-based neutrophilic pustules, often with surrounding acute and chronic inflammation. Foreign body giant cells may be present, reflecting a reaction to follicular damage and the release of follicular contents into the dermis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/folliculitis-decalvans/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. The inflammatory infiltrate may extend from the perifollicular area into the interfollicular dermis. Inflammation usually is most prominent in the superficial dermis and mid-dermis and tends not to extend into the subcutaneous tissue. Consistent with the scarring nature of FD, fibrosis also may be detected. </p><p>Chronic inflammation is more prominent in long-standing disease; plasma cells are often present and only a few neutrophils may be detected. As a result, this stage of disease can be difficult to distinguish histologically from lymphocytic cicatricial alopecia. Late-state lesions may exhibit diffuse dermal scarring.</p><p>The histologic findings of FD differ from dissecting cellulitis of the scalp, a neutrophilic cicatricial alopecia that is characterized by deep seated, cystic nodules which merge to form sinus tracts. The extension of inflammation into the deep dermis and subcutaneous tissue in dissecting cellulitis of the scalp contrasts with the more superficial inflammation that typically is detected in FD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/folliculitis-decalvans/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H472589784\" class=\"local\">'Differential diagnosis'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H31147341\"><span class=\"h1\">DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The only findings required for a diagnosis of folliculitis decalvans (FD) are scarring hair loss and current or prior clinical or histologic evidence of a neutrophilic inflammatory infiltrate (ie, pustules or histologic findings). Once this is identified, careful assessment of the clinical and histological features still is necessary to confirm the diagnosis because the features of FD overlap with other forms of alopecia. A diagnosis of FD is made when the sum of the clinical and histologic findings are determined to be more consistent with FD than other forms of alopecia. &#160;</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2537377\"><span class=\"h2\">Physical examination</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The physical examination should include a careful examination of the scalp. The following clinical findings offer support for a diagnosis of FD: </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>One or more confluent areas of scarring alopecia on the scalp</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Absence of follicular ostia in areas of alopecia (a finding consistent with cicatricial alopecia)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pustules (with or without accompanying inflammatory papules), particularly at the periphery of areas of alopecia</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Perifollicular scale extending onto the hair shaft</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Tufting of hair shafts</p><p/><p>The presence of all of the features above is not required for a diagnosis of FD. In particular, when disease is quiescent, pustules and inflammatory papules can be absent. Additionally, perifollicular scale and tufting of hair shafts are common, but not uniformly present in FD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/folliculitis-decalvans/abstract/10,29\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,29</a>].</p><p>Certain physical findings support alternative diagnoses in patients with pustular, scarring eruptions on the scalp. As an example, patients who also exhibit fluctuant nodules and abscesses should be evaluated for dissecting cellulitis of the scalp. In addition, the possibility of acne keloidalis nuchae should be considered when a pustular scalp eruption is accompanied by firm, dome-shaped papules and involvement is primarily limited to the occipital scalp. (See <a href=\"#H472589784\" class=\"local\">'Differential diagnosis'</a> below and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-and-diagnosis-of-hair-loss#H638362\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation and diagnosis of hair loss&quot;, section on 'Physical examination'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-and-diagnosis-of-hair-loss#H1871427\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation and diagnosis of hair loss&quot;, section on 'Cicatricial alopecia'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dissecting-cellulitis-of-the-scalp\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Dissecting cellulitis of the scalp&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acne-keloidalis-nuchae\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Acne keloidalis nuchae&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Examination of the rest of the skin should be performed as part of the initial evaluation. This enables the recognition of involvement in areas other than the scalp and may aid in the identification of features that support a different form of alopecia.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H88765161\"><span class=\"h2\">Dermoscopy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Dermoscopy can be useful for visualization of the absence of follicular ostia in cicatricial alopecia. Additional reported findings of dermoscopic examination of FD include perifollicular hyperplasia observed in a starburst pattern, large follicular pustules with an emerging hair shaft, tufted hairs, and tubular perifollicular scale (ie, scale surrounding the base of the hair shaft) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/folliculitis-decalvans/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. More studies are necessary to confirm the diagnostic value of dermoscopic findings in FD.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2537371\"><span class=\"h2\">Biopsy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Because there are no pathognomonic histologic findings of FD and biopsy findings in FD are variable, the recognition of both consistent clinical findings and histologic findings is required to confirm a diagnosis of FD. </p><p>For patients with pustules (a clinical finding consistent with a neutrophilic inflammatory infiltrate), the most important goal of the biopsy is to confirm the presence of a scarring process. In contrast, for patients in whom scarring alopecia is clearly evident on physical examination but pustules are absent, the goal of biopsy is to evaluate the inflammatory infiltrate to distinguish FD from lymphocytic cicatricial alopecias. Performing a biopsy that includes tissue demonstrating both clinical signs of scarring (eg, smooth, shiny area devoid of hair and follicular ostia) and active inflammation (eg, pustules, erythema, scale, or crust) allows for evaluation for both of these important features. The ideal site for the biopsy often is the periphery of patch of alopecia.</p><p>A 4 mm punch biopsy that extends into the subcutaneous fat is our preferred procedure for pathologic evaluation of FD. Dermatopathologists differ on the number of biopsies that should be performed in patients with alopecia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/folliculitis-decalvans/abstract/30,31\" class=\"abstract_t\">30,31</a>]. Although some dermatopathologists prefer to receive two biopsies when evaluating alopecia to allow for examination of tissue in both vertical and horizontal sections, we find that a single biopsy specimen section horizontally usually is sufficient to identify histologic findings consistent with FD.</p><p>It is important to indicate on the requisition form that the specimen is for the evaluation of alopecia, since some laboratories will process the tissue differently than a standard skin biopsy. In addition, because other cicatricial alopecias can exhibit overlapping histopathologic features, it is helpful to give a brief description of the clinical findings, including morphology, distribution, and duration.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H88764834\"><span class=\"h2\">Culture</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Cultures of pustules should be performed in all patients who present with findings consistent with FD because treatment decisions are made based upon the culture results. Case series suggest that bacterial cultures grow <em>Staphylococcus aureus</em> in well over 50 percent of patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/folliculitis-decalvans/abstract/7,8,10,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,8,10,11</a>]. However, this finding is not specific to FD and can occur in superficial folliculitis and superinfection. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H92741648\"><span class=\"h2\">Other laboratory tests</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>No serologic or radiologic studies are useful for confirming a diagnosis of FD.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H472589784\"><span class=\"h1\">DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The differential diagnosis for folliculitis decalvans (FD) is broad and can vary with the clinical features present at the time of evaluation. Although the sight of pustules often first brings to mind superficial bacterial folliculitis, a very common condition on hair-bearing skin that is most often caused by <em>Staphylococcus aureus</em>, scarring alopecia is not a feature of superficial bacterial folliculitis.</p><p>When scarring and many pustules are present, the differential diagnosis focuses on other primary cicatricial alopecias that present with pustules, including dissecting cellulitis of the scalp, acne keloidalis nuchae, and erosive pustular dermatosis of the scalp. Attention to the clinical features usually easily distinguishes FD from these diagnoses. Tinea capitis, an occasionally pustular fungal infection that may result in secondary alopecia, also should be included in the differential diagnosis. </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Dissecting cellulitis of the scalp</strong> &ndash; Dissecting cellulitis of the scalp is an uncommon primary neutrophilic cicatricial alopecia that may occur alone or in conjunction with acne conglobata and hidradenitis suppurativa as part of the &quot;follicular occlusion triad&quot; (or &quot;tetrad&quot; if pilonidal sinus is included). Young black men are the most common population affected. Patients with dissecting cellulitis of the scalp develop follicular papules, pustules, fluctuant nodules, and abscesses on the scalp that lead to scarring (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F91507%7EDERM%2F91508\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef91507 graphicRef91508 \">picture 3A-B</a>). Fluctuant nodules and abscesses are not features of FD. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dissecting-cellulitis-of-the-scalp\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Dissecting cellulitis of the scalp&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Acne keloidalis nuchae </strong>&ndash; Acne keloidalis nuchae is a relatively common primary cicatricial alopecia that most frequently occurs in black men. Key clinical features include dome-shaped firm follicular papules and pustules on the occipital scalp (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F87490\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef87490 \">picture 4</a>). Keloidal plaques may also develop. The restriction of involvement to the occipital scalp and the development of firm papules and keloidal plaques distinguish acne keloidalis from FD. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acne-keloidalis-nuchae\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Acne keloidalis nuchae&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Erosive pustular dermatosis of the scalp </strong>&ndash;<strong> </strong>Erosive pustular dermatosis of the scalp is a rare primary mixed cicatricial alopecia that primarily occurs in elderly individuals. The disorder often follows trauma or surgery on the scalp. Key clinical features are sterile pustules, erosions, and crusted plaques that lead to scarring (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F87491\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef87491 \">picture 5</a>).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Tinea capitis </strong>&ndash; Inflammatory tinea capitis is an infection caused by dermatophytes that can mimic the appearance of FD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/folliculitis-decalvans/abstract/32,33\" class=\"abstract_t\">32,33</a>]. Key clinical features of inflammatory tinea capitis include erythematous plaques, crusting, drainage, and sometimes pustules (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F86627\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef86627 \">picture 6</a>). Cervical lymphadenopathy typically is present. Tinea capitis can be differentiated from FD with a potassium hydroxide preparation, fungal culture, or biopsy. </p><p/><p>In addition to the disorders above, the possibility of cicatricial alopecia secondary to <a href=\"topic.htm?path=erlotinib-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">erlotinib</a> should be considered in patients who develop pustules and cicatricial alopecia during erlotinib treatment. Case reports have documented the occurrence of erlotinib-induced cicatricial alopecia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/folliculitis-decalvans/abstract/34,35\" class=\"abstract_t\">34,35</a>].</p><p>A greater challenge for the clinical diagnosis of FD arises in patients who present with scarring alopecia and few or no pustules. The differential diagnosis includes FD and several primary lymphocytic cicatricial alopecias, including lichen planopilaris, discoid lupus erythematosus, and central centrifugal cicatricial alopecia. In such cases, close attention for subtle clinical features and a biopsy are valuable tools for diagnosis. </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Lichen planopilaris </strong>&ndash; Key clinical features of lichen planopilaris are perifollicular erythema, perifollicular scale, and multiple smooth patches of scarring alopecia (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F91509\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef91509 \">picture 7</a>). Common histologic findings are lymphocytes and fibrosis around hair follicles, with thinning of the follicular epithelium, a lichenoid interface dermatitis, and eventual follicular destruction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/folliculitis-decalvans/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. While there may be occasional plasma cells in lichen planopilaris, the presence of neutrophils <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> large amounts of plasma cells favors FD. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lichen-planopilaris\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Lichen planopilaris&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Discoid lupus erythematosus </strong>&ndash; Key clinical features of discoid lupus erythematosus on the scalp are erythematous scaly plaques that evolve to patches of scarring alopecia that often exhibit depigmentation, peripheral scale, and follicular plugging (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F91510\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef91510 \">picture 8</a>). There may be concomitant involvement of other sites on the head and neck (particularly the conchal bowls of the ears) or other sun-exposed skin. A biopsy reveals characteristic changes of lupus at both the dermal-epidermal junction and the follicular epithelium, consisting of hyperkeratosis, atrophy, vacuolar change at the dermal-epidermal junction, and a superficial and deep perivascular lymphocytic infiltrate [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/folliculitis-decalvans/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. Neutrophils are present only rarely. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-cutaneous-lupus-erythematosus#H4\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of cutaneous lupus erythematosus&quot;, section on 'Discoid lupus erythematosus'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Central centrifugal cicatricial alopecia </strong>&ndash; Key clinical features of central centrifugal cicatricial alopecia are scarring alopecia that begins on the crown of the scalp and expands centrifugally (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F91511\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef91511 \">picture 9</a>). The disorder is most common in women of African descent. Pruritus may or may not be present. Scale and erythema are usually absent. Occasionally pustules are present, which may contribute to confusion with FD. In active disease, biopsy reveals a perifollicular lymphocytic infiltrate surrounding the upper follicle [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/folliculitis-decalvans/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. Premature desquamation of the inner root sheath may also be detected.

Successful treatment reduces symptoms, halts the inflammatory process, and prevents additional hair loss (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F91512\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef91512 \">picture 10</a>). </p><p>No randomized trials have evaluated the efficacy of treatments for FD and most information on treatment efficacy is derived from case series, case reports, and other documentation of clinical experience. Oral antibiotic therapy is the primary mode of treatment for FD. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H85442841\"><span class=\"h2\">Patient selection</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Treatment is most beneficial for patients with active disease. Active FD is suggested by pustules, erythema, symptoms, or progressive scarring or hair loss. Patients with end-stage FD in which signs of active disease are absent are unlikely to benefit from treatment.</p><p>Providing patients with realistic expectations for treatment is an important part of patient management. We inform all patients of the variability in the response to treatment and the potential for relapse. In addition, we explain that although successful treatment can prevent further hair loss, regrowth of hair from sites where FD has destroyed hair follicles will not occur (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F91512\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef91512 \">picture 10</a>). </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2537418\"><span class=\"h2\">First-line treatment</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients with FD generally require systemic therapy. Our first-line treatment for FD typically is a tetracycline-class oral antibiotic, provided antibiotic cultures demonstrate susceptibility to tetracyclines. Tetracyclines also are our preferred initial treatments for patients with culture-negative FD.</p><p>Because systemic antibiotic therapy usually is necessary to achieve control of FD, topical antibiotic therapy is not usually given as the primary therapy. However, our clinical experience suggests that topical antibiotic monotherapy may be effective in select patients with very limited disease. (See <a href=\"#H85896813\" class=\"local\">'Topical antibiotics'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H528004\"><span class=\"h3\">Conventional oral antibiotic therapy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Oral antibiotic therapy guided by the results of culture and antibiotic susceptibility testing can be effective for reducing symptoms and clearing active lesions of FD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/folliculitis-decalvans/abstract/9,16,36\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,16,36</a>]. However, the long-term response to treatment is unpredictable; rapid relapse often occurs after the discontinuation of an apparently effective course of antibiotic therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/folliculitis-decalvans/abstract/7,16\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,16</a>]. </p><p>A variety of anti-staphylococcal and broad-spectrum oral antibiotics have been used for treatment. Tetracyclines are our preferred first-line antibiotics for patients with FD and culture results that demonstrate bacterial susceptibility to tetracyclines and patients with negative cultures because of the known antiinflammatory properties and well-tolerated nature of these agents. A small case series documents clearance of scalp lesions in several patients treated with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=minocycline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">minocycline</a> monotherapy (100 mg twice daily for one to three months) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/folliculitis-decalvans/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. </p><p>However, evidence for the efficacy of antibiotic therapy for FD is limited and insufficient to conclude that tetracyclines are more effective than other antibiotic therapies. Examples of other oral antibiotics that may be helpful for improving FD based upon clinical experience of experts include cephalosporins, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ciprofloxacin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ciprofloxacin</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=trimethoprim-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">trimethoprim</a><span class=\"nowrap\">/sulfamethoxazole,</span> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=erythromycin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">erythromycin</a> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/folliculitis-decalvans/abstract/6,9,19,36\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,9,19,36</a>]. </p><p>When treating adults with FD with antibiotics, our initial course of treatment varies in duration, depending on disease activity and the response to treatment. Our standard dose for tetracyclines for adults with FD is 50 to 100 mg of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=doxycycline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">doxycycline</a> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=minocycline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">minocycline</a> given twice daily. Symptoms often improve within one to two months after the start of treatment. </p><p>In patients who respond to antibiotic therapy within one to two months, the medication can be tapered or discontinued after approximately three months of treatment, with the knowledge that the disease often recurs. If symptoms recur quickly after treatment cessation, we reinitiate treatment. Once the disease is under control, we taper the antibiotic to the lowest dose that maintains remission.</p><p>Patients who do not respond within one to two months may be given longer courses of conventional antibiotic treatment provided signs of progressive improvement are evident. If a patient fails to respond to conventional oral antibiotic therapy and repeat culture and susceptibility testing does not demonstrate a reason for resistance, we proceed to second-line therapy. (See <a href=\"#H717751\" class=\"local\">'Second-line therapy'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H85896813\"><span class=\"h3\">Topical antibiotics</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>No studies have evaluated the efficacy of topical antibiotic monotherapy in FD. However, our experience with topical <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clindamycin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">clindamycin</a> in a few patients with very mild FD (few active lesions and limited, fairly stable, non-disfiguring scarring) suggests that some patients can achieve disease control with topical therapy. We generally restrict topical antibiotic therapy to patients with mild FD who desire to avoid systemic antibiotic therapy.

Both rifampin and clindamycin have activity against <em>Staphylococcus aureus</em>, and are lipid soluble and kill intracytoplasmic organisms, making them highly efficacious antibacterial agents.

Combination therapy with rifampin (300 mg twice daily) and clindamycin (300 mg twice daily) was given to 18 patients with FD for an initial treatment course of 10 weeks. All of the patients had cultures positive for <em>Staphylococcus aureus</em> and previously had experienced improvement with systemic antibiotics selected based upon culture and antibiotic susceptibility test results, but experienced disease recurrences during or after treatment. </p><p>After one 10-week course of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=rifampin-rifampicin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">rifampin</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clindamycin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">clindamycin</a>, 10 of 18 patients were clear of disease and did not experience a recurrence during follow-up of 2 to 22 months. Five patients improved after one course, but continued to have persistent symptoms during treatment and required extension to a 20-week or 30-week course of treatment. Of the remaining three patients, one patient required a switch to rifampin and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=doxycycline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">doxycycline</a> after the development of a possible drug eruption and one patient required an additional treatment course because of a relapse two months after treatment cessation. The third patient failed to respond and was noted to have a culture positive for rifampin-resistant staphylococci. Other small series have also documented both remissions and relapses after rifampin and clindamycin therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/folliculitis-decalvans/abstract/7,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,13</a>].</p><p>We use a similar regimen when we treat adults with FD (300 mg of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=rifampin-rifampicin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">rifampin</a> and 300 mg of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clindamycin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">clindamycin</a>, both given twice daily for an initial course of 10 weeks). Rifampin should always be given in combination with another antibiotic because there is rapid emergence of resistance to rifampin when the drug is given as monotherapy.

Patients with quiescent or partially treated FD may lack pustules and may exhibit only scarring alopecia and perifollicular erythema or scale, a presentation that may be difficult to distinguish from other cicatricial alopecias. The diagnosis of FD is confirmed by correlation of the clinical and histologic findings.

(See <a href=\"#H88764834\" class=\"local\">'Culture'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Data are limited on the efficacy of treatments for FD. Antibiotic therapy is the mainstay of treatment. Successful treatment consists of reduction in symptoms, arrest of the inflammatory process, and prevention of further hair loss (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F91512\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef91512 \">picture 10</a>). (See <a href=\"#H472589790\" class=\"local\">'Treatment'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients with FD, we suggest that an oral antibiotic selected based upon culture and antibiotic susceptibility testing should be used as initial therapy (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). We usually use <a href=\"topic.htm?path=doxycycline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">doxycycline</a> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=minocycline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">minocycline</a> and give an initial course of treatment that lasts two to three months. We treat patients with negative cultures similarly. (See <a href=\"#H2537418\" class=\"local\">'First-line treatment'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients who fail to respond adequately to conventional oral antibiotic therapy, we suggest a trial of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=rifampin-rifampicin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">rifampin</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clindamycin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">clindamycin</a> as second-line therapy (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). Patients treated with this regimen should be followed for treatment-related side effects. Rifampin should not be given alone because of a high risk for the development of antibiotic resistance. (See <a href=\"#H717751\" class=\"local\">'Second-line therapy'</a> above.)</p></div><div id=\"topicAgreement\">Use of UpToDate is subject to the <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/legal/license\" class=\"licenseLink\" id=\"sla_in_page\">Subscription and License Agreement</a>.</div><div id=\"references\" class=\"headingAnchor\"><h1>REFERENCES</h1><ol id=\"reference\"><li><a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/folliculitis-decalvans/abstract/1\" class=\"nounderline abstract_t\">Olsen EA, Bergfeld WF, Cotsarelis G, et al.
