The clinical presentation can be quite variable among patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/central-neuropathic-facial-pain/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. The current International Classification of Headache Disorders recognizes two entities that are central causes of facial pain [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/central-neuropathic-facial-pain/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Central neuropathic pain attributed to multiple sclerosis</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Central post-stroke pain</p><p/><p>This topic will discuss these conditions.

There may be a higher risk for developing central pain when the spinothalamic and quintothalamic pathways are affected, compared with suprathalamic lesions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/central-neuropathic-facial-pain/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">PATHOPHYSIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Although the mechanisms are poorly understood [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/central-neuropathic-facial-pain/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>], two general hypothetic processes have been implicated. In the first one, an &quot;irritative lesion&quot; affecting somatosensory pathways may lead to increased activity in otherwise normal nociceptive pathways. In the second one, neurons, remote from the lesion site, become hyperactive and hypersensitive after losing normal synaptic inputs through &quot;denervation&quot; [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/central-neuropathic-facial-pain/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Either way, the result of the central nervous system lesion is an abnormal, sensitized state of central structures leading to persistent pain in the absence of ongoing tissue injury [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/central-neuropathic-facial-pain/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h1\">GENERAL CHARACTERISTICS OF CENTRAL PAIN</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Clinically, the presentation of central neuropathic facial pain can vary significantly in severity, character, and location. Pain can be constant or intermittent, and pain intensity can range from mild to excruciating [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/central-neuropathic-facial-pain/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Characteristic symptoms, alone or combined, include [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/central-neuropathic-facial-pain/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Muscle pain, felt as cramping, constriction, or crushing.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Dysesthesia, most commonly with a burning character. Dysesthesia may be poorly localized and may be constant or intermittent in response to a stimulus (pain may be delayed after the stimulus in central pain).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Hyperpathia (a heightened response to noxious stimuli).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Allodynia (interpretation of nonpainful stimuli as painful).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><span class=\"nowrap\">Shooting/lancinating</span> intermittent pain.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Circulatory-like pain (pins and needles, stings, jabs).</p><p/><p>Internal and external stimuli, including cold, movement, light touch, and emotional distress, often exacerbate central pain [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/central-neuropathic-facial-pain/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Steady and evoked pain (allodynia and hyperpathia) is most commonly encountered in central pain caused by brain lesions, while neuralgic pain due to brain lesions is rare [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/central-neuropathic-facial-pain/abstract/3,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,6</a>], although it can occur such as in trigeminal neuralgia from pontine ischemic infarction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/central-neuropathic-facial-pain/abstract/7,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,8</a>]. Nevertheless, central pain can be difficult to describe, and most patients experience more than one pain quality [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/central-neuropathic-facial-pain/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Bizarre, vague terms might be utilized by patients attempting to explain what they are feeling [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/central-neuropathic-facial-pain/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].</p><p>Central pain results from central nervous system lesions. Hence, it should occur in association with neurologic symptoms <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> signs such as impaired somatic sensibility. The onset of central pain often coincides with, or shortly follows, the return of transiently lost or impaired sensation related to a lesion affecting somatosensory pathways. However, the onset of the pain may be delayed for years after the insult [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/central-neuropathic-facial-pain/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. In addition, central pain can occur even after a brain lesion that left no permanent, clinically-detectable sensory loss [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/central-neuropathic-facial-pain/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].</p><p>The diagnosis of central craniofacial pain is made when clinical evidence supports a disease process in the central nervous system and the pain characteristics are consistent with central pain.</p><p>The following are suggested general diagnostic criteria for central pain [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/central-neuropathic-facial-pain/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>History of disease in the brain or spinal cord</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><span class=\"nowrap\">Laboratory/radiologic</span> support of central nervous system disease</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pain starting after the onset of central nervous system disease, with the onset of pain often delayed</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pain with a regional distribution, rather than corresponding to individual nerves</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pain quality compatible with central pain</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Sensory abnormality is present</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Non-sensory symptoms and signs may or may not be present</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H93883932\"><span class=\"h1\">CENTRAL NEUROPATHIC PAIN ATTRIBUTED TO MULTIPLE SCLEROSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Central neuropathic pain attributed to multiple sclerosis is described as unilateral or bilateral craniocervical pain of varying presentation, with or without sensory changes, attributed to a demyelinating lesion of the central connections of the trigeminal nerve or upper cervical nerve roots in an individual with multiple sclerosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/central-neuropathic-facial-pain/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. &#160;</p><p>Current diagnostic criteria, according to the International Classification of Headache Disorders 3rd edition (ICHD-3), require all of the following [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/central-neuropathic-facial-pain/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Facial <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> head pain</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Multiple sclerosis has been diagnosed, with MRI demonstration of a demyelinating lesion in the brain stem or ascending projections of the trigeminal nuclei</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pain has developed in temporal relation to the demyelinating lesion, or led to its discovery</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Not better accounted for by another ICHD-3 diagnosis</p><p/><p>The pain may be continuous or paroxysmal.

As an example, a multiple sclerosis plaque at the trigeminal nerve entry zone in the pons can give rise to a clinical scenario indistinguishable from classic trigeminal neuralgia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/central-neuropathic-facial-pain/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. Trigeminal neuralgia occurs in 1 to 2 percent of patients with multiple sclerosis, about 20 times the prevalence in the general population [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/central-neuropathic-facial-pain/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. Conversely, multiple sclerosis is the cause of trigeminal neuralgia in about 2 percent of patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/central-neuropathic-facial-pain/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>].

It is not explicable by a lesion of the peripheral trigeminal nerve or other cranial or cervical nerves. The pain is attributed to a lesion involving the ascending projections of the trigeminal nuclei, with possible involvement of the cervical spinothalamic pathways and cortical processing. Depending on the specific site of the lesion, the ipsilateral trunk <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> limbs may be affected. The disorder affects 0.5 to 8 percent of stroke victims [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/central-neuropathic-facial-pain/abstract/11-14\" class=\"abstract_t\">11-14</a>]. </p><p>Diagnostic criteria for central post-stroke pain according to the International Classification of Headache Disorders 3rd edition (ICHD-3) require all of the following [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/central-neuropathic-facial-pain/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Facial <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> head pain</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Ischemic or hemorrhagic stroke has occurred</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Evidence of causation demonstrated by both of the following:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Pain has developed within six months after the stroke</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Imaging (usually MRI) has demonstrated a vascular lesion in an appropriate site</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Not better accounted for by another ICHD-3 diagnosis</p><p/><p>The pain is usually persistent but can also be paroxysmal [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/central-neuropathic-facial-pain/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. In contradistinction to the ICHD-3 diagnostic criteria [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/central-neuropathic-facial-pain/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>], its onset may be delayed months or even years after the stroke [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/central-neuropathic-facial-pain/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. The intensity of the pain may vary, may increase by <span class=\"nowrap\">physical/emotional</span> stress, and may be alleviated by relaxation.

Furthermore, it is unknown whether a treatment that is effective in one central pain syndrome can be beneficial in another [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/central-neuropathic-facial-pain/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. It is therefore difficult to apply available guidelines for neuropathic or central pain management to facial pain specifically [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/central-neuropathic-facial-pain/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>].</p><p>A treatment algorithm for neuropathic pain has been proposed based upon a systematic review of randomized clinical trials in various central and peripheral neuropathic pain conditions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/central-neuropathic-facial-pain/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. European Federation of the Neurological Societies (EFNS) guidelines from 2010 have similar recommendations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/central-neuropathic-facial-pain/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>].

Rash is the most common side effect associated with lamotrigine treatment and requires discontinuation of the drug, since a hypersensitivity reaction may result and lead to life-threatening complications such as Stevens-Johnson syndrome and toxic epidermal necrolysis.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H23\"><span class=\"h1\">NEUROMODULATION AND SURGERY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Neuromodulation and invasive procedures to treat central neuropathic facial pain are reserved for patients with significant disability who have failed noninvasive measures [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/central-neuropathic-facial-pain/abstract/6,25\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,25</a>]. Transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation is recommended as an initial option by some authors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/central-neuropathic-facial-pain/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Chronic electrical stimulation of the gasserian ganglion provided at least 50 percent relief in five of seven patients with central post-stroke facial pain in one series [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/central-neuropathic-facial-pain/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>].</p><p>Encouraging results have been obtained since the 1990s with chronic motor cortex stimulation. However, 2016 guidelines from the European Academy of Neurology found only poor to moderate quality of evidence that motor cortex stimulation is efficacious for neuropathic pain [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/central-neuropathic-facial-pain/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. The relief after motor cortex stimulation may subside with time [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/central-neuropathic-facial-pain/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].</p><p>Deep brain stimulation and destructive lesions, such as medial thalamotomy, are last resort procedures, only considered after other alternatives have failed and only in specialized centers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/central-neuropathic-facial-pain/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4055013459\"><span class=\"h1\">SOCIETY GUIDELINE LINKS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Links to society and government-sponsored guidelines from selected countries and regions around the world are provided separately.

(See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Anatomy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Facial pain attributed to multiple sclerosis is characterized by unilateral or bilateral facial pain, with or without dysesthesia, attributed to a demyelinating lesion of the central connections of the trigeminal nerve. (See <a href=\"#H93883932\" class=\"local\">'Central neuropathic pain attributed to multiple sclerosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Central post-stroke pain is characterized by unilateral pain and dysesthesia associated with impaired sensation involving part or the whole of the face, not explicable by a lesion of the trigeminal nerve. (See <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'Central post-stroke pain'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Limited scientific evidence is available regarding pharmacotherapy for most types of central pain. Except for a few drugs, treatment is based on anecdotal observations and consensus opinions. (See <a href=\"#H12\" class=\"local\">'Pharmacologic treatment'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients with neuralgic central neuropathic pain attributed to multiple sclerosis or stroke, we suggest treatment with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=carbamazepine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">carbamazepine</a>&nbsp;(<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). (See <a href=\"#H12\" class=\"local\">'Pharmacologic treatment'</a> above and <a href=\"#H15\" class=\"local\">'Carbamazepine'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients with non-neuralgic central post-stroke pain or non-neuralgic pain from multiple sclerosis, we suggest initial therapy with tricyclic antidepressants (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). <a href=\"topic.htm?path=amitriptyline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Amitriptyline</a> is the preferred tricyclic.
