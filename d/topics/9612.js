The United States military used ketamine as a field anesthetic during the Vietnam War, and the agent gradually gained popularity for use in brief surgical procedures as both an induction and maintenance agent for sedation and general anesthesia. Currently, use of ketamine is expanding to include acute treatment of psychomotor agitation in the emergency setting [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ketamine-poisoning/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>], acute therapy of depression [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ketamine-poisoning/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>], treatment of chronic migraine headache [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ketamine-poisoning/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>], treatment of status epilepticus [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ketamine-poisoning/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>], and in low or sub-dissociative doses to treat pain [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ketamine-poisoning/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].</p><p>By the 1970s, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ketamine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ketamine</a> became a widely used recreational drug, with street names such as K, Special K, Kitkat, Vitamine K, Ket, and Super K. Ketamine abuse is closely associated worldwide with the use of other &quot;club drugs&quot; including &quot;Molly&quot; or &ldquo;ecstasy&rdquo; (3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine or MDMA), gamma hydroxybutyrate (GHB), and methamphetamine, often in the setting of large dance parties (sometimes referred to as raves) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ketamine-poisoning/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=mdma-ecstasy-intoxication\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;MDMA (ecstasy) intoxication&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=gamma-hydroxybutyrate-ghb-intoxication\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Gamma hydroxybutyrate (GHB) intoxication&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methamphetamine-acute-intoxication\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Methamphetamine: Acute intoxication&quot;</a>.)</p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=ketamine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Ketamine</a> is produced by a complex, multistep synthesis that essentially precludes easy clandestine drug production. Most if not all ketamine sold illicitly in the United States is obtained by diversion of legitimate supplies.</p><p>This topic review will discuss the presentation and treatment of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ketamine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ketamine</a> intoxication, as well as poisoning with ketamine analogues, including methoxketamine, methoxetamine, tiletamine, and similar substances. A summary table to facilitate emergent management is provided (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F69157\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef69157 \">table 1</a>). Discussions of the use of ketamine for procedural sedation and induction for rapid sequence intubation (RSI) are found separately.

Ketamine is a dissociative anesthetic and hallucinogen. It acts primarily as an antagonist of the N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor, but also possesses some opioid receptor activity and sympathomimetic properties. The latter results in enhanced central and peripheral monoaminergic transmission and inhibition of central and peripheral cholinergic transmission [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ketamine-poisoning/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. The primary site of ketamine's central nervous system (CNS) activity appears to be the thalamocortical projection system, where it causes depression of certain cortical and thalamic functions and stimulation of parts of the limbic system [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ketamine-poisoning/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">KINETICS AND METABOLISM</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Two phases of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ketamine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ketamine</a> distribution can be distinguished following intravenous administration. The first phase corresponds to the anesthetic effect of the drug and is characterized by rapid distribution (half-life of 10 to 16 minutes), and a large volume of distribution, due to the drug's high lipid solubility. The second phase represents redistribution from the central nervous system (CNS) to peripheral tissues, with an elimination half-life of two to three hours.</p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=ketamine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Ketamine</a> undergoes significant first pass metabolism. The drug is metabolized by hepatic enzymes through demethylation, hydroxylation, and glucuronidation, and then excreted in the urine [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ketamine-poisoning/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h1\">DOSAGES AND FORMULATIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Common therapeutic dosages of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ketamine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ketamine</a> are 3 to 8 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> for intramuscular (IM) use, and 0.5 to 4.5 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> for intravenous (IV) use depending upon the procedure and the patient's age [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ketamine-poisoning/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. The usual induction dose is 1 to 2 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span>. Recreational doses typically range from 75 to 125 mg via the IM or subcutaneous route, 60 to 250 mg intranasally, 50 to 100 mg IV, and 200 to 300 mg orally [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ketamine-poisoning/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>].</p><p>The number of medications and designer drugs that are analogs of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ketamine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ketamine</a> has increased and includes methoxetamine, methoxyketamine, and tiletamine. There is limited clinical experience with the toxicity of these analogs, but a spectrum of poisoning that includes fatality has been reported [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ketamine-poisoning/abstract/13-17\" class=\"abstract_t\">13-17</a>]. The relative ease with which such drugs can be purchased via the internet and promotion of these drugs as having fewer adverse side effects than ketamine is expected to lead to an increase in poisonings from these substances. In the absence of more definitive data, we suggest that clinicians manage poisoning from designer drug analogs of ketamine in a manner similar to that described below for ketamine poisoning. (See <a href=\"#H16\" class=\"local\">'Management'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL PRESENTATION</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Vital signs</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>At low or therapeutic doses (less than 5 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg),</span> <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ketamine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ketamine</a> may cause slight elevations in heart rate and blood pressure. Higher doses (over 5 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg)</span> have inconsistent cardiovascular effects and may result in hypertension or hypotension, tachycardia or bradycardia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ketamine-poisoning/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. Massive overdose or use with other sedatives may result in respiratory depression or apnea [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ketamine-poisoning/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. One case of malignant hyperthermia has been reported [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ketamine-poisoning/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Central nervous system (CNS) effects</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span><a href=\"topic.htm?path=ketamine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Ketamine</a> is capable of causing a spectrum of CNS effects, ranging from mild agitation to coma, depending on the dose and patient susceptibility. Agitation and other psychiatric disturbances caused by ketamine are much less common and less severe than those caused by phencyclidine (PCP).</p><p>The desired clinical effect of iatrogenic <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ketamine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ketamine</a> administration is sedation or anesthesia. This results from dissociation, or interruption of the patient's sensory perception. Specifically, inability to sense pain is the effect that permits ketamine to be an effective anesthetic. Reflexes, including those involved in airway protection, are maintained. </p><p>In overdose, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ketamine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ketamine</a>, like PCP, is capable of inducing coma and deep anesthesia. In smaller doses (ie, those of most abusers), ketamine slightly alters sensory perception and acts as a hallucinogen. Effects include slight depression of mental status, diminished alertness, ataxia, and nystagmus. In abuse and with emergence reactions, patients may also experience extreme agitation, fear, and psychiatric disturbance [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ketamine-poisoning/abstract/21-23\" class=\"abstract_t\">21-23</a>]. The typical presentation of ketamine abusers who present for medical evaluation is impaired consciousness [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ketamine-poisoning/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>].</p><p>Emergence reactions occur as the effects of therapeutic doses of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ketamine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ketamine</a> dissipate following sedation. The phenomenon may involve vivid dreams, &quot;out of body&quot; experiences, and illusions, and can be associated with excitement, confusion, euphoria, or fear. The incidence of emergence reactions may be lower than previously thought [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ketamine-poisoning/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>].</p><p>The following manifestations may also be seen with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ketamine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ketamine</a> intoxication:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Amnesia (not as prominent as with benzodiazepines)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Moderate dilatation of pupils</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Increased muscle tone</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Absence-like effect (patient appears awake but is unresponsive)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Respiratory and airway effects</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span><a href=\"topic.htm?path=ketamine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Ketamine</a> is an preferred anesthetic because in therapeutic doses it does not cause cardiopulmonary depression [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ketamine-poisoning/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. In massive doses or in combination with other sedative agents, however, respiratory depression and apnea can occur [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ketamine-poisoning/abstract/26-28\" class=\"abstract_t\">26-28</a>]. Independent idiosyncratic effects seen after iatrogenic administration include laryngospasm, hypersalivation, and bronchorrhea [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ketamine-poisoning/abstract/19,29-31\" class=\"abstract_t\">19,29-31</a>].

First reported in 2007, ketamine-induced urologic injury is presumed to result from irritation of the urologic system, and may include urge incontinence, decreased bladder compliance, decreased bladder volume, detrusor overactivity, hematuria, and rarely hydronephrosis or papillary necrosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ketamine-poisoning/abstract/33-35\" class=\"abstract_t\">33-35</a>]. Ketamine-induced uropathy is being diagnosed and reported with increasing frequency, though it is unclear if this is due to an increase in incidence or clinician awareness. Ketamine-induced uropathy appears to be a permanent injury, though patients may have symptomatic improvement through medical or surgical treatment.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h2\">Presentation after iatrogenic administration</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>When administered correctly, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ketamine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ketamine</a> is generally safe.

Since most abusers insufflate (ie, &quot;snort&quot;) <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ketamine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ketamine</a>, the complications listed are rare outside of the hospital.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h2\">Presentation after illicit use</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span><a href=\"topic.htm?path=ketamine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Ketamine</a> abusers are typically adolescents or young adults. However, according to one case series, the age of abusers ranges from 13 to 60 years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ketamine-poisoning/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. Overwhelmingly, impaired consciousness is the presenting complaint. Patients may have white powder in or on their nose at time of presentation. Symptoms from ketamine abuse appear to resolve quickly in most instances. In another small case series, half of patients who abused ketamine were asymptomatic by the time a clinician evaluated them in the emergency department, while half complained of anxiety, chest pain, or palpitations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ketamine-poisoning/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>]. Hallucinations usually resolved prior to evaluation. Tachycardia was the most common physical finding; hypertension was also noted.</p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=ketamine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Ketamine</a> is frequently abused in combination with other illicit drugs, such as amphetamines, MDMA, and cocaine [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ketamine-poisoning/abstract/36,37\" class=\"abstract_t\">36,37</a>]. Toxicity from these other agents is common. In New York City between 1997 and 2000, 12 deaths occurred in people abusing ketamine, but in all cases multiple drugs were involved. Death following intravenous injection of ketamine alone has been reported, but such events are likely rare [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ketamine-poisoning/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. Animal data suggest that combined use of caffeine and ketamine exacerbates toxicity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ketamine-poisoning/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>]. This may be important in some cases, as use of highly caffeinated energy drinks is common in the nightclub settings where ketamine is often abused.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h1\">DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The differential diagnosis for <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ketamine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ketamine</a> toxicity varies with the major presenting symptoms. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=general-approach-to-drug-poisoning-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;General approach to drug poisoning in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Coma can be caused by many toxins, including opioids, alcohols, and sedative hypnotic agents.

After securing the airway and breathing if necessary, clinicians should treat bradycardia with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=atropine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">atropine</a> (0.01 to 0.02 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> IV, minimum dose 0.1 mg IV, may be repeated every five minutes to a maximum total dose of 3 mg). Tachycardia from psychomotor agitation is treated with benzodiazepines. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=advanced-cardiac-life-support-acls-in-adults#H11\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Advanced cardiac life support (ACLS) in adults&quot;, section on 'Bradycardia'</a> and <a href=\"#H23\" class=\"local\">'Psychomotor agitation, muscle rigidity, hallucination'</a> below.)</p><p>Treatment of hypotension begins with intravenous (IV) boluses of crystalloid. Hypotension requiring treatment with vasopressors is uncommon, but sympathomimetic agents such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=norepinephrine-noradrenaline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">norepinephrine</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dopamine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">dopamine</a> may be used.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H22\"><span class=\"h2\">Supportive care</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Once airway, breathing, and circulation are secured as necessary, supportive care is typically the only treatment necessary for <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ketamine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ketamine</a> toxicity. The adverse effects of ketamine typically last between 15 minutes to several hours, and prolonged care is rarely needed.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H23\"><span class=\"h2\">Psychomotor agitation, muscle rigidity, hallucination</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Psychiatric disturbance from <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ketamine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ketamine</a> toxicity is generally short-lived. Minimizing stimuli, such as light and noise, is helpful. When restraint is needed, physical restraints should only be used until adequate chemical sedation is provided. Benzodiazepines are the mainstay of such treatment. They are helpful in managing fear, panic, hallucinations, and emergence reactions. <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lorazepam-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Lorazepam</a> may be used in 1 to 2 mg intravenous (IV) doses, until the desired level of sedation is achieved. Alternatively, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diazepam-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">diazepam</a> in 5 to 10 mg IV doses may be used.</p><p>Muscle rigidity can occur with intravenous <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ketamine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ketamine</a> use, but is generally without consequence. <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lorazepam-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Lorazepam</a> may be given in identical doses for muscle relaxation if needed.</p><p>Butyrophenones (such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=haloperidol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">haloperidol</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=droperidol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">droperidol</a>) and other antipsychotic agents should not be used to treat agitation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ketamine-poisoning/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>].

When used illicitly, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ketamine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ketamine</a> is usually snorted, and occasionally injected intravenously or intramuscularly.

Patients who use ketamine illicitly usually insufflate (&quot;snort&quot;) or ingest the drug. They often have no medical complaints. Some describe anxiety, chest pain, palpitations, or hallucinations. Tachycardia is a common physical finding. Massive overdose or use with other sedatives may result in respiratory depression or apnea. Ketamine is capable of causing a spectrum of CNS effects, ranging from mild agitation to coma, depending upon the dose and patient susceptibility. It is frequently abused in combination with other illicit drugs, such as amphetamine, MDMA, and cocaine. (See <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Clinical presentation'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>When administered correctly, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ketamine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ketamine</a> is generally safe.

(See <a href=\"#H14\" class=\"local\">'Diagnosis'</a> above and <a href=\"#H15\" class=\"local\">'Laboratory evaluation'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H31\"><span class=\"h2\">Treatment</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Ketamine-induced laryngospasm is rare, but most frequently occurs in infants. It is typically self-limited, usually lasting less than one minute. Assisted ventilation using a bag-valve mask should be provided. In circumstances when laryngospasm does not resolve with basic airway support, endotracheal intubation may be needed. Hypoxia during administration of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ketamine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ketamine</a> for procedural sedation most frequently occurs from positional airway compromise, but respiratory depression or even apnea may occur. In such circumstances, clinicians should provide assisted ventilation. Rarely, endotracheal intubation may be needed. A summary table to facilitate emergent management is provided (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F69157\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef69157 \">table 1</a>). (See <a href=\"#H17\" class=\"local\">'Airway and breathing support'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Extreme salivation (sialorrhea) is a known complication of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ketamine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ketamine</a> administration.

We suggest pharmacologic treatment be given if respiratory compromise develops, continual suctioning is necessary, or excessive saliva interferes with a necessary procedure (eg, laceration repair) (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). Either <a href=\"topic.htm?path=glycopyrrolate-glycopyrronium-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">glycopyrrolate</a> (5 <span class=\"nowrap\">mcg/kg,</span> may be repeated once every two to three minutes; maximum single dose is 0.2 mg; maximum total dose is 0.8 mg) or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=atropine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">atropine</a> (0.01 to 0.02 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg,</span> minimum dose 0.1 mg; maximum dose 1.2 mg) may be given.
