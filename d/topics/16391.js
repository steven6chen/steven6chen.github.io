Some of them include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Problems with the placenta &ndash; The placenta is the organ inside the uterus that brings a baby nutrients and oxygen. One problem that can happen with the placenta is called an &quot;abruption&quot; (also called &quot;abruptio placenta&quot;). This is when the placenta pulls away or separates from the uterus before the baby is born. Another problem might be a placenta that doesn't give the baby enough nutrients or oxygen. When this happens, the baby grows slowly and is very small.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Problems with the baby &ndash; This could include birth defects or an infection.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Serious medical conditions in the mother &ndash; These include poorly controlled diabetes, kidney disease, or high blood pressure.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Problems with the umbilical cord &ndash; In rare cases, problems with the umbilical cord cause stillbirth. For example, there can be a knot in the cord.</p><p/><p>In about one-third of stillbirths, doctors do not know why the stillbirth happened.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13954679\"><span class=\"h1\">What are the symptoms of a stillbirth?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The main symptom of stillbirth is not being able to feel the baby moving inside you.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13954694\"><span class=\"h1\">Will I need tests?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>If you don't feel the baby moving, your doctor or nurse will check for the baby's heartbeat and might do an ultrasound. If there is no heartbeat on the ultrasound, it means the baby has died.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13954711\"><span class=\"h1\">What happens next?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>If your baby has died inside the womb, your doctor or nurse will probably ask if you want labor &quot;induced.&quot; That means that you will get medicines to start contractions, so you will have your baby in the next few days.</p><p>Some women prefer to wait until labor starts on its own, which usually happens 1 to 2 weeks after a fetus dies. But sometimes it is not safe to wait. Rarely, women need to have a C-section, which is surgery to get the baby out.</p><p>After the baby is delivered, the doctor will do tests to try to find out why the stillbirth happened.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13954726\"><span class=\"h1\">Will I be able to have a normal pregnancy after a stillbirth?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Probably. Most women who have a stillbirth go on to have healthy pregnancies. But you should talk about the risk of stillbirth with your doctor or nurse before trying to get pregnant again.</p><p>Your doctor might suggest that you wait several months before trying to get pregnant again. Before you start trying to get pregnant, see your doctor or nurse. He or she can help make sure you are as healthy as possible before and during any future pregnancies.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13954743\"><span class=\"h1\">How do we cope with the loss of the baby?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>It is normal to grieve the loss of the baby. What was a joyful time is now sad, confusing, and stressful. People react to the loss in different ways.</p><p>The people on your health care team will do what they can to help you cope. Your doctor will probably suggest that you talk to a counselor. Talking helps many people get through this difficult time.</p><p>Support groups might be helpful for some people. Support groups are groups of people who have gone through a loss such as yours and who get together to talk about their feelings. Your doctor, nurse, or counselor can help you find a support group if you would like to join one (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F82797\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef82797 \">table 1</a>).</p></div><div id=\"reviewProcess\"><span>All topics are updated as new evidence becomes available and our <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/home/editorial-policy\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"policy policy_editorialpolicy\">peer review process</a> is complete.</span></div><div id=\"topicRetrievedDate\"><span class=\"emphasis\">This topic retrieved from UpToDate on: </span>Apr 03, 2018.</div><div id=\"disclaimer\">The content on the UpToDate website is not intended nor recommended as a substitute for medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.
