Reduced myocardial contractility and systemic and pulmonary vasoconstriction induced by neurohumoral activation (eg, increased angiotensin II, aldosterone, and norepinephrine) play important roles in the progression of disease. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pathophysiology-of-heart-failure-neurohumoral-adaptations\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pathophysiology of heart failure: Neurohumoral adaptations&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The improvement in patient survival associated with the use of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers, beta blockers, and aldosterone antagonists provides direct evidence of the long-term deleterious effect of these neurohumoral changes. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-the-therapy-of-heart-failure-with-reduced-ejection-fraction\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of the therapy of heart failure with reduced ejection fraction&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Circulating levels of endothelin also are increased in patients with HFrEF and may contribute to the progression of left ventricular dysfunction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/role-of-endothelin-in-heart-failure-with-reduced-ejection-fraction/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>] and the development of secondary pulmonary hypertension [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/role-of-endothelin-in-heart-failure-with-reduced-ejection-fraction/abstract/2,3\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,3</a>]. The possible role of endothelin in HFrEF and studies of anti-endothelin therapies will be reviewed here. Unfortunately, while the pathophysiology of HFrEF strongly implicates endothelin in the progression of disease, the promise of endothelin inhibition as a novel therapeutic strategy has not been realized in clinical trials.</p><p>The role of endothelin receptor antagonists in treatment of pulmonary arterial hypertension is discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-pulmonary-hypertension-in-adults#H25\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of pulmonary hypertension in adults&quot;, section on 'Endothelin receptor antagonists'</a>.) </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">BIOLOGY AND PHYSIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Endothelin (ET) is a 21 amino acid, vasoconstrictor peptide first isolated in 1988 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/role-of-endothelin-in-heart-failure-with-reduced-ejection-fraction/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. In addition to its direct vasoconstrictor properties, ET can exert long-term effects on vascular smooth muscle cell proliferation and phenotype [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/role-of-endothelin-in-heart-failure-with-reduced-ejection-fraction/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].</p><p>Endothelin is synthesized as a large preprohormone (big ET-1) that is cleaved to pro-ET and then undergoes further modification by one of several endothelin converting enzymes to yield mature ET. Three isoforms have been cloned and sequenced: ET-1, ET-2, and ET-3.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>ET-1, the predominant isoform synthesized in the human vasculature, is the most potent vasoconstrictor.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>ET-2 is not found in human plasma but is present in the kidney and intestine where it has vasoconstrictor properties similar to ET-1.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>ET-3 has minimal vasoconstrictor properties; its major source is unclear, although high concentrations have been found in the developing central nervous system.</p><p/><p>Endothelins are rapidly cleared from the circulation by the lung, liver, and kidneys [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/role-of-endothelin-in-heart-failure-with-reduced-ejection-fraction/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Endothelin receptors</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There are two major endothelin receptors: ET-A and ET-B. Both receptors are expressed on several cells in the cardiovascular system including endothelial cells, vascular smooth muscle cells, cardiac myocytes, and fibroblasts [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/role-of-endothelin-in-heart-failure-with-reduced-ejection-fraction/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. A third receptor, ET-C, has not yet been isolated in mammals or humans [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/role-of-endothelin-in-heart-failure-with-reduced-ejection-fraction/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. Polymorphisms of genes encoding the ET receptors may increase the risk of development of cardiomyopathy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/role-of-endothelin-in-heart-failure-with-reduced-ejection-fraction/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].</p><p>Understanding the physiologic importance of ET-1 has been greatly aided by the development of ET receptor antagonists [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/role-of-endothelin-in-heart-failure-with-reduced-ejection-fraction/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. Some of these antagonists are subtype selective (eg, BQ123 for the ET-A receptor) while others are nonselective (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=bosentan-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">bosentan</a>), also referred to as &ldquo;dual-receptor antagonists.&rdquo; Selective ET receptor agonists (eg, sarafotoxin S6c for the ET-B receptor) are also available. As described below, some of these antagonists have undergone clinical investigation as therapy for heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Cardiovascular actions</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Activation of the ET-A and ET-B receptors appears to produce different hemodynamic effects. In vascular beds, ET-A receptors are located on vascular smooth muscle cells where they mediate both vasoconstriction and smooth muscle cell proliferation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/role-of-endothelin-in-heart-failure-with-reduced-ejection-fraction/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. In comparison, ET-B receptors are found primarily on vascular endothelial cells and mediate vasodilation via the release of endothelium-derived nitric oxide [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/role-of-endothelin-in-heart-failure-with-reduced-ejection-fraction/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. ET-B receptors are also located on vascular smooth muscle cells where they mediate vasoconstriction.</p><p>In humans, the vasoconstrictor actions of ET-1 predominate, resulting in concentration-dependent contraction of systemic and pulmonary arteries. In one study in healthy subjects, for example, selective antagonism of the ET-A receptor caused vasodilation associated with an increase in nitric oxide generation; this response was attenuated by inhibition of nitric oxide synthesis or antagonism of the ET-B receptor [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/role-of-endothelin-in-heart-failure-with-reduced-ejection-fraction/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. In contrast, stimulation of both ET-A and ET-B receptors mediates vasoconstriction in patients with left ventricular dysfunction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/role-of-endothelin-in-heart-failure-with-reduced-ejection-fraction/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. ET-1 may also play a role in inflammation by increasing vascular permeability, inducing cytokine release, and stimulating production of vascular adhesion molecules [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/role-of-endothelin-in-heart-failure-with-reduced-ejection-fraction/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h3\">Effects on myocardium</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Endothelin is expressed in the myocardium [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/role-of-endothelin-in-heart-failure-with-reduced-ejection-fraction/abstract/16-18\" class=\"abstract_t\">16-18</a>] where it has potent inotropic activity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/role-of-endothelin-in-heart-failure-with-reduced-ejection-fraction/abstract/19,20\" class=\"abstract_t\">19,20</a>]. The latter effect is mediated in part by increased sensitivity of the myofilaments to calcium [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/role-of-endothelin-in-heart-failure-with-reduced-ejection-fraction/abstract/20-22\" class=\"abstract_t\">20-22</a>]. On the other hand, there is some evidence that endothelin may have a negative inotropic effect in the failing heart [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/role-of-endothelin-in-heart-failure-with-reduced-ejection-fraction/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. In addition, ET-1 may be proarrhythmic in the setting of HFrEF [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/role-of-endothelin-in-heart-failure-with-reduced-ejection-fraction/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>].</p><p>ET-1 is the predominant isoform in the human heart and is largely synthesized by vascular endothelial cells [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/role-of-endothelin-in-heart-failure-with-reduced-ejection-fraction/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]; in addition, synthesis can occur in ventricular myocytes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/role-of-endothelin-in-heart-failure-with-reduced-ejection-fraction/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>] and fibroblasts [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/role-of-endothelin-in-heart-failure-with-reduced-ejection-fraction/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. In normal myocardium, ET-A receptors predominate on cardiac myocytes, whereas ET-B receptors are located primarily on fibroblasts. The density of ET receptors is 1.5- to 2-fold higher in atrial tissue than in ventricular myocardium [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/role-of-endothelin-in-heart-failure-with-reduced-ejection-fraction/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>].</p><p>In failing human myocardium, chronic stimulation of ET-A receptors by elevated plasma and myocardial endothelin (see below) results in myocyte hypertrophy and fibroblast proliferation. Receptor density is unchanged or slightly increased [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/role-of-endothelin-in-heart-failure-with-reduced-ejection-fraction/abstract/22,26\" class=\"abstract_t\">22,26</a>], but the functional effects of ET-1 are attenuated [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/role-of-endothelin-in-heart-failure-with-reduced-ejection-fraction/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>].</p><p>Myocardial ET-1 synthesis can be stimulated in vitro by hypoxia, ischemia, neurohormones (eg, norepinephrine, angiotensin II, and arginine vasopressin) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/role-of-endothelin-in-heart-failure-with-reduced-ejection-fraction/abstract/27,28\" class=\"abstract_t\">27,28</a>], and inflammatory cytokines (eg, interleukin [IL]-1b) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/role-of-endothelin-in-heart-failure-with-reduced-ejection-fraction/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. Many of these stimuli are increased in failing human myocardium and may contribute to ventricular remodeling. In a mouse model, cardiac overexpression of ET-1 was associated with increased expression of inflammatory cytokines and the development of a dilated cardiomyopathy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/role-of-endothelin-in-heart-failure-with-reduced-ejection-fraction/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>].</p><p>By analogy to the tissue renin-angiotensin system, it has been hypothesized that the expression of ET-1 in the myocardium results in high local concentrations of ET-1, which could in turn alter the structure and function of cardiomyocytes and fibroblasts. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=angiotensin-converting-enzyme-inhibitors-and-receptor-blockers-in-heart-failure-mechanisms-of-action\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors and receptor blockers in heart failure: Mechanisms of action&quot;</a>.)</p><p>In support of this hypothesis are observations suggesting that ET-1 plays an important role in the cardiac hypertrophic response to pressure or volume overload. This effect appears to be mediated by stress-activated protein kinases (SAPK), as inhibition of the SAPK pathway markedly attenuates the ET-1-induced increase in protein synthesis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/role-of-endothelin-in-heart-failure-with-reduced-ejection-fraction/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h3\">Other effects</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In addition to its actions on the vasculature and myocardium, circulating ET-1 modulates renal function and the activity of the renin-angiotensin and sympathetic nervous systems. In normal humans, ET-1 helps to maintain volume homeostasis, whereas in heart failure, increased circulating levels of ET-1 may contribute to renal vasoconstriction and sodium retention [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/role-of-endothelin-in-heart-failure-with-reduced-ejection-fraction/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>]. ET-1 stimulates the secretion of norepinephrine, angiotensin II, and vasopressin [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/role-of-endothelin-in-heart-failure-with-reduced-ejection-fraction/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h1\">PLASMA ET IN HEART FAILURE WITH REDUCED EJECTION FRACTION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Plasma endothelin [ET]-1 concentrations are generally increased in patients with heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/role-of-endothelin-in-heart-failure-with-reduced-ejection-fraction/abstract/27,34-36\" class=\"abstract_t\">27,34-36</a>]. Animal studies suggest that at least part of this increase is mediated by angiotensin II [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/role-of-endothelin-in-heart-failure-with-reduced-ejection-fraction/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. If this occurs in humans, then part of the beneficial action of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors in HF may be mediated by diminished release of ET.</p><p>In symptomatic HFrEF patients, resting plasma ET-1 is often two to three times higher than in control subjects. The elevation in plasma big ET-1 and ET-1 in HF is primarily due to increased production, rather than decreased clearance [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/role-of-endothelin-in-heart-failure-with-reduced-ejection-fraction/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>]. The increase in production includes enhanced release from the lungs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/role-of-endothelin-in-heart-failure-with-reduced-ejection-fraction/abstract/38-41\" class=\"abstract_t\">38-41</a>] and myocardial cells [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/role-of-endothelin-in-heart-failure-with-reduced-ejection-fraction/abstract/42,43\" class=\"abstract_t\">42,43</a>].</p><p>Plasma ET-1 may also correlate with pulmonary artery pressures and pulmonary vascular resistance [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/role-of-endothelin-in-heart-failure-with-reduced-ejection-fraction/abstract/34,39\" class=\"abstract_t\">34,39</a>]. Whether ET-1 contributes to the development of pulmonary hypertension or is a marker for its presence is uncertain [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/role-of-endothelin-in-heart-failure-with-reduced-ejection-fraction/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>].</p><p>Plasma ET-1 appears to be related to the severity of the HF, correlating positively with New York Heart Association class [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/role-of-endothelin-in-heart-failure-with-reduced-ejection-fraction/abstract/44\" class=\"abstract_t\">44</a>] and plasma angiotensin II [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/role-of-endothelin-in-heart-failure-with-reduced-ejection-fraction/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>], and negatively with left ventricular ejection fraction and exercise capacity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/role-of-endothelin-in-heart-failure-with-reduced-ejection-fraction/abstract/44,45\" class=\"abstract_t\">44,45</a>]. Short-term and intermittent outpatient vasodilator therapy (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nitroprusside-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">nitroprusside</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nesiritide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">nesiritide</a>) reduces plasma ET-1 levels [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/role-of-endothelin-in-heart-failure-with-reduced-ejection-fraction/abstract/38,46\" class=\"abstract_t\">38,46</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Role in prognosis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>To the degree that plasma ET-1 reflects the severity of HFrEF, it might be expected to have some predictive prognostic value. In one series of 120 patients with an ischemic or nonischemic cardiomyopathy, elevated plasma ET-1 (&gt;5 <span class=\"nowrap\">pg/mL)</span> was the most important prognostic marker in patients with left ventricular dysfunction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/role-of-endothelin-in-heart-failure-with-reduced-ejection-fraction/abstract/47\" class=\"abstract_t\">47</a>]. Patients with increased plasma ET-1 had a significantly higher one-year mortality than those with normal values (21 versus 4 percent, p = 0.001).</p><p>Plasma big ET-1 also has predictive value and may improve the short-term prognostic accuracy of VO2max measured during exercise testing. This was illustrated in a report of 226 patients with chronic HFrEF who were stable on oral therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/role-of-endothelin-in-heart-failure-with-reduced-ejection-fraction/abstract/48\" class=\"abstract_t\">48</a>]. The one-year survival free of death or prioritization for urgent transplant was significantly lower in patients with a serum big ET-1 concentration &ge;4.3 <span class=\"nowrap\">fmol/mL</span> compared with those with lower levels (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F58488\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef58488 \">figure 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/role-of-endothelin-in-heart-failure-with-reduced-ejection-fraction/abstract/48\" class=\"abstract_t\">48</a>]. In a multivariate stepwise regression analysis, serum big ET-1 was independently predictive of outcome. In subsequent studies that analyzed a panel of neurohormones in patients with severe HFrEF, big ET-1 and ET-1 were found to be superior to natriuretic peptides in predicting long-term survival [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/role-of-endothelin-in-heart-failure-with-reduced-ejection-fraction/abstract/49,50\" class=\"abstract_t\">49,50</a>].

As noted above, activation of the ET-B receptors results in vasodilation via the release of nitric oxide [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/role-of-endothelin-in-heart-failure-with-reduced-ejection-fraction/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. Thus, selective inhibition of the ET-B receptor may have adverse effects on cardiac and renal hemodynamics due to vasoconstriction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/role-of-endothelin-in-heart-failure-with-reduced-ejection-fraction/abstract/13,56\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,56</a>].</p><p>Animal models also suggest that adverse effects can occur with ET receptor blockade.

In dogs with pacing-induced HFrEF, early administration of an ET-A receptor antagonist caused further activation of the renin-angiotensin and ET systems and sustained sodium and water retention [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/role-of-endothelin-in-heart-failure-with-reduced-ejection-fraction/abstract/58\" class=\"abstract_t\">58</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h1\">ET RECEPTOR ANTAGONISTS IN HUMAN HF</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The preceding experimental observations provided the rationale for the administration of endothelin (ET) receptor antagonists to patients with heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/role-of-endothelin-in-heart-failure-with-reduced-ejection-fraction/abstract/59\" class=\"abstract_t\">59</a>].

However, a large phase III study testing the effects of intravenous tezosentan (a dual-receptor antagonist) on morbidity and mortality in patients with acute decompensated HFrEF was stopped because of lack of efficacy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/role-of-endothelin-in-heart-failure-with-reduced-ejection-fraction/abstract/66\" class=\"abstract_t\">66</a>]. In addition, three large, randomized controlled trials (ENABLE, ENCOR, and EARTH), two of which have only been presented at American College of Cardiology meetings, have shown no benefit of chronic ET receptor blockade in ambulatory patients with HFrEF [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/role-of-endothelin-in-heart-failure-with-reduced-ejection-fraction/abstract/67-69\" class=\"abstract_t\">67-69</a>].</p><p>The ENABLE trial randomly assigned 1613 patients with New York Heart Association (NYHA) class IIIB or IV HFrEF and an ejection fraction less than 35 percent who were receiving optimal therapy with diuretics, beta blockers, and angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors to <a href=\"topic.htm?path=bosentan-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">bosentan</a> (125 mg twice per day), a dual <span class=\"nowrap\">(ET-A/ET-B)</span> receptor antagonist, or placebo [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/role-of-endothelin-in-heart-failure-with-reduced-ejection-fraction/abstract/67,70\" class=\"abstract_t\">67,70</a>]. At one-year follow-up, there was no difference in the primary end point of death and hospitalization for HF (39 versus 40 percent for placebo) or all-cause mortality (20 versus 21 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/role-of-endothelin-in-heart-failure-with-reduced-ejection-fraction/abstract/67\" class=\"abstract_t\">67</a>]. These findings were consistent across subgroups. In addition, bosentan increased the risk of excess fluid retention and an adverse event (primarily an increase in hospitalizations for HF) during the first four weeks of therapy. Increases in liver transaminases to at least three times the upper limit of normal occurred in 2.7 percent of the placebo group and 9.5 percent of the bosentan-treated patients. Data from a large study of ET receptor antagonist therapy in patients with diabetes and nephropathy showed that body weight increase was associated with incident HF [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/role-of-endothelin-in-heart-failure-with-reduced-ejection-fraction/abstract/71\" class=\"abstract_t\">71</a>].</p><p>A similar lack of clinical benefit was noted in the ENCOR trial in which the dual-receptor antagonist enrasentan was administered for nine months to 419 patients with NYHA class II or III HFrEF and an ejection fraction less than 35 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/role-of-endothelin-in-heart-failure-with-reduced-ejection-fraction/abstract/70\" class=\"abstract_t\">70</a>]. Enrasentan therapy was associated with a higher rate of adverse effects requiring drug discontinuation (21 versus 8 percent for placebo) and a trend toward increased mortality. There was also a threefold increase in hospitalizations with enrasentan. In patients with asymptomatic left ventricular dysfunction, six-month therapy with enrasentan caused adverse ventricular remodeling despite an increase in cardiac index [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/role-of-endothelin-in-heart-failure-with-reduced-ejection-fraction/abstract/72\" class=\"abstract_t\">72</a>].</p><p>The effect of selective ET-A receptor blockade was evaluated in the EARTH trial, in which 642 patients with HF (79 percent NYHA class III) and an ejection fraction less than or equal to 35 percent were randomly assigned to one of five doses of darusentan or placebo [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/role-of-endothelin-in-heart-failure-with-reduced-ejection-fraction/abstract/69\" class=\"abstract_t\">69</a>]. At 24 weeks, the primary end point (magnetic resonance measured left ventricular end systolic volume) did not change significantly with any dose of darusentan compared to placebo. There were also no significant changes in symptoms, neurohormone concentrations, or clinical outcomes with darusentan. The withdrawal rate due to an adverse effect was 10.5 percent in the darusentan group versus 2.7 percent in placebo-treated patients.</p><p>Only one controlled study has tested the safety and efficacy of ET receptor antagonist therapy in patients with HF and preserved ejection fraction (diastolic HF). One hundred and ninety-two HF patients with EF greater than or equal to 50 percent were randomly assigned to receive to receive sitaxsentan 100 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day</span> or placebo for 24 weeks [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/role-of-endothelin-in-heart-failure-with-reduced-ejection-fraction/abstract/73\" class=\"abstract_t\">73</a>]. Sitaxsentan increased treadmill time but had no beneficial effects on symptoms, quality of life, or clinical events. &#160;</p><p>In summary, clinical trials of ET receptor blockade in patients with HFrEF have demonstrated no benefit and some evidence of harm. Some have suggested that lower doses with more aggressive diuretic therapy may be effective without toxicity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/role-of-endothelin-in-heart-failure-with-reduced-ejection-fraction/abstract/74\" class=\"abstract_t\">74</a>], but this remains unproven. The overall lack of efficacy in HF is in contrast to the role of ET receptor antagonists as an approved class of advanced therapy for patients with group 1 pulmonary arterial hypertension. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-pulmonary-hypertension-in-adults#H16\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of pulmonary hypertension in adults&quot;, section on 'Advanced therapy'</a>.) For patients with group 2 pulmonary hypertension (eg, due to left heart disease), there is no established role for chronic ET receptor blockade [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/role-of-endothelin-in-heart-failure-with-reduced-ejection-fraction/abstract/75\" class=\"abstract_t\">75</a>], although the Melody-1 study with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=macitentan-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">macitentan</a> is testing this hypothesis in patients with combined pre- and post-capillary pulmonary hypertension [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/role-of-endothelin-in-heart-failure-with-reduced-ejection-fraction/abstract/76\" class=\"abstract_t\">76</a>]. </p><p>A potential benefit limited to patients with end-stage HFrEF was suggested by a later retrospective study of ET receptor antagonist therapy in patients with end-stage HFrEF with pulmonary hypertension awaiting cardiac transplantation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/role-of-endothelin-in-heart-failure-with-reduced-ejection-fraction/abstract/77\" class=\"abstract_t\">77</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h1\">ET CONVERTING ENZYME INHIBITORS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>An alternative strategy for anti-endothelin (ET) therapy is to block the conversion of pro-ET-1 (big ET-1) to ET-1 with specific endothelin converting enzyme (ECE) inhibitors.
