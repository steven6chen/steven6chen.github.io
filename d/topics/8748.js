RTH was first identified in 1967 as a syndrome of reduced end-organ responsiveness to thyroid hormone [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/impaired-sensitivity-to-thyroid-hormone/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>] and was subsequently associated with mutations in the gene encoding the beta form of the thyroid hormone receptor (TR-beta) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/impaired-sensitivity-to-thyroid-hormone/abstract/1,6,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,6,7</a>]. </p><p>Impaired sensitivity to thyroid hormone can be grouped according to the underlying mechanism, as follows (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F50619\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef50619 \">table 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/impaired-sensitivity-to-thyroid-hormone/abstract/8-10\" class=\"abstract_t\">8-10</a>]: </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Thyroid hormone cell membrane transport defect (THCMTD)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Thyroid hormone metabolism defect (THMD)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Thyroid hormone action defects </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Resistance to thyroid hormone (RTH) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent3\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#45;</span>Thyroid hormone receptor beta gene defects (RTH-beta)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent3\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#45;</span>RTH of unknown etiology (nonTR-RTH)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Thyroid hormone receptor alpha gene defects (RTH-alpha)</p><p/><p>Disorders that cause impaired sensitivity to thyroid hormone will be discussed here. Resistance to thyrotropin and thyrotropin-releasing hormone will be discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=resistance-to-thyrotropin-and-thyrotropin-releasing-hormone\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Resistance to thyrotropin and thyrotropin-releasing hormone&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">NORMAL THYROID HORMONE PHYSIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Maintenance of thyroid hormone supply is ensured by a feedback control mechanism involving the hypothalamus, pituitary, and thyroid gland, as shown in panel A (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F70604\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef70604 \">figure 1</a>). A decreased thyroid hormone supply stimulates secretion of thyrotropin releasing hormone (TRH) from the hypothalamus and thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) from the anterior pituitary thyrotrophs, which in turn stimulates thyroid follicular cells to synthesize and secrete thyroid hormone. Conversely, thyroid hormone excess shuts down the system through the same pathway until a steady state is restored.</p><p>Local requirements for thyroid hormone are adjusted through additional mechanisms. One such system is the control of thyroid hormone entry into the cell through active transmembrane transporters [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/impaired-sensitivity-to-thyroid-hormone/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. Activation of the prohormone T4 (thyroxine) by removal of one of the outer ring iodine atoms (5'-deiodination) to form T3, or the inactivation of T4 and T3 by inner ring (5-deiodination) to form reverse T3 (rT3) and T2, respectively, provide an added level of control, as shown in panel B (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F70604\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef70604 \">figure 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/impaired-sensitivity-to-thyroid-hormone/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. </p><p>Finally, the presence and abundance of thyroid hormone receptors (TR), through which thyroid hormone action is mediated, determine the type and degree of hormonal response. Action takes place in the cytosol as well as in the nucleus of the target cell [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/impaired-sensitivity-to-thyroid-hormone/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. The latter, known as a genomic effect, has been more extensively studied, as shown in panel C (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F70604\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef70604 \">figure 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/impaired-sensitivity-to-thyroid-hormone/abstract/14,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">14,15</a>]. There are two TRs (TR-alpha and TR-beta), which are encoded by separate genes located on chromosomes 17 and 3, respectively. In addition, different isoforms are formed by alternative transcription and splicing. The receptors have structural and sequence similarities with DNA-binding and T3-binding domains (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F77294\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef77294 \">figure 2</a>). Other regions of the molecules are involved in dimerization with another TR (homodimerization) or another type of nuclear receptor (heterodimerization), and in binding corepressor and coactivator protein cofactors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/impaired-sensitivity-to-thyroid-hormone/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>].</p><p>In the nucleus, TRs act as transcription factors that regulate expression of specific genes, which are recognized through a DNA sequence known as the thyroid hormone response element (TRE). Dimers of unliganded (without T3) receptors bind to TREs and recruit corepressor proteins, resulting in inhibition of the expression of genes that are positively regulated by T3. When T3 binds to the receptors, the TR molecule undergoes a steric change that results in release of the corepressor protein, dissociation of the dimers, and formation of heterodimers of TR and retinoid X receptors that then bind coactivator proteins (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F70604\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef70604 \">figure 1</a>). These changes promote expression of the target genes and ultimately increase the synthesis of specific proteins. Through this mechanism, genes such as that for type 1 iodothyronine deiodinase are upregulated, and the gene for thyrotropin beta subunit is downregulated. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=thyroid-hormone-action\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Thyroid hormone action&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">MECHANISMS OF IMPAIRED SENSITIVITY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Since the first description of resistance to thyroid hormone [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/impaired-sensitivity-to-thyroid-hormone/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>] resulting from a receptor deletion, several different mechanisms that cause impaired sensitivity to thyroid hormone have been described and others are postulated. A classification and proposed nomenclature was proposed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/impaired-sensitivity-to-thyroid-hormone/abstract/8-10\" class=\"abstract_t\">8-10</a>] and is outlined below (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F110783\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef110783 \">table 2</a>). These defects should be considered in a patient with thyroid function tests that show a discordance of serum thyroid hormone and thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) concentrations, and each defect has its own constellation of test abnormalities and different clinical presentation. The types of known and postulated defects are listed below according to the physiologic sequence of thyroid hormone transport and action, rather than by clinical frequency.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Thyroid hormone cell membrane transport defect (THCMTD)</strong> &ndash; Reduced intracellular levels of thyroid hormone can be caused by defects in one of the transport proteins that allow thyroid hormone to enter cells (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F70604\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef70604 \">figure 1</a>). Defective cell-transport proteins may not reach the cell membrane or may not be able to transport the hormone. The resulting disorder depends on the specific hormone transporter affected. As an example, a defect in the monocarboxylate transporter 8 (MCT8) causes elevated serum concentrations of T3 and low levels of T4 and rT3; this defect also causes a severe psychomotor deficit [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/impaired-sensitivity-to-thyroid-hormone/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. This transporter is involved in the secretion of thyroid hormone from the thyroid gland [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/impaired-sensitivity-to-thyroid-hormone/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H39028808\" class=\"local\">'Thyroid hormone cell membrane transport defect'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Thyroid hormone metabolism defect (THMD)</strong> &ndash; T4, the major product secreted by the thyroid gland, is a prohormone that must be activated by conversion to T3 in the cell cytoplasm, as shown in panel B (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F70604\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef70604 \">figure 1</a>). Defects in any of the factors involved in this enzymatic deiodination reaction can cause a diminished production of T3, and thus reduced sensitivity to thyroid hormone. Defects may include abnormalities in the synthesis or degradation of the various deiodinases. As an example, some individuals have defective synthesis of selenoproteins, a family of proteins to which deiodinases belong [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/impaired-sensitivity-to-thyroid-hormone/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. Patients present with low serum T3 and high T4 and rT3 concentrations. (See <a href=\"#H39028884\" class=\"local\">'Thyroid hormone metabolism defect'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Thyroid hormone action defects</strong></p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span><strong>Abnormal hormone transfer to the nucleus</strong> &ndash; Before it can exert its genomic effects, thyroid hormone must be transported into the nucleus where it interacts with the thyroid hormone receptor (TR) to regulate transcription of target genes, as shown in panel C (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F70604\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef70604 \">figure 1</a>). Putative defects in transfer of hormone <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> its receptor to the nucleus are expected to reduce the hormonal action at the genomic level. However, no patients have been described to date whose thyroid hormone resistance is caused by this mechanism. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span><strong>Thyroid hormone receptor defect</strong> &ndash; The genomic action of thyroid hormone within the nucleus is mediated through the TRs. TRs are transcription factors that activate or repress transcription of specific target genes, as shown in panel C (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F70604\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef70604 \">figure 1</a>). Mutant TR proteins have reduced ability to bind cognate ligand or protein cofactors or to bind to DNA. Mutation of <em>THRB</em>, which encodes the thyroid hormone receptor beta (TR-beta), is the most frequent cause of resistance to thyroid hormone (RTH) and is defined as <strong>RTH-beta</strong>; affected patients have<strong> </strong>persistent elevations of all three serum iodothyronines with nonsuppressed TSH. In contrast, patients with mutations of the gene encoding TR-alpha have low serum T<sub>4</sub> and rT<sub>3</sub>, borderline high T<sub>3</sub>, and normal or slightly elevated TSH; this disorder is termed <strong>RTH-alpha</strong>. (See <a href=\"#H39030316\" class=\"local\">'RTH-beta'</a> below and <a href=\"#H1579863351\" class=\"local\">'Resistance to thyroid hormone alpha (RTH-alpha)'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span><strong>Abnormal cofactors or interfering substances</strong> &ndash; Nuclear hormone receptors including TR act in concert with a complex of accessory and modulatory proteins as well as the ligand, as shown in panel C (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F70604\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef70604 \">figure 1</a>). Putative defects in cofactors that normally stabilize the hormone-receptor complex or cofactors that repress or activate function could be responsible for reduced hormone sensitivity. As an example, some individuals have a phenotype that mimics that of a TR-beta gene mutation, but have no identifiable TR gene mutation. This disorder has been termed &quot;<strong>nonTR-TRH,</strong>&quot; and is thought to be caused by defects in TR cofactors, although no such defect has been definitively identified. (See <a href=\"#H39030331\" class=\"local\">'NonTR-RTH'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Postreceptor and non-genomic abnormalities</strong> &ndash; Thyroid hormone also can act at the level of the cytosol through non-genomic mechanisms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/impaired-sensitivity-to-thyroid-hormone/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. The clinical effects of defects in this component of TH action have not been defined.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H39028808\"><span class=\"h1\">THYROID HORMONE CELL MEMBRANE TRANSPORT DEFECT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The monocarboxylate transporter 8 gene (<em>MCT8</em>), also called SLC16A2 (<a href=\"http://omim.org/entry/300095&amp;token=O25AxH2ZrpTPG8o+GEGTWE+f+1U6iYBjaIZaykHKiEDZV9xRYorV6KEE++EEql3I&amp;TOPIC_ID=5827\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">MIM 300095</a>), encodes a thyroid hormone transporter. This transporter appears to play an important role in the movement of thyroid hormone into the brain and, therefore, in the effect of thyroid hormone on brain development [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/impaired-sensitivity-to-thyroid-hormone/abstract/18,19\" class=\"abstract_t\">18,19</a>]. Mutations in <em>MCT8</em> cause an X-chromosome linked syndrome combining severe psychomotor deficiency and abnormal thyroid function tests. The early hallmarks are hypotonia and high serum T3 levels.</p><p>Thyroid hormone is transported across cell membranes by a variety of transport proteins. These proteins belong to different families of solute carriers, organic anions, amino acids, and monocarboxylate transporters (MCT). It has been postulated that defects in transport proteins other than MCT8 also could cause reduced sensitivity to thyroid hormone (RSTH), but such mutations have not yet been identified [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/impaired-sensitivity-to-thyroid-hormone/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. Differences in cell distribution and kinetics, as well as transport of other ligands, provide each transport protein with a distinctive role in the cell-specific delivery of thyroid hormone [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/impaired-sensitivity-to-thyroid-hormone/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. Presumably, defects in each transport protein would result in a distinct phenotype, the nature of which may be predicted by the generation of mice deficient in a specific transporter.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H39028848\"><span class=\"h2\">Prevalence and inheritance</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The incidence of a thyroid hormone cell membrane transport defect (THCMTD) is not known. A sex-linked form of mental retardation with motor abnormalities was described in 1944 and subsequently named the Allan Herndon Dudley syndrome [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/impaired-sensitivity-to-thyroid-hormone/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. Its etiology was recognized in 2004 when the same defect, associated with characteristic thyroid function test abnormalities, was found to be caused by <em>MCT8</em> mutations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/impaired-sensitivity-to-thyroid-hormone/abstract/2,3\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,3</a>]. Since then, approximately 157 individuals belonging to 72 families with <em>MCT8</em> defects were identified, suggesting that this syndrome is more common than initially suspected [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/impaired-sensitivity-to-thyroid-hormone/abstract/22-25\" class=\"abstract_t\">22-25</a>] (and personal observations). Spontaneous <em>MCT8</em> mutations can be maintained in the population because carrier females are asymptomatic, thus no negative selection takes place.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H39028854\"><span class=\"h2\">Pathogenesis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>MCT8 is a specific transporter of T4 and T3 into cells (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F70604\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef70604 \">figure 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/impaired-sensitivity-to-thyroid-hormone/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. The clinical manifestations are probably caused by thyroid hormone deprivation, particularly in the brain during embryonic and early postnatal life. Indeed, there appears to be a correlation between the degree of functional impairment of the mutant transporter and severity of the psychomotor retardation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/impaired-sensitivity-to-thyroid-hormone/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. Several types of defects in <em>MCT8</em> can interfere with its function as a carrier protein, including reduced protein expression, impaired trafficking to plasma membrane, or reduced substrate affinity.</p><p>MCT8 defects are characterized by an unusual mixed pattern of thyroid hormone deprivation in some tissues and thyroid hormone excess in others. Transgenic mice deficient in MCT8 have thyroid function test abnormalities similar to humans with mutations in this gene and provide some understanding of the mechanisms responsible for the thyroid phenotype [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/impaired-sensitivity-to-thyroid-hormone/abstract/28-30\" class=\"abstract_t\">28-30</a>]. In this animal model, tissue levels of T3 varied depending on redundancy in thyroid hormone transmembrane transporters; the liver had high T3 concentrations, and brain T3 concentrations were low. The resulting increase in liver type 1 deiodinase and brain type 2 deiodinase enhances the generation of T3 and has a consumptive effect on T4. In addition, the impaired T3 uptake in some tissues, such as the brain, prevents its degradation by type 3 deiodinase. Another study in mice demonstrated that <em>MCT8</em> defects also cause impaired thyroid hormone secretion from the thyroid gland [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/impaired-sensitivity-to-thyroid-hormone/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>], suggesting for the first time that MCT8 mediates the molecular mechanism of thyroid hormone secretion, a process previously believed to be passive. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H39028860\"><span class=\"h2\">Clinical features</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Because <em>MCT8</em> defects are x-linked, virtually all affected individuals are male; they present during infancy or early childhood with neurodevelopmental abnormalities. A single female patient with a phenotype identical to that of males had a de-novo balanced translocation at the <em>MCT8</em> site [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/impaired-sensitivity-to-thyroid-hormone/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. Early signs, manifesting in the first few weeks of life, are hypotonia and feeding difficulties. Though variable in severity, the clinical presentation is very similar, with consistent thyroid test abnormalities. Gestation and delivery are normal, and affected newborns have normal length, weight, and head circumference.</p><p>With advancing age, weight gain lags behind, leading to microcephaly, while linear growth proceeds normally. Although truncal hypotonia persists, there is progressive development of limb rigidity, often resulting in spastic quadriplegia. Muscle mass is diminished and there is generalized muscle weakness with poor head control. Purposeless movements are common. Many infants have characteristic paroxysms of kinesigenic dyskinesias, consisting of body extension, opening of the mouth, and stretching or flexing of the limbs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/impaired-sensitivity-to-thyroid-hormone/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]. These paroxysms are usually triggered by somatosensory stimuli and last a few minutes or less. True seizures also can occur. Most affected children are never able to sit by themselves or walk, and have no speech.</p><p>Affected individuals present stigmata of thyroid hormone deficiency as well as excess. The psychomotor abnormalities are due to hormone deficiency, and the hypermetabolic state and difficulty to maintain weight are caused by hormone excess in some tissues. This coexistence of thyroid hormone deficiency and excess in the same individual is due to cell-specific differences in the expression of the various thyroid hormone transporters, as discussed above.</p><p>Although early death has occurred in some families, some individuals live beyond the age of 70 years. Female carriers do not manifest any of the psychomotor abnormalities described above. However, intellectual delay and frank mental retardation have been reported [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/impaired-sensitivity-to-thyroid-hormone/abstract/2,32\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,32</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H39028866\"><span class=\"h2\">Laboratory findings</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Individuals with <em>MCT8</em> defects have characteristically high serum T3 and low rT3 concentrations, in contrast to the other three syndromes of impaired sensitivity to thyroid hormone (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F50619\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef50619 \">table 1</a>). T4 has the tendency to be low, and thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) levels are normal or slightly elevated. Heterozygous female carriers have serum thyroid hormone concentrations intermediate between affected males and unaffected family members (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F65090\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef65090 \">figure 3</a>).</p><p>The diagnosis is confirmed by sequencing <em>MCT8</em>.

Otherwise, MRI may be normal or show atrophy of the cerebrum, thalamus, corpus callosum, and basal ganglia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/impaired-sensitivity-to-thyroid-hormone/abstract/22,24,34-36\" class=\"abstract_t\">22,24,34-36</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H39028872\"><span class=\"h2\">Treatment</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Treatment options for patients with <em>MCT8</em> mutations are limited to supportive measures, including the use of braces to prevent contractures.

Thyroid hormone is activated and inactivated by site-specific monodeiodination to provide the proper amount of active hormone at its site of action. Deiodinases are selenoproteins that require a selenocysteine for their enzymatic function. Inactivating mutations in <em>SBP2</em> prevent incorporation of selenocysteine amino acid into the nascent selenoproteins and thus alter the protein structure and enzymatic activity, causing a global deiodination defect [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/impaired-sensitivity-to-thyroid-hormone/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>]. <em>SBP2</em> is located in chromosome 9 and is expressed at a low level in all tissues and at a high level in testis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/impaired-sensitivity-to-thyroid-hormone/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>]. </p><p>Type 1 and 2 deiodinases (D1 and D2) catalyze the activation of thyroid hormone by 5' deiodination that converts T4 to T3.

Defects in a specific deiodinase have not been identified in humans, but if they did occur, they would probably interfere with thyroid hormone metabolism, with variable phenotypes as predicted by mouse models [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/impaired-sensitivity-to-thyroid-hormone/abstract/43\" class=\"abstract_t\">43</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H39028930\"><span class=\"h2\">Prevalence and inheritance</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The incidence of inherited defects of thyroid hormone metabolism is unknown.

The disorder is characterized by high serum concentrations of free T4 and usually free T3, accompanied by normal or slightly high serum thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) concentrations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/impaired-sensitivity-to-thyroid-hormone/abstract/1,51\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,51</a>].

(See <a href=\"#H14\" class=\"local\">'Laboratory findings and differential diagnosis'</a> below.) </p><p>RTH is the most common type of defect in thyroid hormone action. In most cases, RTH is caused by an inherited defect in the thyroid hormone receptor beta gene (<em>THRB</em>); this condition is termed &quot;RTH-beta.&quot; Subjects with the identical clinical and laboratory manifestations but no defect in <em>THRB</em> have non-thyroid hormone receptor RTH, or &quot;nonTR-RTH&quot; (see <a href=\"#H8\" class=\"local\">'Pathogenesis and categorization'</a> below).

One hundred and twenty-four different mutations have been identified so far among 343 unrelated families. Most of the mutations are located in the T3-binding domain of the thyroid hormone receptor (TR) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F77294\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef77294 \">figure 2</a>). They interfere with the function of the normal TR (dominant negative effect). One family has been described in which the affected subjects had complete deletion of the TR-beta gene [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/impaired-sensitivity-to-thyroid-hormone/abstract/57\" class=\"abstract_t\">57</a>]. This was inherited in a recessive manner because the single normal allele in heterozygotes was sufficient for normal function. Somatic mutations in the TR-beta gene have been identified in two TSH-producing pituitary adenomas [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/impaired-sensitivity-to-thyroid-hormone/abstract/58\" class=\"abstract_t\">58</a>]. </p><p>The severity of hormonal resistance varies among different subjects carrying the same gene mutation, such as affected siblings. The variation in phenotype is not fully understood, but probably results from genetic variability of cofactors involved in thyroid hormone action [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/impaired-sensitivity-to-thyroid-hormone/abstract/59\" class=\"abstract_t\">59</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H39030331\"><span class=\"h3\">NonTR-RTH</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In 15 percent of families with RTH, TR-beta gene mutations are not detected; this is known as &quot;nonTR-RTH.&quot; It is clinically and biochemically indistinguishable from RTH with TR-beta gene mutations (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F75538\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef75538 \">figure 4</a>). Mosaicism should be excluded by sequencing the receptor in DNA obtained from different tissues. However, mosaicism has been ruled out in several of these families in which inheritance was autosomal dominant and mutations in both TR-beta and TR-alpha genes have been excluded by the absence of genetic cosegregation. Mutations of one of the cofactors that interact with the receptors may be responsible for the resistance in these families [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/impaired-sensitivity-to-thyroid-hormone/abstract/60,61\" class=\"abstract_t\">60,61</a>]. </p><p>Patients with TR-alpha gene mutations have a different phenotype from RTH-beta and nonTR-RTH, and are categorized separately. (See <a href=\"#H1579863351\" class=\"local\">'Resistance to thyroid hormone alpha (RTH-alpha)'</a> below.)</p><p>In the past, RTH was subdivided into generalized (GRTH), isolated pituitary (PRTH), and isolated peripheral tissues resistance (PTRTH). This classification was based upon clinical findings alone and has no consistent genetic basis. Indeed, pituitary and generalized resistance to thyroid hormone can occur in individuals with the same mutation. Isolated peripheral tissue resistance to thyroid hormone could be the consequence of the development of tolerance to the ingestion of excess thyroid hormone [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/impaired-sensitivity-to-thyroid-hormone/abstract/51\" class=\"abstract_t\">51</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h3\">Effects on the hypothalamic-pituitary-thyroid axis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In RTH, resistance of the pituitary thyrotrophs to thyroid hormone raises TSH secretion, which increases the synthesis and secretion of T4 and T3 from the thyroid gland. The elevated levels of these thyroid hormones fail to downregulate the hypothalamic-pituitary-thyroid axis as they would in an individual without RTH, as shown in panel A (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F70604\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef70604 \">figure 1</a>). As a result, these patients have high levels of T4 and T3, and normal or high levels of TSH. Because of this apparent dissociation between serum thyroid hormone and TSH concentrations, the syndrome has been called &quot;inappropriate secretion of TSH.&quot; However, TSH secretion is not really inappropriate because the response of the thyrotrophs to thyroid hormone is reduced; to the contrary, it is compensatory and appropriate for the level of thyroid hormone action mediated through the defective TR-beta.</p><p>The TSH secreted by these patients is rich in sialic acid and has increased bioactivity, as compared with normal TSH [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/impaired-sensitivity-to-thyroid-hormone/abstract/62\" class=\"abstract_t\">62</a>]. This explains why patients with RTH have goiter and high serum T4 and T3 concentrations even though their serum immunoreactive TSH concentrations are normal or only slightly high. The relationship between serum TSH and T4 concentrations in patients remains negative log-linear, but the slope of serum <span class=\"nowrap\">TSH/free</span> T4 is lower, and the slope appears to be characteristic of the specific mutation involved [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/impaired-sensitivity-to-thyroid-hormone/abstract/62-64\" class=\"abstract_t\">62-64</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h3\">Effects on metabolism</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Because increased thyroid hormone secretion compensates for thyroid hormone resistance, most patients with RTH are clinically euthyroid, although the completeness of compensation varies in different patients and in different tissues in the same patient [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/impaired-sensitivity-to-thyroid-hormone/abstract/65\" class=\"abstract_t\">65</a>]. However, the level of tissue responses does not always correlate with the serum T4 and T3 concentrations, probably because of discordance between the hormonal effects on the pituitary and other body tissues [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/impaired-sensitivity-to-thyroid-hormone/abstract/63\" class=\"abstract_t\">63</a>]. For example, patients with RTH have increased muscle-derived resting energy expenditure, as a consequence of thyroid hormone-mediated mitochondrial uncoupling [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/impaired-sensitivity-to-thyroid-hormone/abstract/66\" class=\"abstract_t\">66</a>].</p><p>The magnitude of the decrease in T3-binding by the mutant TR-beta is correlated with the clinical severity of RTH in most patients, which is usually determined by measuring the serum free T4 concentration needed to maintain normal TSH secretion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/impaired-sensitivity-to-thyroid-hormone/abstract/63\" class=\"abstract_t\">63</a>]. However, some patients have a mild phenotype despite having mutations that result in marked impairment of T3-binding. In these individuals, the mutations are located in domains of the TR that, in addition to binding T3, also alter receptor dimerization or association with other proteins that mediate the dominant-negative effect of the mutant receptor [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/impaired-sensitivity-to-thyroid-hormone/abstract/67-69\" class=\"abstract_t\">67-69</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h2\">Clinical features</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The hallmark of RTH is the paucity of symptoms and signs of thyroid dysfunction despite the presence of high serum T4 and T3 concentrations.</p><p>Among all clinical findings, goiter is by far the most common (65 to 95 percent), followed by hyperactivity (33 to 68 percent) and tachycardia (33 to 75 percent) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F79670\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef79670 \">table 3</a>). These abnormalities usually lead to evaluation of thyroid function.

If hypothyroidism is present, clinical features may include growth retardation, delayed bone maturation, learning disabilities, mental retardation, sensorineural deafness, and nystagmus. Patients with symptoms of hyperthyroidism may have tachycardia, hyperactivity, and increased basal metabolic rate. Overt hypothyroidism is more common in patients who, because of erroneous diagnosis of hyperthyroidism, received ablative or antithyroid treatment to reduce their thyroid hormone level [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/impaired-sensitivity-to-thyroid-hormone/abstract/1,51,65\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,51,65</a>].</p><p>There is a high prevalence of attention deficit disorder (ADD) and learning disabilities in patients with RTH [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/impaired-sensitivity-to-thyroid-hormone/abstract/1,65,70\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,65,70</a>].

However, sensorineural deafness is common among individuals with RTH due to TR-beta gene deletion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/impaired-sensitivity-to-thyroid-hormone/abstract/57\" class=\"abstract_t\">57</a>]. In mice, absence of TR-beta-1 is sufficient to cause hearing loss [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/impaired-sensitivity-to-thyroid-hormone/abstract/71\" class=\"abstract_t\">71</a>].

A study of 27 RTH-beta subjects described functional defects of medium wave length cones and rods leading to deranged color vision; this was independent of endogenous TH levels or prenatal exposure to high or normal TH [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/impaired-sensitivity-to-thyroid-hormone/abstract/72\" class=\"abstract_t\">72</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H573770042\"><span class=\"h2\">Associated abnormalities</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>RTH is associated with an increased risk for autoimmune thyroid disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/impaired-sensitivity-to-thyroid-hormone/abstract/73\" class=\"abstract_t\">73</a>].

The concentration of thyroglobulin (the protein within which T3 and T4 are synthesized and stored) tends to be high, reflecting the level of TSH-induced thyroid gland hyperactivity. The abnormalities should be confirmed by repeat measurements several weeks later. Other causes of impaired sensitivity to thyroid hormone are associated with low levels of at least one of these thyroid hormones (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F50619\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef50619 \">table 1</a>).

This test provides a means to confirm the diagnosis, to obtain prenatal diagnosis, and to prevent inappropriate anti-thyroid treatment of patients with high serum levels of free thyroid hormone.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Individuals without an identifiable <em>THRB</em> mutation but with thyroid function tests consistent with RTH, may have nonTR-RTH. In this case, dynamic testing is required to confirm or exclude the diagnosis. In patients with RTH, the response of TSH to TSH-releasing hormone (TRH) is normal or exaggerated, depending on the baseline TSH level. TRH is not readily available in some countries, including the United States. The suppressive effect of administered thyroid hormone on TSH, cholesterol, and creatine kinase is blunted. Similarly, the stimulatory effect of thyroid hormone on sex hormone binding globulin and ferritin is attenuated (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F75538\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef75538 \">figure 4</a>). The diagnosis of nonTR-RTH is also supported by the presence of the characteristic thyroid function tests in other family members, which distinguishes nonTR-RTH from TSH-secreting pituitary adenomas. </p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15\"><span class=\"h2\">Treatment</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There is no treatment that will correct the defect of TR-beta function in subjects with RTH. Fortunately, treatment is not needed in most patients because the hyposensitivity to thyroid hormone seems to be adequately compensated by the increase in secretion of T4 and generation of T3. This is not the case in patients with limited thyroid reserve due to prior destructive therapy directed to the thyroid gland. These patients should be treated with a sufficient amount of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=levothyroxine-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">levothyroxine</a> to reduce their serum TSH concentrations to normal or near normal.</p><p>In general, treatments that ablate the thyroid gland should be avoided. Large glands have been successfully treated by the administration of a single high dose of L-T3 given every other day [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/impaired-sensitivity-to-thyroid-hormone/abstract/75\" class=\"abstract_t\">75</a>]. Patients with symptoms of thyrotoxicosis, more specifically tachycardia and tremor, usually respond to the administration of the beta adrenergic blocker, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=atenolol-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">atenolol</a>. Another treatment, triiodothyroacetic acid, has limited beneficial effect and is not available in North America. Patients with symptoms of ADD should be treated using standard regimens for ADD, independently from RTH.</p><p>In some patients with RTH, several peripheral tissues may be relatively more resistant than the thyrotrophs. Thus, the compensation for the hormonal resistance in these tissues is incomplete and judicious administration of a dose of T4 higher than that needed to restore TSH secretion to normal may be indicated. The dose must be individually determined by assessing tissue responses. In children, this should be done by regular assessment of growth, bone maturation, and mental development. <a href=\"topic.htm?path=levothyroxine-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">Levothyroxine</a> should be given in incremental doses, and the basal metabolic rate, nitrogen balance, and serum sex hormone binding globulin should be measured after treatment for four to six weeks before the dose is changed; bone age and growth should be followed on a longer-term basis. Development of a catabolic state is an indication of overtreatment.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H16\"><span class=\"h2\">Pregnancy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Management of thyroid hormone levels during pregnancy in a mother with RTH or a normal mother carrying a fetus with RTH is not straightforward. A pregnant woman with RTH is protected from adverse effects of her high thyroid hormone levels, but fetal thyrotoxicosis may occur in offspring that do not carry the mutation.</p><p>A retrospective study of a large family with RTH demonstrated that the adverse effect of thyroid hormone on the fetus was independent of that on the pregnant woman [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/impaired-sensitivity-to-thyroid-hormone/abstract/76\" class=\"abstract_t\">76</a>]. The prevalence of early pregnancy loss was increased fivefold in affected mothers, but not in couples with an affected father and unaffected mother. Two-thirds of their infants carried the TR-beta mutation, which suggests that nearly all miscarried fetuses had no mutation and thus, a normal response to thyroid hormone. Furthermore, unaffected infants born to affected mothers had lower birth weights and suppressed serum TSH concentrations when compared with affected infants. These adverse pregnancy outcomes are similar to those for infants with excess thyroid hormone, caused by gain-of-function TSH receptor mutations, who are born prematurely and have low birth weights [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/impaired-sensitivity-to-thyroid-hormone/abstract/77\" class=\"abstract_t\">77</a>].</p><p>Management of pregnancies in mothers with RTH who are carrying unaffected fetuses may warrant judicious use of antithyroid medication, depending on the wellbeing of the fetus [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/impaired-sensitivity-to-thyroid-hormone/abstract/78\" class=\"abstract_t\">78</a>]. In such mothers, free T4 should be maintained not higher than 20 percent above the upper limit of normal. This can be achieved by judicious use of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=propylthiouracil-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">propylthiouracil</a>, taking care to avoid inducing hypothyroidism. There is no basis for regular treatment of normal mothers carrying affected fetuses (from paternal source, or de novo mutation) unless the fetus is found to have a large goiter or be in distress, in which case the only treatment alternative is intraamniotic infusion of LT-4, although this has not been reported. Further studies are needed before general recommendations can be made.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1579863351\"><span class=\"h1\">RESISTANCE TO THYROID HORMONE ALPHA (RTH-alpha)</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Mutations in the thyroid hormone receptor alpha (TR-alpha) gene (<em>THRA, </em><a href=\"http://omim.org/entry/190120&amp;token=O25AxH2ZrpTPG8o+GEGTWEIHDo9nxKkaTmEaIeutr9RvAT5S51sgC+rcl8ogjdE8&amp;TOPIC_ID=5827\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">MIM 190120</a>) were first reported in 2012 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/impaired-sensitivity-to-thyroid-hormone/abstract/79\" class=\"abstract_t\">79</a>], more than two decades after discovery of a mutation in the TR-beta gene. The reason is undoubtedly that TR-alpha defects are associated with less obvious abnormalities in serum hormone tests, such that the latest generation sequencing is required to identify this disorder. Since 2012, more than 20 patients due to 11 different mutations have been published, most summarized in a review [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/impaired-sensitivity-to-thyroid-hormone/abstract/80\" class=\"abstract_t\">80</a>] and several new cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/impaired-sensitivity-to-thyroid-hormone/abstract/81\" class=\"abstract_t\">81</a>]. Mutations are of all varieties (frame shifts with early termination resulting in a truncated receptor, point mutations [missense and nonsense], inherited and de-novo), and all are located in the ligand-binding domain. As in the case of <em>THRB</em> mutations, this results in three different mechanisms causing functional impairment: 1) there is reduced affinity for T3; 2) the mutant TR-alpha interferes with the normal TR-alpha allele, resulting in a dominant negative effect; and 3) coactivator recruitment to the liganded receptor is defective.</p><p>Because TR-alpha is not involved in the feedback regulation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-thyroid axis, the thyroid function tests are different from those of the RTH phenotype due to <em>THRB</em> mutations: patients with <em>THRA</em> mutations tend to have low serum T<sub>4</sub>, borderline high T<sub>3</sub>, and lower rT<sub>3</sub><em>,</em> though most overlap the normal ranges of these tests. As a consequence, more consistent findings are high ratios of T3 to T4, and T3 to rT3; the mechanism for these findings is unclear. Serum TSH concentrations are usually within the normal range. &#160;</p><p>The phenotype is very variable but is consistent with the manifestations of untreated congenital hypothyroidism in peripheral tissues. Due the main role of TR-alpha in mediating thyroid hormone action in bone, there are significant bony abnormalities in these patients, including reduced bone age, short stature, femoral epiphyseal dysgenesis, patent cranial sutures, and macrocephaly. Other major clinical findings are in the gastrointestinal tract (ranging from constipation to megacolon), heart (bradycardia), striated muscles, hematologic system (normocytic anemia), and the central nervous system (ranging from autism to mental retardation). Clinical features were mild in one of the reported families with missense mutations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/impaired-sensitivity-to-thyroid-hormone/abstract/81\" class=\"abstract_t\">81</a>].</p><p>Treatment with T<sub>4</sub> was considered in several case reports [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/impaired-sensitivity-to-thyroid-hormone/abstract/79,81-83\" class=\"abstract_t\">79,81-83</a>]. In one of the cases, the hypothalamic-pituitary axis responded to exogenous thyroid hormone, but the skeletal, gastrointestinal, and myocardial tissues were resistant [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/impaired-sensitivity-to-thyroid-hormone/abstract/79\" class=\"abstract_t\">79</a>], consistent with the differential tissue expression of the TR-alpha subtype. In a third case report, T3 treatment was given, which reduced the TSH and consequently the T4 level, but an increase in heart rate was observed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/impaired-sensitivity-to-thyroid-hormone/abstract/82\" class=\"abstract_t\">82</a>]. The experience is too preliminary to make definitive recommendations regarding treatment in patients with RTH due to mutations in the TR-alpha gene.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H30\"><span class=\"h1\">SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Impaired sensitivity to thyroid hormone describes any process that impairs the effectiveness of thyroid hormone and can be caused by each of the following mechanisms (see <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Mechanisms of impaired sensitivity'</a> above):</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Thyroid hormone action defects &ndash; Including resistance to thyroid hormone (RTH) (caused by thyroid hormone receptor beta gene defects [RTH-beta] or unknown etiology), or resistance to thyroid hormone alpha (RTH-alpha) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Thyroid hormone cell membrane transport defect (THCMTD)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Thyroid hormone metabolism defect (THMD)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>These disorders can be distinguished by their characteristic abnormalities of thyroid function.
