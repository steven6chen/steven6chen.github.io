In 1994, a novel gamma herpesvirus was subsequently identified in KS biopsies. After sequence analysis of the genome and characterization of the viral life cycle, this virus was subsequently named human herpesvirus 8 (HHV-8), or Kaposi sarcoma associated herpesvirus (KSHV).</p><p>The first disease associated with HHV-8 infection was KS. However, it soon became appreciated that several other conditions, especially body cavity based lymphoma (also known as primary effusion lymphoma or PEL) and Castleman's disease, were also linked to this virus. Host factors influence disease expression, since HHV-8 seroprevalence is relatively common. The onset of disease typically occurs several years after acquisition of infection.</p><p>The diseases that are or may be associated with HHV-8 infection will be reviewed here. The epidemiology, mode of transmission, diagnosis, and treatment of HHV-8 infection are discussed separately.

Thirty-six (42 percent) were seropositive; 14 of these patients had PCR evidence of HHV-8 DNA (mostly in saliva), but only six had evidence supporting primary HHV-8 infection.</p><p>Five of these six children had a maculopapular rash, which first appeared on the face and spread gradually to the trunk and extremities.

In addition, the transplant itself may transmit HHV-8 infection.

However, while infection with HHV-8 is necessary for the development of KS, it alone may not be sufficient.</p><p>Immunosuppression significantly increases the risk of developing KS from asymptomatic HHV-8 infection. KS is the most common tumor after solid organ transplantation in areas where HHV-8 is endemic [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/disease-associations-of-human-herpesvirus-8-infection/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. At the height of the AIDS epidemic, HIV-infected persons were at high risk of developing KS when compared with the general population (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=virology-epidemiology-and-transmission-of-human-herpesvirus-8-infection\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Virology, epidemiology, and transmission of human herpesvirus 8 infection&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aids-related-kaposi-sarcoma-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;AIDS-related Kaposi sarcoma: Clinical manifestations and diagnosis&quot;</a>).</p><p>In contrast, discordance between HHV-8 seroprevalence and the development of KS has been observed in certain geographic areas.

The mechanisms by which HHV-8 might cause KS are discussed elsewhere.

The data supporting these associations is presented elsewhere.

An increasingly common presentation of DM in persons of African descent is the acute onset of ketosis, followed by reversible periods of decreased insulin secretion. In a study of 187 persons of African descent presenting for diabetes care in France, the seroprevalence of HHV-8 was 88 percent among the 81 individuals with ketosis-prone DM, compared with 15 percent among the 106 individuals with non-ketotic DM [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/disease-associations-of-human-herpesvirus-8-infection/abstract/73\" class=\"abstract_t\">73</a>]. Twenty-two patients had plasma available from the time of first presentation, and 6 of 13 (46 percent) had HHV-8 DNA detectable in the ketotic group versus 0 of 9 in the non-ketotic group. A subsequent study in Sardinia confirmed an association between HHV-8 infection and type 2 DM and suggested that persons with a specific killer cell immunoglobulin-like receptor (KIR)&nbsp;allele may be more prone to developing type 2 DM after infection with HHV-8 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/disease-associations-of-human-herpesvirus-8-infection/abstract/74\" class=\"abstract_t\">74</a>].

In 1994, a novel gamma herpesvirus was identified in KS biopsies. After sequence analysis of the genome and characterization of the viral life cycle, this virus was named human herpesvirus 8 (HHV-8), or Kaposi sarcoma associated herpesvirus (KSHV). (See <a href=\"#H1\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>HHV-8 has been identified by the polymerase chain reaction in all four types of KS: classic, endemic, organ transplant-associated, and epidemic (AIDS-related) KS. (See <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'Kaposi sarcoma'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>While infection with HHV-8 is necessary for the development of KS, it alone may not be sufficient. Immunocompromise substantially increases the risk of developing KS from asymptomatic HHV-8 infection. (See <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'Serologic testing'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The first disease associated with HHV-8 infection was KS. However, it soon became appreciated that several other conditions, especially body cavity based lymphoma (also known as primary effusion lymphoma or PEL) and Castleman's disease, were also linked to this virus. Host factors influence disease expression, since HHV-8 seroprevalence is relatively common. The onset of many HHV-8 associated diseases typically occurs several years after acquisition of infection. (See <a href=\"#H1\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above and <a href=\"#H10\" class=\"local\">'Other associations'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Acute primary infection with subsequent HHV-8 seroconversion have been described in children, men who have sex with men (MSM), and immunocompromised hosts:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Primary HHV-8 infection may be associated with fever and a maculopapular rash in immunocompetent children. (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Children'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Two studies of HIV-negative MSM identified new onset lymphadenopathy in association with HHV-8 seroconversion. A mild illness with fatigue, diarrhea, and localized rash has also been described in MSM. (See <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Men who have sex with men'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Among immunocompromised persons such as solid organ transplant recipients and HIV-infected individuals, fever, splenomegaly, lymphoid hyperplasia, pancytopenia, and occasionally rapid-onset KS may occur in association with apparent primary HHV-8 infection. (See <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Immunocompromised hosts'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>HHV-8 DNA has also been detected in the blood or tissues of patients with a variety of diseases, including angiosarcoma, pemphigus vulgaris, multiple myeloma, idiopathic pulmonary arterial hypertension, and sarcoidosis. However, an etiologic role for HHV-8 has not been established for any of these diseases.
