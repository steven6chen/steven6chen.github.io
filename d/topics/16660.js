Extensive experience with pulmonary metastasectomy in a number of different cancers has confirmed that resection can substantially prolong survival and cure some patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-resection-of-pulmonary-metastases-benefits-indications-preoperative-evaluation-and-techniques/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Based upon these observations, aggressive resection of isolated pulmonary metastases has become a widely accepted treatment for appropriately selected patients.</p><p>The benefits of metastasectomy, selection criteria, preoperative evaluation, and techniques for surgical resection are discussed here. Outcomes according to histology are discussed elsewhere, as are issues specific to resection of soft tissue sarcoma lung metastases.

Most are detected incidentally during the initial staging workup of a primary cancer, or from routine post-treatment surveillance radiographic studies, typically chest computed tomography (CT). Symptoms of cough, pain, or hemoptysis may be present in patients with hilar involvement, particularly when the metastases abut or invade the bronchi. Rarely, patients with peripheral metastases present with a spontaneous pneumothorax due to tumor disruption of the visceral pleura [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-resection-of-pulmonary-metastases-benefits-indications-preoperative-evaluation-and-techniques/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">BENEFITS OF RESECTION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>While pulmonary metastasectomy is a commonly performed operation, belief in its effectiveness is based upon registry data and surgical follow-up studies; there are no randomized trials. Until trials are completed, uncertainty will remain about the effectiveness of metastasectomy relative to other forms of treatment (eg, chemotherapy, stereotactic radiotherapy) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-resection-of-pulmonary-metastases-benefits-indications-preoperative-evaluation-and-techniques/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. One such trial is underway in Great Britain for patients with metastatic colorectal cancer (ie, the <a href=\"https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT01106261?term=PulMiCC&rank=1&amp;token=nbsXe3i4qfUea5RCPRHtOS7yhoEzH+MCpwZ1/1ekxPP53Goo5zhH/ZqdK5wOXL1ySUndDUNND4hLam3cFaw0v5E1SBjTIv9bjqiC2qC11vs=&amp;TOPIC_ID=7815\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">PulMiCC trial, NCT01106261</a> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-resection-of-pulmonary-metastases-benefits-indications-preoperative-evaluation-and-techniques/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]), in which patients are randomly assigned to pulmonary metastasectomy or active monitoring.</p><p>Despite the lack of randomized trials, multiple case reports and small series suggest that resection prolongs survival and that long-term relapse-free survival (ie, cure) is possible in some patients with isolated lung involvement. The following retrospective reviews illustrate the benefits of a complete pulmonary metastasectomy: </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A review from the International Registry of Lung Metastases identified 5206 patients with a variety of primary metastatic tumors (carcinomas, sarcomas, germ cell tumors, and melanomas) who underwent a pulmonary metastasectomy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-resection-of-pulmonary-metastases-benefits-indications-preoperative-evaluation-and-techniques/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. This series included 4572 (88 percent) in whom complete resection was carried out [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-resection-of-pulmonary-metastases-benefits-indications-preoperative-evaluation-and-techniques/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. The overall 5-, 10-, and 15-year survival rates were 36, 26, and 22 percent, respectively. Factors associated with a better prognosis included germ cell etiology, disease-free interval of 36 months, and a single metastatic lesion.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>These outcomes were further corroborated by a 2017 analysis of the Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center database [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-resection-of-pulmonary-metastases-benefits-indications-preoperative-evaluation-and-techniques/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. Over a 25-year period, 539 patients underwent 760 metastasectomies of soft tissue sarcoma with curative intent. Although the median disease-free survival of 6.8 months was short, there was a long tail to the Kaplan-Meier survival curve, 34 percent surviving five years, and 23 percent surviving seven years. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=surgical-resection-of-pulmonary-metastases-outcomes-by-histology#H2\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Surgical resection of pulmonary metastases: Outcomes by histology&quot;, section on 'Soft tissue sarcoma'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A retrospective review of 178 consecutive patients undergoing 256 surgical resections for pulmonary metastasis identified a complete resection in 248 cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-resection-of-pulmonary-metastases-benefits-indications-preoperative-evaluation-and-techniques/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. The five-year survival based upon primary disease site and complete resection was the highest for patients with renal cell carcinomas (51.4 percent), followed by colon or rectal cancer carcinoma (50.3 percent), sarcoma (21.7 percent), and melanoma (25 percent). </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Another study of pulmonary metastasectomy is ongoing in Belgium and the Netherlands [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-resection-of-pulmonary-metastases-benefits-indications-preoperative-evaluation-and-techniques/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. However, this prospective nonrandomized phase II multicenter trial is testing the benefit of adding isolated lung perfusion with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=melphalan-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">melphalan</a> at the time of surgical metastasectomy and is not comparing surgical metastasectomy versus systemic chemotherapy, active monitoring, or local ablation. To date, 50 patients have been treated, with no operative mortality and 42 percent grade 3 morbidity. The three-year overall survival rate is a favorable 57 percent with a median survival time of 44 months. Forty of the 50 patients remain without evidence of a disease recurrence. Among those with a recurrence, 77 percent recurred outside of the perfused lung. Despite the lack of randomization to resection versus systemic chemotherapy or other local forms of treatment, this study adds additional evidence that surgical resection with or without adjuvant therapy provides an opportunity for long-term recurrence-free survival. </p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Patient selection</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The decision to proceed with pulmonary metastasectomy requires a multidisciplinary approach that includes both the medical oncologist and the thoracic surgeon. The goal is to offer surgery to only those patients who are most likely to benefit, either in terms of prolonging survival or symptom palliation, and to optimize the timing of surgical intervention. (See <a href=\"#H23502092\" class=\"local\">'Timing of surgery'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h3\">Criteria for resection</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Although there are no published guidelines from expert groups (with the exception of guidelines for resectability of colorectal cancer lung metastases from the National Comprehensive Cancer Network [NCCN] [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-resection-of-pulmonary-metastases-benefits-indications-preoperative-evaluation-and-techniques/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]), most clinicians would accept the following criteria for suitability of pulmonary metastasectomy. For patients who do not meet these criteria, stereotactic radiotherapy, radiofrequency ablation, or cryoablation offer an alternative to resection for local control. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=image-guided-ablation-of-lung-tumors\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Image-guided ablation of lung tumors&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=radiation-therapy-techniques-in-cancer-treatment#H654912\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Radiation therapy techniques in cancer treatment&quot;, section on 'Stereotactic radiation therapy techniques'</a>.)</p><p>Criteria for resection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-resection-of-pulmonary-metastases-benefits-indications-preoperative-evaluation-and-techniques/abstract/11-13\" class=\"abstract_t\">11-13</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The pulmonary metastases appear to be completely resectable based upon preoperative imaging (see <a href=\"#H12\" class=\"local\">'Computed tomography'</a> below).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The patient has adequate cardiopulmonary reserve to tolerate resection.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Metastasectomy is technically feasible.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The primary tumor is controlled.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Extrapulmonary metastatic disease is absent, and if present, the disease must be controllable with surgery or another treatment modality (see <a href=\"#H11\" class=\"local\">'Preoperative evaluation'</a> below).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Uncommonly, resection of one or more lung lesions may be indicated in a patient with a known malignancy who does not meet these criteria.

Unfavorable prognostic factors include an inability to completely resect all metastatic disease, a short disease-free interval following treatment of the primary tumor, a large number of pulmonary metastases, and involved lymph nodes. Tumor histology also influences outcomes. (See <a href=\"#H28\" class=\"local\">'Lymphadenectomy'</a> below and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=surgical-resection-of-pulmonary-metastases-outcomes-by-histology\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Surgical resection of pulmonary metastases: Outcomes by histology&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h3\">Completeness of resection</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Inability to completely resect all areas of pulmonary involvement is widely considered to represent a contraindication to pulmonary metastasectomy. Nearly all reports indicate that complete resection of metastatic disease is associated with more favorable outcomes. In the International Registry series, for example, the median survival with complete versus incomplete resection was 35 versus 15 months, and the five-year survival rate was 36 versus 13 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-resection-of-pulmonary-metastases-benefits-indications-preoperative-evaluation-and-techniques/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h3\">Disease-free interval</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Outcomes are more favorable when there has been a longer disease-free interval between primary tumor treatment and presentation of metastatic disease; however, there is no absolute time frame (including synchronous presentation of metastatic disease) that is short enough that metastasectomy would not be considered. However, particularly for a presentation of synchronous metastases, we recommend repeat chest computed tomography (CT) six to eight weeks after recognition of pulmonary metastases to assure that additional target lesions (or too many target lesions) have not appeared. (See <a href=\"#H23502092\" class=\"local\">'Timing of surgery'</a> below.) </p><p>Although early series yielded conflicting results about the importance of disease-free interval on outcomes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-resection-of-pulmonary-metastases-benefits-indications-preoperative-evaluation-and-techniques/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>], data from the International Registry indicate higher five-year survival rates for patients with a disease-free interval of greater than 36 months (45 versus 33 percent for a disease-free interval of less than one year) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-resection-of-pulmonary-metastases-benefits-indications-preoperative-evaluation-and-techniques/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h3\">Number of lesions</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Outcomes are better with fewer metastases. However, for patients with multiple metastases, there is no consensus among thoracic surgeons as to what disease burden represents an insurmountable obstacle. The important issue is the feasibility of resecting all sites of disease, not the absolute number of metastases per se. </p><p>Data from the International Registry indicate better five-year survival for patients with a single metastatic focus (single focus 43 percent versus 34 and 27 percent for those with two to three, or greater than three metastases, respectively) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-resection-of-pulmonary-metastases-benefits-indications-preoperative-evaluation-and-techniques/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. This observation holds true both for patients with sarcomas and epithelial tumors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-resection-of-pulmonary-metastases-benefits-indications-preoperative-evaluation-and-techniques/abstract/15,16\" class=\"abstract_t\">15,16</a>].</p><p>The inverse relationship between the number of metastases and survival is likely due to multiple factors. The higher the number of pulmonary metastases, the greater the probability of incomplete resection (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F70943\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef70943 \">figure 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-resection-of-pulmonary-metastases-benefits-indications-preoperative-evaluation-and-techniques/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>], the likely heavier burden of occult disease diffusely in the lung, and the greater the probability of disease recurrence in the lung [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-resection-of-pulmonary-metastases-benefits-indications-preoperative-evaluation-and-techniques/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. Additionally, if several nodules need to be removed from the same lobe or a more centrally located nodule needs to be removed, a lobectomy may be required rather than wedge resection. As more lung tissue is removed, perioperative risk increases.</p><p>A more important issue than the number of metastases is the feasibility of resecting all sites of disease, although the two are related. In a series of 92 patients undergoing pulmonary metastasectomy for renal cell cancer, the chance of a complete resection was over 80 percent for patients with three or fewer nodules identified on preoperative CT [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-resection-of-pulmonary-metastases-benefits-indications-preoperative-evaluation-and-techniques/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. In contrast, if there were more than six nodules on the CT, the chance of a complete resection was no more than 20 percent.</p><p>If resection is not feasible at the time of exploration (eg, for technical considerations such as an incomplete pulmonary fissure or proximity to a major vascular structure that was inapparent on the preoperative radiographs), intraoperative ablation using either cryotherapy or radiofrequency ablation (RFA) could be considered. Another alternative is the placement of fiducials for postoperative irradiation. Where available, techniques such as frameless stereotactic radiosurgery provide an opportunity to treat focal areas of the lung to high radiation doses, while preserving adjacent normal tissue [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-resection-of-pulmonary-metastases-benefits-indications-preoperative-evaluation-and-techniques/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h3\">Lymph node spread</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Pulmonary metastases may be accompanied by hilar <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> mediastinal lymph node involvement (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F73945\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef73945 \">figure 2</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-resection-of-pulmonary-metastases-benefits-indications-preoperative-evaluation-and-techniques/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. Lymph node involvement is an important negative prognostic factor in patients undergoing metastasectomy, regardless of histology [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-resection-of-pulmonary-metastases-benefits-indications-preoperative-evaluation-and-techniques/abstract/16,20-26\" class=\"abstract_t\">16,20-26</a>]. Sarcomas and most cancers that spread to the lungs do so through the vascular system, and the metastases appear limited to the parenchyma. However, other malignancies, notably renal cell carcinoma, colon cancer, and melanoma, have demonstrated the ability to metastasize to the lung, and then to metastasize to the local N1 nodes believed (but not proven) to be through the lymphatic system, behaving similarly to primary lung cancer, and with the capability to spreading further to the N2 and N3 nodes. The frequency of lymphatic involvement in patients with pulmonary metastases has not been fully characterized, in part because a systematic lymph node dissection has not been considered a standard approach in this setting. In retrospective reviews, unsuspected metastatic disease in hilar or mediastinal lymph nodes was revealed in 5 to 33 percent of cases, depending on histology (more common in patients with carcinoma than sarcoma) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-resection-of-pulmonary-metastases-benefits-indications-preoperative-evaluation-and-techniques/abstract/3,20-22,27-30\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,20-22,27-30</a>]. </p><p>Outcomes are generally poor in those with mediastinal nodal involvement, and we consider this to represent a contraindication to pulmonary metastasectomy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-resection-of-pulmonary-metastases-benefits-indications-preoperative-evaluation-and-techniques/abstract/21,22,24,26,29\" class=\"abstract_t\">21,22,24,26,29</a>]. However, not all patients with pulmonary metastases and documented nodal metastases are destined to recur, particularly if they have renal cell carcinoma and disease that is limited to the hilar and intrapulmonary lymph nodes. For patients with renal cell cancer and mediastinal (N2) nodal metastases, the decision to pursue pulmonary metastasectomy must be individualized. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=surgical-resection-of-pulmonary-metastases-outcomes-by-histology\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Surgical resection of pulmonary metastases: Outcomes by histology&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The data below provide support for the view that surgical or endoscopic staging of the mediastinal and hilar lymph nodes prior to pulmonary metastasectomy provides diagnostic and prognostic information, as well as a potential therapeutic benefit. (See <a href=\"#H11\" class=\"local\">'Preoperative evaluation'</a> below and <a href=\"#H23502673\" class=\"local\">'Operative staging'</a> below and <a href=\"#H28\" class=\"local\">'Lymphadenectomy'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In one series, 124 patients with a variety of malignancies underwent 139 pulmonary metastasectomies with mediastinal node dissection or sampling [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-resection-of-pulmonary-metastases-benefits-indications-preoperative-evaluation-and-techniques/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. Lymph node involvement was confirmed in 25 (20 percent): 10 in N1 (intrapulmonary or hilar) nodes and 15 in N2 (mediastinal) nodes.

Eighteen had involved N1 (intrapulmonary or hilar) nodes and 10 had N2 (ipsilateral mediastinal) nodes. Although the numbers were small, the presence of nodal metastases (at any site) significantly worsened prognosis, but the estimated five-year survival of patients with three involved nodes was still approximately 30 percent (versus 66 percent with no nodes involved).</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H23500974\"><span class=\"h2\">Repeat metastasectomy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>For both epithelial cancers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-resection-of-pulmonary-metastases-benefits-indications-preoperative-evaluation-and-techniques/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>] and sarcomas [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-resection-of-pulmonary-metastases-benefits-indications-preoperative-evaluation-and-techniques/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>], the most frequent site of relapse following pulmonary resection is in the lung. In general, sequential resections can be carried out safely to treat isolated recurrences [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-resection-of-pulmonary-metastases-benefits-indications-preoperative-evaluation-and-techniques/abstract/3,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,12</a>].</p><p>The role of repeat metastasectomy has been evaluated retrospectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-resection-of-pulmonary-metastases-benefits-indications-preoperative-evaluation-and-techniques/abstract/3,32,33\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,32,33</a>]. The largest series, the International Registry of Lung Metastases, found that 53 percent of the 5206 patients undergoing resection of pulmonary metastases relapsed in the lung [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-resection-of-pulmonary-metastases-benefits-indications-preoperative-evaluation-and-techniques/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Among the 1042 patients who underwent repeat metastasectomy, the 5- and 10-year survival rates were 44 and 29 percent, respectively.

Patients managed this way require close follow-up, with resection of lesions subsequently detected by imaging [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-resection-of-pulmonary-metastases-benefits-indications-preoperative-evaluation-and-techniques/abstract/12,33\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,33</a>].

Some centers routinely evaluate the mediastinal lymph nodes only in patients with suspicious findings on computed tomography (CT), while others advocate routine systematic preoperative staging of the mediastinum in all patients. Prior to planned resection, we suggest evaluation of the mediastinal lymph nodes as would be done for a patient with a primary lung cancer. (See <a href=\"#H10\" class=\"local\">'Lymph node spread'</a> above and <a href=\"#H28\" class=\"local\">'Lymphadenectomy'</a> below.)</p><p>In addition to thoracic CT, several other studies and a diagnostic biopsy may be indicated. We generally recommend an 18-F fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG)-positron emission tomography (PET) scan prior to pulmonary metastasectomy to optimize the selection of candidates for resection. All extrathoracic areas of suspicious FDG uptake should be vigorously investigated prior to surgery, and surgery in the chest should not be performed unless all known deposits of disease are being treated. </p><p>The presence of pathologic mediastinal adenopathy on PET (or CT) should prompt a biopsy via mediastinoscopy, or endobronchial ultrasound-guided fine needle aspiration cytology.

For patients with a history of prior extrathoracic malignancy, the probability that a solitary pulmonary nodule was malignant ranged from 67 percent for nodules &le;1 cm in diameter to 91 percent for nodules &gt;3 cm. For lesions &le;3 cm, there was an equal likelihood that the nodule represented a primary lung cancer or a metastasis; lung cancer was more common than metastasis if the nodule was &gt;3 cm.

Furthermore, a negative PET scan of the chest should not influence the decision to pursue resection. If enlarging lung nodules (particularly if they have the characteristic CT appearance of metastases) are present without other recognized deposits of disease, we still favor surgical resection if possible for both diagnostic and potentially therapeutic purposes, even if the PET scan is negative. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diagnostic-evaluation-of-the-incidental-pulmonary-nodule#H1486138141\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Diagnostic evaluation of the incidental pulmonary nodule&quot;, section on 'Positron emission tomography/computed tomography'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diagnostic-evaluation-of-the-incidental-pulmonary-nodule#H1\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Diagnostic evaluation of the incidental pulmonary nodule&quot;, section on 'Introduction'</a>.)</p><p>The main value of PET is its high level of sensitivity for detecting extrathoracic disease.

In patients with highly suspicious lesions that have a characteristic CT appearance (eg, round, peripheral, multiple), definitive tissue diagnosis is often made after surgical resection of the metastases. However, in many cases, preoperative CT-guided fine needle aspiration (FNA) biopsy is a useful means to obtain tissue less invasively, particularly if the diagnosis of metastatic disease is in question, the patient is a poor or borderline operative candidate, or the patient has a primary tumor (eg, testicular germ cell tumor, lymphoma) for which surgery may not be necessary.</p><p>Particularly for lesions less than 1 cm in size, video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS) may be useful to establish a diagnosis.

Bronchoscopy should be performed preoperatively when positive findings would contraindicate operative intervention. For patients who require general anesthesia, bronchoscopy is performed in the operating room as a component of a staging procedure prior to metastasectomy.

In this manner, patients who rapidly develop extrapulmonary metastases can be spared the morbidity of unnecessary thoracic surgery. This also ensures that a small number of mature (eg, large and fairly uniform in size) target lesions have not evolved into innumerable lesions with a constellation of sizes, which may change the surgical approach. Such a delay may not be necessary for those who are candidates for a video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS) approach.</p><p>Patients with one or more pulmonary metastases are likely to develop additional pulmonary lesions over time. Following potentially curative metastasectomy, additional lesions are identified in 50 percent of cases due to the subsequent growth of previously undetectable lesions. Smaller lesions have a shorter doubling time and, therefore, a faster growth rate than larger lesions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-resection-of-pulmonary-metastases-benefits-indications-preoperative-evaluation-and-techniques/abstract/44\" class=\"abstract_t\">44</a>]. New lesions are recognized when these tumor deposits grow and become recognizable as different from surrounding lung tissue [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-resection-of-pulmonary-metastases-benefits-indications-preoperative-evaluation-and-techniques/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Delaying intervention once a pulmonary metastasis is first identified may allow initially occult metastases to become clinically apparent, permitting a more complete resection and better long-term outcomes. This was illustrated in a retrospective review of 68 patients who underwent pulmonary metastasectomy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-resection-of-pulmonary-metastases-benefits-indications-preoperative-evaluation-and-techniques/abstract/45\" class=\"abstract_t\">45</a>]. On multivariate analysis, the only independently significant prognostic factor for survival was longer interval (greater than twelve weeks) from detection of pulmonary metastases to resection. </p><p>Timing for metastasectomy, however, depends upon the anticipated surgical approach (open versus minimally invasive). For those with a deep nodule or numerous nodules of varying sizes that might require open thoracotomy, which is associated with longer recovery and more morbidity, allowing the full extent of disease to be revealed by delaying open surgery may be beneficial for the patient. In this situation, we delay open surgical intervention for six to eight weeks in order to evaluate the natural history of untreated disease through repeat CT scanning. On the other hand, we frequently choose <strong>not</strong> to delay a VATS metastasectomy for an isolated peripheral nodule in a favorable location because recovery time and surgical risk are minimal, and recurrent disease is technically easier to resect with a repeat VATS approach because of fewer adhesions. The finding of equivalent long-term survival rates for recurrent disease following VATS or open metastasectomy implies that there may be little clinical significance to micronodules missed with initial VATS that are resected at a later date [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-resection-of-pulmonary-metastases-benefits-indications-preoperative-evaluation-and-techniques/abstract/46,47\" class=\"abstract_t\">46,47</a>].

If mediastinal adenopathy is suspected or detected by computed tomography (CT) of the chest or positron emission tomography-computed tomography (PET-CT), then endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS)-guided biopsy or cervical mediastinoscopy may be indicated for pathologic mediastinal nodal staging. For resection of the parenchymal metastases, an open approach (such as thoracotomy) has traditionally been performed to allow bimanual palpation of the lungs; however, a minimally invasive approach using thoracoscopy is associated with less postoperative pain and postoperative morbidity and in many cases can achieve complete resection.

Most clinicians consider the presence of confirmed mediastinal (N2) nodal metastases to represent a contraindication to metastasectomy because of the poor long-term outcome (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F73945\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef73945 \">figure 2</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-resection-of-pulmonary-metastases-benefits-indications-preoperative-evaluation-and-techniques/abstract/14,25\" class=\"abstract_t\">14,25</a>]. In contrast, the presence of hilar or intrapulmonary nodal metastases is not necessarily a contraindication to metastasectomy (particularly for renal cell cancer) as long as anatomic resection is possible [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-resection-of-pulmonary-metastases-benefits-indications-preoperative-evaluation-and-techniques/abstract/16,23,24\" class=\"abstract_t\">16,23,24</a>].

Minimally invasive techniques are often collectively referred to as &quot;VATS&quot; (video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery), although the literature is variable, and terminology is not standardized [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-resection-of-pulmonary-metastases-benefits-indications-preoperative-evaluation-and-techniques/abstract/50\" class=\"abstract_t\">50</a>]. We will use the term &quot;VATS&quot; to refer to techniques not using standard thoracic incisions. </p><p>Whether to choose VATS or an open thoracotomy approach depends upon characteristics of the metastases, including their location, number, and size as well as lesion stability as judged on CT scan. A conservative approach, removing the least amount of lung tissue needed to render the patient free of disease, results in greater cardiopulmonary reserve to withstand subsequent treatments should there be a recurrence. Wedge resection is often sufficient for peripheral nodules, but segmentectomy, lobectomy, or even pneumonectomy may be required for lesions at the hilum or in the central part of the lobe. The mortality of pulmonary surgery is related to the amount of lung tissue removed, with mortality rates of 4 to 10 percent for pneumonectomy, and consistently less than 1 percent following wedge resection. These mortality rates do not differ from those associated with resection for lung adenocarcinoma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-resection-of-pulmonary-metastases-benefits-indications-preoperative-evaluation-and-techniques/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. </p><p>In general, a wedge resection by VATS is most appropriate for stable, peripheral metastases, each of which is no greater than 3 cm in size. There should be a small number of nodules; a single metastasis is ideal. Numerous target lesions may preclude a VATS approach, although there is no consensus among thoracic surgical oncologists or sarcoma specialists as to what disease burden represents an insurmountable obstacle.</p><p>A wedge resection requires a margin of 1 cm, which is easily accomplished when the metastasis is peripheral (eg, outer third of lung field as seen on chest CT). For more centrally located lesions, this margin cannot be achieved because excessive tissue tension prevents the closure of the remaining lung tissue.</p><p>Central lesions are better approached with either segmentectomy or lobectomy, and open thoracotomy may be preferred, though lobectomy can also be performed using VATS.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H23\"><span class=\"h3\">Open thoracotomy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The location of the thoracotomy incision depends on the anatomic location of the metastases (anterior and posterolateral approaches are most common), and whether the disease is unilateral or bilateral. Resection of pulmonary metastases by a thoracotomy incision uses one-lung anesthesia for complete atelectasis of the nonventilated lung. Open thoracotomy exposes the chest cavity, facilitating bimanual palpation of the pulmonary parenchyma, and resection of visible and palpable metastases. (See <a href=\"#H23502673\" class=\"local\">'Operative staging'</a> above.)</p><p>A bilateral approach is indicated only for those patients who present radiographically with bilateral metastases. For patients who appear to have unilateral disease, inspection of both hemithoraces frequently identifies occult tumor deposits. However, bilateral exploration and resection has not produced a survival advantage compared with a unilateral approach [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-resection-of-pulmonary-metastases-benefits-indications-preoperative-evaluation-and-techniques/abstract/51\" class=\"abstract_t\">51</a>]. Further, recurrence in the ipsilateral lung was as common as recurrence in the contralateral lung in patients who underwent bilateral exploration with complete resection to treat unilateral disease.</p><p>Patients with known bilateral lesions can be managed with median sternotomy, bilateral anterior thoracotomy (clamshell incision), or a bilateral sequential thoracotomy (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F54065\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef54065 \">table 1</a>).</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Sternotomy (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F86046\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef86046 \">figure 5</a>) allows the simultaneous examination of both lungs and identification and treatment of contralateral occult disease. The main advantages of this approach are reduced postoperative pain and less impairment of pulmonary function (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F54065\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef54065 \">table 1</a>). Disadvantages include more difficult exposure of the costovertebral lung fields and limited visualization of the left lower lobe because of the heart. A thoracotomy extension may improve exposure (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F113019\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef113019 \">figure 6</a>). The sternal approach may also not be feasible in a patient who has had a previous sternotomy (eg, heart bypass). Longitudinal sternal transection carries a risk of a sternal wound infection; however, the incidence is low. Sternal wound infection (as with any wound infection) can delay recovery and initiation of adjuvant therapy.

Thoracoscopy involves the passage of a videoscope through the chest wall giving the surgeon a &quot;window&quot; for direct visualization into the chest. Additional ports are placed through the chest wall to allow for various instruments. VATS is less invasive than open thoracotomy; however, like thoracotomy, it must be performed in the operating room under general anesthesia with single-lung ventilation.

Intrathoracic postoperative adhesions are milder with VATS compared with open thoracotomy. VATS has the advantage of shortened recuperation time and decreased blood loss in patients who require repeat resection after recurrence [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-resection-of-pulmonary-metastases-benefits-indications-preoperative-evaluation-and-techniques/abstract/55\" class=\"abstract_t\">55</a>].</p><p>VATS can be used to resect most metastatic lesions, as the majority are located in the peripheral one-third of the lung [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-resection-of-pulmonary-metastases-benefits-indications-preoperative-evaluation-and-techniques/abstract/56\" class=\"abstract_t\">56</a>].

Intrathoracic recurrence rates of clinically significant disease are reported to be between 18 and 49 percent for VATS, similar to that reported with open thoracotomy (16 to 53 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-resection-of-pulmonary-metastases-benefits-indications-preoperative-evaluation-and-techniques/abstract/55\" class=\"abstract_t\">55</a>]. On the other hand, VATS is associated with procedure-related recurrences at the pulmonary resection stump site (staple line), port site, and pleural surfaces. A margin of at least 1 cm is recommended to prevent staple line recurrence. As a general rule, the margin should be at least as large as the width as the maximal diameter of the nodule removed. To avoid intrathoracic and port site seeding, the resected specimen should be placed intact into a sterile specimen bag before being delivered through the port site. It is important to examine the cut surface of the resected specimen to confirm that the resection margin is free of tumor; frozen-section histologic analysis should be undertaken when indicated.</p><p>As discussed above, there is no consensus regarding a preference for open thoracotomy over a VATS procedure. Some argue that thoracoscopic resection is a valid approach only for patients with a solitary pulmonary nodule on preoperative chest CT, where the risk of additional disease is small [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-resection-of-pulmonary-metastases-benefits-indications-preoperative-evaluation-and-techniques/abstract/57-60\" class=\"abstract_t\">57-60</a>]. On the other hand, proponents of VATS argue that while open surgical exploration identifies radiographically occult nodules, these can be resected with VATS in the future, once they become detectable on surveillance CT scans, without adversely affecting survival. (See <a href=\"#H23500974\" class=\"local\">'Repeat metastasectomy'</a> above.)</p><p>There are no randomized trials comparing outcomes between open and thoracoscopic resection and few retrospective comparisons. Data suggest that patients do at least as well after VATS as after thoracotomy and imply that there is little if any clinical significance to skipped nodules. However, because these favorable outcomes from VATS were obtained predominantly in populations with a limited disease extent, many surgeons restrict VATS to patients with a single or very few pulmonary metastases. Available studies are inherently biased because patients with single metastases are more often offered VATS.</p><p>Specific data illustrating these points include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a retrospective cohort study of 186 patients undergoing pulmonary metastasectomy (36 with VATS and 135 via thoracotomy), five-year overall survival (70 versus 59 percent) and recurrence-free survival (67 versus 51 percent) were not worse after VATS [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-resection-of-pulmonary-metastases-benefits-indications-preoperative-evaluation-and-techniques/abstract/46\" class=\"abstract_t\">46</a>]. However, the VATS group more often had single metastases (56 versus 21 percent) and unilateral disease (94 versus 67 percent).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Another study attempted to minimize patient selection bias by comparing outcomes from both procedures in a relatively homogeneous population of patients with two or fewer sarcoma metastases per lung field [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-resection-of-pulmonary-metastases-benefits-indications-preoperative-evaluation-and-techniques/abstract/47\" class=\"abstract_t\">47</a>]. When the 31 patients treated with VATS were compared to 29 patients undergoing open thoracotomy, overall survival and ipsilateral recurrence rates were similar in both groups. In this study, again, VATS patients more often had single lesions (58 versus 38 percent). Comparative rates of perioperative morbidity and mortality were not addressed in this series.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H28\"><span class=\"h2\">Lymphadenectomy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The need for routine systematic lymph node sampling during pulmonary metastasectomy is controversial. In practical terms, if the preoperative imaging suggests suspicious N1 or N2 nodes, then an operative plan for complete removal of all metastatic disease should include plans for removal of these nodes. Removal of perihilar nodes can frequently be accomplished by thoracoscopic enucleation while removal of nodes between the vessels and segmental bronchi often requires segmentectomy or lobectomy. If preoperative evaluation does not suggest local nodal involvement, then routine sampling of these nodes is not supported by the current level of knowledge. (See <a href=\"#H11\" class=\"local\">'Preoperative evaluation'</a> above and <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'Influence of prognostic determinants'</a> above and <a href=\"#H23502673\" class=\"local\">'Operative staging'</a> above.) </p><p>In general, there are few long-term survivors among those with N2 disease, leading many to conclude that documentation of mediastinal nodal involvement represents a contraindication to potentially curative pulmonary metastasectomy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-resection-of-pulmonary-metastases-benefits-indications-preoperative-evaluation-and-techniques/abstract/21,22,24,26,29\" class=\"abstract_t\">21,22,24,26,29</a>]. Although there are no randomized trials in which patients either did or did not undergo mediastinal node dissection prior to pulmonary metastasectomy, successful removal of involved nodes can produce a complete resection with negative margins, which may contribute to the success of the surgery. Leaving an involved node is equivalent to having a positive margin. There are at least some data that suggest that long-term survival is possible for some patients, particularly those with renal cell cancer with nodal disease that is limited to the hilar and intrapulmonary (N1) nodes (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F73945\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef73945 \">figure 2</a>). The bias at the authors' institutions has been to treat such malignancies according to their biologic behavior, which includes a willingness to diagnose N2 and N3 disease by endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS)-guided biopsy, endoscopic ultrasound (EUS), or cervical mediastinoscopy, if neoadjuvant therapy is plausible. It also includes a surgical plan to resect these metastases with anatomic resections (segmentectomy or lobectomy) to achieve a local lymphadenectomy in the surgical specimen. We also perform a mediastinal lymphadenectomy in these cases. </p><p>Documentation of N2 nodal diseases may make nonsurgical treatment alternatives (such as chemotherapy, radiation, or radiofrequency ablation) more attractive because of the lower perceived benefit of surgery in this situation. Although some have suggested that knowing the status of the regional nodes can guide adjuvant radiotherapy, or chemotherapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-resection-of-pulmonary-metastases-benefits-indications-preoperative-evaluation-and-techniques/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>], the presence of nodal metastases does not change medical management for the vast majority of tumor types metastasizing to the lung (sarcoma, colorectal cancer, breast cancer, germ cell tumor). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=surgical-resection-of-pulmonary-metastases-outcomes-by-histology\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Surgical resection of pulmonary metastases: Outcomes by histology&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2047014615\"><span class=\"h1\">SOCIETY GUIDELINE LINKS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Links to society and government-sponsored guidelines from selected countries and regions around the world are provided separately.

Retrospective experience has shown that the overall actuarial 5- and 10-year survival rates after complete metastasectomy are approximately 36 and 26 percent, respectively. (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Benefits of resection'</a> above.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For appropriately selected patients, we suggest surgical resection of lung metastases rather than palliative systemic therapy (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=5\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2B</a>). Optimal outcomes are highly dependent on appropriate patient selection. (See <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Patient selection'</a> above.) &#160;</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Outcomes are more favorable the longer the disease-free interval between primary tumor treatment and presentation of metastatic disease, although there is no absolute time frame (including synchronous presentation) that is short enough that metastasectomy would not be considered. However, particularly for synchronous presentation with metastatic disease, a delay in metastasectomy is reasonable to allow the natural history of the disease to become manifest. (See <a href=\"#H8\" class=\"local\">'Disease-free interval'</a> above and <a href=\"#H23502092\" class=\"local\">'Timing of surgery'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Outcomes are better with fewer metastases. However, for patients with multiple metastases, there is no consensus among thoracic surgeons as to what disease burden represents an insurmountable obstacle. The important issue is the feasibility of resecting all sites of disease, not the absolute number of metastases per se. (See <a href=\"#H9\" class=\"local\">'Number of lesions'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Prior to planned resection, contrast-enhanced, high-resolution helical computed tomography (CT) of the chest should be performed. (See <a href=\"#H11\" class=\"local\">'Preoperative evaluation'</a> above and <a href=\"#H10\" class=\"local\">'Lymph node spread'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>For patients without evidence of extrapulmonary disease on chest CT, an 18-F fluorodeoxyglucose-positron emission tomography (FDG-PET) scan is indicated. Positive extrathoracic or mediastinal uptake on a PET scan is not sufficient evidence to exclude a patient from surgery for lung metastases. All suspicious areas should be vigorously investigated (usually with a diagnostic biopsy) prior to metastasectomy. (See <a href=\"#H11\" class=\"local\">'Preoperative evaluation'</a> above and <a href=\"#H10\" class=\"local\">'Lymph node spread'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>For patients with suspicion for mediastinal (N2) adenopathy on chest CT, we suggest confirming this by <span class=\"nowrap\">biopsy/mediastinoscopy</span> prior to attempted resection, and not proceeding with resection if N2 disease is confirmed for histologies other than renal cell cancer. For patients with renal cell cancer and involved N2 lymph nodes, the decision to pursue complete metastasectomy must be individualized. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Prior to attempted resection of apparently isolated pulmonary metastases, brain imaging should be performed for patients who have tumors that frequently metastasize to the brain (eg, breast cancer, melanoma). (See <a href=\"#H16\" class=\"local\">'Brain imaging'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>There are no widely accepted published guidelines as to appropriate patient selection for pulmonary metastasectomy. We suggest the following general selection criteria (see <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Criteria for resection'</a> above): </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>All lung metastases, including bilateral tumors, should be potentially resectable (see <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'Completeness of resection'</a> above)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>The primary tumor is under control</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Absence of extrapulmonary metastatic disease; if present, the disease must be controllable with surgery or another treatment modality</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Adequate cardiopulmonary reserve</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Outside of these criteria, resection of one or more lung lesions may also be indicated in a patient with a known malignancy when:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent3\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#45;</span>A new primary lung cancer cannot be excluded </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent3\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#45;</span>Symptomatic metastases (eg, bronchial obstruction with distal suppuration) cannot be managed in any other way</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent3\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#45;</span>Tissue needs to be obtained for a novel therapeutic strategy (eg, an autologous vaccine), preferably within the confines of a clinical trial</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients who do not meet the criteria for pulmonary metastasectomy, stereotactic radiotherapy, radiofrequency ablation, or cryotherapy may offer an alternative to resection for local control. Another option is systemic chemotherapy, depending on the specific histologic tumor type. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=image-guided-ablation-of-lung-tumors\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Image-guided ablation of lung tumors&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=radiation-therapy-techniques-in-cancer-treatment#H654912\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Radiation therapy techniques in cancer treatment&quot;, section on 'Stereotactic radiation therapy techniques'</a>.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients meeting criteria for pulmonary metastasectomy, we suggest using video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS) rather than an open thoracotomy for patients with one or a limited number of small metastases in the peripheral one-third of one lung (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). (See <a href=\"#H27\" class=\"local\">'VATS procedure'</a> above and <a href=\"#H23\" class=\"local\">'Open thoracotomy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients planned for open thoracotomy, we suggest delaying surgery for at least six to eight weeks, rather than a shorter interval, to assess lesion stability and to avoid unnecessary surgery in those with rapid progression (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). The need for delay in patients planned for a VATS procedure is less clear. We frequently choose not to delay a VATS metastasectomy for an isolated peripheral nodule in a favorable location. (See <a href=\"#H23\" class=\"local\">'Open thoracotomy'</a> above and <a href=\"#H23502092\" class=\"local\">'Timing of surgery'</a> above.) &#160;</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Prior to planned resection, we suggest evaluation of the mediastinal lymph nodes identified on chest CT that are &gt;1 cm or PET positive nodes of any size as would be done for a patient with a primary lung cancer (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). This can be accomplished either with endobronchial ultrasound-guided biopsy or mediastinoscopy prior to surgery. (See <a href=\"#H17\" class=\"local\">'Need for preoperative tissue diagnosis'</a> above and <a href=\"#H28\" class=\"local\">'Lymphadenectomy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The role of postoperative adjuvant chemotherapy for specific histologic tumor types is discussed elsewhere.

Radiographic evidence of possible recurrence mandates a full evaluation of disease extent and cardiorespiratory reserve. If the indications for pulmonary metastasectomy are still met, a repeat surgical procedure can be offered as an alternative to systemic therapy or other locally ablative options. A chest CT scan should be repeated six weeks after the initial observation of suspected recurrence and prior to repeat surgery, as this may reveal additional deposits of recurrence that may preclude surgery.
