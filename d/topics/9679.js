The diagnosis of anaphylaxis during the acute event is based on the clinical presentation and a history of a recent exposure to an offending agent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/laboratory-tests-to-support-the-clinical-diagnosis-of-anaphylaxis/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. There are no laboratory tests available in an emergency department or clinic setting to confirm a diagnosis of anaphylaxis in real time. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=anaphylaxis-emergency-treatment\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Anaphylaxis: Emergency treatment&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Laboratory tests in serum, plasma, and possibly urine obtained during or shortly after the acute event, can, however, help to support the clinical diagnosis of anaphylaxis. These tests can also help identify anaphylaxis in the presence of other disorders that have overlapping clinical presentations, such as severe asthma or myocardial infarction. In addition, these tests may provide evidence for anaphylaxis as a cause of death.</p><p>This topic reviews the laboratory tests that can be used to support the clinical diagnosis of anaphylaxis in both adults and children. These tests are different from those that identify sensitization to the inciting allergen, namely measurements of allergen-specific immunoglobulin E (IgE), which are reviewed elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-skin-testing-for-allergic-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of skin testing for allergic disease&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-in-vitro-allergy-tests\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of in vitro allergy tests&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=anaphylaxis-confirming-the-diagnosis-and-determining-the-causes#H4433858\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Anaphylaxis: Confirming the diagnosis and determining the cause(s)&quot;, section on 'Testing for allergen cause(s)'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">OVERVIEW</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The principal effector cells of systemic anaphylaxis are mast cells and basophils. The various preformed and newly-generated mediators secreted by these cells cause many of the signs and symptoms of systemic anaphylaxis. The pathophysiology of anaphylaxis is reviewed in detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pathophysiology-of-anaphylaxis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pathophysiology of anaphylaxis&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Two of the most abundant and best-characterized preformed granule mediators released by these cells during anaphylaxis are tryptase and histamine. Elevations in tryptase and histamine can sometimes be detected in blood samples obtained shortly after the onset of symptoms. Also, elevated levels of histamine, histamine metabolites (N-methylhistamine and N-methylimidazole acetic acid), the prostaglandin D<sub>2</sub> (PGD<sub>2</sub>) metabolite, 11-beta-prostaglandin F<sub>2-alpha</sub> (11-beta-PGF<sub>2-alpha</sub>), and the leukotriene C<sub>4</sub> (LTC<sub>4</sub>) metabolite, leukotriene E<sub>4</sub> (LTE<sub>4</sub>) can be measured in urine after an anaphylactic event.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2357974\"><span class=\"h2\">Available tests</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Assays for the following mediators are available commercially in the United States (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F69698\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef69698 \">table 1</a>):</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Tryptase <span class=\"nowrap\">(serum/plasma)</span></p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Histamine (plasma)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The histamine metabolite N-methylhistamine (urine)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The PGD<sub>2</sub> metabolite 11-beta-PGF<sub>2-alpha</sub> (urine)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The LTC<sub>4</sub> metabolite LTE<sub>4</sub> (urine)</p><p/><p>N-methylimidazole acetic acid (urine) is available in some commercial laboratories.</p><p>Platelet-activating factor (PAF), chymase, and mast cell carboxypeptidase A3 are also being investigated as markers of anaphylaxis, although these mediators require further study as biomarkers and assays for them are not widely available for routine clinical use [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/laboratory-tests-to-support-the-clinical-diagnosis-of-anaphylaxis/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].

Ideally, this level should be compared with one obtained at baseline, which could either be prior to the event or be at least 24 hours after all signs and symptoms have resolved. During experimental insect-sting anaphylaxis, serum tryptase levels peak 30 to 90 minutes after the onset of symptoms and then decline with a half-life of about 2 hours [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/laboratory-tests-to-support-the-clinical-diagnosis-of-anaphylaxis/abstract/3,4\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,4</a>]. The larger the initial elevation of tryptase, the longer the level remains elevated and may remain detectable for several hours after the event. (See <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Tryptase'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Histamine elevations are even more fleeting. Plasma histamine levels peak within 5 to 10 minutes after symptom onset, and decline with a half-life of 1 to 2 minutes such that levels typically return to baseline by 15 to 30 minutes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/laboratory-tests-to-support-the-clinical-diagnosis-of-anaphylaxis/abstract/3-7\" class=\"abstract_t\">3-7</a>]. Therefore, samples should be drawn as soon as possible, preferably 2 to 15 minutes from the onset of symptoms (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F72041\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef72041 \">table 3</a>). Metabolites of histamine are slightly longer lasting in blood and may appear in urine made within 30 to 60 minutes of the event. They remain detectable in urine stored in the bladder for hours. (See <a href=\"#H17\" class=\"local\">'Histamine'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h1\">TRYPTASE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Tryptase is produced by both mast cells and basophils, although mast cells contain approximately 500-fold more than basophils [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/laboratory-tests-to-support-the-clinical-diagnosis-of-anaphylaxis/abstract/8-10\" class=\"abstract_t\">8-10</a>]. Upon activation, mast cells degranulate, releasing tryptase, along with histamine, into the extracellular environment. Because tryptase is relatively specific for mast cells, acutely elevated tryptase levels in serum or plasma, when compared with a baseline level, indicate involvement of these cells in clinical events [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/laboratory-tests-to-support-the-clinical-diagnosis-of-anaphylaxis/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. The biologic functions of tryptase have not been fully defined.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Forms</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Tryptase exists in mature and immature forms:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A portion of the immature form, also known as protryptase, is spontaneously secreted by unstimulated mast cells [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/laboratory-tests-to-support-the-clinical-diagnosis-of-anaphylaxis/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. Specifically, alpha-protryptase and beta-protryptase account for the vast majority of the tryptase detected in nonanaphylactic serum or plasma. The commercial total tryptase assay measures mature and pro forms of both alpha and beta tryptases with comparable sensitivities. Any function(s) of immature tryptases, other than serving as precursors of mature enzymes, are not known [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/laboratory-tests-to-support-the-clinical-diagnosis-of-anaphylaxis/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. Protryptases can be proteolytically processed to maturity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/laboratory-tests-to-support-the-clinical-diagnosis-of-anaphylaxis/abstract/14,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">14,15</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Another portion of protryptases are processed to their mature forms, namely beta-tryptase, and possibly alpha-tryptase, which are stored inside the secretory granules of mast cells as tetramers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/laboratory-tests-to-support-the-clinical-diagnosis-of-anaphylaxis/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>] in a macromolecular complex with heparin proteoglycan [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/laboratory-tests-to-support-the-clinical-diagnosis-of-anaphylaxis/abstract/17,18\" class=\"abstract_t\">17,18</a>]. When mast cells become activated and degranulate, mature tryptase(s) and histamine are released into the extracellular environment. In vitro potential biologic activities of mature beta-tryptase include generation of complement anaphylatoxins, inactivation of fibrinogen, and stimulation of a variety of different cell types, while its activity(ies) in vivo remain uncertain. Unlike beta-tryptase, alpha-tryptase is nearly inactive as a protease.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Genetics</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There are genetic differences in tryptase genes that have slight effects on total tryptase, but these have been incorporated into the normal laboratory range. The genes for the human alpha- and beta-tryptases reside on chromosome 16. The dimorphic tryptase <span class=\"nowrap\">alpha/beta</span> 1 (<em>TPSAB1</em>) gene can give rise to alpha- or beta-tryptase, and the monomorphic <em>TPSB2</em> gene gives rise to beta-tryptase only. Humans have four functional tryptase genes (two from each parent). About 25 percent of people have two alpha and two beta genes, approximately 50 percent have one alpha and three beta genes, and the remaining 25 percent have four beta genes.</p><p>Genotype has a small effect on the level of total tryptase [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/laboratory-tests-to-support-the-clinical-diagnosis-of-anaphylaxis/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. Specifically, healthy individuals with four beta genes have the lowest total tryptase levels. Those with three beta and one alpha have levels approximately 0.5 <span class=\"nowrap\">ng/mL</span> higher, and those with two alpha and two beta genes, approximately 0.5 <span class=\"nowrap\">ng/mL</span> higher still. (See <a href=\"#H9\" class=\"local\">'Normal levels'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Assays</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Two immunoassays for tryptase have been developed and applied clinically:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>An assay for all forms of alpha- and beta-tryptases (mature and proforms), in combination, or &quot;total&quot; tryptase, is commercially available as &quot;ImmunoCAP tryptase&quot; (Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc) through many commercial laboratories [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/laboratory-tests-to-support-the-clinical-diagnosis-of-anaphylaxis/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>An immunoassay for mature tryptase (alpha and beta) is presently performed only at the author's laboratory at Virginia Commonwealth University (Richmond, Virginia) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/laboratory-tests-to-support-the-clinical-diagnosis-of-anaphylaxis/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. In addition to mature tryptase, this laboratory also routinely measures total tryptase by ImmunoCAP on each sample provided and monitors for the presence of heterophilic antibody. (See <a href=\"#H1046138\" class=\"local\">'Causes of false-positive elevations'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Proper collection of samples</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Serum or plasma for tryptase should be obtained ideally within the first 1 to 3 hours after anaphylaxis (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F69698\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef69698 \">table 1</a>). Measurements of tryptase in serum and plasma are similar [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/laboratory-tests-to-support-the-clinical-diagnosis-of-anaphylaxis/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. An additional sample should be collected at least 24 hours after all signs and symptoms have resolved, to serve as a baseline sample. Frozen serum or plasma obtained before the event can also be used as a baseline and is often available for hospitalized patients. Tryptase is stable in frozen serum for at least one year.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Serum and plasma tryptase levels are similar. In a study designed to compare serum and plasma, plasma samples obtained from citrated blood was collected from 43 healthy subjects and divided into two portions, one of them was clotted by addition of CaCl<sub>2</sub> from which serum was separated from clot, and the other remained as plasma. Total tryptase levels were 4.6&plusmn;1.5 <span class=\"nowrap\">ng/mL</span> in plasma and 5.1&plusmn;2.1 <span class=\"nowrap\">ng/mL</span> in serum, which were not statistically different from one another [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/laboratory-tests-to-support-the-clinical-diagnosis-of-anaphylaxis/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Also, if basophils are disrupted or activated during blood collection or clotting, this can increase the tryptase level in plasma or serum. For example, 100 percent of basophil tryptase (0.3 x 10<sup>6</sup> <span class=\"nowrap\">basophils/mL</span> x 50 <span class=\"nowrap\">ng/10<sup>6</sup></span> basophils) could increase mature tryptase levels to 15 <span class=\"nowrap\">ng/mL,</span> though such release has not been reported &ndash; indeed, mature tryptase levels in serum are typically &lt;1 <span class=\"nowrap\">ng/mL</span>.</p><p/><p>The author's laboratory requires 1 mL of serum (red top tube) or plasma (heparin, citrate, or ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid [EDTA]) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/laboratory-tests-to-support-the-clinical-diagnosis-of-anaphylaxis/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. The sample should optimally be stored and shipped frozen by overnight courier, although the enzyme appears to be immunologically stable if refrigerated for more than one week. Samples left at room temperature for more than one or two days might yield falsely low values. Printable instructions for proper collection and handling are provided (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F72041\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef72041 \">table 3</a>).</p><p>For postmortem samples, collection from the femoral artery or vein, rather than the heart, is recommended to minimize the contribution of nonspecifically-released tryptase from mast cells in disintegrating or traumatized cardiac tissue [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/laboratory-tests-to-support-the-clinical-diagnosis-of-anaphylaxis/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h2\">Normal levels</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Baseline serum levels of mature tryptase are normally undetectable (&lt;1 <span class=\"nowrap\">ng/mL)</span> in healthy individuals who have not experienced anaphylaxis in the preceding few hours. Baseline total tryptase levels range from 1 to 11.4 <span class=\"nowrap\">ng/mL</span> with an average of 3 to 5 <span class=\"nowrap\">ng/mL</span> (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F79722\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef79722 \">table 2</a>). The upper limit of 11.4 <span class=\"nowrap\">ng/mL</span> is recommended by the manufacturer. A person's baseline total tryptase level shows little variation over time. The primary determinant of that level is genetic, not environmental [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/laboratory-tests-to-support-the-clinical-diagnosis-of-anaphylaxis/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h2\">Elevations in anaphylaxis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Elevated levels of mature or total tryptase in serum or plasma may be useful for distinguishing anaphylaxis from other conditions in the differential diagnosis, such as vasovagal reactions, septic shock, seizures, myocardial shock, benign flushing, or carcinoid syndrome. These other disorders are NOT normally associated with elevations in serum mature or total tryptase levels. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=differential-diagnosis-of-anaphylaxis-in-children-and-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Differential diagnosis of anaphylaxis in children and adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Tryptase levels in serum or plasma begin to rise as early as 5 minutes after clinical onset of anaphylaxis, reaching maximal levels between 30 and 90 minutes, and then decline with a half-life of about 2 hours. An increased level of mature tryptase in serum collected during an acute clinical event indicates that mast cell (and possibly basophil) activation has occurred. There is no other known condition that results in selective elevations of mature tryptase. Total tryptase levels may also rise during anaphylaxis, and a rise in total tryptase levels above baseline may be more sensitive than a single mature tryptase level [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/laboratory-tests-to-support-the-clinical-diagnosis-of-anaphylaxis/abstract/22,25\" class=\"abstract_t\">22,25</a>]. The minimal elevation of the acute total tryptase level that is considered to be clinically significant was suggested to be &ge;2 + 1.2 x baseline tryptase levels [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/laboratory-tests-to-support-the-clinical-diagnosis-of-anaphylaxis/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. The ratio of total to mature tryptase during systemic anaphylaxis is typically &lt;10 and approaches unity at higher levels of mature tryptase (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F79722\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef79722 \">table 2</a>).</p><p>Elevations during anaphylaxis can range from marginally elevated to levels &gt;100 <span class=\"nowrap\">ng/mL</span>. Dramatic elevations have been recorded following anaphylactic shock induced by medications, for example.</p><p>Both total and mature tryptase levels should be higher in the acute than in the baseline sample. Comparing acute and baseline levels greatly improves the diagnostic value of total tryptase measurements. If total tryptase is the only test available, then paired levels are essential for interpretation (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F58418\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef58418 \">table 4</a>).</p><p>Higher baseline levels of total tryptase initially appeared to increase the risk for more severe anaphylaxis, particularly in insect venom-sensitive subjects, to both field stings and to venom immunotherapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/laboratory-tests-to-support-the-clinical-diagnosis-of-anaphylaxis/abstract/27,28\" class=\"abstract_t\">27,28</a>]. However, this risk may reflect the increased likelihood of underlying mastocytosis or an activating c-kit mutation rather than the tryptase level per se. Notably, patients with a history of systemic anaphylaxis to insect stings and a baseline tryptase level &gt;11.4 <span class=\"nowrap\">ng/mL</span> have a high prevalence of underlying clonal mast cell disease (systemic mastocytosis or monoclonal mast cell activation syndrome [MMAS]) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/laboratory-tests-to-support-the-clinical-diagnosis-of-anaphylaxis/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. However, patients with systemic anaphylaxis to insect stings and a normal tryptase level also may have an underlying clonal mast cell disorder, and this possibility should be considered in patients with hypotensive reactions to stings in the absence of urticaria [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/laboratory-tests-to-support-the-clinical-diagnosis-of-anaphylaxis/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>].

Several possible explanations for lower or no tryptase elevation in food-induced anaphylaxis have been proposed, including the following:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Localized rather than systemic release of mast cell mediators may occur in some victims of anaphylaxis (eg, those with laryngeal edema).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Tryptase released by mast cells at mucosal sites may not diffuse into the circulation as efficiently as that released near blood vessels, and mast cells at mucosal surfaces contain less tryptase than those in the skin and perivascular tissues.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>There may be immunoglobulin E (IgE)-dependent anaphylactic pathways that bypass mast cells and involve basophils <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> other cell types. Proving basophil-dependent anaphylaxis has been problematic because there is no test at present for specifically detecting basophil activation.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Other pathways that could clinically mimic anaphylaxis might include production of nonmast cell vasoactive mediators, such as complement anaphylatoxins (C3a and C5a), kinins, or lipids.

Elevations in tryptase correlate with hypotension and support the diagnosis of anaphylaxis, although normal levels do not exclude anaphylaxis, particularly in food-induced reactions, samples collected more than 4 hours after symptom onset, and those without hypotension. The specificity and sensitivity of tryptase elevations have not been precisely determined but increase with clinical severity.</p><p>Ideally, samples should be collected between 15 minutes to 3 hours of the event onset, or as soon as possible thereafter. Large elevations in tryptase may persist for several hours.</p><p>Mature tryptase is more specific for mast cell activation than total tryptase, particularly when only a single acute specimen is available. The predictive value of total tryptase is markedly improved by comparing an acute with a baseline sample, using the formula acute &ge;2 + 1.2 baseline to calculate the minimal acute tryptase level likely to be clinically significant. Using this formula, the sensitivity of the total tryptase assay appears to be greater than for an acute mature tryptase level alone.</p><p>Detailed descriptions of the clinical event and medications received before and during the event are needed for optimal interpretation of tryptase levels.

The prevalence of false elevations in tryptase is higher in subjects that are rheumatoid factor-positive, although the immunoglobulin G (IgG) or immunoglobulin M (IgM) rheumatoid factors recognizing human IgG may not be the culprits binding to the mouse antitryptase antibodies used in the immunoassay. Instead, these individuals are more likely to have human antimouse antibodies that crosslink the capture and detector mouse antitryptase antibodies, similar to how tryptase crosslinks these antibodies.</p><p>Phadia began adding a heterophilic antibody suppressor to their tryptase kit in early 2011, which markedly reduces such false-positives such that this is probably no longer an issue. Such a reagent has been added to tryptase measurements performed by the author since 2005. In addition, the author's diagnostic lab at Virginia Commonwealth University performs a negative-control enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), using a mouse nonimmune detector antibody that appears positive in the presence of heterophilic antibody, but not in the presence of tryptase, which serves as a warning of the presence of breakthrough heterophilic antibody activity.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H17\"><span class=\"h1\">HISTAMINE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Histamine is a biogenic amine produced by and stored in human mast cells and basophils, and is the only preformed granule mediator of these cells known to have direct potent vasoactive and smooth muscle spasmogenic activities. Mast cells and basophils produce comparable amounts of histamine [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/laboratory-tests-to-support-the-clinical-diagnosis-of-anaphylaxis/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>].</p><p>Histamine is generated intracellularly from histidine by histidine decarboxylase. Most of this histamine is then stored in the secretory granules of mast cells and basophils, although a small portion is released constitutively. Histamine binds to carboxyl and possibly sulfate moieties on proteins and proteoglycans in the acidic pH environment of secretory granules. However, in the neutral pH of the extracellular environment, histamine is less positively charged and becomes dissociated from the macromolecular structures to which it had been bound. Free histamine has low molecular mass (111 Da) and high solubility, and rapidly diffuses away from its local sites of release. A portion may enter the circulation. A smaller amount of free histamine may pass into the urine unmetabolized.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H18\"><span class=\"h2\">Elevations during anaphylaxis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Similar to tryptase, any elevation in plasma or urine histamine is consistent with anaphylaxis, although normal levels do not exclude the diagnosis. Ideally, the acute level should be compared with a baseline level.</p><p>Histamine elevations correlate well with clinical severity of anaphylaxis. Although histamine levels in properly collected samples of plasma have a greater sensitivity than tryptase, the short plasma half-life of histamine and the difficulties in handling the sample usually limit the utility of this measurement in the clinical setting [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/laboratory-tests-to-support-the-clinical-diagnosis-of-anaphylaxis/abstract/62\" class=\"abstract_t\">62</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H19\"><span class=\"h2\">Histamine metabolites</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Within minutes, the majority of released histamine is sequentially metabolized to N-methylhistamine and then to N-methylimidazole acetic acid by histamine N-methyl transferase and monoamine oxidase, or to imidazole acetic acid by diamine oxidase. N-methylhistamine and N-methylimidazole acetic acid are specific metabolites of histamine, while imidazole acetic acid is not. Levels of N-methylhistamine or N-methylimidazole acetic acid, which can be measured in plasma or urine, may also reflect overall levels of released histamine. These metabolites, generated acutely and then stored in the bladder, will be detectable in the urine for several hours after anaphylaxis. Elevated urinary N-methylhistamine was observed in specimens collected 6 hours after an insect sting challenge in patients experiencing systemic anaphylactic symptoms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/laboratory-tests-to-support-the-clinical-diagnosis-of-anaphylaxis/abstract/63\" class=\"abstract_t\">63</a>].</p><p>Some investigators consider these metabolites to be more reliable indicators of histamine release than histamine itself. N-methylhistamine is longer-lived than histamine in the circulation, accounts for a greater portion of the released histamine that ends up in the urine, and demonstrates less natural diurnal variation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/laboratory-tests-to-support-the-clinical-diagnosis-of-anaphylaxis/abstract/64-66\" class=\"abstract_t\">64-66</a>]. However, another study of anaphylaxis during anesthesia found urinary N-methylhistamine to be less sensitive than either plasma tryptase or histamine, so the relative merits of histamine and its metabolites are not fully defined [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/laboratory-tests-to-support-the-clinical-diagnosis-of-anaphylaxis/abstract/67\" class=\"abstract_t\">67</a>].</p><p>In summary, urinary histamine, N-methylhistamine or methylimidazole acetic acid levels are helpful when elevated above baseline, but normal levels do not exclude mast cell activation.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H20\"><span class=\"h2\">Assays and collection of samples</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Assays are commercially available to measure histamine and its metabolites in biologic fluids (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F69698\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef69698 \">table 1</a>).</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Blood</strong> &ndash; Normal levels of histamine in plasma are approximately 2 nM. Plasma should be used, rather than serum, to avoid the artifactual release of histamine from basophils that can occur during clotting. The blood sample must be collected through a 20-gauge or larger needle, and pulled manually under gentle pressure into a syringe containing either citrate or EDTA. Pulling blood through a narrow-bore needle under vacuum can also cause basophil activation or breakage ex vivo and falsely elevate the levels of histamine.

However, serum, plasma, and urine obtained during or shortly after the acute event can support the clinical diagnosis of anaphylaxis. (See <a href=\"#H1\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Mast cells and basophils are the principal effector cells of systemic anaphylaxis and release a variety of mediators upon activation. Assays for tryptase (serum or plasma), histamine (plasma), histamine metabolites (urine), prostaglandin F<sub>2-alpha</sub> (PGF<sub>2-alpha</sub>) (urine) and leukotriene E<sub>4</sub> (LTE<sub>4</sub>) (urine) are available commercially (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F69698\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef69698 \">table 1</a>). (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Overview'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Tryptase should be measured within 15 minutes to 3 hours after onset of anaphylaxis symptoms (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F72041\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef72041 \">table 3</a>). Plasma histamine levels should be measured preferably less than 30 minutes after symptom onset. Metabolites of histamine accumulated in urine may remain elevated for several hours after an anaphylactic event. (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Time course of mediator release'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Tryptase exists in mature and immature (precursor) forms. The immature forms are constitutively released and reflect total body mast cell content, while mature tryptase is released from mast cells upon degranulation (ie, in anaphylaxis). Assays for total tryptase, which are available commercially, measure both immature and mature forms of tryptase. The only assay available for mature tryptase is performed in the author's laboratory (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F69698\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef69698 \">table 1</a>). Both mature and total tryptase can be useful in the evaluation of anaphylaxis, although levels of mature tryptase are more specific (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F79722\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef79722 \">table 2</a>). (See <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Tryptase'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Any elevation in mature tryptase in serum or plasma is suggestive of anaphylaxis, although normal levels do not exclude the diagnosis. Total tryptase will rise after anaphylaxis, but a follow-up baseline sample is required to interpret total tryptase accurately (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F58418\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef58418 \">table 4</a>). The ratio of total to mature tryptase during systemic anaphylaxis is typically &lt;10 (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F79722\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef79722 \">table 2</a>). (See <a href=\"#H10\" class=\"local\">'Elevations in anaphylaxis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Conditions that cause elevated total tryptase, with minimal or no elevations in mature tryptase, include systemic mastocytosis, acute myelocytic leukemia, myelodysplastic syndromes, hypereosinophilic syndrome (myelocytic variant), and onchocerciasis (during active treatment). (See <a href=\"#H15\" class=\"local\">'Systemic mastocytosis'</a> above and <a href=\"#H16\" class=\"local\">'Other conditions'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Plasma histamine elevations correlate well with clinical severity of anaphylaxis, although elevations are fleeting, and blood samples must be handled with great care, limiting the practical utility of this test (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F72041\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef72041 \">table 3</a>). Urinary metabolites of histamine, such as N-methylhistamine, are longer-lasting and can be assayed in a routine 24-hour urine sample. Like tryptase, any elevations of these mediators support the diagnosis of anaphylaxis, but normal levels do not exclude the possibility of anaphylaxis. (See <a href=\"#H17\" class=\"local\">'Histamine'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Urinary prostaglandin F<sub>2-alpha</sub> (PGF<sub>2-alpha</sub>), a metabolite of prostaglandin D<sub>2</sub> (PGD<sub>2</sub>), is elevated after mast cell-mediated anaphylaxis, unless the patient has taken a cyclooxygenase inhibitor such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aspirin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">aspirin</a>, and can be measured in the same urine specimen as N-methylhistamine. Assays for urinary LTE<sub>4</sub> are available from commercial laboratories. (See <a href=\"#H5038436\" class=\"local\">'Prostaglandin and metabolites'</a> above and <a href=\"#H293100982\" class=\"local\">'Leukotrienes and metabolites'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Chymase and mast cell carboxypeptidase A3 are other products that may be useful in the future for diagnosing anaphylaxis. Assays for these proteases are available only in research settings. (See <a href=\"#H22\" class=\"local\">'Possible future tests'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Several other laboratory tests are useful in excluding rare disorders that can mimic anaphylaxis (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F61358\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef61358 \">table 5</a>). (See <a href=\"#H25\" class=\"local\">'Tests for conditions mimicking anaphylaxis'</a> above.)</p></div><div id=\"topicAgreement\">Use of UpToDate is subject to the <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/legal/license\" class=\"licenseLink\" id=\"sla_in_page\">Subscription and License Agreement</a>.</div><div id=\"references\" class=\"headingAnchor\"><h1>REFERENCES</h1><ol id=\"reference\"><li><a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/laboratory-tests-to-support-the-clinical-diagnosis-of-anaphylaxis/abstract/1\" class=\"nounderline abstract_t\">Sampson HA, Mu&ntilde;oz-Furlong A, Campbell RL, et al.
