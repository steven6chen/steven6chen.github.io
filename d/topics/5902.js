Such hypertrophy is usually the response to a chronic volume or pressure load.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The two most important pressure overload states are systemic hypertension and aortic stenosis.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The major conditions associated with LV volume overload are aortic or mitral valve regurgitation and dilated cardiomyopathy.</p><p/><p>Ventricular septal defects cause both right and left ventricular volume overload, while hypertrophic cardiomyopathy is an example of an inherited condition in which LVH (usually with asymmetric septal hypertrophy) occurs in the absence of any apparent hemodynamic pressure or volume overload. A physiologic type of hypertrophy with increase in wall thickness and LV end-diastolic volume may occur in trained athletes. The &quot;athletic heart&quot; is often associated with electrocardiogram (ECG) voltage criteria for LVH. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hypertrophic-cardiomyopathy-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-evaluation#H2599226\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy: Clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and evaluation&quot;, section on 'Athlete's heart'</a>.)</p><p>LVH is not an acute condition. It takes weeks and usually months to years to develop. Patients with LVH from any cause are at increased risk for major cardiovascular complications, including congestive heart failure and cardiac arrhythmias [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/electrocardiographic-diagnosis-of-left-ventricular-hypertrophy/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>]. ECG markers of LVH also were associated with a significant increase in all-cause mortality in a large prospective study (ARIC) of the general, middle-aged population [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/electrocardiographic-diagnosis-of-left-ventricular-hypertrophy/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. These pathophysiologic outcomes may be fostered by the development of myocardial inflammation and fibrosis with LVH, as well as by the association of LVH due to systemic hypertension with renal and cerebrovascular disease. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-implications-and-treatment-of-left-ventricular-hypertrophy-in-hypertension\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical implications and treatment of left ventricular hypertrophy in hypertension&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The ECG is a useful but imperfect tool for detecting LVH. The utility of the ECG relates to its being relatively inexpensive and widely available. The limitations of the ECG relate to its moderate sensitivity or specificity depending upon which of the many proposed sets of criteria are applied [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/electrocardiographic-diagnosis-of-left-ventricular-hypertrophy/abstract/4,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,5</a>].</p><p>Echocardiography is the procedure of choice for diagnosing LVH. It can also permit quantitation of LV mass and give important information about the etiology of LVH (such as aortic or mitral valve disease, or hypertrophic cardiomyopathy). However, the ECG may be used when echocardiography is unavailable or not cost effective [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/electrocardiographic-diagnosis-of-left-ventricular-hypertrophy/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">GENERAL ELECTROCARDIOGRAPHIC FINDINGS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>LVH and related changes can produce five major ECG findings: increased QRS voltage, increased QRS duration, left axis deviation, repolarization (ST-T) changes, and left atrial abnormality [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/electrocardiographic-diagnosis-of-left-ventricular-hypertrophy/abstract/4,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,7</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Increased QRS voltage</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>An increase in LV mass predictably will augment the amplitude of voltage generated by these fibers. This effect will, in turn, increase the amplitude of positive forces (R waves) recorded over the left chest leads and negative forces (S waves) recorded over the right chest leads. LVH will also increase the amplitude of R waves in those limb leads that record the projection of these positive forces (typically I and aVL with a horizontal or leftward QRS axis) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F69040\" class=\"graphic graphic_waveform graphicRef69040 \">waveform 1</a>). (See <a href=\"#H8\" class=\"local\">'Electrocardiographic diagnosis'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Increased QRS duration</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>An increase in LV mass is often associated with widening of the QRS duration. This change may be subtle or may be associated with incomplete, or eventually complete, left bundle branch block (LBBB). On the other hand, most patients with LBBB have underlying LVH. In addition, some causes of LVH can lead to LBBB by other mechanisms such as calcification or fibrosis of the proximal ventricular conduction system, which lies close to the valve ring, in calcific aortic stenosis.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Left axis deviation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>LVH is usually associated with a horizontal or frankly leftward (&ge;-30&ordm;) QRS axis in the frontal plane leads. However, LVH may occur with a vertical QRS axis (or even rightward axis), especially in young adults or patients with biventricular hypertrophy. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=left-anterior-fascicular-block\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Left anterior fascicular block&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Repolarization abnormalities</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Severe LVH, especially due to a pressure load, is often associated with ST depressions and T wave inversions in leads with relatively tall R waves (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F76497\" class=\"graphic graphic_waveform graphicRef76497 \">waveform 2</a>). This pattern, formerly referred to as LV &quot;strain&quot; (but best referred to as &quot;LVH with associated ST-T wave abnormalities&quot;), may be due to primary alteration in repolarization of hypertrophied muscle or to relative subendocardial ischemia.</p><p>In a review of 886 hypertensive patients with LVH, these ST-T wave changes were present in 15 percent, were more common in those with coronary heart disease (29 versus 11 percent without coronary disease), and were associated with a greater LV mass [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/electrocardiographic-diagnosis-of-left-ventricular-hypertrophy/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. In another report of patients without evidence of coronary disease, increasing magnitude of ST depression correlated with increasing LV mass and with increasing prevalence of LVH [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/electrocardiographic-diagnosis-of-left-ventricular-hypertrophy/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. However, the sensitivity and specificity of ST segment depression alone for detecting LVH were limited.</p><p>The presence of ST-T wave abnormalities with LVH has adverse prognostic implications. In the <a href=\"topic.htm?path=losartan-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Losartan</a> Intervention for Endpoint Reduction in Hypertension (LIFE) study, ST-T changes (&quot;strain&quot;) on the baseline ECG in concert with voltage criteria for LVH increased the five-year risk of heart failure by more than threefold and the risk of heart failure-related mortality by fourfold [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/electrocardiographic-diagnosis-of-left-ventricular-hypertrophy/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>].</p><p>A cellular basis for T wave inversion was suggested from an animal model of LVH, which found regional differences in action potential characteristics [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/electrocardiographic-diagnosis-of-left-ventricular-hypertrophy/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. There was prolongation of the early repolarization phase of the action potential duration in the subepicardial and mid-myocardial layers; this phase was not altered in the subendocardium, but the plateau phase of the action potential was shortened. The net effect was an endocardial to epicardial sequence of repolarization, the reverse of normal.</p><p>By comparison, LVH with a volume load state, particularly due to mitral or aortic regurgitation, is sometimes associated with prominent <strong>positive</strong> T waves in the lateral chest leads.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Left atrial abnormality</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Most patients with LVH develop abnormalities in left atrial depolarization due to conduction delay or actual atrial enlargement. The two major markers of left atrial abnormality are increased duration of P waves (&ge;120 ms) in the limb leads <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> biphasic P waves with a prominent negative component (&ge;40 ms in duration <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> &ge;1 mV in depth) in V1. Biphasic P waves with a very prominent negative component may be a subtle but important clue to major abnormalities such as severe mitral regurgitation or dilated cardiomyopathy.</p><p>The presence of a left atrial abnormality may be particularly helpful in the setting of an LBBB. In a series of 220 patients with and without an LBBB, 92 percent of those with a left atrial abnormality had LVH as established by echocardiography; the sensitivity, specificity, predictive valve, and accuracy were 80, 89, 88, and 78 percent, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/electrocardiographic-diagnosis-of-left-ventricular-hypertrophy/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h1\">ELECTROCARDIOGRAPHIC DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The ECG diagnosis of LVH is quite reliable when very prominent voltage is seen in conjunction with left atrial and ST-T abnormalities, leftward axis, or widening of the QRS. As noted above, however, false negative and false positive diagnoses are not uncommon. Patients with LVH may fail to show voltage criteria, especially if they have only mild hypertrophy or underlying obstructive lung disease. The sensitivity is also reduced in women and in subjects with obesity. Right bundle branch block, when associated with decreased S waves in leads V1 and V2, may decrease the sensitivity of some voltage criteria for LVH. On the other hand, increased voltage is a common normal variant, particularly in young adult males and in athletes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/electrocardiographic-diagnosis-of-left-ventricular-hypertrophy/abstract/4,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,13</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hypertrophic-cardiomyopathy-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-evaluation#H2599226\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy: Clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and evaluation&quot;, section on 'Athlete's heart'</a>.)</p><p>The question of whether left anterior fascicular block (LAFB; hemiblock) can simulate LVH in the limb leads (ie, tall R waves in I and aVL) is somewhat controversial and requires further study. Since arterial hypertension is one of the most common causes of LAFB and also a major cause of LVH, these two findings often coexist. ECG evidence of left atrial abnormality with marked left axis may add to the specificity of diagnosing both LAFB and LVH.</p><p>Commonly used criteria are given below with estimates of their accuracy. Given the intrinsic limitations of the ECG and the many extracardiac factors that affect QRS voltage (eg, body habitus, pulmonary status, age, etc), it is not realistic to expect more than moderate accuracy from the ECG in diagnosing LVH [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/electrocardiographic-diagnosis-of-left-ventricular-hypertrophy/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].</p><p>The following are the major criteria used in the ECG diagnosis of LVH [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/electrocardiographic-diagnosis-of-left-ventricular-hypertrophy/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. More complex mathematical models based upon the ECG are of limited clinical use in predicting echocardiographic LV mass.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h2\">Sokolow-Lyon indices</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There are two criteria with these widely used indices:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Sum of S wave in V1 and R wave in V5 or V6 &ge;3.5 mV (35 mm)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span></p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>R wave in aVL &ge;1.1 mV (11 mm) (sometimes &ge;1.3 mV [13 mm] is used)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3868718\"><span class=\"h2\">Romhilt-Estes point score system</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>This index gives different weights to specific findings (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F51012\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef51012 \">table 1</a>). A score of 5 or more indicates &quot;definite&quot; LVH; a score of 4 indicates &quot;probable&quot; LVH. The upper limits of the QRS duration used in this system (90 ms) was from the pre-computerized measurement era. The upper limits of QRS duration by computerized measurements in adults is 100 to 110 ms.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h2\">Cornell voltage criteria</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>These criteria are based upon echocardiographic correlative studies designed to detect an LV mass index &gt;132 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/m<sup>2</sup></span> in men and &gt;109 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/m<sup>2</sup></span> in women.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For men: S in V3 plus R in aVL &gt;2.8 mV (28 mm)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For women: S in V3 + R in aVL &gt;2.0 mV (20 mm)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h2\">Accuracy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The sensitivity and specificity of these criteria vary widely depending upon the populations studied, the &quot;gold standard&quot; employed (LV mass or chamber dimension by echocardiographic or magnetic resonance imaging [MRI] versus necropsy measurements), and the severity of LVH. Conservative estimates of the sensitivity of the various criteria for moderate to severe LVH have been in the 30 to 60 percent or lower range, with specificities in the 80 to 90 percent range [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/electrocardiographic-diagnosis-of-left-ventricular-hypertrophy/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. This wide range is supported by data from the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis in middle-aged to older men and women [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/electrocardiographic-diagnosis-of-left-ventricular-hypertrophy/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. Traditional ECG-LVH criteria were reassessed and showed overall and ethnicity-specific low sensitivity (10 to 26 percent) and high specificity (88 to 99 percent) in diagnosing MRI-defined LVH. The Cornell criteria provided moderate sensitivity (40 percent) while maintaining good specificity (90 percent). The highest accuracy of various criteria was noted in African Americans.</p><p>Although it is relatively insensitive, the ECG does have prognostic significance. Hypertensive patients with echocardiographically-proven LVH who also meet ECG criteria have a greater LV mass than those without the expected ECG changes. The LV mass is highest in those with associated ST-T abnormalities (formerly termed the &quot;strain&quot; pattern).</p><p>Serial monitoring of ECG voltage also may be helpful. In particular, changes in ECG voltage over time may reflect changes in LV mass and correlate with cardiovascular risk (eg, regression of LVH with effective antihypertensive therapy). However, &quot;loss&quot; of LVH voltage criteria may also be due to alterations in lead placement or to factors that may be associated with decreased QRS voltage such as anasarca, pleural or pericardial effusion, weight gain, and increased severity of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Thus, regression of LVH is most accurately determined by echocardiography.
