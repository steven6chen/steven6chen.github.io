The prevalence of this disorder is uncertain, particularly since the potential contributory role of high-output syndromes to HF may not be appreciated in many cases. Although high-output states are uncommon as a sole cause of HF, they may more commonly contribute to HF in patients with underlying cardiovascular disease and reduced myocardial reserve. (See <a href=\"#H3445715294\" class=\"local\">'Role of concurrent cardiac conditions'</a> below.)</p><p>In a Mayo Clinic series of 120 consecutive patients with high-output HF diagnosed between 2000 and 2014, the most common causes were morbid obesity (31 percent), liver disease (22.5 percent), arteriovenous shunts (22.5 percent), lung disease (16 percent), and myeloproliferative disorders (8 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-and-pathophysiology-of-high-output-heart-failure/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. This study excluded patients with physiologic (eg, pregnancy, fever, infection), iatrogenic (pulmonary vasodilator or inotrope administration), or congenital causes of high output, as well as patients with severe anemia (hemoglobin &lt;8 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL),</span> hyperthyroidism, valvular heart disease, constrictive pericarditis, left ventricular systolic dysfunction (left ventricular ejection fraction &lt;45 percent), cardiomyopathy, or heart transplantation. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1981261847\"><span class=\"h1\">PATHOPHYSIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>High-output HF is characterized by elevated cardiac output, low systemic vascular resistance (due to peripheral vasodilation or arteriovenous shunting), and low arterial-venous oxygen content difference; some types are associated with increased oxygen consumption (reflecting increased metabolic demand). In the setting of high-output HF, the elevation in cardiac output is greater than that required to meet metabolic demand [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-and-pathophysiology-of-high-output-heart-failure/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. </p><p>In high-output HF, low systemic vascular resistance results in borderline preserved or depressed systemic arterial blood pressure and elevated cardiac filling pressures [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-and-pathophysiology-of-high-output-heart-failure/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Ineffective blood volume and pressure lead to activation of the sympathetic nervous system and renin-angiotensin-aldosterone axis and increased serum vasopressin (antidiuretic hormone) concentrations. This neurohormonal activation results in increased renovascular resistance and reduced renal blood flow and glomerular filtration rate, with retention of salt and water [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-and-pathophysiology-of-high-output-heart-failure/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Chronic volume overload gradually may cause ventricular enlargement, remodeling, and HF. </p><p>The conditions that provoke high-output HF are rarely the sole cause of HF. In most such patients, the high cardiac output provokes HF in the setting of reduced ventricular reserve (systolic <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> diastolic dysfunction) from some underlying cardiac problem. Thus, the presence of high-output HF should prompt a search for another underlying cardiovascular condition. (See <a href=\"#H3445715294\" class=\"local\">'Role of concurrent cardiac conditions'</a> below and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-management-of-high-output-heart-failure#H2663884181\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and management of high-output heart failure&quot;, section on 'Diagnostic evaluation'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1590881010\"><span class=\"h1\">CAUSES AND THEIR MECHANISMS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A number of conditions lead to an obligatory increase in cardiac output, which can precipitate HF in some patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-and-pathophysiology-of-high-output-heart-failure/abstract/1,3\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,3</a>]. While hemodynamic alterations are present across various etiologies, there are some differences among etiologies. In a series of 120 consecutive patients with high-output HF, oxygen consumption indexed to weight was highest and mixed venous oxygen content was lowest in the myeloproliferative disorder group [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-and-pathophysiology-of-high-output-heart-failure/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. The subgroup with liver disease had the lowest arterial-venous oxygen content difference and lowest systemic vascular resistance. </p><p>There are a variety of pathophysiologic processes that result in a high-output state. Some causes appear to have primarily peripheral vascular effects, while other causes may have metabolic effects or myocardial as well as peripheral vascular effects. The distinction between these categories is imperfect, since some causes are associated with combinations of peripheral vascular, metabolic, and myocardial effects (eg, hyperthyroidism). Peripheral vascular effects can have secondary effects on cardiac structure and function. </p><p>The prognosis of high-output HF is highly variable, as it is largely dependent upon the cause and concurrent conditions. Overall, the mortality rate in patients with high-output HF is increased compared with controls without heart disease (eg, hazard ratio 3.4; 95% CI 1.6-7.6 compared with controls [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-and-pathophysiology-of-high-output-heart-failure/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]). </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3648838780\"><span class=\"h2\">Causes grouped by predominant mechanism</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1322620532\"><span class=\"h3\">Peripheral vascular effects</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The following conditions with largely peripheral vascular primary effects can lead to high-output HF.

Although oxygen consumption is high in this setting, it is not elevated after adjustment for weight. The effects of obesity on the cardiovascular system may be exacerbated by pressure overload states such as hypertension [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-and-pathophysiology-of-high-output-heart-failure/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2224858461\"><span class=\"h4\">Arteriovenous fistula</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A large or multiple small systemic arteriovenous fistulas can cause high-output HF. A fistula can be congenital or acquired. Blood from a high-pressure artery is shunted via the arteriovenous fistula to a low-pressure vein, thus bypassing capillary beds and decreasing systemic vascular resistance. Compensatory increases in heart rate, stroke volume, and total plasma volume ensue. The elevation in cardiac output associated with a fistula depends upon the size of the communication and the magnitude of the resultant reduction in systemic vascular resistance. Since blood flowing through the fistula bypasses the capillary circulation, the total cardiac output increases by the quantity of blood flowing through the fistula to maintain capillary perfusion. </p><p>As described below, high-output HF in patients with chronic kidney disease most often results from an arteriovenous dialysis fistula and anemia (which is now less common due to the widespread use of erythropoietin) superimposed on underlying heart disease. Other renal etiologies include acquired intrarenal arteriovenous fistulas such as those arising as a complication following renal biopsy, renal cell carcinoma, and congenital renal arteriovenous malformation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-and-pathophysiology-of-high-output-heart-failure/abstract/5,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,6</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2493289103\"><span class=\"h5\">Acquired</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Acquired fistulas may be caused by trauma, by a medical procedure (eg, surgically constructed arteriovenous access for hemodialysis or as a complication of a procedure), or by a highly vascular condition or tumor. Traumatic causes include bullet or knife wounds, especially in the thigh. An aortocaval fistula may be caused by trauma or by spontaneous rupture of an aortic aneurysm [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-and-pathophysiology-of-high-output-heart-failure/abstract/7,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,8</a>].</p><p>Iatrogenic fistulas include surgically constructed arteriovenous fistulas used for access to the circulation in patients undergoing chronic hemodialysis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-and-pathophysiology-of-high-output-heart-failure/abstract/9,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,10</a>]. An arteriovenous fistula can cause high-output HF and can also worsen pulmonary hypertension and cause right HF, as discussed separately.

Other cases of iatrogenic arteriovenous fistulas associated with high-output failure include an iliac arteriovenous fistula after lumbar disk surgery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-and-pathophysiology-of-high-output-heart-failure/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>] and high-output failure following transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunting (TIPS) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-and-pathophysiology-of-high-output-heart-failure/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. In a prospective study of 15 portal hypertensive patients, hyperdynamic circulation worsened immediately after TIPS, with a progressive adaptation over two months [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-and-pathophysiology-of-high-output-heart-failure/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. </p><p>Arterial puncture for cardiac catheterization is an uncommon iatrogenic cause of arteriovenous fistula with an incidence of less than 1 percent of catheterizations with a transfemoral approach [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-and-pathophysiology-of-high-output-heart-failure/abstract/14,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">14,15</a>] and less than 0.1 percent using a transradial or transulnar approach [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-and-pathophysiology-of-high-output-heart-failure/abstract/16,17\" class=\"abstract_t\">16,17</a>]. High-output HF is a rare sequela of an arteriovenous fistula from cardiac catheterization with a clinical presentation ranging from two days to several months post-catheterization [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-and-pathophysiology-of-high-output-heart-failure/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>].</p><p>Skeletal disorders such as osteitis deformans (Paget disease) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-and-pathophysiology-of-high-output-heart-failure/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>], multiple myeloma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-and-pathophysiology-of-high-output-heart-failure/abstract/20-22\" class=\"abstract_t\">20-22</a>], and polyostotic fibrous dysplasia (McCune-Albright syndrome) have been identified as causes of high-output HF. Multiple minute arteriovenous fistulas in the bony lesions may cause high-output HF [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-and-pathophysiology-of-high-output-heart-failure/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. Extensive bone involvement (more than 20 percent of the skeleton) is required to increase the cardiac output to the point at which it may contribute to high-output problems. An additional factor for the increase in cardiac output in Paget disease may be increased cutaneous blood flow resulting from local heat production by the increased metabolic activity of affected bone. There appears to be a linear relationship between the amount of skeletal involvement and cardiac index in patients with this disease. In one study, the subgroup of patients with more extensive skeletal involvement had lower peripheral vascular resistance, higher stroke volume, and greater hydroxyproline excretion (a marker of bone turnover) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-and-pathophysiology-of-high-output-heart-failure/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>].

The mechanism for high-output failure in beriberi may be multifactorial, with high cardiac output superimposed on myocardial dysfunction.

The high cardiac output is due to reduced systemic vascular resistance and augmented venous return.

Pyruvate and lactate are important substrates for oxidation and energy production in heart muscle, but thiamine deficiency blocks their utilization. Specifically, thiamine pyrophosphate is needed for the decarboxylation of pyruvate and its subsequent oxidation in the citric acid cycle. As a result of thiamine deficiency, pyruvate and its precursor lactate build up in the blood; increased blood lactate level has been used in the diagnosis of beriberi but is nonspecific. Thiamine deficiency also inhibits the function of the hexose monophosphate shunt, contributing to insufficient oxygenation of the tissues.

Anemia, even when severe, rarely causes HF, and when it does, it is likely that the high-output failure is superimposed upon some cardiac abnormality such as valvular heart disease or underlying LV dysfunction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-and-pathophysiology-of-high-output-heart-failure/abstract/84\" class=\"abstract_t\">84</a>].

Anemia may also cause peripheral vasodilation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-and-pathophysiology-of-high-output-heart-failure/abstract/87\" class=\"abstract_t\">87</a>] due to endothelial dysfunction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-and-pathophysiology-of-high-output-heart-failure/abstract/88\" class=\"abstract_t\">88</a>]. The loss of hemoglobin is partly compensated by an increase in cardiac output and widening of the arteriovenous O<sub>2</sub> difference.

In patients with HF due to other causes, there is evidence that chronic anemia is associated with the progression of HF, but anemia is also associated with a number of common comorbidities. There is conflicting evidence regarding whether anemia is an independent cause of HF progression and worse outcomes, or if it is simply associated with overall disease severity.

Premature atherosclerosis and LV hypertrophy due to hypertension are common in patients with end-stage renal disease. Thus, patients with end-stage renal disease frequently have heart disease with increased susceptibility to HF in the setting of an elevated cardiac output. Another example of multiple factors causing HF is high-output HF caused by the combination of morbid obesity plus cirrhosis due to nonalcoholic fatty liver disease.
