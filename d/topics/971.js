They are caused by a virus called human papillomavirus, or &quot;HPV.&quot; You can catch this virus during sex. Anogenital warts are often called just &quot;genital warts.&quot;</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H394373421\"><span class=\"h1\">Is HPV dangerous?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The type of HPV that causes most forms of genital warts is not usually dangerous. But other types of HPV can lead to cancer of the cervix (a part inside the woman's body), penis, or anus.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H394373428\"><span class=\"h1\">Do warts hurt or itch?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Not usually. Most people with genital warts have no symptoms (other than the warts). But some people have itching, burning, or tenderness.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H394373435\"><span class=\"h1\">Is there a test for genital warts?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>No, there is no test. But your doctor or nurse should be able to tell if you have warts just by doing an exam. He or she might also take small samples of tissue (biopsy) if it is not clear what you have. But that is not usually necessary.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H394373442\"><span class=\"h1\">How are genital warts treated?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There are several medicines that can help get rid of warts. Some work by slowly destroying the warts. Others work by getting your body's own infection-fighting system to attack the warts.</p><p>Most medicines are lotions or gels that go on the warts. They have to be applied one or more times a week for many weeks. Some medicines must be applied by a doctor or nurse. Others you can apply yourself.</p><p>People who do not get better with medicines or who have a very big wart or a lot of warts can have them removed. This is also an option for people who have warts that could become cancer.</p><p>There are different treatments to remove warts:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Cryotherapy, which uses a chemical to freeze warts</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Electrocautery, which uses electricity to burn away warts</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Traditional surgery, which involves cutting away warts</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Laser surgery, which uses light to destroy warts</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Ultrasound surgery, which uses sound waves to break up and remove warts (this is not available many places)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H23450561\"><span class=\"h1\">What if I am pregnant?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>If you are pregnant, make sure to tell your doctor before you get treated for genital warts. Some of the treatments for genital warts are safe to use during pregnancy, but others are not.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H394373449\"><span class=\"h1\">What happens after treatment?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>After you have been treated for warts, your doctor or nurse might ask you to check once in a while to see if they come back. If warts are going to come back, they will probably do so within a few months.</p><p>You should know that even if you cannot see any warts, you might still have HPV. That means that warts can come back at any time. If warts do come back, you could spread them to someone else.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H394373456\"><span class=\"h1\">Can genital warts be prevented?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Yes. There are now vaccines against HPV. They can help prevent infection with most of the forms of HPV that cause warts. But the vaccines can prevent infection only if you get vaccinated before you get warts.</p><p>You can also protect yourself by not having sex with anyone who is infected with HPV. But that is hard, because people do not always know that they have the virus. Condoms can help reduce the risk of infection. But they do not totally protect you. The virus can live on places on the skin not covered by a condom.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H394373463\"><span class=\"h1\">More on this topic</span></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=chlamydia-and-gonorrhea-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Chlamydia and gonorrhea (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=genital-herpes-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Genital herpes (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=screening-for-sexually-transmitted-infections-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Screening for sexually transmitted infections (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=hiv-aids-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: HIV/AIDS (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=trichomoniasis-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Trichomoniasis (The Basics)</a></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=genital-warts-in-women-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Genital warts in women (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=chlamydia-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Chlamydia (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=gonorrhea-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Gonorrhea (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=genital-herpes-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Genital herpes (Beyond the Basics)</a></p></div><div id=\"reviewProcess\"><span>All topics are updated as new evidence becomes available and our <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/home/editorial-policy\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"policy policy_editorialpolicy\">peer review process</a> is complete.</span></div><div id=\"topicRetrievedDate\"><span class=\"emphasis\">This topic retrieved from UpToDate on: </span>Apr 02, 2018.</div><div id=\"disclaimer\">The content on the UpToDate website is not intended nor recommended as a substitute for medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.
