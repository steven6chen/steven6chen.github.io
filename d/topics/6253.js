AKs represent early lesions on a continuum with squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) and occasionally progress to SCC. </p><p>AKs often present as erythematous and scaly macules or papules; lesions are most commonly detected in adults with fair skin. Chronic sun exposure is a major risk factor for the development of these lesions, which accounts for the usual detection of AKs in frequently sun-exposed areas (eg, balding scalp, face, lateral neck, and distal upper or lower extremities).</p><p>The epidemiology, clinical features, natural history, and diagnosis of AK will be discussed here. The management of AK and SCC is reviewed elsewhere.

It is estimated that between 1990 and 1999, 14 percent of dermatology visits in the United States were related to AKs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-natural-history-and-diagnosis-of-actinic-keratosis/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. </p><p>Individuals with fair skin are most likely to develop AKs, and many of the data on the epidemiology and risk factors for AK are derived from studies in Australia, northern Europe, and the United States. Factors such as the extent of exposure to ultraviolet light and certain phenotypic features have been associated with risk for developing these lesions.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H624955\"><span class=\"h2\">Ultraviolet radiation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Ultraviolet radiation is believed to contribute to the development of AK through the induction of mutations in epidermal keratinocytes that lead to increased survival and proliferation of atypical cells [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-natural-history-and-diagnosis-of-actinic-keratosis/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. Mutations in the p53 tumor suppressor gene, a gene involved in cell cycle regulation, apoptosis, and DNA repair, have been detected in 30 to 50 percent of lesional skin samples from patients with AKs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-natural-history-and-diagnosis-of-actinic-keratosis/abstract/6,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,7</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H584300\"><span class=\"h3\">Extent of sun exposure</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Individuals with extensive sun exposure, such as those with outdoor occupations, are at increased risk for AK [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-natural-history-and-diagnosis-of-actinic-keratosis/abstract/8-11\" class=\"abstract_t\">8-11</a>]. In a population-based study of 20,637 people in the United States, AKs were present in 55 percent of white men and 37 percent of white women between the ages of 65 and 74 years and who were classified as having high cumulative sun exposure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-natural-history-and-diagnosis-of-actinic-keratosis/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. In contrast, among a similar demographic population composed of subjects with low cumulative exposure to the sun, AKs were present in only 19 percent of men and 12 percent of women.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H584307\"><span class=\"h3\">History of sunburn</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A history of sunburn increases the risk for AK [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-natural-history-and-diagnosis-of-actinic-keratosis/abstract/8-10\" class=\"abstract_t\">8-10</a>]. In an Australian study of 2045 residents of Queensland, Australia (aged 20 to 69 years), six or more painful sunburns over the course of life were associated with an increased likelihood for AK (prevalence odds ratio [OR] 1.47, 95% CI 1.01-2.14) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-natural-history-and-diagnosis-of-actinic-keratosis/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. A separate cohort study of 197 residents of the same Australian state found that even a single episode of sunburn in childhood elevated the risk for AK [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-natural-history-and-diagnosis-of-actinic-keratosis/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>].

In a seven-month randomized trial, 588 residents (aged 40 or older) of Victoria, Australia who had between 1 and 30 AKs were instructed to apply either a broad-spectrum sunscreen with a sun protection factor (SPF) of 17 or a vehicle cream to the head, neck, and forearms daily. Patients in the sunscreen group developed significantly fewer new AKs (mean number of new lesions 1.6 versus 2.3) and had significantly more spontaneous remissions of AKs (mean percentage of resolved lesions 28 versus 20 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-natural-history-and-diagnosis-of-actinic-keratosis/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>].

Epidermal melanin absorbs ultraviolet radiation and shields keratinocytes against damage from ultraviolet light, resulting in a reduced risk for AK with darkening skin pigmentation. </p><p>The importance of skin color is supported by a study of 197 residents of Queensland, Australia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-natural-history-and-diagnosis-of-actinic-keratosis/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. Compared with olive-skinned individuals, people with fair or medium-toned (between fair and olive) skin were significantly more likely to develop AKs (age and sex adjusted odds ratios [OR] of 14.1, 95% CI 2.9-69.6 and 6.5, 95% CI 1.2-34.7, respectively) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-natural-history-and-diagnosis-of-actinic-keratosis/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. In addition, AKs are uncommon in African-Americans [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-natural-history-and-diagnosis-of-actinic-keratosis/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. Freckling, light hair color, a propensity to sunburn easily, and an inability to tan, which are more often seen in people with fair skin, are additional features that have been associated with increased risk for AK [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-natural-history-and-diagnosis-of-actinic-keratosis/abstract/1,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,12</a>].</p><p>The balding scalp is a common site for AK in men and may represent a risk factor for lesion development. In a Dutch population-based cohort study of 2061 men and women over the age of 50, severe baldness was associated with increased risk for AK when compared with minimal or no baldness [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-natural-history-and-diagnosis-of-actinic-keratosis/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. In particular, men with severe baldness were approximately seven times more likely to have 10 or more AKs than men with minimal or absent baldness (adjusted OR 7.0, 95% CI 3.8-13.1).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H422395\"><span class=\"h2\">Gender, age, and geographic location</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Sex and age influence the risk for AK. Men are more likely than women to develop these lesions, and the prevalence of AK rises with age [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-natural-history-and-diagnosis-of-actinic-keratosis/abstract/9,15,17-20\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,15,17-20</a>]. The magnitude of these effects is illustrated by the following observations:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a study in Queensland, Australia that evaluated the prevalence of AK in 2045 adults between the ages of 20 and 69 years, AKs were detected in 40 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-natural-history-and-diagnosis-of-actinic-keratosis/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. Lesions were present in 79 percent of men and 68 percent of women between the ages of 60 and 69 compared with only 10 percent of men and 5 percent of women aged 20 to 29 years.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A cohort study of 1040 people over the age of 40 in North Central Victoria, Australia also detected a high prevalence of AK that increased with age. Fifty-nine percent of study participants had at least one AK, and the mean age of individuals with AK was significantly higher than in those without AK (62 versus 54 years) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-natural-history-and-diagnosis-of-actinic-keratosis/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. </p><p/><p>Compared with Australia, AKs are less prevalent in the United States and northern Europe, where there is generally less sun exposure. Estimates of the proportion of adults with AKs in these locations range from 11 to 26 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-natural-history-and-diagnosis-of-actinic-keratosis/abstract/1,18,20,21\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,18,20,21</a>]. In a Dutch population-based study limited to individuals over the age of 50 years, physical examination revealed AK in 38 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-natural-history-and-diagnosis-of-actinic-keratosis/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. </p><p>The impact of geographic location was illustrated in a cohort study that compared the prevalence of AKs in Australian-born adults with that in British immigrants to Australia. All subjects were age 40 years or older. The prevalence of AKs in those who immigrated to Australia before the age of 20 became similar to native Australians in late adulthood, while those who immigrated after the age of 20 had fewer AKs than native Australians in all age groups [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-natural-history-and-diagnosis-of-actinic-keratosis/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. These results suggest that living in a location associated with greater exposure to ultraviolet light early in life may increase the risk for AK.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H421852\"><span class=\"h2\">Other</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H584493\"><span class=\"h3\">Genetic disorders</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Individuals with genetic disorders that interfere with effective DNA repair after exposure to ultraviolet radiation are at increased risk for AK. Examples include xeroderma pigmentosum, Bloom syndrome, and Rothmund-Thompson syndrome.

However, HPV is also detected in normal skin [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-natural-history-and-diagnosis-of-actinic-keratosis/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>], and an etiologic relationship between HPV and these lesions is uncertain. A cohort study of 291 adults (ages 36 to 86 years) in Queensland, Australia who were tested for the presence of betapapillomavirus in eyebrow hairs in 1996 did not identify an independent association of betapapillomavirus infection with the detection of AK in 2003 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-natural-history-and-diagnosis-of-actinic-keratosis/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. However, when combined with risk factors for AKs (eg, fair skin, male sex, age over 60), betapapillomavirus infection appeared to increase the likelihood for the development of AK. Additional studies are necessary to explore the role of HPV in this disorder.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H421788\"><span class=\"h3\">Immunosuppression</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Immunosuppression has been associated with an increased risk for SCC and may also increase the risk for AK [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-natural-history-and-diagnosis-of-actinic-keratosis/abstract/28-30\" class=\"abstract_t\">28-30</a>]. In a study of 94 renal transplant recipients in England (mean age 38 years and mean duration from transplant 4.5 years) and their matched controls, AKs developed in seven of the transplant recipients (7.4 percent) and in none of the controls [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-natural-history-and-diagnosis-of-actinic-keratosis/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. All patients with AKs had a history of high sun exposure, defined as more than three months in a tropical or subtropical climate or more than five years in an outdoor occupation. The risk for AK may rise as the time interval after transplant increases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-natural-history-and-diagnosis-of-actinic-keratosis/abstract/28,30\" class=\"abstract_t\">28,30</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H17075261\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL FEATURES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>AKs typically develop as solitary or multiple lesions on highly sun exposed areas, such as the balding scalp, neck, dorsal hands, and dorsal forearms. The lower extremities are an additional common site for AKs in women. Skin adjacent to AKs usually shows signs of solar damage, such as a yellow or pale color, spotty hyperpigmentation, scattered telangiectasias, or xerosis. AKs are generally asymptomatic, but some patients experience local tenderness or a stinging sensation. </p><p>AKs present as several clinical variants, including:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Classic (common) </strong>&ndash; The classic form of AK presents as an erythematous, scaly macule, papule, or plaque (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F50949%7EONC%2F53177\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef50949 graphicRef53177 \">picture 1A-B</a>). Lesions typically range from a few millimeters to 2 cm in diameter. Occasionally, lesions are larger.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Hypertrophic </strong>&ndash; Hypertrophic AKs are characterized by the presence of thick, adherent scale on an erythematous base (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F63461%7EDERM%2F72634\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef63461 graphicRef72634 \">picture 2A-B</a>).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Atrophic </strong>&ndash; Scale is absent in atrophic AKs. Lesions are smooth, red macules.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>AK with cutaneous horn</strong> &ndash; A cutaneous horn is a keratotic projection the height of which is at least one-half of the largest diameter (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F50667\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef50667 \">picture 3</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-natural-history-and-diagnosis-of-actinic-keratosis/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]. The mound of compact keratin often resembles a spicule or cone. Several other skin lesions can present with cutaneous horns.

If only a portion of the lesion can be removed due to size or concern for scarring, the thickest area of the lesion should be biopsied as SCC arising in an AK is most likely to be detected in this area.</p><p>Shave biopsies should extend into the dermis, and preferably at least into the mid-reticular dermis for lesions that are suspicious for SCC. An insufficient biopsy depth will compromise the pathologist's ability to rule out an invasive SCC. Punch biopsies performed with the full length of the punch blade usually reach the subcutaneous fat. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=skin-biopsy-techniques#H5\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Skin biopsy techniques&quot;, section on 'Biopsy techniques'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H625419\"><span class=\"h3\">Pathology</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The histopathologic findings of AKs are dependent upon the clinical variant and specific lesion characteristics. Unlike invasive SCCs, atypical keratinocytes do not invade into the dermis. Common histopathologic features of AK include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A collection of<strong> atypical keratinocytes</strong> with hyperchromatic and pleomorphic nuclei that extends from the basal layer of the epidermis upward; the full thickness of the epidermis is spared (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F76208%7EDERM%2F54208\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef76208 graphicRef54208 \">picture 17A-B</a>). Mitoses are not uncommon, and acanthosis (epidermal thickening) may be present.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A hyperkeratotic stratum corneum with alternating areas of <strong>orthokeratosis and parakeratosis</strong> (&quot;flag sign&quot;), particularly in hypertrophic AKs.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A variable lymphocytic dermal infiltrate.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Dermal changes consistent with <strong>solar elastosis</strong>.</p><p/><p>In addition to the above, pigmented AKs demonstrate increased melanin in the lower epidermis and dermal melanophages. Clinically atrophic lesions demonstrate a thin epidermis with atypia that predominantly involves the basal layer. </p><p>Histologic variants of AK include bowenoid, lichenoid, and acantholytic subtypes. The existence of the histologic bowenoid variant of AK is controversial. Bowenoid AKs are characterized by full-thickness epidermal dysplasia that is indistinguishable from SCC in situ; notably, keratinocytes in the acrosyringium are spared. Lichenoid lesions feature vacuolization of the basal layer of the epidermis and a band-like chronic inflammatory infiltrate in the superficial dermis. Acantholytic AKs exhibit detachment of keratinocytes due to loss of intercellular bridges; this results in the formation of clefts or lacunae immediately above the basal layer. </p><p>A histologic grading system analogous to that used for cervical intraepithelial neoplasia in gynecology has been proposed for AKs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-natural-history-and-diagnosis-of-actinic-keratosis/abstract/44\" class=\"abstract_t\">44</a>]. In this system, the term keratinocytic intraepidermal neoplasia, divided into grades of I, II, and III, is used to describe the progression of AK to in situ SCC. This grading system has not been widely adopted.</p><p>Biopsy specimens should be sent to a dermatopathologist when feasible. If pathology results fail to correlate with the clinical findings, consultation with the dermatopathologist may be beneficial. Additional pathologic sections may aid in identifying an invasive SCC, particularly in cases in which clinical suspicion for SCC is high [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-natural-history-and-diagnosis-of-actinic-keratosis/abstract/45\" class=\"abstract_t\">45</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H625426\"><span class=\"h2\">Dermoscopy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Dermoscopy is a noninvasive procedure that involves use of a handheld tool that combines magnification and a transilluminating light source to aid in the diagnosis of many cutaneous lesions. Dermoscopy is widely used for the evaluation of melanocytic nevi and lesions suspicious for melanoma. </p><p>Common dermoscopic features of nonpigmented AKs include a strawberry pattern (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F96295\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef96295 \">picture 18</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F96294\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef96294 \">picture 19</a>) (background erythema or a red pseudonetwork that consists of unfocused large vessels between hair follicles and prominent follicular openings surrounded by white halos) or a vascular pattern with linear, wavy vessels [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-natural-history-and-diagnosis-of-actinic-keratosis/abstract/46\" class=\"abstract_t\">46</a>].

Intense pigmentation, gray rhomboid lines, and loss of identifiable follicles are suggestive of lentigo maligna. However, histopathologic examination remains the gold standard for such cases.

Major risk factors for the development of AKs include chronic sun exposure, fair skin, advancing age, and male sex. (See <a href=\"#H17075246\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above and <a href=\"#H17075254\" class=\"local\">'Epidemiology and risk factors'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>AKs most commonly present as scaly, erythematous macules or papules on sites of chronic sun exposure (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F50949%7EONC%2F53177\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef50949 graphicRef53177 \">picture 1A-B</a>). Lesions may also be pigmented, nonerythematous, or free of scale. Typical locations for AKs include the scalp, face, lateral neck, dorsal forearms, and dorsal hands. Actinic cheilitis is a variant of AK that involves the lip (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F68057%7EDERM%2F67012%7EDERM%2F79589\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef68057 graphicRef67012 graphicRef79589 \">picture 4A-C</a>). (See <a href=\"#H17075261\" class=\"local\">'Clinical features'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>AKs may progress to squamous cell carcinoma (SCC). The risk that an individual AK will progress is low, but approximately 60 percent of cutaneous SCCs arise in sites of preexisting AKs. In addition, patients with AKs are at an increased risk for the development of SCCs or BCCs in other sites. (See <a href=\"#H17075268\" class=\"local\">'Clinical course'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The diagnosis of AK is often made based on visual and tactile clinical inspection. Biopsy is indicated if the diagnosis is uncertain; a common indication for biopsy is distinguishing AK from SCC. In particular, lesions that are greater than 1 cm in diameter, indurated, ulcerated, or rapidly growing and lesions that fail to respond to appropriate therapy should be considered for biopsy. (See <a href=\"#H17075275\" class=\"local\">'Diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pigmented AKs are often difficult to distinguish from lentigo maligna on clinical exam. Histopathologic examination is the gold standard for diagnosis. Dermoscopy may not reliably distinguish between these lesions.
