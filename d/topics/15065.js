It is designed to convert photons into neural impulses that travel along the visual pathways to the visual cortex. The retinal photoreceptors are some of the most metabolically active cells in the body. They line the outer portion of the neurosensory retina and their outer segments are in contact with the retinal pigment epithelia and underlying choroid. The choroidal circulation has the highest blood flow rate per cubic centimeter of tissue in the human body and provides a critical supply of oxygen to the outer third of the neurosensory retina and, in particular, to the retinal photoreceptors.</p><p>Retinal detachment occurs when the multilayer neurosensory retina separates from the underlying retinal pigment epithelium and choroid. This separation can occur passively due to accumulation of fluid between these two layers, or it may occur actively due to vitreous traction on the retina, such as with diabetic traction retinal detachment.</p><p>Separation between the neurosensory retina and the underlying choroidal circulation results in ischemia and rapid and progressive photoreceptor degeneration [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/retinal-detachment/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. The amount of photoreceptor degeneration and loss of vision can be minimized by rapid diagnosis and treatment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/retinal-detachment/abstract/2-4\" class=\"abstract_t\">2-4</a>]. Without treatment, most symptomatic retinal detachments progress to involve the entire retina and lead to loss of vision.</p><p>Understanding the basic pathophysiology involved in the process of retinal tear formation and retinal detachment and understanding the symptoms and signs of the early stages of this process are important in identifying high-risk patients, preventing the development of retinal detachments, and preventing loss of vision.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">PATHOPHYSIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Retinal detachments can be rhegmatogenous (caused by a break in the retina; &ldquo;rhegma&rdquo; is Greek for tear) or nonrhegmatogenous (caused by leakage or exudation from beneath the retina [exudative retinal detachment] or vitreous traction pulling on the retina [traction retinal detachment]). On occasion the retina appears to be detached but is actually not; this is termed pseudo retinal detachment.</p><p>A full-thickness retinal break may exist as a round retinal hole, as a linear break, or as a horseshoe-shaped retinal tear. In all of these cases, there is a discontinuity in the retina that allows vitreous fluid to pass through the retinal break into the subretinal space, resulting in retinal detachment.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Rhegmatogenous retinal detachment</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Rhegmatogenous retinal detachments are the most common type of retinal detachment. By definition, they are caused by a full-thickness retinal hole or retinal tear. Although distinct from traction retinal detachments (see <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'Traction retinal detachment'</a> below), these full-thickness holes or tears are also usually caused by vitreous traction on the retina. Unlike a traction retinal detachment, however, the traction does not directly pull the retina off the underlying tissue; instead, fluid that leaks through the hole or tear results in retinal detachment.</p><p>Holes and tears can be asymptomatic or symptomatic; asymptomatic breaks in the retina are much more common than symptomatic breaks but much less likely to lead to retinal detachment. Thus, most retinal holes or tears found in an asymptomatic patient do not result in retinal detachment, whereas symptomatic retinal breaks often result in retinal detachment.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h3\">Posterior vitreous detachment</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Posterior vitreous detachment (PVD) is the most common cause of retinal holes and tears, which may lead to rhegmatogenous retinal detachment (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F81192\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef81192 \">picture 3</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/retinal-detachment/abstract/5,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,6</a>]. The vitreous is a clear gel-like structure in the back of the eye composed of collagen fibrils and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hyaluronate-derivatives-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">hyaluronic acid</a> that slowly liquefies throughout life. These pockets of liquid can break through the posterior vitreous face and cause PVD from the retina. This event, which occurs typically in patients between the ages of 50 and 75 years, results in a new onset of cobweb-like floaters <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> increased floaters (see below).</p><p>Vitreous detachment usually occurs over one week but may take up to three months to completely develop. Any areas in which there might be an abnormally strong vitreoretinal adhesion are areas that, due to vitreous traction, may develop a full-thickness horseshoe retinal tear or operculated retinal tear. The aforementioned lattice degeneration is an example of an area that has an abnormally strong vitreoretinal connection. Anything that tugs on the retina will cause photopsias or flashes of light that last seconds and may be associated with eye movement. In addition, patients who develop a full-thickness retinal tear may also tear a small retinal blood vessel, resulting in a vitreous hemorrhage and an increasing number of floaters or blurred vision.</p><p>Thus, nontraumatic rhegmatogenous retinal detachments begin with the normal and acute development of PVD. If the patient also has areas of abnormally strong vitreoretinal adhesion, as in areas of lattice degeneration, a full-thickness retinal tear or hole can develop. Liquid vitreous within the eye can percolate through the retinal break creating retinal detachment.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h3\">Traumatic retinal detachment</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients who sustain an ocular injury also can develop a full-thickness retinal break or retinal dialysis. These may lead to subretinal migration of liquid vitreous and the development of a retinal detachment (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F77996\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef77996 \">picture 4</a>). This is much less common than spontaneous rhegmatogenous detachment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/retinal-detachment/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Nonrhegmatogenous retinal detachment</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h3\">Traction retinal detachment</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Traction retinal detachments occur when the vitreous has an abnormally strong attachment to the retina and contracts, thus pulling the retina off the back of the eye. This is typically seen in patients who have proliferative diabetic retinopathy, vitreomacular traction syndrome, retinopathy of prematurity, or sickle cell retinopathy and who subsequently develop retinal neovascularization. The areas of neovascularization and fibrosis between the retina and the vitreous create a strong adhesion between these two tissues. With vitreous contraction, the retina is pulled away from the back of the eye and a traction retinal detachment is created. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diabetic-retinopathy-prevention-and-treatment#H15\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Diabetic retinopathy: Prevention and treatment&quot;, section on 'Vitrectomy'</a>.)</p><p>Traction retinal detachment can also occur in patients who have had perforating trauma and have developed a fibrotic transvitreal retinal band that contracts. In addition, there are rare cases of patients who have an abnormally strong adhesion between the vitreous and the macula (the central part of the retina). Vitreous contraction in these cases can lead to a localized macular traction detachment called vitreomacular traction syndrome [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/retinal-detachment/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h3\">Exudative retinal detachment</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Exudative retinal detachment occurs in patients who do not have a full-thickness retinal break but rather have an accumulation of fluid beneath the retina. These types of retinal detachments are often associated with inflammatory conditions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/retinal-detachment/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>], may occur spontaneously as with central serous chorioretinopathy, or can occur in association with choroidal <span class=\"nowrap\">neoplasms/metastases</span>. Traditional retinal reattachment surgeries are not effective since exudative retinal detachments are not associated with a full-thickness retinal break. Diagnosing and treating the underlying etiology of the exudative retinal detachment is critical in curing the problem and restoring vision [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/retinal-detachment/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h2\">Lattice degeneration</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Lattice degeneration is a relatively common condition found in about 6 to 8 percent of eyes and characterized by focal retinal thinning in the periphery of the retina, associated with overlying vitreous liquefaction, sclerotic lattice-like vessels, and abnormally strong areas of vitreoretinal adhesion. An atrophic retinal hole may occur within a patch of lattice degeneration, which can cause a slowly developing and often asymptomatic peripheral retinal detachment in young patients with myopia.</p><p>Thus, lattice degeneration can be viewed as an asymptomatic precursor to retinal tears and potential detachment. Significant new tears or detachment occur in only 1 percent of patients with lattice degeneration [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/retinal-detachment/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. While prophylactic therapy for these lesions to prevent retinal detachment has been considered, most studies do not support this approach since tears are just as likely to occur in areas of the retina that appear normal. However, prophylactic laser barrier photocoagulation around focal areas of lattice degeneration in very high-risk eyes (such as history of giant retinal tear in the fellow eye) may be reasonable. (See <a href=\"#H23\" class=\"local\">'Prevention'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h2\">Pseudo retinal detachment</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There are a number of cases in which the retina appears to be detached but it is not:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Peripheral senile retinoschisis is a splitting of the peripheral retina with an elevated retinal layer; this generally has a very good prognosis</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>White without pressure is a white reflex at the vitreoretinal interface that is normally seen in some patients</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Choroidal lesion or swelling or infolding due to choroidal neoplasms, swelling, or hypotonia</p><p/><p>These causes of a pseudo retinal detachment need to be diagnosed by a retina specialist or ophthalmologist [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/retinal-detachment/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h1\">EPIDEMIOLOGY/RISK FACTORS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Nontraumatic rhegmatogenous retinal detachment occurs in approximately 1 in 10,000 people per year [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/retinal-detachment/abstract/13,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,14</a>]. Myopia is a major risk factor. In a case-control study of 253 patients with idiopathic retinal detachment and 1138 controls, an eye with a spherical equivalent refractive error of -1 to -3 diopters had a fourfold increased risk of retinal detachment compared with a non-myopic eye; the risk was increased 10-fold if the refractive error was greater than -3 diopters [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/retinal-detachment/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. These data suggest that almost 55 percent of nontraumatic detachments in eyes without previous surgery are attributable to myopia.</p><p>Retinal detachment is also a complication of cataract surgery and an association with current use of fluoroquinolones has been reported [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/retinal-detachment/abstract/16,17\" class=\"abstract_t\">16,17</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cataract-in-adults#H26\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Cataract in adults&quot;, section on 'Outcomes'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fluoroquinolones#H142842158\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Fluoroquinolones&quot;, section on 'Retinal detachment'</a>.)</p><p>Posterior vitreous detachment (PVD) typically occurs in patients between the ages of 50 and 75 years. However, it can occur earlier in patients who are myopic, have had a history of ocular trauma, or have had ocular inflammation, all of which lead to a more rapid vitreous liquefaction. Patients with a unilateral PVD are very likely to develop PVD in the other eye; in one series of 51 patients, 90 percent developed PVD in the contralateral eye within three years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/retinal-detachment/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. Patients diagnosed with an uncomplicated PVD have a 3.4 percent chance of developing a retinal tear within six weeks [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/retinal-detachment/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>].</p><p>Lattice degeneration is present in 6 to 8 percent of the general population and in approximately 30 percent of patients with nontraumatic rhegmatogenous retinal detachment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/retinal-detachment/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. Nevertheless, most patients with lattice degeneration do not develop a retinal detachment. In a prospective study of 276 untreated patients with lattice degeneration (423 eyes) followed for 1 to 25 years (mean 10.8 years), symptomatic retinal detachments occurred in only 3 of 276 patients (1 percent) and 0.7 percent of eyes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/retinal-detachment/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. Tractional retinal tears were slightly more common, occurring in eight patients (2.9 percent) and 1.9 percent of eyes; one of these led to a clinical retinal detachment. Clinical or progressive subclinical retinal detachment occurred in three eyes (2 percent) with atrophic holes. Asymptomatic retinal detachment was seen in 10 of 150 eyes with atrophic holes (6.7 percent) and had a much less serious prognosis than symptomatic detachment. The risk of retinal detachment in patients with lattice degeneration is much higher if the patient has already had one retinal detachment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/retinal-detachment/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>].</p><p>Asymptomatic retinal breaks have been reported in approximately 6 percent of eyes in clinical and autopsy studies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/retinal-detachment/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. The natural history of such breaks was investigated in a cohort study of 196 patients (235 involved eyes) who were followed from 1 to 33 years (mean 11 years) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/retinal-detachment/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. Nineteen eyes (8 percent) originally had or developed 22 areas of subclinical detachment. Ten eyes had acute PVD, which caused symptomatic retinal tears in three eyes, one of which also had a clinical retinal detachment. The chance of retinal detachment due to an asymptomatic retinal break in people in which a retinal detachment had not occurred in either eye was only approximately 0.5 percent. These findings suggest that asymptomatic retinal breaks do not show any significant tendency toward retinal detachment, with the exception of a few cases that progress to subclinical retinal detachment.</p><p>Other risk factors for retinal detachment include a family history of retinal detachment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/retinal-detachment/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>] or vitreous abnormalities.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL PRESENTATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients with the most common cause of retinal detachment, rhegmatogenous detachment following spontaneous posterior vitreous detachment (PVD), usually complain of an increasing number of floaters in one eye. The floaters may look like a cobweb or like one particularly large floater that appears to move in and out of central vision. The large floater represents the fibrous ring around the optic nerve and may have the appearance of &quot;a large housefly.&quot;</p><p>These symptoms are usually associated with acute PVD and result from the sudden separation of the vitreous gel from the surface of the retina. This sometimes dramatic presentation of vitreous floaters or debris can range from being an inconvenience or a nuisance to being visually disabling. The floaters usually resolve with time, settle down outside the visual axis, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> become less noticeable.</p><p>As the posterior vitreous face separates from the underlying retinal surface, it may encounter areas of abnormally strong vitreoretinal adhesions. At these sites, the separating vitreous will tug on the surface of the retina and create a mechanical depolarization of the axons running through the nerve fiber layer of the retina. This is usually interpreted by the patient as a flash of light or photopsia that lasts less than one second and is sometimes associated with eye movement. These photopsias may be more easily seen in the dark or at night and are usually pinpointed to the affected eye. This appearance contrasts with the fortification spectra often described in patients with ocular migraines; this zigzagging light typically lasts 10 to 20 minutes, is seen in the peripheral visual field of both eyes, and is sometimes associated with blurry central vision. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=approach-to-the-patient-with-visual-hallucinations#H5\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Approach to the patient with visual hallucinations&quot;, section on 'Retinal pathology'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=approach-to-the-patient-with-visual-hallucinations#H7\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Approach to the patient with visual hallucinations&quot;, section on 'Migraine aura'</a>.)</p><p>Small retinal vessels may avulse or a small horseshoe retinal tear can be created if sufficient vitreoretinal traction is applied to the retina. In this circumstance, patients complain of a shower of black spots consistent with vitreous hemorrhage. Sometimes this shower of spots progresses, leaving the patient with a large vitreous hemorrhage and significantly impaired vision. For patients who present with floaters or flashes, decrease in vision is the most important symptom suggesting a retinal tear [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/retinal-detachment/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. Patients who are found to have a dense vitreous hemorrhage on slitlamp biomicroscopy associated with an acute PVD have a 10-fold increased risk of also having a retinal tear and developing a retinal detachment.</p><p>Approximately 30 to 50 percent of patients who develop a full-thickness horseshoe retinal tear in the setting of a symptomatic vitreous detachment will go on to develop a rhegmatogenous retinal detachment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/retinal-detachment/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. Liquefied vitreous fluid has a tendency to percolate through retinal breaks under residual traction causing a neurosensory retinal detachment. Patients who reach this stage often complain of a slowly progressive peripheral visual field defect in the affected eye. Interestingly, they frequently describe a photo stress response in the area of the detached retina. In other words, when they are exposed to a bright light, the retinal photopigments in the area of the detached retina are bleached; the inability of the detached retina to quickly regenerate the retinal photopigments results in darkening of the visual field defect.</p><p>The rate of progression of retinal detachment varies depending upon the size of the retinal break, location of the break, and movements of the eye. Large horseshoe retinal tears or giant retinal tears that have persistent vitreoretinal traction will usually allow a retinal detachment to progress over the period of hours to days. By contrast, small horseshoe retinal tears or operculated holes often result in more slowly progressive retinal detachment that can take one to four weeks to develop [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/retinal-detachment/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].</p><p>As the retinal detachment progresses from the full-thickness retinal breaks posteriorly towards the macula, the size of the visual field defect will enlarge in a corresponding fashion. Patients will lose the ability to read once the retinal detachment involves the macula or the central area of the retina responsible for reading vision. Vision in patients with macula-off rhegmatogenous retinal detachment usually ranges between <span class=\"nowrap\">20/40</span> and count fingers.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h2\">Differential diagnosis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Idiopathic vitreous floaters are the most common cause of floaters. In addition to PVD and full-thickness retinal tear, other causes of floaters include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Vitreous hemorrhage</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Vitreous inflammation (eg, toxoplasmic chorioretinitis)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Ocular lymphoma</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Intraocular foreign body</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14\"><span class=\"h1\">DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients presenting to primary care with sudden onset of floaters, or photopsias should be initially evaluated by a test of visual acuity and confrontational evaluation of visual fields. Patients with visual loss or who are found to have monocular decreased visual field should be seen urgently by an ophthalmologist or retinal surgeon [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/retinal-detachment/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. When possible, all patients should also be evaluated with slitlamp biomicroscopy and a dilated retinal examination. Patients without high-risk features (visual field loss, subjective or objective decreased vision, vitreous hemorrhage, or vitreous pigment on slit-lamp examination) may be referred to an ophthalmologist more electively.</p><p>Patients who are referred to an ophthalmologist or retina specialist undergo a careful history and ophthalmic examination. Anterior segment examination is performed looking for pigmented vitreous cells behind the lens of the eye. These cells are known as &quot;tobacco dust&quot; and represent liberated retinal pigment epithelial cells that have floated into the vitreous from under the retina. Patients who have pigmented cells behind the lens have a very high probability of having a full-thickness retinal break. Funduscopic examination of these patients will usually reveal vitreous debris and often a white fibrous ring, called a Weiss ring, which corresponds to the area of contact between the posterior vitreous face and the round optic nerve.</p><p>A careful 360 degree peripheral retinal examination using an indirect ophthalmoscope also should be performed. Peripheral retina examination allows identification of vitreoretinal abnormalities, vitreoretinal areas of abnormal traction, round atrophic holes, operculated retinal breaks, or full-thickness horseshoe retinal tears. Scleral depression during ophthalmoscopy is a very helpful technique for improving the view of the peripheral retina.</p><p>Patients should also undergo examination of the fellow eye as there is a relatively high rate of bilateral retinal tears or detachments and an asymptomatic tear or detachment could otherwise be missed.</p><p>In patients with dense vitreous hemorrhage, a good ophthalmoscopic view of the retina may not be possible. No view of the posterior pole or peripheral retina will be obtained in cases where the vitreous cavity is filled with blood. In such cases, use of an ophthalmic B-scan ultrasound is needed to help identify large retinal breaks <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> retinal detachment (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F91050\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef91050 \">image 1</a>). Ultrasound usually reveals the dense vitreous hemorrhage floating in the vitreous cavity as well as the presence of any retinal elevation. Since the resolution of ultrasonography is not as good as visual examination, patients with dense vitreous hemorrhages are often followed carefully with sequential B-scan ultrasounds or earlier surgical intervention with small-gauge vitrectomy and careful examination of the retinal periphery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/retinal-detachment/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H21\" class=\"local\">'Vitrectomy'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15\"><span class=\"h1\">TREATMENT</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H16\"><span class=\"h2\">Posterior vitreous detachment management</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Most patients who present with posterior vitreous detachment (PVD) and do not have any retinal breaks or retinal tears on a 360 degree peripheral retina examination require only reassurance and education. In a meta-analysis of retrospective studies that included 1600 patients with symptomatic PVD, delayed retinal tears (not seen on initial examination) were found in 1.8 percent; 83 percent of the patients with late tears had vitreous or retinal hemorrhage at initial examination or developed new symptoms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/retinal-detachment/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. While studies have tried to identify subsets of patients who may not require additional evaluation after the initial examination [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/retinal-detachment/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>], we suggest that most patients should be seen in follow-up at about three months. Patients who describe photopsias or have evidence of retinal bleeding, but no full-thickness or retinal detachment, may require an earlier follow-up in approximately one to two months.</p><p>The floaters often resolve over a period of 3 to 12 months; they settle down outside the visual axis <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> become less noticeable or bothersome. In some cases, however, floaters may be a permanent symptom and, if disabling, may require vitrectomy to treat.</p><p>In general, patients with a PVD do not require any specific activity limitations. Patients who develop worsening symptoms of flashes, significantly more floaters, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> loss of peripheral or central vision should be reevaluated with a careful peripheral retinal examination.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H17\"><span class=\"h2\">Retinal hole or tear</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients who have a full-thickness symptomatic operculated retinal hole or horseshoe retinal tear, but no retinal detachment, clearly benefit from laser retinopexy or cryoretinopexy. These patients are advised that their risk of developing a retinal detachment is around 30 percent and that treatment reduces this risk to less than 1 percent. Since the risks of laser treatments or cryoretinopexy are minimal, the <span class=\"nowrap\">risk/benefit</span> ratio strongly favors treating symptomatic retinal breaks prophylactically.</p><p>Patients who undergo laser photocoagulation may be seated in front of a slit lamp after numbing the affected eye with topical drops. A contact lens is then placed on the surface of the eye in order to visualize the retinal break using the slit-lamp biomicroscope. Once identified, the retinal break is surrounded by two to three rows of confluent 200 to 300 micron size laser burns. The laser intensity necessary for these treatments can vary between 100 and 500 milliwatts depending upon the amount of cataract present and fundus pigmentation.</p><p>Patients may also be treated with a laser indirect ophthalmoscope that allows the clinician to examine, depress, and laser the retina at the same time. This delivery system allows for more peripheral treatment of the retina.</p><p>Patients who are treated with cryoretinopexy usually have a subconjunctival injection of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lidocaine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">lidocaine</a> over the area of the full-thickness retinal break. Using the indirect ophthalmoscope, the cryoretinopexy probe is placed on the surface of the conjunctiva underneath the retinal break. A freezing ball is created at the tip of this probe that freezes through the sclera, choroid, and retina. A number of cryoretinopexy spots are created in order to contiguously surround the retinal break (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F71437\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef71437 \">figure 1</a>).</p><p>Once either treatment is completed, it takes approximately one to two weeks for the body to form its maximal amount of chorioretinal adhesion. Patients are usually advised to minimize eye movement (such as with reading) during this period. Sitting on a couch and watching TV is actually quite effective in minimizing head and eye movement.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H18\"><span class=\"h2\">Rhegmatogenous retinal detachment</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Without treatment, most symptomatic retinal detachments progress to involve the entire retina and lead to loss of all vision. Thus, treatment is indicated for nearly all patients with symptomatic detachments.</p><p>Patients who present with a full-thickness retinal break and a small retinal detachment can be treated with delimiting laser photocoagulation or cryoretinopexy barrier. The chorioretinal scar created with these procedures may hold the retinal detachment in place and prevent it from spreading and threatening the macula. These treatments are most appropriate for small peripheral retinal detachments and for asymptomatic retinal detachments. The process is similar to that discussed for the treatment of a retinal tear. (See <a href=\"#H17\" class=\"local\">'Retinal hole or tear'</a> above.)</p><p>Patients who present with a frank rhegmatogenous retinal detachment will require other techniques in order to reattach the retina. These techniques include a pneumatic retinopexy, a temporary peribulbar balloon, scleral buckle placement, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> pars plana vitrectomy.</p><p>Asymptomatic retinal detachments appear to have a better prognosis. A case series of 16 patients with 18 eyes with asymptomatic rhegmatogenous retinal detachments found that none became symptomatic over a mean follow-up of 46 months [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/retinal-detachment/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. The patients in this cohort were relatively young (mean age 56), none had a superior detachment, all had at least a partial demarcation line on presentation, and only 3 of the 18 detachments had retinal tears (many had atrophic holes). As such, it is uncertain whether these results are generalizable to all patients with asymptomatic retinal detachments.</p><p>While awaiting further data, we suggest that patients with small asymptomatic inferior rhegmatogenous detachments due to atrophic holes be followed with close monitoring or offered laser photocoagulation. For now, we would continue to treat other patients with asymptomatic detachments.</p><p>Patients with significant rhegmatogenous retinal detachment will require one of three procedures for reattachment: pneumatic retinopexy, scleral buckling, or vitrectomy. Few randomized trials are available to determine the optimal selection of one procedure over another, and the decision is often subjective [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/retinal-detachment/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. Pneumatic retinopexy is an office procedure with lower costs and fewer complications and is appropriate as a first-line procedure for non-complex cases. When not successful, the more invasive procedures can be performed.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H19\"><span class=\"h3\">Pneumatic retinopexy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Pneumatic retinopexy is a procedure performed in the office and includes cryoretinopexy of the retinal break followed by injection of an intravitreal gas bubble (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F64514\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef64514 \">picture 5</a>). With strict head positioning, retinal breaks that are in the superior part of the retina can be tamponaded by the intravitreal gas bubble, closed, and sealed by the chorioretinal adhesion induced by cryoretinopexy. Once the retinal break is closed, the retinal epithelial cells quickly reabsorb the subretinal fluid, thereby reattaching the retina. This process of reabsorption usually takes about 24 to 48 hours [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/retinal-detachment/abstract/30,31\" class=\"abstract_t\">30,31</a>].</p><p>It may also be possible to use pneumatic retinopexy in patients with retinal breaks that are in the inferior portion of the retina, using an inverted technique that requires patients to maintain a head-down position for six to eight hours [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/retinal-detachment/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>].</p><p>Pneumatic retinopexy leads to successful retinal attachment about 70 to 80 percent of the time after one procedure. In cases of failure, most patients are treated with scleral buckle placement <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> vitrectomy.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H20\"><span class=\"h3\">Scleral buckle</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Scleral buckle is performed in the operating room. After a retrobulbar injection or infusion of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lidocaine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">lidocaine</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=bupivacaine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">bupivacaine</a>, cryoretinopexy to the retinal breaks is performed, followed first by suturing of an exoplant to the outside of the sclera that indents the wall of the eye and closes the retinal breaks, and then by drainage of subretinal fluid, if needed (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F57343\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef57343 \">figure 2</a>). The scleral indentation created by the sutured exoplant not only helps close the retinal break and allow the chorioretinal retinal adhesion to form, but also helps reduce the vitreoretinal traction present.</p><p>A modification of the technique involves placing a small balloon catheter underneath a retinal break to temporarily close it and allow sealing of the hole over a period of 12 to 24 hours. Once the retinal hole is sealed and closed and the subretinal fluid is reabsorbed, the balloon catheter can be safely removed.</p><p>A randomized, controlled trial of 198 patients with primary, uncomplicated retinal detachment found no significant differences in outcome in patients assigned to pneumatic retinopexy compared with scleral buckling [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/retinal-detachment/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>].</p><p>Scleral buckle placement leads to successful retinal reattachment approximately 80 to 90 percent of the time after one surgery. In cases of failure, most patients are treated with vitrectomy.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H21\"><span class=\"h3\">Vitrectomy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients with more complicated retinal detachments may require a vitrectomy (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F65234\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef65234 \">figure 3</a>). With this procedure, three sclerotomies are made on the outside of the eye: one that allows fluid to infuse into the eye, and two others that are used to introduce instruments into the back part of the eye. Using a light pipe and a vitreous cutter, all of the central and peripheral vitreous is removed and all of the vitreoretinal traction on any of the breaks excised. The patient's retina can be flattened intraoperatively using an air bubble or heavier than water perfluorocarbon liquid. These patients are usually left with intravitreal air, a long-acting gas bubble (SF6 or C3F8), or silicone oil [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/retinal-detachment/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>].</p><p>Vitrectomy leads to successful retinal reattachment approximately 80 to 90 percent of the time after one surgery. In cases of failures, patients often require more extensive vitreoretinal procedures such as combined cataract extraction and intraocular lens placement, lensectomy, extensive epiretinal membrane peeling, subretinal fibrous band removal, relaxing retinotomies, and silicone oil tamponade. Virtually all patients over age 50 treated with vitrectomy will develop a visually significant cataract within 6 to 18 months.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H22\"><span class=\"h2\">Other causes of retinal detachments</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients who present with traction retinal detachments (severe diabetic retinopathy, penetrating ocular injury, or vitreomacular syndrome) may also benefit from surgical retinal reattachment; all of these cases require surgical intervention with a pars plana vitrectomy. During this surgery, extensive peeling is often required, utilizing end-grabbing forceps and intravitreal scissors. Once the vitreoretinal traction is relieved the retina can be reattached as previously described and left with an intravitreal tamponade.</p><p>Patients who present with an exudative retinal detachment must have the etiology of this detachment identified and treated. Surgical repair of this type of retinal detachment is not recommended in most cases.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H23\"><span class=\"h1\">PREVENTION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There is no evidence that posterior vitreous detachment (PVD) can be prevented. On the other hand, since vitreoretinal abnormalities such as lattice degeneration with atrophic holes, vitreoretinal tags, or small round retinal holes can lead to retinal detachment, it has been suggested that such patients may benefit from prophylactic laser or cryoretinopexy. However, a major limitation of prophylactic therapy is that most retinal detachments are due to retinal tears that develop in areas of the retina that appear normal prior to vitreous detachment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/retinal-detachment/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. Thus treatment of visible lesions associated with retinal detachment may prevent a tear at those sites but not a tear in normal-appearing retina. A systematic review of studies involving patients with asymptomatic vitreoretinal abnormalities found no trials that met inclusion criteria, and thus no conclusions could be made about prophylactic therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/retinal-detachment/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>].</p><p>In the absence of definitive data, the most important aspect of prevention is education of the patient about the symptoms of retinal tear or retinal detachment. Early identification of retinal tears and rapid treatment of this problem usually results in the prevention of a retinal detachment and significant loss of vision. Also, there are some very high-risk patients, such as patients who have developed a giant retinal tear in the fellow eye, in whom prophylactic treatment may be reasonable.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H24\"><span class=\"h2\">Photoreceptor neuroprotection</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The visual prognosis after retinal detachment repair is often limited. Various animal models of retinal detachment have been developed to better understand the cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying this vision loss.</p><p>Animal models have demonstrated that photoreceptor apoptosis typically occurs in a stereotypic manner in response to retinal detachment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/retinal-detachment/abstract/1,35-38\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,35-38</a>]. Separation of the neurosensory retina from the underlying choroidal circulation results in ischemia and retinal degeneration as soon as 12 hours after detachment. Studies of human patients with retinal detachment have also shown a similar pattern of photoreceptor cell loss [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/retinal-detachment/abstract/39-41\" class=\"abstract_t\">39-41</a>].</p><p>A number of potential neuroprotective agents are being tested clinically, which may prevent some of this retinal degeneration and improve final visional outcome in patients with macula off retinal detachments [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/retinal-detachment/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"PATIENT_INFORMATION\"><span class=\"h1\">INFORMATION FOR PATIENTS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>UpToDate offers two types of patient education materials, &quot;The Basics&quot; and &quot;Beyond the Basics.&quot; The Basics patient education pieces are written in plain language, at the 5<sup>th</sup> to 6<sup>th</sup> grade reading level, and they answer the four or five key questions a patient might have about a given condition.

(See <a href=\"#H1\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Retinal detachments are classified as &quot;rhegmatogenous&quot; if they are the result of a full-thickness retinal hole or retinal tear and as &quot;nonrhegmatogenous&quot; otherwise. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Pathophysiology'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Rhegmatogenous detachments are most common, and they are often a consequence of posterior vitreous detachment (PVD), a normal event in people between the ages of 50 and 75. In some patients, areas of adhesion during PVD can pull on the retina and cause a tear. Rhegmatogenous detachments can also occur after ocular trauma, though this is a rare occurrence. (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Rhegmatogenous retinal detachment'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Nonrhegmatogenous detachments can occur in patients with proliferative diabetic retinopathy, retinal neovascularization, or inflammatory conditions and in other settings. (See <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'Nonrhegmatogenous retinal detachment'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Risk factors for rhegmatogenous detachments include myopia, focal thinning of the periphery of the retinal called lattice degeneration, and a family history of retina tears or detachments. Asymptomatic retinal breaks do not typically progress to retinal detachment. (See <a href=\"#H11\" class=\"local\">'Epidemiology/risk factors'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients with a symptomatic PVD who develop a full-thickness retinal tear are at high risk for retinal detachment. The most common symptom of PVD is an increasing number of floaters in one eye. Flashes of light (photopsias) are also common during PVD, and if a small retinal vessel is torn the patient may note a shower of black spots (red blood cells) <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> a marked decrease in vision. (See <a href=\"#H12\" class=\"local\">'Clinical presentation'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients with retinal detachment (due to PVD or other etiologies) will typically note a peripheral visual field defect. (See <a href=\"#H12\" class=\"local\">'Clinical presentation'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients with symptoms of a PVD should be quickly examined by an ophthalmologist to exclude a retinal tear or detachment. Patients with a new and progressive visual field defect suggestive of a retinal detachment require urgent evaluation. (See <a href=\"#H14\" class=\"local\">'Diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In the absence of retinal breaks or tears or vitreous pigmented cells, most patients with PVD require no specific treatment but should be re-examined by an ophthalmologist in one to three months. (See <a href=\"#H16\" class=\"local\">'Posterior vitreous detachment management'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients with a retinal hole or tear in the presence of a symptomatic PVD should generally be treated by an ophthalmologist with laser photocoagulation or cryoretinopexy to prevent retinal detachment. (See <a href=\"#H17\" class=\"local\">'Retinal hole or tear'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients with a retinal detachment will generally be treated with one or more of the following procedures: laser or cryoretinopexy, pneumatic retinopexy, scleral buckle, or vitrectomy. Patients with small peripheral retinal detachments may be treated with barrier procedures, such as cryoretinopexy or laser photocoagulation. Some patients with asymptomatic rhegmatogenous retinal detachments may be closely monitored without therapy or treated with barrier procedures.
