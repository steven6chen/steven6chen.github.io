It accounts for a significant fraction of transplant-related mortality and, in its severe form, is almost always fatal.</p><p>SOS is characterized by hepatomegaly, right upper quadrant pain, jaundice, and ascites, most often occurring in patients undergoing HCT and less commonly following the use of chemotherapeutic agents in non-transplant settings, ingestion of alkaloid toxins, after high dose radiation therapy, or liver transplantation. The disease resembles the Budd-Chiari syndrome clinically; however, hepatic venous outflow obstruction in SOS is due to occlusion of the terminal hepatic venules and hepatic sinusoids rather than the hepatic veins and inferior vena cava.</p><p>The prevention and management of hepatic SOS following HCT will be reviewed here. The pathogenesis, clinical features, and diagnosis of SOS following HCT are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diagnosis-of-hepatic-sinusoidal-obstruction-syndrome-veno-occlusive-disease-following-hematopoietic-cell-transplantation\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Diagnosis of hepatic sinusoidal obstruction syndrome (veno-occlusive disease) following hematopoietic cell transplantation&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H613743047\"><span class=\"h1\">PREVENTION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Certain pretransplant characteristics and factors related to the transplant process are associated with the development of SOS. The strength of these associations varies among studies, and no factor alone or in combination explains the variability in the risk of developing SOS among patients (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F91604\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef91604 \">table 1</a>). </p><p>Pretransplant characteristics that are associated with an increased risk of SOS include pre-existing liver disease (elevated serum aspartate aminotransferase, AST), younger patient age (higher rate in children &lt;7 years), and poor baseline performance status. Proposed risk factors related to the transplant process include the source of graft (allogeneic greater than autologous), choice of conditioning therapy (higher with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cyclophosphamide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cyclophosphamide</a> and high doses of radiation, lower with reduced intensity regimens), choice of graft-versus-host disease prophylaxis (use of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sirolimus-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">sirolimus</a> in combination with certain preparative regimens), and the use of specific antimicrobials (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=vancomycin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">vancomycin</a>, amphotericin, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acyclovir-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">acyclovir</a>) prior to transplantation.

Clinicians should aim to minimize modifiable risk factors for the development of SOS for all patients undergoing autologous or allogeneic HCT. The following are examples of risk factors that may be modified prior to transplantation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prevention-of-hepatic-sinusoidal-obstruction-syndrome-following-hematopoietic-cell-transplantation/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Minimizing exposure to hepatotoxic agents &ndash; Patients should avoid medications, supplements, and other substances that are commonly associated with liver injury.

These trials were limited by small sample size and variable definitions of SOS. The seminal study began as a pilot study and developed into a controlled study that demonstrated that UDCA used prophylactically can reduce the incidence of SOS [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prevention-of-hepatic-sinusoidal-obstruction-syndrome-following-hematopoietic-cell-transplantation/abstract/4,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,7</a>]: </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In the pilot study, 22 consecutive patients undergoing HCT for hematologic malignancies received a <a href=\"topic.htm?path=busulfan-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">busulfan</a><span class=\"nowrap\">/<a href=\"topic.htm?path=cyclophosphamide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cyclophosphamide</a></span> preparative regimen and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cyclosporine-ciclosporin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cyclosporine</a><span class=\"nowrap\">/<a href=\"topic.htm?path=methotrexate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">methotrexate</a></span> for graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) prophylaxis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prevention-of-hepatic-sinusoidal-obstruction-syndrome-following-hematopoietic-cell-transplantation/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. UDCA (600 to 900 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day)</span> was begun at least one day prior to beginning the preparative regimen. Results for this pilot group were compared with a control group of 28 consecutive patients transplanted with the same regimen without UDCA.

The incidence of SOS was significantly lower in patients assigned to receive UDCA (15 versus 40 percent). The risk of relapse in patients with chronic myeloid leukemia and nonhepatic toxicities did not differ between the groups. There was a trend, which did not reach statistical significance, towards improved overall survival in the patients who were treated with UDCA.</p><p/><p>These results were further supported by a 2015 meta-analysis, which included data from 612 patients enrolled on four randomized clinical trials [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prevention-of-hepatic-sinusoidal-obstruction-syndrome-following-hematopoietic-cell-transplantation/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. Prophylaxis with UDCA resulted in a decreased incidence of SOS (relative risk [RR] 0.60; 95% CI 0.40-0.88) and mortality related to SOS (RR 0.27; 95% CI 0.09-0.87). Prophylaxis did not appear to increase adverse events (RR 0.90; 95% CI 0.37-2.22) or impact overall survival (hazard ratio 0.83; 95% CI 0.59-1.18). </p><p>UDCA is a well-tolerated oral medication with limited side effects [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prevention-of-hepatic-sinusoidal-obstruction-syndrome-following-hematopoietic-cell-transplantation/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Diarrhea is seen in less than 5 percent of cases. Mucositis and nausea in the early post-transplant period may result in temporary administration difficulties. In a randomized trial, more than half of the patients were able to take all of the tablets each week [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prevention-of-hepatic-sinusoidal-obstruction-syndrome-following-hematopoietic-cell-transplantation/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].

Heparin (100 <span class=\"nowrap\">units/kg</span> per day by continuous intravenous infusion) is started on the first day of the preparative regimen and continued until hematopoietic engraftment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prevention-of-hepatic-sinusoidal-obstruction-syndrome-following-hematopoietic-cell-transplantation/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Studies of the efficacy of heparin in this setting have had mixed results [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prevention-of-hepatic-sinusoidal-obstruction-syndrome-following-hematopoietic-cell-transplantation/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].</p><p>Three randomized trials have evaluated the efficacy of anticoagulation as prophylaxis for SOS:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In one trial, 161 patients who underwent allogeneic or autologous HCT were randomly assigned to either low dose heparin (100 <span class=\"nowrap\">units/kg</span> per day by continuous intravenous infusion) or placebo [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prevention-of-hepatic-sinusoidal-obstruction-syndrome-following-hematopoietic-cell-transplantation/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. The infusion of heparin was initiated prior to the start of the preparative regimen and continued until 30 days after the transplant. A lower incidence of SOS was noted in the heparin group (2.5 versus 13.7 percent); this benefit was most pronounced in those undergoing allogeneic HCT (0 versus 18 percent). There was no increase in bleeding risk or other toxicities in the patients treated with heparin.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In contrast, another randomized trial did not confirm the benefit of heparin therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prevention-of-hepatic-sinusoidal-obstruction-syndrome-following-hematopoietic-cell-transplantation/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. In this trial, however, heparin was initiated on the day of stem cell infusion, not at the beginning of the preparative regimen as in the randomized trial discussed above.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a small pilot study, 61 patients undergoing HCT were randomized to receive low molecular weight (LMW) heparin (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=enoxaparin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">enoxaparin</a> 40 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day)</span> or placebo from prior to conditioning until day +40 post-transplant [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prevention-of-hepatic-sinusoidal-obstruction-syndrome-following-hematopoietic-cell-transplantation/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. LMW heparin was associated with less SOS parameters (a shorter duration of jaundice and a lower frequency of hepatomegaly) and less bleeding than patients receiving placebo that did not reach statistical significance.</p><p/><p>The heterogeneity of these results was reflected in a 2006 meta-analysis that included data from 2782 patients enrolled on 12 studies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prevention-of-hepatic-sinusoidal-obstruction-syndrome-following-hematopoietic-cell-transplantation/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. Pooled estimates suggested an uncertain effect ranging from a 38 percent decrease in SOS to a 29 percent increase (RR 0.90; 95% CI 0.62-1.29). However, this pooled analysis was limited by the heterogeneity and methodological weaknesses among the trials included. </p><p>The development of SOS is thought to be related to hepatic toxicity from the preparative regimen. As such, it is not surprising that a prophylactic regimen that begins prior to the administration of the preparative regimen is associated with benefit while one that starts later is not. When using heparin as prophylaxis, we begin prior to the preparative regimen using the dose and schedule that was effective and safe in the randomized trial described above.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H613744212\"><span class=\"h3\">Defibrotide</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span><a href=\"topic.htm?path=defibrotide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Defibrotide</a> is used for the treatment of severe SOS.

While awaiting further study of this agent, we reserve defibrotide for the treatment of SOS. (See <a href=\"#H613744504\" class=\"local\">'Defibrotide'</a> below.)</p><p>Retrospective studies in both adults and children, and a randomized trial in children, have reported significant reductions in the incidence of SOS following the prophylactic use of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=defibrotide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">defibrotide</a> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prevention-of-hepatic-sinusoidal-obstruction-syndrome-following-hematopoietic-cell-transplantation/abstract/6,11-13\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,11-13</a>]. As with other agents, this has not yet translated into a survival benefit.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In one report, the incidence of SOS in 52 patients who received prophylactic <a href=\"topic.htm?path=defibrotide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">defibrotide</a> between days &ndash;7 and +20 was compared with historical controls [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prevention-of-hepatic-sinusoidal-obstruction-syndrome-following-hematopoietic-cell-transplantation/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. None of the 52 patients receiving defibrotide prophylaxis developed SOS, significantly better than the historical controls where 19 percent developed SOS along with three deaths. There was also a trend towards improved survival in this report.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Similar results were obtained in a study of 58 patients receiving <a href=\"topic.htm?path=defibrotide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">defibrotide</a> prophylaxis without concurrent heparin [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prevention-of-hepatic-sinusoidal-obstruction-syndrome-following-hematopoietic-cell-transplantation/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>].

Defibrotide (6.25 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg)</span> was administered intravenously over two hours, four times daily from the start of conditioning for a minimum of 14 days with the final dose administered on the day of discharge or on day 30, whichever came first. Heparin use was permitted for patients with central venous access and approximately one-third of patients received <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ursodeoxycholic-acid-ursodiol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ursodeoxycholic acid</a>. All patients who developed SOS were treated with defibrotide. Patients assigned to defibrotide prophylaxis had a significantly lower cumulative incidence of SOS at 30 days post-HCT (12 versus 20 percent) and a lower incidence of renal failure (1 versus 6 percent). Interestingly, there was also a trend towards lower GVHD in the defibrotide-treated group. Mortality rates at 100 and 180 days post-HCT were similar. Defibrotide was well tolerated with no increase in hemorrhage.</p><p/><p>Together, these results suggest that <a href=\"topic.htm?path=defibrotide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">defibrotide</a> prophylaxis decreases the incidence of SOS in children at high risk for SOS undergoing myeloablative allogeneic HCT. Questions regarding its use in other settings, the optimal dose and duration of prophylaxis, and the efficacy of oral versus intravenous defibrotide remain.
