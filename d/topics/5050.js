The risk of dying or of developing complications is related to the age and general health of the patient, the causative pathogen, the severity and duration of illness at the time of presentation, and, occasionally, delays in the initiation of antibiotic therapy.

There was no difference between the treatment groups with regard to persistent cognitive dysfunction, hearing loss, or focal neurologic deficits. It is possible that the trial was underpowered to detect benefits of this magnitude. In addition, these neurologic sequelae primarily occurred in the most severely ill patients; the proportion of patients who survived to be tested was significantly greater in the dexamethasone group.</p><p>An additional finding was that patients with pneumococcal meningitis had a significantly higher rate of persistent cognitive dysfunction compared with other patients (21 versus 6 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dexamethasone-to-prevent-neurologic-complications-of-bacterial-meningitis-in-adults/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. This observation is consistent with the worse outcomes at eight weeks cited above in the patients with pneumococcal meningitis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dexamethasone-to-prevent-neurologic-complications-of-bacterial-meningitis-in-adults/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].</p><p>A separate follow-up study with median follow-up of 13 years evaluated long-term survival in 228 of 246 evaluable patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dexamethasone-to-prevent-neurologic-complications-of-bacterial-meningitis-in-adults/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. Overall, 31 of 144 patients (22 percent) in the <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dexamethasone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">dexamethasone</a> group died, compared with 44 of 134 patients (33 percent) in the placebo group. After the primary outcome measurement at eight weeks, an additional 20 patients in the dexamethasone group and 23 patients in the placebo group died, and age was the sole predictor of death. These results suggest that the survival benefit of dexamethasone is obtained during the acute phase of the disease and that there are no differences at later time points.</p><p>A nationwide prospective cohort study was undertaken in the Netherlands to evaluate the implementation of adjunctive <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dexamethasone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">dexamethasone</a> use in adults with pneumococcal meningitis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dexamethasone-to-prevent-neurologic-complications-of-bacterial-meningitis-in-adults/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. Dexamethasone was initiated with or before the first dose of antibiotics in 84 percent of 357 patients with pneumococcal meningitis in 2006 to 2009 but in only 3 percent of 352 patients in 1998 to 2002. At hospital discharge, an unfavorable outcome (defined as Glasgow outcome scale score of 1 to 4 points) was present in 39 percent of patients in the 2006 to 2009 cohort compared with 50 percent of patients in the 1998 to 2002 cohort (odds ratio [OR] 0.63, 95% CI 0.46-0.86). Rates of death (20 versus 30 percent) and hearing loss (12 versus 22 percent) were significantly lower in the 2006 to 2009 cohort.</p><p>In a subsequent prospective cohort study of adult patients with community-acquired bacterial meningitis in the Netherlands from 2006 to 2014, adjunctive <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dexamethasone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">dexamethasone</a> treatment was given in 1234 of 1384 episodes (89 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dexamethasone-to-prevent-neurologic-complications-of-bacterial-meningitis-in-adults/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. In a multivariate analysis, use of dexamethasone given to patients according to guideline recommendations was associated with a significantly lower rate of adverse outcomes (OR 0.54, 95% CI 0.39-0.79) and lower mortality (OR 0.46, 95% CI 0.32-0.66).</p><p>A study compared data regarding the use of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dexamethasone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">dexamethasone</a> in adults with meningococcal meningitis from two prospective cohort studies of community-acquired bacterial meningitis in the Netherlands; the first study enrolled 258 patients between 1998 and 2002, before routine dexamethasone therapy was introduced, and the second study enrolled 100 patients between 2006 and 2011, after guidelines recommended dexamethasone [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dexamethasone-to-prevent-neurologic-complications-of-bacterial-meningitis-in-adults/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. Dexamethasone was administered to 17 percent of patients in the 1998 to 2002 cohort and 90 percent of patients in the 2006 to 2011 cohort and was continued in the majority of patients after <em>N. meningitidis</em> was identified by culture. In the later (dexamethasone) cohort compared with the earlier cohort, there was a nonsignificant trend toward a reduction in hearing loss (3 versus 8 percent) and death (4 versus 11 percent). Similar Glasgow outcome scores were observed in the two cohorts. The rate of arthritis was significantly lower in the later cohort compared with the earlier cohort (32 of 258 patients [12 percent] versus 5 of 96 [5 percent]). These results suggest that the use of dexamethasone in patients with meningococcal meningitis is not associated with harm and that there may be small yet unproven benefits.</p><p>A population-based observational study using data from the Healthcare Cost Utilization Project database found that both the incidence and mortality rates of pneumococcal meningitis declined among American patients between 1997 and 2010 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dexamethasone-to-prevent-neurologic-complications-of-bacterial-meningitis-in-adults/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. Overall incidence rates of pneumococcal meningitis declined from 0.8 to 0.3 per 100,000 people over this time period, a decrease of 83 percent. Rates of death from pneumococcal meningitis also declined from 0.073 people per 100,000 from 2002 to 2004 to 0.049 per 100,000 people from 2005 to 2008. The authors attributed the decline in mortality to the introduction of guidelines promoting the use of adjunctive <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dexamethasone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">dexamethasone</a> therapy, although their analysis did not include data on the actual use of such therapy.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">In developing regions</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In contrast with the results of the above trial, which involved patients with bacterial meningitis in the developed world, a study from sub-Saharan Africa found no benefit from treatment with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dexamethasone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">dexamethasone</a> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dexamethasone-to-prevent-neurologic-complications-of-bacterial-meningitis-in-adults/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. In this randomized trial of adults in Malawi, 465 patients (95 percent of whom were HIV infected) received dexamethasone or placebo for four days plus intravenous or intramuscular <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ceftriaxone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ceftriaxone</a>.</p><p>In an intention-to-treat analysis, there was no significant mortality difference at 40 days in the <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dexamethasone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">dexamethasone</a> group as compared with the placebo group (56 versus 53 percent, OR 1.14, 95% CI 0.79-1.64). There was also no difference in mortality when the analysis was restricted to patients with pneumococcal meningitis (53 versus 50 percent, OR 1.10; 95% CI 0.68-1.77), and there were no significant differences between the two groups in the outcomes of disability and death combined, hearing loss, and adverse events.</p><p>There are several issues that must be considered in the interpretation of these results. In Malawi, the outcomes of bacterial meningitis are poor and the life expectancy is low. Contributing factors to worse outcomes in these patients include poor nutrition, delays in presentation that may have contributed to neurologic compromise prior to treatment, and chronic diseases such as HIV.</p><p>A similar prospective, randomized, double-blind trial of 435 Vietnamese patients (of whom less than 1 percent were HIV infected) found no overall reduction in mortality or disability with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dexamethasone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">dexamethasone</a> therapy compared with placebo started before the first dose of antibiotics (intravenous <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ceftriaxone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ceftriaxone</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dexamethasone-to-prevent-neurologic-complications-of-bacterial-meningitis-in-adults/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. However, when the analysis was limited to the 300 patients (69 percent) with confirmed bacterial meningitis (ie, those with organisms cultured from CSF or blood or detected in CSF), there was a significant reduction in the risk of death at one month (RR 0.43; 95% CI 0.20-0.94) and in the risk of death or disability at six months (OR 0.56; 95% CI 0.32-0.98). The major causes of confirmed bacterial meningitis were <em>Streptococcus suis</em> (39 percent), <em>S. pneumoniae</em> (18 percent), <em>N. meningitis</em> (6 percent), and other gram-negative organisms (10 percent). The outcomes were significantly worse in patients with confirmed meningitis caused by a bacterium other than <em>S. suis</em>, who had a mortality rate of 2.6 percent. The median duration of symptoms prior to therapy was three to four days in this study cohort.</p><p>Patients who received <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dexamethasone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">dexamethasone</a> for probable bacterial meningitis (defined as the presence of a typical clinical picture and lack of an alternative diagnosis in the absence of identification of bacteria in CSF or blood) had an increased risk of death at one month. The authors proposed that this finding could be explained by the inadvertent inclusion of cases of tuberculous meningitis in the treatment group. Eleven individuals in the study (eight in the dexamethasone group and three in the placebo group) were subsequently treated for tuberculous meningitis on clinical grounds. Six of these patients died, all of whom had received dexamethasone. Similar adverse effects of dexamethasone were seen in a retrospective study of 425 Ethiopian patients treated with presumed bacterial meningitis from 2011 to 2015 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dexamethasone-to-prevent-neurologic-complications-of-bacterial-meningitis-in-adults/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1326228962\"><span class=\"h2\">Meta-analyses</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Several meta-analyses have been performed using data collected in various randomized controlled trials of glucocorticoid treatment of bacterial meningitis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dexamethasone-to-prevent-neurologic-complications-of-bacterial-meningitis-in-adults/abstract/19-21\" class=\"abstract_t\">19-21</a>].

In comparison, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=rifampin-rifampicin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">rifampin</a> penetration into the CSF was not affected by dexamethasone, and the combination of rifampin and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ceftriaxone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ceftriaxone</a> produced prompt bacteriologic cure.</p><p>The applicability of these experimental findings in rabbits to bacterial meningitis in humans is uncertain. Therapeutic CSF concentrations of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=vancomycin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">vancomycin</a> in the CSF were evaluated in a study of 14 adults with bacterial meningitis, 13 of whom had pneumococcal meningitis who were treated with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dexamethasone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">dexamethasone</a> and vancomycin (15 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> loading dose followed by a continuous infusion of 60 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> per day in adults) plus <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ceftriaxone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ceftriaxone</a> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cefotaxime-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cefotaxime</a> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dexamethasone-to-prevent-neurologic-complications-of-bacterial-meningitis-in-adults/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>].

We agree with the guidelines and therefore recommend dexamethasone therapy in adults in developed countries with known or suspected pneumococcal meningitis regardless of the Glasgow coma scale score.</p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=dexamethasone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Dexamethasone</a> should be continued for four days if the Gram stain reveals organisms consistent with <em>S. pneumoniae</em> or if the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) or blood culture grows <em>S. pneumoniae</em>. Dexamethasone should be discontinued if the Gram stain <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> cultures reveal another pathogen or if bacterial meningitis is subsequently thought not to be present.

Dexamethasone should be initiated shortly before or at the same time as the first dose of antibiotics. In a review that included 118 episodes of community-acquired bacterial meningitis in adults in which dexamethasone was given, the likelihood of an unfavorable outcome was much higher in the 94 patients in whom dexamethasone was given after antibiotics (51 versus 12 percent if given before antibiotics) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dexamethasone-to-prevent-neurologic-complications-of-bacterial-meningitis-in-adults/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>].
