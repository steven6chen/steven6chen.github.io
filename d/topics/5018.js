Various strategies for HCT have been developed and are applied, dependent upon the patient&rsquo;s disease and disease stage, the hematopoietic cell donor, and the source of hematopoietic progenitor cells. The assessment of those parameters, in turn, will affect the selection of the preparative regimen. These factors influence the efficacy of HCT and the short and long-term toxicities associated with the procedure. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=the-approach-to-hematopoietic-cell-transplantation-survivorship#H83240218\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;The approach to hematopoietic cell transplantation survivorship&quot;, section on 'Terminology'</a>.)</p><p>Allogeneic HCT (allo-HCT) uses hematopoietic progenitor cells collected from a healthy person (not from the patients themselves). Allo-HCT is increasingly used to treat a variety of hematologic neoplasms and nonmalignant marrow disorders (acquired and inherited), including inborn errors of metabolism. Eligibility for allo-HCT varies across countries and institutions. Ultimately, decisions regarding transplant eligibility should be made on a case-by-case basis dependent upon a risk-benefit assessment, and the needs and wishes of the patient. Here we discuss eligibility for allo-HCT. Eligibility for autologous HCT, the use of HCT in specific disease settings, and the short- and long-term complications of HCT are discussed separately.

Currently, a decision to perform allo-HCT must include an assessment of the underlying disease state and whether allo-HCT is likely to offer results superior to those achieved with nontransplant options. The risks of morbidity and mortality associated with allo-HCT must be compared with those of other treatment approaches.</p><p>The role of allo-HCT in specific diseases is discussed in more detail separately.

Additional information and instructions for referring a patient to an appropriate research center can be obtained from the United States National Institutes of Health (<a href=\"http://www.clinicaltrials.gov/&amp;token=NK91I08KOJ1eJ1hT1o/oHgJu4vbbEBRl2V0d48fIIMDpbZTpeZvuNaOE2M5VxYDS&amp;TOPIC_ID=16870\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">clinicaltrials.gov</a>). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=allogeneic-hematopoietic-cell-transplantation-in-multiple-myeloma\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation in multiple myeloma&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Of importance, there are no accepted guidelines regarding indications for allo-HCT, and recommendations differ between transplant centers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/determining-eligibility-for-allogeneic-hematopoietic-cell-transplantation/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. For malignant disorders, disease stage at the time of HCT and cytogenetic abnormalities have consistently been identified as the strongest determinants of relapse after allo-HCT. These factors are closely linked to the underlying diagnosis and prior treatment. Many pre-HCT factors such as patient age, type of disease, genetic determinants, and most comorbid conditions are not modifiable. However, assuming that a suitable donor is available, clinicians have some control over the timing of allo-HCT and thereby the disease stage when allo-HCT is carried out. </p><p>General issues that complicate recommendations regarding the timing and efficacy of allo-HCT include the following:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients who have received extensive cytotoxic therapy before allo-HCT are more likely to be in worse physical condition and less likely to tolerate allo-HCT. As an example, a patient with refractory disease is very likely to have received twice the amount or more of therapy (chemotherapy <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> radiation) before allo-HCT than a patient in first remission. Thus, it may be difficult to separate the effect of prior therapy from disease status in such patients.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>There is a general lack of randomized trials comparing allo-HCT with nontransplant strategies. Instead, investigators have often relied on a &ldquo;genetic randomization&rdquo; in which patients are assigned to treatment with or without allo-HCT based upon the presence or absence of an HLA-matched sibling donor or, more recently, an HLA-matched unrelated donor. Patients without an HLA-matched donor are considered for transplantation from an &ldquo;alternative&rdquo; donor (HLA-haploidentical family member or cord blood) or are assigned to treatment with either chemotherapy alone or autologous HCT, depending upon the trial design. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Chemotherapy and radiation therapy programs change over time as new drugs and techniques are developed. Clinicians must determine how to incorporate data regarding new therapies in a setting that has previously shown a benefit from allo-HCT. Patients referred for allo-HCT may have been exposed to chemotherapeutic or biologic agents whose impact on allo-HCT is unknown. Patients who have received these regimens may be more refractory to the effects of allo-HCT than patients exposed to different agents in the past.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Low intensity (nonmyeloablative [NMA]) or reduced intensity conditioning (RIC) regimens have allowed for allo-HCT in older patients and patients with comorbidities. As a result, there is a broad spectrum of preparative regimens suitable for various disease categories and patient populations (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F87814\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef87814 \">figure 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/determining-eligibility-for-allogeneic-hematopoietic-cell-transplantation/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. There appears to be a higher relapse rate with <span class=\"nowrap\">NMA/RIC</span> conditioning in several disease categories [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/determining-eligibility-for-allogeneic-hematopoietic-cell-transplantation/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. As such, the disease status becomes a central issue when considering <span class=\"nowrap\">NMA/RIC</span> allo-HCT. Additional therapy may be administered to decrease tumor bulk before allo-HCT to increase the probability of post-HCT success [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/determining-eligibility-for-allogeneic-hematopoietic-cell-transplantation/abstract/4,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,5</a>]. Importantly, randomized trials (eg, BMT CTN 0901 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/determining-eligibility-for-allogeneic-hematopoietic-cell-transplantation/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]) suggest that high dose (myeloablative) conditioning should be the standard for patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) or myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) if patients can tolerate such a regimen. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hematopoietic-cell-transplantation-in-myelodysplastic-syndromes#H9989758\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Hematopoietic cell transplantation in myelodysplastic syndromes&quot;, section on 'Nonmyeloablative or reduced-intensity regimens'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=post-remission-therapy-for-acute-myeloid-leukemia-in-younger-adults#H17\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Post-remission therapy for acute myeloid leukemia in younger adults&quot;, section on 'Nonmyeloablative/Reduced intensity HCT'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The availability of RIC regimens has also allowed for second transplantations to be carried out after failure of a previous (autologous or allogeneic) transplant after a high-dose regimen, a situation where repeat conditioning with high-dose therapy is expected to cause prohibitive toxicity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/determining-eligibility-for-allogeneic-hematopoietic-cell-transplantation/abstract/4,7,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,7,8</a>].</p><p/><p>Ongoing trials are assessing the role of allo-HCT in other settings and tumor types. Often there is no better therapy to offer a patient than enrollment onto a well-designed, scientifically valid, peer-reviewed clinical trial. Additional information and instructions for referring a patient to an appropriate research center can be obtained from the United States National Institutes of Health (<a href=\"http://www.clinicaltrials.gov/&amp;token=NK91I08KOJ1eJ1hT1o/oHgJu4vbbEBRl2V0d48fIIMDpbZTpeZvuNaOE2M5VxYDS&amp;TOPIC_ID=16870\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">www.clinicaltrials.gov</a>).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7278633\"><span class=\"h2\">Disease type and status</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The aggressiveness of the underlying disease and the disease status (eg, complete remission [CR], partial remission [PR], minimal residual disease [MRD]) at the time of transplant have a considerable impact on long-term survival of patients undergoing allogeneic HCT for malignancies. These variables have made the results of studies of transplantation across disease entities difficult to compare. </p><p>A disease risk index was created using data from 1539 patients who underwent allogeneic HCT at Dana-Farber Cancer <span class=\"nowrap\">Institute/Brigham</span> and Women's Hospital from 2000 to 2009, and was validated in an independent cohort of 672 patients who underwent transplant at the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/determining-eligibility-for-allogeneic-hematopoietic-cell-transplantation/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. Sixteen defined underlying diseases were categorized as low risk (eg, AML with favorable cytogenetics, CLL, CML, indolent B cell NHL), high risk (eg, AML or MDS with adverse cytogenetics, extranodal T cell lymphoma), or intermediate risk (all others). Disease stage was categorized as low risk (eg, complete remission, first partial remission, untreated disease) or high risk (eg, induction failure, active relapse, accelerated or blast phase CML). These two ratings were then combined to define four risk groups with significantly different estimated rates of overall survival (OS), progression-free survival (PFS), cumulative incidence of relapse (CIR), and non-relapse mortality (NRM) at four years. </p><p>The disease risk index described above was independently validated by the Center for International Blood and Marrow Transplant Research (CIBMTR) using data from 13,131 patients who underwent HCT between 2008 and 2010, approximately half of whom received a myeloablative preparative regimen [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/determining-eligibility-for-allogeneic-hematopoietic-cell-transplantation/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. Estimated overall survival at two years was 64, 51, 34, and 24 percent for those in the low, intermediate, high, and very high risk groups, respectively. Using this large cohort of patients, the CIBMTR was able to further refine the disease index for specific patient populations (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F95118\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef95118 \">table 1</a>). </p><p>In addition, several risk classifications have been developed for diseases such as myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) or myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPN). The International Prognostic Scoring System (IPSS) in its original or in its revised form (IPSS-R) have significant prognostic relevance in patients with MDS [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/determining-eligibility-for-allogeneic-hematopoietic-cell-transplantation/abstract/11,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,12</a>]. Similarly, the dynamic IPSS (DIPSS) and its modified version, the DIPSS Plus are useful in determining indications for HCT in patients with MPN [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/determining-eligibility-for-allogeneic-hematopoietic-cell-transplantation/abstract/13,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,14</a>]. As an example, in one analysis, patients with MPN in the DIPSS risk groups low and intermediate-1 had the best overall outlook with conservative management, while patients in risk groups intermediate-2 and high benefited from HCT [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/determining-eligibility-for-allogeneic-hematopoietic-cell-transplantation/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>].

Some studies have evaluated the impact of individual parameters (eg, age, performance status, cardiopulmonary function), while others have created scoring systems to evaluate the effects of multiple parameters. These are described in the following sections. None of these factors represents an absolute contraindication to allo-HCT. Instead, they must be carefully weighed within the context of the clinical scenario. (See <a href=\"#H24292859\" class=\"local\">'Determining eligibility'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H24292824\"><span class=\"h2\">Age</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The incorporation of age cutoffs into eligibility criteria for allo-HCT is controversial. Historically, myeloablative allo-HCT has been limited to patients &le;55 years due to the expected<strong> </strong>toxicity associated with the procedure. The development of transplantation conditioning regimens<strong> </strong>of lower intensity (ie, nonmyeloablative, reduced intensity) has allowed allo-HCT to be carried out with less<strong> </strong>toxicity than observed in the past and has permitted transplantation<strong> </strong>of patients who hitherto had not been considered candidates. While lower intensity regimens appear to be associated with less toxicity, they are associated with a greater risk of relapse [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/determining-eligibility-for-allogeneic-hematopoietic-cell-transplantation/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. Many centers continue to use an age cutoff of 55 years for myeloablative allo-HCT, but allow for lower intensity allo-HCT in physically fit patients up to age 75 years.</p><p>The<strong> </strong>median age of transplanted patients has increased continuously<strong> </strong>over the past few decades with reports including patients up to age 75 years. The Center for International Blood and Marrow Transplantation<strong> </strong>Research (CIBMTR) database shows a median patient age of<strong> </strong>25, 39, and 46 years in the 1980s, in the 1990s, and in the first decade of this century, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/determining-eligibility-for-allogeneic-hematopoietic-cell-transplantation/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>].<strong> </strong>Transplants performed between 2002 and 2009 included a substantial percentage of patients &gt;50 years (44 percent) and &gt;60 years (20 percent).</p><p>The factors driving allo-HCT eligibility and the patient's goal of therapy may change with age. In younger patients, decisions regarding HCT are primarily governed by disease risk and donor availability, and allo-HCT aims to add many more years of life. In older patients, the presence of comorbid conditions and the suitability of conditioning regimens play a central role in the decision process and patients may feel more strongly about quality of life (QOL) during whatever time remains. In either case, QOL can be significantly impaired by transplantation-related complications, in particular graft-versus-host disease and its treatment. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=quality-of-life-following-hematopoietic-cell-transplantation\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Quality of life following hematopoietic cell transplantation&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The following is a description of studies that have investigated the impact of recipient age on outcomes after HCT:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A retrospective study from the European Bone Marrow Transplantation (EBMT) group analyzed the impact of age on the outcomes of 1333 older adults (age 50 to 74 years) who underwent myeloablative (38 percent) or reduced intensity allo-HCT from HLA-identical siblings (61 percent) or unrelated donors for the treatment of MDS or secondary AML [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/determining-eligibility-for-allogeneic-hematopoietic-cell-transplantation/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. Estimated four-year survival for all patients was 31 percent. There was no significant association between age and relapse or non-relapse mortality. Relapse was significantly more likely in patients with advanced disease and those who underwent reduced-intensity conditioning. In contrast, non-relapse mortality was greater in those with advanced stage disease, the use of unrelated donors, and reduced-intensity conditioning regimen. In the absence of more details regarding comorbidities, it is unknown how much selection bias influences whether patients go on to receive a transplant and what conditioning regimen is chosen.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In another analysis from the CIBMTR, 1080 older adults (&gt;40 years) underwent reduced intensity conditioning followed by allo-HCT for MDS or AML in first remission from 1995 to 2005 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/determining-eligibility-for-allogeneic-hematopoietic-cell-transplantation/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. Among those with AML, estimated two-year survival was 44, 50, 34, and 36 percent among those ages 40 to 54, 55 to 59, 60 to 64, or older than 64 years, respectively. Two-year overall survival was correlated with pre-HCT performance status. Chronologic age did not impact rates of non-relapse mortality, relapse, or graft-versus-host disease (GVHD).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>An analysis of 372 patients aged 60 to 75 years enrolled in prospective clinical trials of nonmyeloablative allo-HCT reported five-year cumulative incidences of non-relapse mortality and relapse of 27 and 41 percent, respectively, and overall and progression-free survival rates of 35 and 32 percent, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/determining-eligibility-for-allogeneic-hematopoietic-cell-transplantation/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. There was no statistically significant difference in these outcomes when stratified by age. Greater age was associated with increased bacterial infections and hospitalizations. The incidence of chronic GVHD and the rate of resolution were similar to that seen in younger patients treated with HCT. Two-thirds of survivors had resolution of their GVHD and returned to near-normal physical function.</p><p/><p>Chronologic age alone should not be the sole criterion used to determine eligibility for allo-HCT, but, in the context of comorbid conditions, may impact the choice of conditioning regimen. Although it is difficult to agree on parameters to define biologic age, age must be taken into consideration in the decision process. Even in the absence of clinically apparent comorbidities, changes in organ function with age may modify drug metabolism or excretion and contribute to differences in outcome compared with younger patients. As an example, increasing age is associated with decreased glomerular filtration rate and is a risk factor for the development of chronic kidney disease after allo-HCT [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/determining-eligibility-for-allogeneic-hematopoietic-cell-transplantation/abstract/21-23\" class=\"abstract_t\">21-23</a>]. Similarly, increasing age is associated with decreased forced expiration volume at one second, which might interfere with airway clearance and infection prevention after HCT. Therefore, it is important to consider age as a predictor of how well (or poorly) a patient is expected to tolerate not only the transplantation regimen but also the management after HCT, in particular GVHD and its treatment.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H19386571\"><span class=\"h2\">Comorbidities</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Screening for pulmonary, cardiac, liver, and kidney dysfunction is performed in an attempt to identify patients at increased risk for complications and to help guide therapy. Patients with organ dysfunction prior to allo-HCT are expected to have more complications with the procedure. In addition, knowledge of underlying organ dysfunction can guide therapy decisions to minimize further toxicity. As examples:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Pulmonary disease</strong> &ndash; Historically, a corrected DLCO of 60 percent or greater has been required for allo-HCT eligibility. However, a subset of patients with DLCO less than 60 percent can be transplanted successfully. This is particularly important for patients with autoimmune diseases involving the lungs who are considering HCT. As an example, a study from the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research center evaluated the impact of pulmonary function as part of the PAM score that also includes transplant donor type, disease risk, and planned transplantation regimen [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/determining-eligibility-for-allogeneic-hematopoietic-cell-transplantation/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. This analysis showed that the discriminating capacity of PAM was superior to DLCO and that patients with DLCO less than 60 percent could be transplanted. Patients with known pulmonary dysfunction should avoid conditioning regimens, such as BCNU-based regimens and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=busulfan-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">busulfan</a> plus total body irradiation, which are known to decrease diffusion capacity. (See <a href=\"#H3520624\" class=\"local\">'PAM score'</a> below and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pulmonary-toxicity-associated-with-antineoplastic-therapy-cytotoxic-agents\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pulmonary toxicity associated with antineoplastic therapy: Cytotoxic agents&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Cardiac disease</strong> &ndash; While life-threatening cardiac complications are uncommon following allo-HCT, the transplant procedure is associated with sub-acute cardiac injury even in patients with normal cardiac function pretransplant. This cardiac injury is assumed to be of greater impact in patients with less cardiac reserve. Cardiac risk factors should be minimized in all patients prior to transplant (eg, smoking, obesity, hyperlipidemia, hypertension, hyperglycemia). The degree of cardiac dysfunction allowed depends largely upon the underlying disease and conditioning regimen. In general, patients with a left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) &lt;40 percent or uncontrolled coronary artery disease or uncontrolled arrhythmias are not considered candidates for allo-HCT. A reduced ejection fraction and a history of congestive heart failure have a strong association with cardiotoxicity following transplant.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Liver dysfunction</strong> &ndash; A substantial percentage of patients with hematologic malignancies have abnormalities on liver function tests. Causes include those seen in patients without malignancy (eg, hepatitis, alcohol abuse, hepatic steatosis) and iron overload due to a large number of previous transfusions. Patients with abnormal liver function tests should undergo a detailed workup for etiology, ideally in consultation with a hepatologist. Patients with increased transaminases are at increased risk of developing veno-occlusive disease (VOD) post-HCT. Other risk factors for VOD post-HCT include a history of VOD and a history of exposure to <a href=\"topic.htm?path=gemtuzumab-ozogamicin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">gemtuzumab ozogamicin</a>.

Adequate renal function is important due to the potential for exposure to many nephrotoxic agents (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cyclosporine-ciclosporin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cyclosporine</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tacrolimus-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">tacrolimus</a>, aminoglycosides and amphotericin) following transplant. Patients with renal failure must be approached with caution since many of the clinical trials evaluating conditioning regimens have mainly studied patients with serum creatinine &lt;2.0 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> (177 <span class=\"nowrap\">micromol/L)</span> or Cr CL &gt;50 to 60. </p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3520542\"><span class=\"h2\">Infectious disease status</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Screening for infectious diseases before allo-HCT is designed to prevent post-transplant infections by defining specific infection control policies and antimicrobial prophylaxis and therapy, which will be necessary after transplantation. This is discussed in more detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-for-infection-before-hematopoietic-cell-transplantation\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation for infection before hematopoietic cell transplantation&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Seropositivity for HIV, hepatitis B, or hepatitis C does not exclude patients from undergoing allo-HCT, but does affect transplant care. Patients with these infections need further evaluation regarding the status of the infection, ideally in consultation with an infectious disease expert. Patients with hepatitis B or hepatitis C are at increased risk of viral reactivation after transplant, even if the infection appears to be resolved. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hepatitis-b-virus-reactivation-associated-with-immunosuppressive-therapy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Hepatitis B virus reactivation associated with immunosuppressive therapy&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aids-related-lymphomas-treatment-of-systemic-lymphoma#H4261285\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;AIDS-related lymphomas: Treatment of systemic lymphoma&quot;, section on 'Allogeneic transplantation'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3520363\"><span class=\"h2\">Weight and nutritional status</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patient weight is not used as a criterion for transplant eligibility, but may affect drug delivery and dosage considerations. Patients with obesity, anorexia, cachexia, or malnutrition should be evaluated by a dietician to maximize their nutritional status before and during the transplant procedure. Obesity should not exclude patients from undergoing allo-HCT.</p><p>Several analyses examined the impact of patient weight on transplantation outcome with mixed results [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/determining-eligibility-for-allogeneic-hematopoietic-cell-transplantation/abstract/25-27\" class=\"abstract_t\">25-27</a>]. When compared with patients closer to ideal body weight, patients who are severely underweight or obese appear to have inferior outcomes following allo-HCT [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/determining-eligibility-for-allogeneic-hematopoietic-cell-transplantation/abstract/27-30\" class=\"abstract_t\">27-30</a>]. Inferior outcome in underweight patients may be related to aggressive pre-HCT therapy, resulting in a negative nitrogen balance and wasting. Inferior outcomes in overweight patients may be related to general deconditioning and reduced activity; physical constraints regarding the care of obese patients who are too ill to care for themselves; and an increased incidence of infections. In addition, inferior outcomes may reflect differences in the volume of distribution of drugs and the impact of weight on pharmacokinetics [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/determining-eligibility-for-allogeneic-hematopoietic-cell-transplantation/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H24292831\"><span class=\"h1\">RISK ASSESSMENT SCORING SYSTEMS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A number of composite scoring systems are available for estimating mortality risk in patients considering allo-HCT. Of these, the three most commonly used assessments are the European Group for Blood and Marrow Transplantation (EBMT) risk assessment score for allogeneic transplantation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/determining-eligibility-for-allogeneic-hematopoietic-cell-transplantation/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>], the Pretransplant Assessment of Mortality (PAM) score [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/determining-eligibility-for-allogeneic-hematopoietic-cell-transplantation/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>], and the Hematopoietic Cell Transplantation-specific Comorbidity Index (HCT-CI) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/determining-eligibility-for-allogeneic-hematopoietic-cell-transplantation/abstract/34,35\" class=\"abstract_t\">34,35</a>].</p><p>A potentially important issue is that mortality rates after allo-HCT have decreased since these tools were created. A retrospective single-center study of 1418 patients who underwent allo-HCT from 1993 through 1997 and 1148 patients who were transplanted from 2003 through 2007 reported a significant decrease in non-relapse mortality (odds ratio 0.48, 95% CI 0.40-0.57) and overall mortality (odds ratio 0.59, 95% CI 0.52-0.67) in the patients in the latter group [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/determining-eligibility-for-allogeneic-hematopoietic-cell-transplantation/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>]. Similar results were reported in a study of 5972 patients younger than age 50 years undergoing myeloablative conditioning and allo-HCT for acute myeloid leukemia (AML) in first or second complete remission [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/determining-eligibility-for-allogeneic-hematopoietic-cell-transplantation/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>]. This benefit probably reflects shifts in conditioning regimens, preferred stem cell source, graft-versus-host disease prophylaxis, and other supportive measures.</p><p>There are few studies comparing these risk scores. One study compared the PAM model with the HCT-CI and found that a modified HCT-CI, allowing for risk group stratification different from that used in the original description, was the best predictor of non-relapse mortality [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/determining-eligibility-for-allogeneic-hematopoietic-cell-transplantation/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>]. An additional analysis involving data on 286 patients transplanted at a French center found the comorbidity indices to have little discriminating power but acknowledged that many children did not have pulmonary function tests available [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/determining-eligibility-for-allogeneic-hematopoietic-cell-transplantation/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>].</p><p>While future studies will be needed to validate these scoring systems and other available comorbidity scores [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/determining-eligibility-for-allogeneic-hematopoietic-cell-transplantation/abstract/34,35,40,41\" class=\"abstract_t\">34,35,40,41</a>], including the Karnofsky performance status [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/determining-eligibility-for-allogeneic-hematopoietic-cell-transplantation/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>], all can serve to help patients better appreciate their mortality risk after allo-HCT.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3520617\"><span class=\"h2\">EBMT score</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The European Group for Blood and Marrow Transplantation (EBMT) devised a risk score based on five separate characteristics, which predicted treatment-related mortality and five-year overall survival following allo-HCT for patients with chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F67260\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef67260 \">table 4</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/determining-eligibility-for-allogeneic-hematopoietic-cell-transplantation/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>].

Importantly, age greater than 40 years has a similar weight as a single underlying comorbidity (eg, diabetes requiring pharmacologic intervention). As such, decisions regarding eligibility for allo-HCT cannot be made on chronologic age alone. Older patients, including those more than age 60 years, may well be able to tolerate MA conditioning and allo-HCT. In contrast, unacceptably high rates of non-relapse mortality are seen in patients with significant comorbidities pretransplant, including those younger than age 40 years.

There are several possible sources for these cells:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>An identical twin (syngeneic, HLA identical)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A sibling, relative, or unrelated donor (who can be HLA identical, haploidentical, or mismatched)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Umbilical cord blood (which can be HLA identical, haploidentical, or mismatched)</p><p/><p>General issues involved in donor selection for HCT and the decision as to which donor source to utilize depends to a large degree upon the clinical situation and the approaches employed at the individual transplant center. This is discussed in more detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=donor-selection-for-hematopoietic-cell-transplantation\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Donor selection for hematopoietic cell transplantation&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sources-of-hematopoietic-stem-cells\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Sources of hematopoietic stem cells&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H24292838\"><span class=\"h1\">RACE, SOCIAL, AND ECONOMIC ISSUES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The final decision to perform an allo-HCT must take into account the psychosocial and financial support structure available to the patient. A plan must be in place to care for the patient's usual responsibilities and dependents during the prolonged hospital stay.</p><p>The patient's living situation must be taken into consideration. Patients are immunocompromised following allo-HCT and are therefore at increased risk for infectious complications, especially if exposed to large crowds. As such, patients who are homeless are unlikely to be able to get the needed care post-transplant. Similarly, transportation costs may become significant for patients who do not live near the transplant center. Some centers require that the patient have available or hire a full-time caregiver during the peri-transplant period, and this may be cost prohibitive. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-infections-following-hematopoietic-cell-transplantation\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of infections following hematopoietic cell transplantation&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Retrospective studies have also suggested that low socioeconomic status has a negative impact on the success of HCT [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/determining-eligibility-for-allogeneic-hematopoietic-cell-transplantation/abstract/55\" class=\"abstract_t\">55</a>]. Low socioeconomic status is correlated with a lower likelihood of health insurance, which may be associated with poor health maintenance, and the need to delay HCT. Postponement or delayed referral may be associated with more advanced disease, although such an explanation was not supported by one analysis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/determining-eligibility-for-allogeneic-hematopoietic-cell-transplantation/abstract/56\" class=\"abstract_t\">56</a>]. Although many patients have health insurance that would cover allo-HCT, even patients with insurance coverage often have a lifetime maximum coverage on insurance contracts, and the cost for allo-HCT and subsequent medical care may exceed that maximum [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/determining-eligibility-for-allogeneic-hematopoietic-cell-transplantation/abstract/57\" class=\"abstract_t\">57</a>]. As a result, patients may incur major out-of-pocket expenses, thereby exhausting their savings, or even being forced to sell their home. Expenses are due not only to direct medical costs, but also the need for the patient's partner or other family members, serving as caregivers, to take a leave from work, thus incurring a loss of income and the frequent need to rent an apartment close to the medical center to allow for appropriate treatment of the patient. Therefore, families must weigh this enormous investment against the probability of long-term success.</p><p>There are disparities in the use of allo-HCT among patients of different races and ethnicities [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/determining-eligibility-for-allogeneic-hematopoietic-cell-transplantation/abstract/58\" class=\"abstract_t\">58</a>]. Studies investigating this association are complicated by the understanding that race is a complex social, cultural, and political construct, rather than a biologic concept [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/determining-eligibility-for-allogeneic-hematopoietic-cell-transplantation/abstract/59\" class=\"abstract_t\">59</a>]. A retrospective analysis, summarizing data from four states, showed that blacks were less likely than whites to undergo HCT for leukemia or lymphoma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/determining-eligibility-for-allogeneic-hematopoietic-cell-transplantation/abstract/60\" class=\"abstract_t\">60</a>]. Results of subsequent studies have been mixed, with some confirming this difference and others not showing a difference [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/determining-eligibility-for-allogeneic-hematopoietic-cell-transplantation/abstract/61,62\" class=\"abstract_t\">61,62</a>]. Factors that may contribute to this include health insurance coverage, educational status, and health literacy. </p><p>In addition, retrospective studies have suggested that black patients may have inferior survival rates following allo-HCT [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/determining-eligibility-for-allogeneic-hematopoietic-cell-transplantation/abstract/55,56,63\" class=\"abstract_t\">55,56,63</a>].</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>An analysis of 2221 allo-HCT recipients reported that black race was associated with significantly higher mortality rates than observed in whites (HR = 1.65) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/determining-eligibility-for-allogeneic-hematopoietic-cell-transplantation/abstract/56\" class=\"abstract_t\">56</a>]. Blacks had more severe acute GVHD and higher non-relapse mortality following related and unrelated allo-HCT. A matched cohort analysis showed no correlation of higher mortality with socioeconomic status, suggesting that differences may be the result of currently unidentified genetic polymorphisms.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In an analysis of 6207 patients undergoing unrelated allo-HCT, blacks (but not Hispanics or <span class=\"nowrap\">Asians/Pacific</span> Islanders) had inferior overall survival (relative risk [RR] = 1.47) when compared with whites [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/determining-eligibility-for-allogeneic-hematopoietic-cell-transplantation/abstract/55\" class=\"abstract_t\">55</a>]. In addition, nonrelapse mortality (NRM) was higher in blacks (RR = 1.56) and Hispanics (RR = 1.30). Across all racial groups, patients in the lowest quartile of median income had worse overall survival (RR = 1.15) and higher risk of NRM (RR = 1.21) than patients with higher incomes. This suggested that inferior transplantation outcome in blacks is not fully explained by socioeconomic status; other factors, such as genetic polymorphisms and health behavior, may contribute. </p><p/><p>Other potential explanations for apparent differences in outcome according to race include a higher rate of comorbid conditions (eg, hypertension and kidney disease, which are prevalent in blacks) and difficulty in interpreting skin findings (eg, cutaneous GVHD) in patients with dark skin complexion. Studies are needed to address these factors. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H24292859\"><span class=\"h1\">DETERMINING ELIGIBILITY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients with a disease-related indication for allo-HCT should be offered the opportunity to discuss the procedure with a transplantation physician. Eligibility for allo-HCT varies across countries and institutions and there are few strict rules about who is and who is not an appropriate candidate. Instead, clinical judgment should be used for the majority of patients as to whether the long-term and short-term risks with the transplant outweigh the benefits. Risk factors include and are based on performance status, comorbidity, age, compliance, extent and status of disease, as well as the sensitivity of the tumor to standard therapy. We are currently not able to predict who will develop chronic GVHD or other complications, but we must inform patients of those possibilities and their effects on quality of life; risk-averse patients may not want to proceed. All of these factors should be considered when determining appropriateness of allo-HCT for an individual. The final decision on transplant eligibility should be made based on a risk-benefit assessment, and the needs and wishes of the patient. </p><p>The following general principles apply (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F87815\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef87815 \">table 6</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/determining-eligibility-for-allogeneic-hematopoietic-cell-transplantation/abstract/64\" class=\"abstract_t\">64</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>General features associated with superior outcomes following allo-HCT include: younger age, disease that is in remission or responsive to therapy with a low risk of disease relapse after HCT, the absence of active infections or other comorbid conditions, the presence of an HLA-matched donor, and a good socioeconomic support system.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>General features associated with increased risk of morbidity and mortality following allo-HCT include: older age, relapsed or refractory disease or disease with a high risk of relapse after HCT, a history of aggressive chemotherapy, and comorbidities.</p><p/><p>Criteria for allo-HCT are not absolute and vary by center.

This is in part related to efforts directed at optimizing<strong> </strong>patient selection, graft selection, conditioning regimens, and supportive care. We can expect the field to continue to<strong> </strong>evolve, hopefully eliminating some of the problems that currently exist. Two major obstacles that remain are relapse and GVHD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/determining-eligibility-for-allogeneic-hematopoietic-cell-transplantation/abstract/65,66\" class=\"abstract_t\">65,66</a>];<strong> </strong>because of the GVHD-associated graft-versus-tumor (GVT) effect, these<strong> </strong>problems are closely interrelated. As the intensity of transplantation<strong> </strong>conditioning is reduced, we rely increasingly on donor<strong> </strong>cell-mediated GVT effects to prevent relapse. As an example, the relationship between GVHD and GVT was investigated in an analysis of 1092 patients receiving a uniform conditioning regimen consisting of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fludarabine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">fludarabine</a> and low-dose TBI [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/determining-eligibility-for-allogeneic-hematopoietic-cell-transplantation/abstract/67\" class=\"abstract_t\">67</a>]. Most relapses occurred early after HCT while patients were on immunosuppression for prevention of acute GVHD. Chronic GVHD, but not acute GVHD, was associated with increased GVT effects.

Patients with substantial comorbidities and older patients are not candidates for myeloablative conditioning regimens, but may be candidates for a reduced intensity conditioning (RIC) regimen. Many older adults are not candidates for RIC. However, allo-HCT may be considered for older adults who are biologically younger than their chronologic age if the following are met: they have no significant comorbidities; they have stable social and economic support; their disease is considered &ldquo;responsive&rdquo; to treatment; and the patient fully understands the potential complications and long-term sequelae that may ensue [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/determining-eligibility-for-allogeneic-hematopoietic-cell-transplantation/abstract/68\" class=\"abstract_t\">68</a>].</p><p>Even younger patients and patients without significant comorbidities, whose disease has been refractory to various chemotherapeutic regimens, are not good candidates for current transplantation strategies except, possibly, as part of clinical trials that address refractory disease with disease-specific approaches. In such settings, it is not known whether allo-HCT offers a significant advantage over nontransplantation therapy.</p><p>Patients must have a suitable donor, a good social support system, and a secure financial net. They must be well informed, not only about the transplantation process but also about expected or potential post-HCT events, including GVHD and delayed effects, which may become manifest only years after HCT.
