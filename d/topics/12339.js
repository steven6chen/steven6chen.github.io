As an example, patients with widespread metastatic disease and asymptomatic primary tumor will not benefit from definitive colectomy and should <strong>not</strong> be subjected to the procedure. (See <a href=\"#H149209301\" class=\"local\">'Medical risk assessment'</a> below and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=surgical-resection-of-primary-colon-cancer#H149209808\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Surgical resection of primary colon cancer&quot;, section on 'Complicated disease'</a>.)</p><p>Relative contraindications include those patients with no social support <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> psychological issues where the magnitude of the procedure could be crippling and the patients would not be able to take care of themselves. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H149209082\"><span class=\"h1\">PREOPERATIVE EVALUATION</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H149209301\"><span class=\"h2\">Medical risk assessment</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Prior to elective colon surgery, major medical conditions should be identified and optimized before proceeding.

The clinician should identify any patient who lives alone to allow social services to identify any relevant issues and identify a nursing facility for temporary placement during the patient's recovery. Until this is settled, elective colectomy can be postponed. </p><p>The same factors should be considered for emergency colectomy as for elective colectomy, except that at times there is no time for a complete evaluation due to the nature of the emergency.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H219177400\"><span class=\"h2\">Preoperative imaging</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Prior to colon resection, regardless of indication, a contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) scan of the abdomen and pelvis should be obtained.

Under most circumstances, contrast-enhanced CT scan should provide adequate information regarding the mesenteric vasculature, such that standard arteriography is rarely needed.

Prior to elective colon surgery, we recommend intravenous antibiotic prophylaxis. We do not continue prophylaxis (intravenous or oral) postoperatively. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=control-measures-to-prevent-surgical-site-infection-following-gastrointestinal-procedures-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Control measures to prevent surgical site infection following gastrointestinal procedures in adults&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=antimicrobial-prophylaxis-for-prevention-of-surgical-site-infection-in-adults#H3098704\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Antimicrobial prophylaxis for prevention of surgical site infection in adults&quot;, section on 'Timing'</a>.) </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H149209272\"><span class=\"h2\">Bowel preparation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In patients undergoing elective colon resection, we suggest the use of a mechanical bowel preparation combined with oral antibiotics. Mechanical bowel preparation is usually accomplished with polyethylene glycol solution and is followed by oral antibiotics such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=neomycin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">neomycin</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=erythromycin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">erythromycin</a> base. Our suggestion is consistent with surgical site infection guidelines issued by the American College of Surgeons and Surgical Infection Society [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-colon-resection/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. </p><p>Traditionally, mechanical bowel preparation was used with oral antibiotics to prepare for all elective colon surgeries [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-colon-resection/abstract/4,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,5</a>]. Subsequently, several randomized trials reported no benefit from mechanical bowel preparation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-colon-resection/abstract/6-8\" class=\"abstract_t\">6-8</a>] or oral antibiotics [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-colon-resection/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. As a result, the practice of colon resection without preoperative bowel preparation (and without oral antibiotics) became widespread. </p><p>However, results from several studies suggest that the use of mechanical bowel preparation combined with oral antibiotics is associated with more favorable outcomes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-colon-resection/abstract/10-14\" class=\"abstract_t\">10-14</a>], despite a potential increase in the rate of <em>C. difficile</em> infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-colon-resection/abstract/11,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,15</a>]. </p><p>The best data come from two large retrospective cohort studies of the American College of Surgeons National Surgical Quality Improvement Program [ACS-NSQIP] targeted colectomy data [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-colon-resection/abstract/12,16\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,16</a>]. In the larger study, 45,724 elective colectomies with anastomosis were performed from 2012 to 2015: 37 percent after both mechanical bowel preparation and oral antibiotics, 33 percent after mechanical bowel preparation only, 4 percent after oral antibiotics only, and 25 percent with no bowel preparation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-colon-resection/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. Compared with other bowel prep strategies, the combination of mechanical bowel preparation and oral antibiotics was associated with lower rates of surgical site infection (2.9 versus 4.6 percent with oral antibiotics only, 5.9 percent with mechanical bowel preparation only, and 6.7 percent with no preparation), anastomotic leaks (2.2 versus 2.9, 3.5, and 4.2 percent), overall complications (10 versus 13.2, 15, and 17.3 percent), and 30-day mortality (0.4 versus 0.8, 0.7, and 1.4 percent). By multivariate analyses, the combination of mechanical bowel preparation and oral antibiotics, compared with no preparation, was associated with few surgical site infections in right colectomy (odds ratio [OR] 0.40, 95% CI 0.33-0.50), left colectomy (OR 0.57, 95% CI 0.47-0.68), and segmental colectomy (OR 0.43, 95% CI 0.34-0.54); the same combination was associated with fewer anastomotic leaks in left (OR 0.50, 95% CI 0.37-0.69) and segmental colectomy (OR 0.53, 95% CI 0.36-0.80). </p><p>Similarly, a 2015 meta-analysis of seven randomized trials showed that, compared with patients who received a mechanical bowel preparation, patients who received oral antibiotics plus a mechanical bowel preparation had a significantly lower rate of overall surgical site infection (7 versus 16 percent) and superficial surgical site infection (5 versus 12 percent), but not deep surgical site infection (4 versus 5 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-colon-resection/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>].</p><p>In most studies, oral antibiotics were coadministered with mechanical bowel preparation to a majority of patients. Given the existing data, oral antibiotics are best administered in conjunction with mechanical bowel preparation for bowel preparation before elective colorectal surgery. This recommendation is consistent with the World Health Organization global guidelines for the prevention of surgical site infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-colon-resection/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>].</p><p>In rare situations where mechanical bowel preparation is contraindicated, there is suggestion that oral antibiotics should be administered anyway. In one study, preoperative antibiotics, independent of mechanical bowel preparation, were associated with lower morbidity and mortality rates compared with no oral antibiotics, although only 4 percent of the study cohort received oral antibiotics only [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-colon-resection/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H644999137\"><span class=\"h2\">Prophylactic ureteral stenting</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The key to preventing ureteral injury is intraoperative identification. Placement of ureteral stents can help identify the ureters but will not prevent injury. Some surgeons routinely consult a urologist to have ureteral stents placed. However, a more selective approach may be prudent, only placing ureteral stents for those patients at high risk for ureteral injury, such as those with bulky tumors, obesity, undergoing reoperations (benign or recurrent disease), prior pelvic surgery, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> prior radiation. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=placement-and-management-of-indwelling-ureteral-stents\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Placement and management of indwelling ureteral stents&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H149209106\"><span class=\"h2\">Thromboprophylaxis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients undergoing colon resection frequently are at moderate-to-high risk for developing a deep venous thrombosis given their age, presence of malignancy, and nature and duration of surgery (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F83739\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef83739 \">table 3</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-colon-resection/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. </p><p>Patients identified as having moderate-to-high risk of developing a venous thromboembolic event (deep vein thrombosis [DVT] or pulmonary embolism [PE]) should be given chemical thromboprophylaxis in addition to mechanical prophylaxis. Chemical prophylaxis is typically administered as subcutaneous injections of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=heparin-unfractionated-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">unfractionated heparin</a> or low-molecular-weight heparin starting either immediately before surgery or shortly thereafter.</p><p>In a randomized trial of 376 patients undergoing colorectal surgery, patients who received chemical prophylaxis before surgery had similar rates of DVT postoperatively (1.6 versus 2.6 percent) and at 30 days (1.6 versus 3.6 percent) compared with those who only received chemical prophylaxis postoperatively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-colon-resection/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. The two groups of patients had similar rates of bleeding events that required reoperation (0.5 versus 1.6 percent). No PE was reported in either group. Thus, when the first dose of chemical prophylaxis should be given remains unclear and continues to be dictated by surgeon preferences and local practices.</p><p>DVT prophylaxis in surgical patients, including the duration of therapy, is discussed in detail separately.

Specific vaccines and vaccine schedules are discussed elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prevention-of-sepsis-in-the-asplenic-patient#H4\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Prevention of sepsis in the asplenic patient&quot;, section on 'Immunizations'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H149210240\"><span class=\"h1\">MINIMALLY INVASIVE COLON RESECTION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Several systematic reviews and meta-analyses of randomized trials have compared outcomes for open versus laparoscopic colectomy for patients undergoing resection for colon cancer, diverticular disease, and colitis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-colon-resection/abstract/22-27\" class=\"abstract_t\">22-27</a>]. Although laparoscopic colectomy may take longer than open colectomy, it is associated with short-term benefits with no overall differences in the risk for complications and no differences for long-term outcomes. Thus, for patients with uncomplicated localized colon disease not involving or invading adjacent organs, and who have not had prior extensive abdominal surgery, we suggest laparoscopic colectomy rather than open colectomy whenever a surgeon experienced with advanced laparoscopic colectomy techniques is available, provided there are no contraindications to the technique (eg, severe pulmonary disease).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2807114844\"><span class=\"h2\">Short-term (perioperative) outcomes</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Laparoscopic colon surgery has been associated with a lower perioperative morbidity in most studies, and a lower perioperative mortality in some reports.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1622885216\"><span class=\"h3\">Overall morbidity</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In a review of the National Surgical Quality Improvement Program (NSQIP) database, patients undergoing laparoscopic colectomy between 2006 and 2007 had significantly fewer superficial wound infections (6.6 versus 10.3 percent), deep wound infections (1.0 versus 2.4 percent), organ space infections (2.4 versus 4.3 percent), and wound dehiscence rates (0.85 versus 2.7 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-colon-resection/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3692474339\"><span class=\"h3\">Severe morbidity</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In another study using the same dataset (2005 to 2008), patients who underwent laparoscopic surgery were 2.3- to 5.5-fold less likely to have a severe complication (Dindo-Clavien Class 4 or 5 (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F110852\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef110852 \">table 4</a>)) than those who underwent open surgery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-colon-resection/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>].

The best evidence comes from a 2016 meta-analysis of 24 randomized trials and 88 observational studies. Compared with open surgery, laparoscopic surgery was associated with fewer early (106 studies, odds ratio [OR] 0.62, 95% CI 0.54-0.72) and late (12 studies, OR 0.61, 95% CI 0.41-0.92) postoperative bowel obstructions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-colon-resection/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]. </p><p>Laparoscopic colectomy can be performed with the single-incision technique or the standard multiport technique.

For localized benign conditions of the colon (eg, trauma, diverticular disease, inflammatory bowel disease), a segmental resection with a primary anastomosis in well-vascularized colon and a limited mesenteric resection can be performed. Diverticular disease, typically treated with a sigmoidectomy, may require a left hemicolectomy if the descending colon is unsuitable for an anastomosis. Extended resection (extended right or left colectomy) or subtotal colectomy may be needed for more extensive benign disease of the colon (eg, inflammatory bowel disease, diverticular disease, fulminant <em>C. difficile </em>colitis). For large polyps that require resection because of a possible malignancy, the authors perform a formal cancer operation. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Malignant lesions located in the appendix, cecum, and ascending colon can be resected by a right hemicolectomy. Malignant lesions located in the hepatic flexure or proximal to the midtransverse colon are resected with an extended right colectomy. Malignant lesions of the left colon are typically resected with a left hemicolectomy. For malignant lesions of the splenic flexure, a limited resection extending from the transverse to the sigmoid colon can be performed, but the pedicle of the left colic artery and the first sigmoid branch should be included in the specimen. A small number of transverse tumors may be amenable to transverse colectomy. The surgical margins for a curative resection for colon cancer should be at least 5 cm from the tumor on both sides [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-colon-resection/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>].</p><p/><p>The extent of the mesenteric resection also varies according to whether the resection is being performed for benign conditions or malignancy. Figures that show these differences are given in the section above. (See <a href=\"#H644993939\" class=\"local\">'Types of colon resection'</a> above.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For benign disease including trauma, mesenteric vessels can generally be divided close to the mesenteric border of the colon since it is unnecessary to resect draining lymph nodes. However, in settings of severe mesenteric inflammation (eg, diverticulitis, inflammatory bowel disease) and thickening of the mesentery near the bowel wall, a more extensive mesenteric dissection may be necessary [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-colon-resection/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For malignancy, a complete mesocolic resection ligates the mesenteric vessels close to their root to optimally resect the lymphovascular tissue. As an example, for left colectomy, the inferior mesenteric artery is ligated at its origin from the aorta, and the inferior mesenteric vein is ligated at the level of the pancreas; the mesentery and draining lymphatics are removed with the vascular pedicle. </p><p/><p>Complete mesocolic excision has been reported to improve oncologic outcomes but could result in higher morbidity. In one study, complete mesocolic excision was associated with more intraoperative injuries to other organs (9.1 versus 3.6 percent), postoperative sepsis (6.6 versus 3.2 percent), and respiratory failure (8.1 versus 3.4 percent) compared with conventional surgery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-colon-resection/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>]. In the same study, the 30-day (OR 1.07, 95% CI 0.62-1.80) and 90-day mortality (OR 1.25, 95% CI 0.77-1.94) associated with complete mesocolic excision were higher, but not statistically different from those of conventional surgery. The two techniques have not been directly compared in prospective trials. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H149208902\"><span class=\"h1\">BOWEL ANASTOMOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There is insufficient evidence to suggest that the method of performing the colon anastomosis (hand sewn or stapled), or its configuration (end to end, end to side, side to side) is better functionally or less likely to leak [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-colon-resection/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>]. Experience, surgeon preference, and availability of equipment dictate the type of anastomosis a surgeon performs in a given situation. Stapling the anastomosis requires less time to perform and offers the potential for reduced fecal contamination but at times may not be practical. Specific types of anastomoses (ileocolic, colo-colonic, colorectal) are discussed separately.

There is great variability in frequency, with most patients having a minimal increase in frequency, but some have at least a temporary increase to four or more movements per day. Such patients may benefit from the addition of dietary fiber and, when necessary, an antimotility agent. The remaining colon will often adapt over a four-to-six-month period, gradually returning to a more normal bowel pattern.</p><p>At the time of discharge from the hospital, the patient is instructed to avoid strenuous activity and heavy lifting for four to six weeks following surgery but is encouraged to participate in light activity, such as walking, and to return if unexpected symptoms such as significant abdominal pain, <span class=\"nowrap\">nausea/vomiting,</span> obstipation, fevers and chills, or signs of wound infection including redness or drainage occur.

Patients with colon cancer are older and tend to have more comorbidities, and as a result have a higher incidence of postoperative morbidity and mortality [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-colon-resection/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Longer-term survival is disease specific and is reviewed in separate topic reviews for various conditions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-colon-resection/abstract/1,52-54\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,52-54</a>].</p><p>Complications of colectomy include surgical site infection, ureteral injury, anastomotic leak, intra-abdominal abscess, enteric fistula, bleeding, and postoperative bowel obstruction.

Planning colon resection takes into account the nature of the lesion, its location within the colon, and the status of the colonic circulation. Regardless of indication, we obtain a contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) scan of the abdomen and pelvis and include a CT scan of the chest if the patient has a colon cancer staged II or higher.
