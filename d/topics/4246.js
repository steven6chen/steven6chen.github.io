Cocaine use can lead to addiction and adverse physical effects, such as stroke and cardiac arrest.</p><p>Cocaine is classified as a Schedule II medication under the Controlled Substances Act in the United States. Cocaine hydrochloride is still legally available in the United States as a 4 or 10 percent solution for use as a local or topical anesthetic, although it has largely been replaced in clinical practice by synthetic local anesthetics [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cocaine-use-disorder-in-adults-epidemiology-pharmacology-clinical-manifestations-medical-consequences-and-diagnosis/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. </p><p>The DSM-IV-TR psychiatric diagnoses cocaine abuse and cocaine dependence were replaced by one diagnosis, cocaine use disorder, in DSM-5 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cocaine-use-disorder-in-adults-epidemiology-pharmacology-clinical-manifestations-medical-consequences-and-diagnosis/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Although the crosswalk between DSM-IV and DSM-5 disorders is imprecise, cocaine dependence is approximately comparable to cocaine use disorder, moderate to severe subtype, while cocaine abuse is similar to the mild subtype [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cocaine-use-disorder-in-adults-epidemiology-pharmacology-clinical-manifestations-medical-consequences-and-diagnosis/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. </p><p>This topic addresses the epidemiology, pharmacology, clinical effects, and diagnosis of cocaine use disorder in adults. Acute intoxication from cocaine use, specific cardiovascular and pulmonary complications related to cocaine, and treatment of stimulant use disorder are discussed separately.

Use is most prevalent in North America (5.1 million people, 1.6 percent of population older than 14 years) and Central and South America (4.4 million people, 1.5 percent) and in Western and Central Europe (3.5 million people, 1.1 percent). Current use (3.4 percent in 2013) in the United Kingdom and Spain now exceeds population rates in the United States [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cocaine-use-disorder-in-adults-epidemiology-pharmacology-clinical-manifestations-medical-consequences-and-diagnosis/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>], which have declined by almost one-quarter over the past 15 years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cocaine-use-disorder-in-adults-epidemiology-pharmacology-clinical-manifestations-medical-consequences-and-diagnosis/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. Common street names used in the United States for cocaine are shown in a table (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F81985\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef81985 \">table 1</a>).</p><p>There is less cocaine use in West and Central Africa, East and Southeast Asia, and Eastern and Southeastern Europe, with little use elsewhere in the world [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cocaine-use-disorder-in-adults-epidemiology-pharmacology-clinical-manifestations-medical-consequences-and-diagnosis/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. This pattern may be due to supply rather than demand factors, because of the difficulty in obtaining cocaine from its only source in South America and the ready availability of alternative synthetic stimulants such as amphetamines [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cocaine-use-disorder-in-adults-epidemiology-pharmacology-clinical-manifestations-medical-consequences-and-diagnosis/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>] or synthetic cathinones (&ldquo;bath salts&rdquo;).</p><p>Most cocaine use is by urban men age 15 to 35 years. About 3 percent of current users in the United States are adolescents 12 to 17 years old [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cocaine-use-disorder-in-adults-epidemiology-pharmacology-clinical-manifestations-medical-consequences-and-diagnosis/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. Cocaine use has declined almost fourfold among this age group in the past decade, while declining about one-quarter in the overall population.</p><p>Less than one-fifth (18.6 percent) of the 4.8 million United States residents estimated to use cocaine in 2015 met DSM-IV diagnostic criteria for cocaine abuse or dependence (cocaine use disorder in DSM-5) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cocaine-use-disorder-in-adults-epidemiology-pharmacology-clinical-manifestations-medical-consequences-and-diagnosis/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. Six-hundred and fifteen thousand cocaine users received specialty treatment for their cocaine use or associated medical problems in 2015 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cocaine-use-disorder-in-adults-epidemiology-pharmacology-clinical-manifestations-medical-consequences-and-diagnosis/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].</p><p>Cocaine is the illegal drug most often associated with visits to Untied States hospital emergency departments. In 2011, it was involved in an estimated 40.3 percent of illicit drug-related emergency department visits (about 505,000 visits), versus about 36 percent (456,000 visits) for marijuana and about 20.6 percent (258,000 visits) for heroin [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cocaine-use-disorder-in-adults-epidemiology-pharmacology-clinical-manifestations-medical-consequences-and-diagnosis/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. Nearly one-quarter of emergency room visits by patients seeking medical assistance for withdrawal (&ldquo;detoxification&rdquo;) involved cocaine use; 6.3 percent of emergency room visits for suicide attempts involved cocaine use.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Patterns of use</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Cocaine is used in a variety of patterns [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cocaine-use-disorder-in-adults-epidemiology-pharmacology-clinical-manifestations-medical-consequences-and-diagnosis/abstract/10,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,11</a>]. The typical &quot;binge&quot; involves short periods of heavy use (eg, payday or weekends) separated by longer periods of little or no use. Others may use for an extended period until their finances are exhausted or access to cocaine is interrupted. A small number of users may be self-medicating an underlying neuropsychiatric disorder, such as attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cocaine-use-disorder-in-adults-epidemiology-pharmacology-clinical-manifestations-medical-consequences-and-diagnosis/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>], excessive daytime sleepiness [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cocaine-use-disorder-in-adults-epidemiology-pharmacology-clinical-manifestations-medical-consequences-and-diagnosis/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>], Parkinsonism [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cocaine-use-disorder-in-adults-epidemiology-pharmacology-clinical-manifestations-medical-consequences-and-diagnosis/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>], or cluster headaches [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cocaine-use-disorder-in-adults-epidemiology-pharmacology-clinical-manifestations-medical-consequences-and-diagnosis/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. Most cocaine users living in the community do not use very frequently. More than half (58 percent) of past-year users used less than 12 times in the year; only 22 percent used at least 50 times [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cocaine-use-disorder-in-adults-epidemiology-pharmacology-clinical-manifestations-medical-consequences-and-diagnosis/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Risk factors</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>While cocaine use occurs in all sociodemographic groups, it is not equally distributed among the United States population. The highest prevalence of use is among unemployed men in their 20s with no more than a high school education who live in urban areas.</p><p>Cocaine use is highly associated with use of other legal and illegal substances and with psychiatric disorders. Cigarette smokers and heavy alcohol drinkers are 10 and 20 times more likely, respectively, than non-users to also use cocaine [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cocaine-use-disorder-in-adults-epidemiology-pharmacology-clinical-manifestations-medical-consequences-and-diagnosis/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. Concurrent use of cocaine and alcohol produces a new compound, cocaethylene, which is pharmacologically active (see <a href=\"#H11\" class=\"local\">'Metabolism'</a> below).</p><p>Cocaine users are at high risk for developing a cocaine use disorder. Community-based interview surveys suggest that up to one in six persons who use cocaine will develop dependence by DSM-IV-TR criteria [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cocaine-use-disorder-in-adults-epidemiology-pharmacology-clinical-manifestations-medical-consequences-and-diagnosis/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. Heavier users and users who take the drug intravenously or by smoking are more likely to develop dependence than lighter users or intranasal and oral users [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cocaine-use-disorder-in-adults-epidemiology-pharmacology-clinical-manifestations-medical-consequences-and-diagnosis/abstract/18-20\" class=\"abstract_t\">18-20</a>]. The greater abuse potential of intravenous or smoked cocaine is attributed to the faster rate of drug delivery to the brain (within 10 seconds), and faster onset of psychological effects [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cocaine-use-disorder-in-adults-epidemiology-pharmacology-clinical-manifestations-medical-consequences-and-diagnosis/abstract/21,22\" class=\"abstract_t\">21,22</a>]. This faster onset is associated with a more intense pleasurable response (the so-called &quot;rate hypothesis&quot; of psychoactive drug action) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cocaine-use-disorder-in-adults-epidemiology-pharmacology-clinical-manifestations-medical-consequences-and-diagnosis/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. Oral use of the coca leaf is not typically associated with significant adverse consequences [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cocaine-use-disorder-in-adults-epidemiology-pharmacology-clinical-manifestations-medical-consequences-and-diagnosis/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. </p><p>The environment (including family, religious, and social factors) has the strongest influence on initial cocaine use [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cocaine-use-disorder-in-adults-epidemiology-pharmacology-clinical-manifestations-medical-consequences-and-diagnosis/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. Studies of drug use by pairs of fraternal (dizygotic) and identical (monozygotic) twins suggested a significant genetic influence on the risk of developing cocaine abuse or dependence after use has begun. Several promising candidate genes have been identified, including those for cholinergic nicotinic and cannabinoid CB1 receptors, but no specific gene has been clearly linked with cocaine addiction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cocaine-use-disorder-in-adults-epidemiology-pharmacology-clinical-manifestations-medical-consequences-and-diagnosis/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9038092\"><span class=\"h2\">Co-occurring conditions</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Many cocaine users use other substances either to enhance the &quot;high&quot; (eg, simultaneous use of opiates [&quot;speedballing&quot;]) or to ameliorate adverse effects of intoxication or withdrawal (eg, use of alcohol, cannabis, or benzodiazepines). Current cocaine users are twice as likely as non-users to have symptoms of depressive or anxiety disorders [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cocaine-use-disorder-in-adults-epidemiology-pharmacology-clinical-manifestations-medical-consequences-and-diagnosis/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h1\">MECHANISM OF ACTION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Cocaine enhances monoamine neurotransmitter (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=dopamine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">dopamine</a>, norepinephrine, and serotonin) activity in the central and peripheral nervous systems by blocking the presynaptic reuptake pumps (transporters) for these neurotransmitters [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cocaine-use-disorder-in-adults-epidemiology-pharmacology-clinical-manifestations-medical-consequences-and-diagnosis/abstract/28,29\" class=\"abstract_t\">28,29</a>]. Cocaine's positive psychological effects and abuse liability are considered to be due to its enhancement of brain dopamine activity, especially in the so-called corticomesolimbic dopamine reward circuit. Cocaine addiction has been conceptualized as a disease of the brain's dopamine reward system [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cocaine-use-disorder-in-adults-epidemiology-pharmacology-clinical-manifestations-medical-consequences-and-diagnosis/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>].</p><p>Cocaine is unique among stimulant drugs in having a second action of blocking voltage-gated membrane sodium ion channels. This action accounts for its local anesthetic effect, and may contribute to cardiac arrhythmias. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-management-of-the-cardiovascular-complications-of-cocaine-abuse\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and management of the cardiovascular complications of cocaine abuse&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h1\">PHARMACOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Illegal cocaine comes in two forms: base (alkaloid, as in coca leaves) and salt&nbsp;[<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cocaine-use-disorder-in-adults-epidemiology-pharmacology-clinical-manifestations-medical-consequences-and-diagnosis/abstract/31,32\" class=\"abstract_t\">31,32</a>]. Both forms consist of the same cocaine molecule and exert the same pharmacological actions once they reach the brain or other target organ. They differ in physical properties, which allow different routes of administration.</p><p>Cocaine base (&quot;crack,&quot; &quot;freebase&quot;) can be smoked because it has a relatively low melting point (98&ordm;C) and vaporizes before substantial pyrolytic destruction has occurred. Cocaine base is difficult to dissolve for injection because it is relatively insoluble in water.</p><p>Cocaine salt, in contrast, cannot be efficiently smoked because it melts at 195&ordm;C, with substantial breakdown of the cocaine molecule before vaporization. Cocaine salt is readily injected or insufflated (&quot;snorted&quot;) through the nose; it is highly water soluble, making it easy to dissolve for injection purposes and facilitating absorption across mucus membranes.</p><p>The average purity of seized cocaine samples in the United States is around 50 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cocaine-use-disorder-in-adults-epidemiology-pharmacology-clinical-manifestations-medical-consequences-and-diagnosis/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>]. Common adulterants include both inert fillers that resemble cocaine in appearance (such as dextrose, lactose, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=mannitol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">mannitol</a>, or starch) and active chemicals that may mimic the local anesthetic effect of cocaine (such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=benzocaine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">benzocaine</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lidocaine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">lidocaine</a>, or procaine) or provide some psychoactive effect (such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ephedrine-systemic-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ephedrine</a>, amphetamine, caffeine, or PCP) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cocaine-use-disorder-in-adults-epidemiology-pharmacology-clinical-manifestations-medical-consequences-and-diagnosis/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>]. Street cocaine also may contain contaminants from the preparation process (such as benzene, acetone, or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sodium-bicarbonate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">sodium bicarbonate</a>). An increasingly common cocaine adulterant is the veterinary anti-helminthic agent levamisole [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cocaine-use-disorder-in-adults-epidemiology-pharmacology-clinical-manifestations-medical-consequences-and-diagnosis/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>].

Several studies suggest that self-reports of cocaine and other illegal substance use can be fairly accurate, as long as there are no adverse consequences (such as criminal charges) for acknowledging use [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cocaine-use-disorder-in-adults-epidemiology-pharmacology-clinical-manifestations-medical-consequences-and-diagnosis/abstract/141\" class=\"abstract_t\">141</a>].</p><p>Systematic review has identified several cocaine-use screening instruments, comprised of one to three questions, with good (though varying) sensitivity and reliability [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cocaine-use-disorder-in-adults-epidemiology-pharmacology-clinical-manifestations-medical-consequences-and-diagnosis/abstract/142\" class=\"abstract_t\">142</a>].

It is the illegal drug most often associated with emergency department visits in the United States. (See <a href=\"#H1\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Up to one in six persons who use cocaine will develop dependence (DSM-IV-TR criteria) or moderate to severe cocaine use disorder (DSM-5 criteria); abuse liability is greater with intravenous and smoked cocaine, compared to intranasal and oral use. Cocaine base has a low melting point and can be smoked; cocaine salt is water soluble and can be injected or absorbed across mucous membranes. (See <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Risk factors'</a> above and <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'Pharmacology'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Cocaine is largely metabolized to inactive hydrolytic products in the liver and plasma. Use of alcohol with cocaine produces a new metabolite, cocaethylene, which has actions similar to cocaine but a longer half-life. Concurrent alcohol use with cocaine may cause more severe and longer lasting toxic effects. (See <a href=\"#H11\" class=\"local\">'Metabolism'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Drug testing detects the metabolite benzoylecgonine, which is usually detectable two to four days after the last cocaine use, although this can be up to 14 days after heavy, prolonged use. (See <a href=\"#H12\" class=\"local\">'Elimination'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Cocaine use increases energy and alertness, can produce euphoria, and decreases appetite and need for sleep. Adverse effects may include anxiety, irritability, paranoia, delusions, and hallucinations. These may be accompanied by tachycardia, diaphoresis, nausea, and pupil dilatation. There is poor correlation between cocaine plasma concentrations and toxicity. (See <a href=\"#H14\" class=\"local\">'Acute intoxication'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Withdrawal symptoms from chronic cocaine use are predominantly psychological: depression, anxiety, anhedonia, cocaine craving, and increased sleep. Most symptoms are self limited and resolve within one to two weeks.
