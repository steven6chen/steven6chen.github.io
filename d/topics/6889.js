A similar problem can occur in military operations, desert hikes, and recreational activities such as yoga [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/exercise-associated-hyponatremia/abstract/5,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,6</a>], weightlifting, tennis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/exercise-associated-hyponatremia/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>], American football [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/exercise-associated-hyponatremia/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>], rugby [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/exercise-associated-hyponatremia/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>], and rowing [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/exercise-associated-hyponatremia/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>].</p><p>Exercise-associated hyponatremia (EAH) was first described in Durban, South Africa in 1981 and in 1985 in four athletes participating in endurance events longer than seven hours [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/exercise-associated-hyponatremia/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. Prior to 1981, athletes were advised to avoid drinking during exercise, leading to the development of hypernatremia in some athletes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/exercise-associated-hyponatremia/abstract/12,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,13</a>]. Subsequently, athletes were advised to consume as much fluid as possible during exercise. Concomitant with these recommendations, the incidence of hyponatremia in endurance athletes appeared to increase, particularly in the United States.</p><p>The majority of athletes who develop hyponatremia are asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic (eg, weakness, dizziness, headache, lethargy, <span class=\"nowrap\">nausea/vomiting)</span>. However, severe manifestations can occur, including seizures, cerebral edema, noncardiogenic pulmonary edema, and death.

The incidence of hyponatremia has varied, ranging from 0 to 18 percent in marathoners and triathletes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/exercise-associated-hyponatremia/abstract/2,15,19-21\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,15,19-21</a>] to 51 percent of runners participating in a 161 km mountain footrace, which suggests that EAH may be more prevalent in extreme endurance events lasting more than 24 hours [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/exercise-associated-hyponatremia/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. However, given that EAH can occur during various types of activity, it should be considered in all cases of exercise-associated collapse.</p><p>The following observations are illustrative:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a prospective study at the 2002 Boston Marathon (26.2 miles, 42.2 km), a sample of 766 runners approached randomly at race registration completed a survey prior to the race and, at the finish line, provided a blood sample and completed a questionnaire detailing their fluid consumption and urine output during the race [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/exercise-associated-hyponatremia/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Among these runners, 511 reported to the finish line station and an adequate blood sample was obtained from 488. Of these, 13 percent had hyponatremia (defined as a serum sodium concentration &le;135 <span class=\"nowrap\">mEq/L)</span> and three runners (0.6 percent) had what was considered critical hyponatremia (serum sodium concentration &le;120 <span class=\"nowrap\">mEq/L)</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/exercise-associated-hyponatremia/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. If this sample was representative of the almost 15,000 runners who finished the race, then 1900 of all finishers would have some degree of hyponatremia and 90 would have critical hyponatremia.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The largest experience comes from a review of 2135 athletes in reported endurance events in which both serum sodium and body weight changes after racing were available: 6 percent had a serum sodium between 129 and 135 <span class=\"nowrap\">mEq/L</span> and 1 percent had a serum sodium below 129 <span class=\"nowrap\">mEq/L</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/exercise-associated-hyponatremia/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. In addition, 13 percent were hypernatremic (serum sodium greater than 145 <span class=\"nowrap\">mEq/L),</span> due to inadequate fluid intake during the race. Hypernatremia has also been noted in other series [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/exercise-associated-hyponatremia/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The incidence of hyponatremia may be higher in runners of ultramarathons [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/exercise-associated-hyponatremia/abstract/24,25\" class=\"abstract_t\">24,25</a>]. As an example, 30 percent of runners completing a 161 km mountain race were found to have asymptomatic mild hyponatremia, associated with a loss of body weight in half of cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/exercise-associated-hyponatremia/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>].</p><p/><p>Based upon such observations, the recommendations for fluid intake during an endurance event were changed to drinking according to thirst. (See <a href=\"#H22\" class=\"local\">'Prevention'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h1\">RISK FACTORS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A number of risk factors have been linked with the development of EAH [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/exercise-associated-hyponatremia/abstract/1,2,8,18\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2,8,18</a>]. The most important is high fluid intake.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">High fluid intake</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The major risk factor for EAH appears to be a high rate of fluid consumption during and after exercise, leading to water overload and hemodilution [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/exercise-associated-hyponatremia/abstract/1,2,8,14,17,21,26,27\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2,8,14,17,21,26,27</a>]. The following observations illustrate the range of findings:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In the report from the Boston Marathon, hyponatremia was independently associated with weight gain during the marathon; 44 of 62 runners who developed hyponatremia gained weight during the race compared with 124 of 426 runners who did not develop hyponatremia (71 versus 29 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/exercise-associated-hyponatremia/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. This corresponded to the frequency and volume of fluid intake, which was significantly higher in the athletes who developed hyponatremia. Furthermore, the severity of hyponatremia was associated with the amount of weight gained. Of the runners who gained at least 2.0 kg, 17 percent developed severe hyponatremia (defined as a serum sodium less than or equal to 130 <span class=\"nowrap\">mEq/L)</span> compared with 3 percent in runners who gained between 0.0 and 1.9 kg.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Similar findings were noted in the review of 2135 athletes in endurance events [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/exercise-associated-hyponatremia/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. The mean serum sodium was 136 <span class=\"nowrap\">mEq/L</span> in the athletes who gained weight during the race compared with 141 <span class=\"nowrap\">mEq/L</span> in the athletes who either maintained weight or lost weight. Of the athletes who gained weight, 19 percent had a serum sodium between 129 and 135 <span class=\"nowrap\">mEq/L</span> and 11 percent had a serum sodium below 129 <span class=\"nowrap\">mEq/L</span>. The comparable values in athletes who did not gain weight were 4 and 0.3 percent, respectively.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">The authors estimated that athletes who gained more than 4 percent body weight during exercise had an 85 percent probability of developing hyponatremia and a 45 percent probability of developing hyponatremic encephalopathy.</p><p/><p>In most athletes who develop EAH, the excessive fluid intake reflects conditioned behavior based upon recommendations to drink fluid during exercise to avoid dehydration. In a study from the 1998 and 1999 Suzuki Rock 'N' Roll Marathons, for example, the 26 runners who developed hyponatremia reported &quot;drinking as much as possible&quot; during and after the race [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/exercise-associated-hyponatremia/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>].</p><p>By contrast, there were no cases of hyponatremia among 134 runners who finished the in the 2002 City of Christchurch marathon, [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/exercise-associated-hyponatremia/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. In this race, aggressive hydration was not promoted, and there were fewer hydration stations than there were in the 2002 Boston Marathon (every 5 versus 1.6 km) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/exercise-associated-hyponatremia/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p>The consumption of a <span class=\"nowrap\">carbohydrate/electrolyte-containing</span> sports drink does <strong>not</strong> provide protection against the development of hyponatremia, since most of these drinks are markedly hypotonic to plasma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/exercise-associated-hyponatremia/abstract/1,8,28\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,8,28</a>]. Gatorade, for example, has a sodium plus potassium concentration of only 23 <span class=\"nowrap\">mEq/L</span> (potassium is as osmotically active as sodium) compared with approximately 145 <span class=\"nowrap\">mEq/L</span> in normal plasma. (See <a href=\"#H22\" class=\"local\">'Prevention'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Other</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Other independent risk factors for EAH in different series included longer race time (or the related variable of slower training pace), and a low body mass index [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/exercise-associated-hyponatremia/abstract/1,8,14,17\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,8,14,17</a>]. As an example, the following observations were made in the report from the Boston Marathon [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/exercise-associated-hyponatremia/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Fifty-two percent of runners who developed hyponatremia had race times above four hours compared with 13 percent in those who finished the race in less than 3.5 hours. Longer race times probably correlate with increased water consumption and increased sodium losses.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Thirty-two percent of runners who developed hyponatremia had a body mass index less than 20 <span class=\"nowrap\">kg/m<sup>2</sup></span> compared with 14 percent in runners whose body mass index was greater or equal to 25 <span class=\"nowrap\">kg/m<sup>2</sup></span>. A possible mechanism is that ingestion of a given volume of water would lead to a greater reduction in serum sodium in individuals with a low body mass index since their total body water is lower at baseline.</p><p/><p>Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are used by as many as 50 to 60 percent of marathon runners. Some studies have found an association between NSAID use and the development of hyponatremia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/exercise-associated-hyponatremia/abstract/8,14,19,29,30\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,14,19,29,30</a>], although NSAID use was not an independent risk factor in the 2002 Boston Marathon study [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/exercise-associated-hyponatremia/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p>NSAIDs increase the activity of antidiuretic hormone (ADH, also called arginine vasopressin) by removing the inhibitory effect of prostaglandins. The ensuing decrease in water excretion, which has been demonstrated in athletes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/exercise-associated-hyponatremia/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>], could promote the development of hyponatremia. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nsaids-electrolyte-complications#H4\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;NSAIDs: Electrolyte complications&quot;, section on 'Hyponatremia'</a> and <a href=\"#H11\" class=\"local\">'Sweat sodium loss'</a> below.)</p><p>Longer races may be associated with an increased risk of hyponatremia independent of other factors. In a study of 47 runners completing a 161 km mountain race, 30 percent had a serum sodium less than 135 <span class=\"nowrap\">mEq/L</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/exercise-associated-hyponatremia/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. A gain in weight, longer race time, and user of NSAIDs did not predict the development of hyponatremia.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h1\">PATHOGENESIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Increased fluid intake is necessary but is not the sole explanation for many if not most cases of EAH [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/exercise-associated-hyponatremia/abstract/2,26\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,26</a>]. The other major factor is impaired urinary water excretion due to persistent secretion of antidiuretic hormone (ADH, also called arginine vasopressin). Other proposed mechanisms of hyponatremia include a failure to mobilize exchangeable sodium stores and sodium losses in sweat [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/exercise-associated-hyponatremia/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H264938073\"><span class=\"h2\">Increased fluid intake</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>As noted above, increased fluid intake appears to be the primary risk factor for EAH. Another source of water is the breakdown of glycogen during exercise since glycogen associates with &quot;bound&quot; water [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/exercise-associated-hyponatremia/abstract/31,32\" class=\"abstract_t\">31,32</a>]. This release of water would not lead to weight gain.</p><p>Despite the water load, individuals on a regular diet who have normal renal function have a maximum water excretory capacity that, depending upon diet, can exceed 500 to 1000 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/hour</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/exercise-associated-hyponatremia/abstract/2,33\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,33</a>]. When one adds sweat and insensible fluid losses, which may be as high as 500 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/hour</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/exercise-associated-hyponatremia/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>], athletes should be able to consume as much as 1000 to 1500 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/hour</span> before retaining fluid and becoming hyponatremic. Based upon these calculations, it has been suggested that endurance athletes should not drink more than 1500 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/hour</span> of fluid during a race [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/exercise-associated-hyponatremia/abstract/34,35\" class=\"abstract_t\">34,35</a>].</p><p>Because of the high rate of water loss, water loading alone is not likely to produce more than a modest reduction in serum sodium in most endurance athletes. This was shown in the review of 2135 endurance athletes cited above: only 30 percent of athletes who gained weight during the race developed hyponatremia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/exercise-associated-hyponatremia/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h2\">Persistent secretion of ADH</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Hyponatremia due to water loading alone should suppress the release of ADH (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEPH%2F65195\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef65195 \">figure 1</a>), leading to a maximally dilute urine with a urine osmolality as low as 30 to 50 <span class=\"nowrap\">mosmol/kg</span> in healthy individuals and a urine output that can exceed 500 to 1000 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/hour</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/exercise-associated-hyponatremia/abstract/2,33\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,33</a>]. Failure to suppress ADH release can markedly reduce water excretory capacity. As an example, low-level persistence of ADH that results in a urine osmolality of 150 <span class=\"nowrap\">mosmol/kg,</span> which is still hypotonic to plasma, diminishes the rate of water excretion by two-thirds compared with a urine osmolality of 50 <span class=\"nowrap\">mosmol/kg</span>. This is particularly important when there is a marked increase in water intake [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/exercise-associated-hyponatremia/abstract/2,26\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,26</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=general-principles-of-disorders-of-water-balance-hyponatremia-and-hypernatremia-and-sodium-balance-hypovolemia-and-edema#H96014898\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;General principles of disorders of water balance (hyponatremia and hypernatremia) and sodium balance (hypovolemia and edema)&quot;, section on 'Regulation of plasma tonicity'</a>.)</p><p>The available data suggest that many patients with EAH have submaximal suppression of ADH secretion, an inappropriately high urine osmolality, and fulfill the criteria for the syndrome of inappropriate ADH secretion (SIADH) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/exercise-associated-hyponatremia/abstract/8,26,27,35-39\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,26,27,35-39</a>].

Among 16 athletes with EAH after the 2004 Boston Marathon, seven had persistent secretion of ADH. In two runners with severe EAH at other marathons who collapsed and were unresponsive, the urine osmolality was inappropriately high (329 and 121 <span class=\"nowrap\">mosmol/kg)</span> and the urine sodium concentration was 81 and 25 <span class=\"nowrap\">mEq/L,</span> findings that are consistent with SIADH.</p><p>There are a number of nonosmotic mechanisms by which ADH secretion might be inappropriately stimulated in endurance athletes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/exercise-associated-hyponatremia/abstract/26,37\" class=\"abstract_t\">26,37</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Intense exercise itself [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/exercise-associated-hyponatremia/abstract/40-42\" class=\"abstract_t\">40-42</a>]</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Nausea <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> vomiting [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/exercise-associated-hyponatremia/abstract/43\" class=\"abstract_t\">43</a>]</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Hypoglycemia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/exercise-associated-hyponatremia/abstract/44,45\" class=\"abstract_t\">44,45</a>]</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Nonspecific stresses such as pain and emotion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/exercise-associated-hyponatremia/abstract/46\" class=\"abstract_t\">46</a>]</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The release of muscle-derived interleukin-6 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/exercise-associated-hyponatremia/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]</p><p/><p>In addition to inappropriate ADH release, endurance athletes may develop what has been called appropriate ADH release due, for example, to hypovolemia resulting from sodium loss in sweat (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEPH%2F58012\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef58012 \">figure 2</a>). (See <a href=\"#H11\" class=\"local\">'Sweat sodium loss'</a> below and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=general-principles-of-disorders-of-water-balance-hyponatremia-and-hypernatremia-and-sodium-balance-hypovolemia-and-edema#H165025668\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;General principles of disorders of water balance (hyponatremia and hypernatremia) and sodium balance (hypovolemia and edema)&quot;, section on 'Role of ADH in volume regulation'</a>.)</p><p>The most comprehensive study of ADH metabolism in endurance athletes evaluated 82 ultramarathon (35 miles, 56 km) runners who ran for a mean of six hours [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/exercise-associated-hyponatremia/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>]. With ad libitum fluid intake, the plasma sodium was maintained (139.3 versus 138.1 <span class=\"nowrap\">mEq/L</span> at baseline and the end of the race, respectively). Plasma ADH was elevated 3.9-fold at the end of the race, which could be explained at least in part by a mean 3.8 kg weight loss and an 8.5 percent reduction in plasma volume. There was also increased release of other hormones such as oxytocin and, despite the fall in plasma volume, N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide. Whether these hormonal changes contributed to ADH release could not be determined. A similar study performed in 33 endurance cyclists participating in a 109 km race also documented nonosmotic ADH secretion after roughly five hours of cycling [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/exercise-associated-hyponatremia/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>].</p><p>The applicability of these findings to EAH is uncertain since, as noted above, EAH primarily occurs in endurance athletes who gain weight during the event and would therefore be unlikely to have a hypovolemic stimulus to ADH release [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/exercise-associated-hyponatremia/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>]. The exact nonosmotic stimulus to ADH secretion is unclear [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/exercise-associated-hyponatremia/abstract/47\" class=\"abstract_t\">47</a>], but these field investigations suggest that the potential for nonosmotic ADH stimuli during competitive long-distance exercise is higher than previously noted in well-controlled laboratory settings [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/exercise-associated-hyponatremia/abstract/48,49\" class=\"abstract_t\">48,49</a>]. Overall, hyponatremia, particularly severe hyponatremia, is rare in athletes who lose weight during the event [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/exercise-associated-hyponatremia/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].

In some cases, the amount of fluid retained was too small to reduce the serum sodium below 135 <span class=\"nowrap\">mEq/L</span>. It is also possible that, when the serum sodium was measured at the end of the race, some ingested water had not yet been absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract, contributing to weight gain without lowering the serum sodium concentration.</p><p>A third possible mechanism for maintenance of normonatremia despite the weight gain is the release of sodium from internal stores [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/exercise-associated-hyponatremia/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Up to 25 percent of body sodium is bound in bone and, although not osmotically active, is potentially recruitable into an osmotically active form [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/exercise-associated-hyponatremia/abstract/50,51\" class=\"abstract_t\">50,51</a>]. In theory, this pool could minimize the fall in serum sodium induced by overhydration.</p><p>The issue of recruiting osmotically active sodium from internal, not osmotically active sources, was addressed in a review of 18 athletes who were hospitalized for encephalopathy due to EAH [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/exercise-associated-hyponatremia/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Sodium and water balance was estimated at the time of admission and measured during recovery in the hospital. At the time of admission, the predicted serum sodium based upon electrolyte and water balance estimates was higher than the actual measured concentration in 14 athletes, suggesting exchange of sodium from an osmotically active to inactive state, and worsening of rather than protection against hyponatremia. During recovery, eight of the athletes showed evidence of osmotic activation of sodium (ie, the increase in serum sodium was more than could be explained by measured values of sodium and water balance), while 10 showed evidence of osmotic inactivation of sodium (ie, the increase in serum sodium was less than could be explained by measured values of sodium and water balance).</p><p>These disparate findings are difficult to explain physiologically, and the following factors could contribute to the observed findings without invoking osmotic activation or inactivation of internally exchangeable sodium:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Absorption of ingested water still in the gastrointestinal tract would lower the serum sodium without a change in weight, falsely suggesting osmotic inactivation. There is some evidence of delayed gastric emptying during exercise [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/exercise-associated-hyponatremia/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The breakdown of glycogen into smaller, more osmotically active molecules (such as lactate) during exercise can increase the cell osmolality, thereby causing the osmotic movement of water into the cells and raising the serum sodium [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/exercise-associated-hyponatremia/abstract/52\" class=\"abstract_t\">52</a>]. This effect reverses within five minutes after the cessation of exertion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/exercise-associated-hyponatremia/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Changes in potassium balance, which were not measured, could have influenced the serum sodium concentration without affecting body weight.

The concentration of sodium in sweat ranges from 15 to 65 <span class=\"nowrap\">mEq/L</span>. Compared with the general population, fit athletes generally have a lower sweat sodium concentration [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/exercise-associated-hyponatremia/abstract/53,54\" class=\"abstract_t\">53,54</a>], a higher rate of sweat production in proportion to the degree of fitness [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/exercise-associated-hyponatremia/abstract/55,56\" class=\"abstract_t\">55,56</a>], and an earlier onset of sweating [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/exercise-associated-hyponatremia/abstract/57\" class=\"abstract_t\">57</a>]. The sweat rate during exercise is primarily determined by the increase in metabolic rate; thus, for athletes of the same body weight, the sweat rate will be higher in those who run faster. By contrast, nonfit athletes, who are at greatest risk of EAH, tend to be heavier and may have a similar rate of sweat loss even though they run more slowly than the thinner fit athletes.</p><p>The direct effect of losing hypotonic sweat would be to raise the serum sodium. However, sweat loss could contribute to the development of hyponatremia if the degree of fluid loss were sufficient to produce significant volume depletion, providing a hypovolemic stimulus to ADH release, which, as described above, would impair excretion of ingested water.</p><p>The contribution of sweat-induced hypovolemia sufficient to increase ADH release is probably small in endurance athletes based upon the following observations:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In the review of 2135 endurance athletes cited above, only 3.5 percent of those athletes who lost more than 3 kg during the race (which would have been due in part to sweating) had a serum sodium between 129 and 135 <span class=\"nowrap\">mEq/L</span> at the end of the race and no athlete had a serum sodium below 129 <span class=\"nowrap\">mEq/L</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/exercise-associated-hyponatremia/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].

By comparison, the presence of EAH should <strong>not</strong> be assumed in collapsed athletes without measurement of the serum or plasma sodium since hyponatremia is present in only a small proportion of these individuals [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/exercise-associated-hyponatremia/abstract/23,27,64\" class=\"abstract_t\">23,27,64</a>].

In such patients, an oral or intravenous bolus of hypertonic saline is without harm and has potential benefit, particularly if symptoms seem to be progressing. We would <strong>not</strong> give hypertonic saline if the plasma or serum sodium cannot be measured, since similar symptoms can occur with hypernatremia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/exercise-associated-hyponatremia/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>], which would be exacerbated by hypertonic saline, and, as noted above, hypernatremia is more common than hyponatremia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/exercise-associated-hyponatremia/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].

Six were treated with hypertonic (3 percent) saline; all recovered and were well at 3 to 24 month follow-up. One patient died; this patient was not suspected of having hyponatremia, and therefore was not treated with hypertonic saline. An important observation in this report is that noncardiogenic pulmonary edema is <strong>not</strong> a contraindication to hypertonic saline administration in patients with hyponatremic encephalopathy.</p><p>The 2015 Third International Exercise-Associated Hyponatremia Consensus Development Conference and others recommend that athletes with hyponatremic encephalopathy (eg, seizures, confusion, coma) and athletes with compatible symptoms (if the plasma or serum sodium cannot be measured) be immediately treated with a 100 mL bolus of 3 percent saline [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/exercise-associated-hyponatremia/abstract/8,68,70\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,68,70</a>].

(See <a href=\"#H9\" class=\"local\">'Persistent secretion of ADH'</a> above.)</p><p>A potential diagnostic problem in patients who have had seizures is that persistent neurologic symptoms may reflect a postictal state rather than persistent hyponatremic encephalopathy.

In a series of six patients with hyponatremic encephalopathy who were treated with hypertonic saline, the serum sodium increased by 10 <span class=\"nowrap\">mEq/L</span> in less than 12 hours, a rate of correction greater than recommended for chronic hyponatremia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/exercise-associated-hyponatremia/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. In another reported case of EAH with encephalopathy, hypertonic saline therapy was associated with a 13 <span class=\"nowrap\">mEq/L</span> elevation in the serum sodium in 8.5 hours without the development of osmotic demyelination [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/exercise-associated-hyponatremia/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>].

The reported incidence of hypernatremia (serum sodium &gt;145 <span class=\"nowrap\">mEq/L)</span> was 13 percent in a review of 2135 endurance athletes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/exercise-associated-hyponatremia/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>], 28 percent in a series of 1319 collapsed marathon runners [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/exercise-associated-hyponatremia/abstract/63\" class=\"abstract_t\">63</a>], and 54 percent of ultramarathon runners competing in a multistage race [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/exercise-associated-hyponatremia/abstract/64\" class=\"abstract_t\">64</a>].</p><p>Treatment consists of the administration of hypotonic fluid to lower the serum sodium. Since hypernatremia stimulates thirst, such athletes can replace the water deficit by drinking.

Given the wide variation in sweat production and renal water excretory capacity both between individual athletes and in the same individual depending upon ambient conditions during the race, universal guidelines for prevention are not feasible [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/exercise-associated-hyponatremia/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].</p><p>In most settings, the regulatory system surrounding the maintenance of plasma sodium is so efficient that the plasma osmolality is maintained within a range of 1 to 2 percent despite wide variations in sodium and water intake. This depends upon an intact thirst mechanism and appropriate regulation of antidiuretic hormone (ADH) release.

Thus, the risk of EAH would still be present.</p><p>We agree with the recommendations from the 2015 Third International Exercise-Associated Hyponatremia Consensus Development Conference, which concluded that endurance athletes should <strong>drink according to thirst</strong> during the race [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/exercise-associated-hyponatremia/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. A prospective study in eight female marathon runners found that such an approach replaced most of the sweat losses with no evidence of overhydration [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/exercise-associated-hyponatremia/abstract/71\" class=\"abstract_t\">71</a>].</p><p>One method that has been used in an attempt to limit excessive water intake is to have fewer water stations. In the 2002 City of Christchurch marathon, aggressive hydration was not promoted and there were fewer hydration stations (every 5 versus 1.6 km) than in the 2002 Boston Marathon [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/exercise-associated-hyponatremia/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. There were no cases of hyponatremia among 134 runners who finished the race compared to an incidence of 13 percent in the Boston Marathon [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/exercise-associated-hyponatremia/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. For Ironman distance triathlons, hydration stations every 2.5 km when running and every 20 km when cycling have been recommended in addition to education about fluid intake [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/exercise-associated-hyponatremia/abstract/8,72\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,72</a>].</p><p>Two additional recommendations have been proposed:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Onsite analysis of serum or plasma sodium should be available in medical facilities at endurance events [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/exercise-associated-hyponatremia/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Use of the USA Track and Field (USATF) guidelines [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/exercise-associated-hyponatremia/abstract/73\" class=\"abstract_t\">73</a>], or other methods, to estimate hourly sweat losses during exercise and to avoid consuming fluid at greater rates during endurance events. This can be facilitated by serial measurements of body weight during and after exercise in a variety of conditions with a goal of maintenance of or a slight reduction in body weight.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">However, the results during training may not be replicated during the race when ADH secretion may not be suppressed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/exercise-associated-hyponatremia/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>], and may be less likely to be followed by casual athletes who are at higher risk of hyponatremia (eg, race time greater than four hours was a significant risk factor in the 2002 Boston Marathon) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/exercise-associated-hyponatremia/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Furthermore, the body protects the plasma sodium, not body weight, during exercise, and drinking according to thirst appears to provide sufficient protection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/exercise-associated-hyponatremia/abstract/8,74\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,74</a>].</p><p/><p>The American College of Sports Medicine (ACSM) has recommended an intake of 500 to 700 mg of sodium (22 to 30 mEq) per liter of water ingested as the appropriate level of sodium intake to replace the sodium lost in sweat during endurance events [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/exercise-associated-hyponatremia/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>]. However, there is insufficient evidence that ingestion of sodium prevents or decreases the risk of EAH [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/exercise-associated-hyponatremia/abstract/75,76\" class=\"abstract_t\">75,76</a>], and consumption of <span class=\"nowrap\">carbohydrate/electrolyte-containing</span> sports drinks does not provide much protection, since most of these drinks are markedly hypotonic to plasma, although they contain roughly the same concentration of cation (sodium plus potassium) as recommended by the ACSM [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/exercise-associated-hyponatremia/abstract/1,8,28\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,8,28</a>].

The incidence of EAH in such events was 6 percent in a large review but has varied among individual studies, ranging from 0 to 51 percent. (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Incidence'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The major risk factor for EAH is a high rate of fluid consumption during and after exercise that is typically associated with weight gain compared with the pre-race weight. Other independent risk factors include longer race time (or the related variable of slower training pace), low body mass index, and in some studies, the use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. (See <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Risk factors'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Fluid intake in excess of fluid loss is the primary pathogenic mechanism underlying EAH. Although excessive fluid consumption is necessary, it is not the sole explanation in many cases of EAH. The other major factor is impaired urinary water excretion due to persistent secretion of antidiuretic hormone (ADH). (See <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'Pathogenesis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The majority of hyponatremic athletes are asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic, with manifestations such as weakness, dizziness, headache, nausea, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> vomiting. These athletes usually have serum sodium concentrations ranging from 128 to 134 <span class=\"nowrap\">mEq/L</span>. Severe manifestations of seizures, obtundation, and coma occur primarily in athletes with a serum sodium concentration &le;132 <span class=\"nowrap\">mEq/L</span>. (See <a href=\"#H12\" class=\"local\">'Clinical manifestations'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We recommend direct measurement of the serum or plasma sodium in any endurance athlete with signs or symptoms compatible with hyponatremic encephalopathy, including seizures, obtundation, and coma. If the sodium concentration cannot be measured at an endurance event, a presumptive diagnosis of EAH can be made if an athlete presents with severe central nervous system manifestations consistent with acute hyponatremia in the absence of an obvious alternative etiology. (See <a href=\"#H14\" class=\"local\">'Diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The presence of EAH should <strong>not</strong> be assumed in the &quot;collapsed athlete&quot; without measurement of the serum or plasma sodium, since hyponatremia is present in only a small proportion of these individuals and hypernatremia is more common and would be made worse with hypertonic saline therapy. (See <a href=\"#H13\" class=\"local\">'The collapsed athlete'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Treatment recommendations are based upon the limited data from small, uncontrolled case series, our current understanding of the pathogenesis of hyponatremia, and the treatment of hyponatremia in other settings. (See <a href=\"#H16\" class=\"local\">'General principles'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Among athletes with hyponatremia and <strong>mild to moderate</strong> symptoms due to EAH (such as weakness, dizziness, headache, nausea, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> vomiting), we recommend oral hypertonic saline solutions or fluid restriction and observation until the onset of a spontaneous diuresis rather than administering intravenous hypertonic saline (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=3\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1C</a>). This will correct the hyponatremia and lead to resolution of the symptoms. (See <a href=\"#H17\" class=\"local\">'Mild to moderate symptoms'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Among athletes with hyponatremia and mild to moderate symptoms due to EAH that seem to be worsening, an oral or intravenous bolus of 100 mL of hypertonic saline (intravenous or oral) is potentially beneficial and without potential harm. We would <strong>not</strong> give hypertonic saline if the plasma or serum sodium cannot be measured, and if signs and symptoms are not life threatening, since hypernatremia is more common than hyponatremia in endurance athletes. (See <a href=\"#H17\" class=\"local\">'Mild to moderate symptoms'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Among athletes with hyponatremia and <strong>severe</strong> central nervous system manifestations of hyponatremic encephalopathy (eg, seizures, confusion, coma), we recommend the following:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Hypertonic saline should be administered by experienced medical personnel in the field (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=2\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1B</a>). (See <a href=\"#H18\" class=\"local\">'Severe symptoms'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>We suggest an initial bolus of 100 mL of hypertonic (3 percent) saline, which should raise the serum sodium by 2 to 3 <span class=\"nowrap\">mEq/L</span> (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). (See <a href=\"#H19\" class=\"local\">'Use of hypertonic saline'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>If the serum or plasma sodium cannot be measured on site, we suggest that this regimen be given empirically by experienced medical personnel to athletes with symptoms compatible with hyponatremic encephalopathy (eg, seizures, confusion, coma) and no other obvious cause (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>All athletes with severe symptomatic hyponatremia should be promptly transported to a hospital for further evaluation and treatment.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Repeat boluses can be given to stabilize the patient prior to arrival at the hospital <strong>only</strong> if the plasma or serum sodium has been measured.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Intravenous isotonic saline is not necessary in most patients and may <strong>worsen</strong> the hyponatremia. (See <a href=\"#H16\" class=\"local\">'General principles'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Prevention of EAH has focused upon education concerning the risks of the overconsumption of fluids during the event. Universal guidelines for prevention are difficult since there are wide variations in sweat production and renal water excretory capacity both between individual athletes and in the same individual depending upon ambient conditions during the race. We recommend that, during the race, endurance athletes <strong>drink</strong> <strong>according to thirst</strong> (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=3\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1C</a>). (See <a href=\"#H22\" class=\"local\">'Prevention'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Consumption of <span class=\"nowrap\">carbohydrate/electrolyte-containing</span> sports drinks does <strong>not</strong> provide much protection compared to water alone, since most of these drinks are markedly hypotonic to plasma.
