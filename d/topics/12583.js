It is most commonly characterized morphologically by extensive crescent formation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-classification-and-treatment-of-rapidly-progressive-crescentic-glomerulonephritis/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. This histologic finding is a common finding in the older adult presenting with acute nephritis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-classification-and-treatment-of-rapidly-progressive-crescentic-glomerulonephritis/abstract/2,3\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,3</a>].</p><p>The severity of the disease is in part related to the degree of crescent formation: patients with circumferential crescents in more than 80 percent of the glomeruli tend to present with advanced renal failure that may not respond well to therapy (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEPH%2F68861%7ENEPH%2F76472%7ENEPH%2F63060%7ENEPH%2F57096%7ENEPH%2F78020\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef68861 graphicRef76472 graphicRef63060 graphicRef57096 graphicRef78020 \">picture 1A-E</a>). By comparison, patients with crescents in less than 50 percent of the glomeruli, particularly if the crescents are noncircumferential, typically follow a more indolent course and may even undergo a remission [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-classification-and-treatment-of-rapidly-progressive-crescentic-glomerulonephritis/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">PATHOGENESIS OF CRESCENT FORMATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Crescent formation appears to represent a nonspecific response to severe injury to the glomerular capillary wall [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-classification-and-treatment-of-rapidly-progressive-crescentic-glomerulonephritis/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. Rents are induced in the glomerular capillary wall, resulting in the movement of plasma products, including fibrinogen, into Bowman's space with subsequent fibrin formation, the influx of macrophages and T cells, and the release of proinflammatory cytokines, such as interleukin-1 and tumor necrosis factor-alpha [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-classification-and-treatment-of-rapidly-progressive-crescentic-glomerulonephritis/abstract/6,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,7</a>]. Thus, crescents may be seen with any form of severe glomerular disease, including lupus nephritis and postinfectious glomerulonephritis, disorders that can usually be diagnosed from the history and typical immunofluorescence and electron microscopic findings. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=mechanisms-of-glomerular-crescent-formation\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Mechanisms of glomerular crescent formation&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The stage of active inflammation is often followed by the development of fibrocellular and fibrous crescents [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-classification-and-treatment-of-rapidly-progressive-crescentic-glomerulonephritis/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. Collagen deposition is due to fibroblast proliferation that is driven by fibroblast growth factors. Transforming growth factor-beta is also thought to play an important role. This transition is important clinically because fibrous crescents represent a stage of the disease that is not likely to respond to immunosuppressive therapy.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">TYPES OF CRESCENTIC GN</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The term RPGN refers to crescentic glomerulonephritis that is usually due to one of three broad mechanisms of glomerular injury [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-classification-and-treatment-of-rapidly-progressive-crescentic-glomerulonephritis/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]:</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Anti-GBM antibody disease</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The pathogenesis, diagnosis, and treatment of this disorder are discussed separately.

In most cases, the serologic and histologic findings will point to the underlying disease, such as mesangial IgA deposits in IgA nephropathy, antistreptococcal antibodies and subepithelial humps in postinfectious glomerulonephritis, antinuclear antibodies, a &quot;full house&quot; immunofluorescence staining for IgG, IgA, IgM, C3 and C1q, mesangial plus subendothelial deposits in lupus nephritis, and circulating cryoglobulins and intraluminal &quot;thrombi&quot; in mixed cryoglobulinemia.</p><p>Crescent formation can also rarely be superimposed upon underlying membranous nephropathy. The mechanism of crescent formation remains unclear, but some patients are antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (ANCA) positive. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=causes-and-diagnosis-of-membranous-nephropathy#H22\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Causes and diagnosis of membranous nephropathy&quot;, section on 'Crescentic glomerulonephritis'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Pauci-immune</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Pauci-immune RPGN refers to a necrotizing glomerulonephritis in which there are few or no immune deposits by immunofluorescence or electron microscopy. The majority of patients with renal-limited vasculitis are ANCA positive, and many have or will develop the systemic symptoms of granulomatosis with polyangiitis (GPA) or microscopic polyangiitis (MPA) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-classification-and-treatment-of-rapidly-progressive-crescentic-glomerulonephritis/abstract/8,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,9</a>]. Patients with ANCA-negative, pauci-immune RPGN are considered part of this spectrum, and may have similar clinical features, renal biopsy findings, and prognosis. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-granulomatosis-with-polyangiitis-and-microscopic-polyangiitis#H11698559\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of granulomatosis with polyangiitis and microscopic polyangiitis&quot;, section on 'Renal manifestations'</a>.)</p><p>Some studies suggest that autoantibodies directed against lysosome-associated membrane protein 2 (LAMP-2) may be present in over 90 percent of ANCA-positive patients with pauci-immune necrotizing RPGN, as well as in patients with ANCA-negative pauci-immune glomerulonephritis. Others have been unable to confirm this result. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pathogenesis-of-granulomatosis-with-polyangiitis-and-related-vasculitides\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pathogenesis of granulomatosis with polyangiitis and related vasculitides&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Some patients with pauci-immune RPGN have scattered small immune deposits in the mesangium and glomerular capillary wall. In the proper clinical setting with a positive ANCA, this finding does not preclude the diagnosis of pauci-immune RPGN.</p><p>The pathogenesis, diagnosis, and treatment of this condition are also discussed separately. Some cases of ANCA-positive disease are induced by drugs (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=propylthiouracil-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">propylthiouracil</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hydralazine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">hydralazine</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=allopurinol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">allopurinol</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=penicillamine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">penicillamine</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=minocycline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">minocycline</a>). Most such patients are MPO-ANCA positive, but some are both high-titer MPO and PR3 positive (as seen with hydralazine). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=initial-immunosuppressive-therapy-in-granulomatosis-with-polyangiitis-and-microscopic-polyangiitis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Initial immunosuppressive therapy in granulomatosis with polyangiitis and microscopic polyangiitis&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-spectrum-of-antineutrophil-cytoplasmic-autoantibodies\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical spectrum of antineutrophil cytoplasmic autoantibodies&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Some patients have features of both ANCA-positive RPGN and anti-GBM disease. This has also been called &quot;double-antibody&quot; positive disease. Other ANCA-positive RPGN patients will have positive antinuclear antibody or other positive lupus serology.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Idiopathic</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The term idiopathic RPGN is applied to two settings: an immune complex disease that does not fit into any of the identifiable categories, and a pauci-immune disease that is ANCA negative. The former is rare [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-classification-and-treatment-of-rapidly-progressive-crescentic-glomerulonephritis/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>], while the latter accounts for less than 5 percent of cases of crescentic GN.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL PRESENTATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The presenting complaints in RPGN may be similar to those in severe postinfectious glomerulonephritis: the acute onset of macroscopic hematuria, decreased urine output, hypertension, and edema. More commonly, however, RPGN has an insidious onset with the initial symptoms being fatigue or edema [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-classification-and-treatment-of-rapidly-progressive-crescentic-glomerulonephritis/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p>Renal insufficiency is present at diagnosis in almost all cases, with the plasma creatinine concentration often exceeding 3 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> (264 <span class=\"nowrap\">micromol/L)</span>. The urinalysis typically reveals dysmorphic hematuria, red cell and other casts, and a variable degree of proteinuria. The marked reduction in glomerular filtration rate usually limits the rate of protein filtration; the nephrotic syndrome is unusual and is most likely to occur in patients with less severe renal insufficiency [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-classification-and-treatment-of-rapidly-progressive-crescentic-glomerulonephritis/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. Occasional patients have no hematuria [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-classification-and-treatment-of-rapidly-progressive-crescentic-glomerulonephritis/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. Why this occurs is not well understood but the absence of hematuria has also been described in other types of glomerulonephritis. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diagnosis-and-classification-of-renal-disease-in-systemic-lupus-erythematosus#H17\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Diagnosis and classification of renal disease in systemic lupus erythematosus&quot;, section on 'Silent lupus nephritis'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=glomerular-disease-evaluation-and-differential-diagnosis-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Glomerular disease: Evaluation and differential diagnosis in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Systemic complaints, including extrarenal organ involvement, are common in patients with pauci-immune RPGN. Although not observed in all studies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-classification-and-treatment-of-rapidly-progressive-crescentic-glomerulonephritis/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>], most reports have found a similar incidence of systemic complaints in those with or without ANCA. One retrospective study, for example, evaluated the presentation and outcome in 141 patients with pauci-immune RPGN, of whom 27 percent were ANCA negative [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-classification-and-treatment-of-rapidly-progressive-crescentic-glomerulonephritis/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. Other than a higher incidence of upper airway disease in ANCA-positive patients (60 versus 19 percent), a similar percentage of ANCA-negative and -positive patients with RPGN presented with involvement of the lower airway, musculoskeletal system, skin, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> nervous system. These findings, as well as the observation that some patients with apparent antibody-negative RPGN later develop the characteristic pulmonary manifestations of ANCA-positive disease (eg, upper airway involvement) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-classification-and-treatment-of-rapidly-progressive-crescentic-glomerulonephritis/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>], strongly suggest that antibody-negative RPGN is pathogenetically part of the ANCA-positive disorders [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-classification-and-treatment-of-rapidly-progressive-crescentic-glomerulonephritis/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>].</p><p>The relative severity of disease at presentation tends to vary with the underlying cause. At the University of North Carolina, for example, the average plasma creatinine concentration and the proportion with &gt;50 percent glomerular crescents at the time of diagnosis were [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-classification-and-treatment-of-rapidly-progressive-crescentic-glomerulonephritis/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>9.7 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> (857 <span class=\"nowrap\">micromol/L)</span> and 85 percent for anti-GBM antibody disease, respectively</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>6.5 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> (575 <span class=\"nowrap\">micromol/L)</span> and 50 percent for ANCA-positive disease, respectively</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>4.9 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> (433 <span class=\"nowrap\">micromol/L)</span> and &lt;13 percent for immune complex crescentic disease, respectively</p><p/><p>Patients with anti-GBM antibody disease may also have pulmonary hemorrhage and hemoptysis due to antibodies directed against the alveolar basement membranes. The bleeding may occur over a prolonged period, leading to anemia and iron deficiency. Although the combination of glomerulonephritis and hemoptysis should suggest this disorder, similar findings can be seen in other causes of RPGN including granulomatosis with polyangiitis (GPA), which is more common and in which there is also direct lung involvement, crescentic lupus nephritis, and any glomerular disease complicated by marked fluid overload and pulmonary edema. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=glomerular-disease-evaluation-and-differential-diagnosis-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Glomerular disease: Evaluation and differential diagnosis in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h1\">EVALUATION AND DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>An accurate and urgent diagnosis is essential in the patient presenting with clinical findings suggestive of RPGN. Patients should undergo appropriate serologic tests (ordered on a stat or rush basis) and, when indicated, a renal biopsy. Serologic tests include ANCA, anti-GBM antibodies, complement component assays, antinuclear antibodies, and others as indicated from the clinical history, examination, and biopsy results. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-spectrum-of-antineutrophil-cytoplasmic-autoantibodies\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical spectrum of antineutrophil cytoplasmic autoantibodies&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pathogenesis-and-diagnosis-of-anti-gbm-antibody-goodpastures-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pathogenesis and diagnosis of anti-GBM antibody (Goodpasture's) disease&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h1\">TREATMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Untreated RPGN typically progresses to end-stage renal disease over a period of weeks to a few months. However, patients with fewer crescents may have a more protracted, not so rapidly progressive course [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-classification-and-treatment-of-rapidly-progressive-crescentic-glomerulonephritis/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].</p><p>Many of the older studies examining treatment in RPGN with pulse corticosteroids, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cyclophosphamide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cyclophosphamide</a>, and plasmapheresis are difficult to interpret because they were performed at a time before it was possible to distinguish among the different types of RPGN. Nevertheless, these studies demonstrated that conventional doses of oral <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prednisone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">prednisone</a>, given alone or in combination with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=azathioprine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">azathioprine</a>, usually had little beneficial effect [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-classification-and-treatment-of-rapidly-progressive-crescentic-glomerulonephritis/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p>As a result, the initial therapy of most patients with RPGN involves pulse <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methylprednisolone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">methylprednisolone</a> followed by daily oral <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prednisone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">prednisone</a>, oral or intravenous <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cyclophosphamide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cyclophosphamide</a> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=rituximab-intravenous-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">rituximab</a>, and, in some settings, plasmapheresis. Early diagnosis with renal biopsy and serologic testing and early initiation of appropriate therapy is essential to minimize the degree of irreversible renal injury.</p><p>Empiric therapy may be begun with the above modalities in patients with severe disease, particularly if either renal biopsy or interpretation of the biopsy will be delayed. Empiric initial therapy consists of intravenous pulse <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methylprednisolone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">methylprednisolone</a> (500 to 1000 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day</span> for three days) and consideration of plasmapheresis, especially if the patient has hemoptysis. This regimen will not alter the histologic abnormalities observed with a renal biopsy that is performed soon after initiating empiric therapy.</p><p>More specific therapy can be given once the diagnosis is established:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Anti-GBM disease.

Some patients are positive for both ANCA and anti-GBM antibodies.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14\"><span class=\"h2\">Clinical presentation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The presenting complaints in RPGN may be similar to those in severe postinfectious glomerulonephritis: the acute onset of macroscopic hematuria, decreased urine output, hypertension, and edema. More commonly, however, RPGN has an insidious onset with the initial symptoms being fatigue or edema.</p><p>Renal insufficiency is present at diagnosis in almost all cases. The urinalysis typically reveals hematuria, red cell and other casts, and a variable degree of proteinuria.</p><p>Patients with anti-GBM antibody disease may also have pulmonary hemorrhage and hemoptysis due to antibodies directed against the alveolar basement membranes. Similar findings can be seen in other causes of RPGN including granulomatosis with polyangiitis (GPA), microscopic polyangiitis (MPA), and lupus nephritis in which there is also direct lung involvement, and any glomerular disease complicated by marked fluid overload and pulmonary edema. Systemic complaints, including extrarenal organ involvement, are common in patients with pauci-immune RPGN, with or without ANCA positivity.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15\"><span class=\"h2\">Evaluation and diagnosis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>An accurate and urgent diagnosis is essential in the patient presenting with clinical findings suggestive of RPGN. Patients should undergo renal biopsy and appropriate serologic assays. These include ANCA, anti-GBM antibodies, antinuclear antibodies, and others as indicated from the biopsy results.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H16\"><span class=\"h2\">Therapy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Early diagnosis with renal biopsy and serologic testing and early initiation of appropriate therapy is essential to minimize the degree of irreversible renal injury. Empiric therapy may be begun in patients with severe disease, particularly if either renal biopsy or interpretation of the biopsy will be delayed.</p><p>Empiric initial therapy consists of intravenous pulse <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methylprednisolone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">methylprednisolone</a> (500 to 1000 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day</span> for three days), oral or intravenous <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cyclophosphamide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cyclophosphamide</a>, and consideration of plasmapheresis, especially if the patient has hemoptysis or anti-GBM antibody disease.
