It is estimated that 13 to 23 percent of people experience psychotic symptoms at some point in their lifetime, and 1 to 4 percent will meet criteria for a psychotic disorder [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-differential-diagnosis-and-initial-management-of-psychosis-in-adults/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>].</p><p>Psychotic symptoms can increase patients&rsquo; risk for harming themselves or others or being unable to meet their basic needs. Most clinicians will encounter patients with psychosis and will thus benefit from knowing how to recognize psychotic symptoms and make appropriate initial evaluation and management decisions. Other clinicians, particularly mental health specialists, will conduct a more thorough patient assessment, consider the patient&rsquo;s differential diagnosis, and determine the patient&rsquo;s diagnosis to guide long-term treatment.</p><p>This topic will characterize different types of psychotic symptoms, provide guidance for formulating a differential diagnosis, and suggest initial evaluation and management practices. Issues related to antipsychotic medications, the treatment of specific disorders, and psychosocial interventions are discussed separately.

They can be categorized as bizarre or non-bizarre based on their plausibility (eg, a belief that family members have been replaced by body-doubles is bizarre and a belief that a spouse is having an affair is non-bizarre). Frequently encountered types of delusions include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Persecutory delusions (eg, believing one is being followed and harassed by gangs)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Grandiose delusions (eg, believing one is a billionaire CEO who owns casinos around the world)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Erotomanic delusions (eg, believing a famous movie star is in love with them)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Somatic delusions (eg, believing one&rsquo;s sinuses have been infested by worms)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Delusions of reference (eg, believing dialogue on a television program is directed specifically towards the patient)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Delusions of control (eg, believing one&rsquo;s thoughts and movements are controlled by planetary overlords)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H261969380\"><span class=\"h2\">Hallucinations</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Hallucinations can be defined as wakeful sensory experiences of content that is not actually present. They are differentiated from illusions, which are distortions or misinterpretations of real sensory stimuli. While hallucinations can occur in any of the five sensory modalities, auditory hallucinations (eg, hearing voices) are the most common, followed by visual, tactile, olfactory, and gustatory hallucinations. Auditory hallucinations can present as speech (including spoken commands or a running commentary on the patient&rsquo;s actions) or other sounds. Visual hallucinations can range from recognizable objects to more unformed lights or shadows. Olfactory hallucinations are frequently of unpleasant odors.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H261969386\"><span class=\"h2\">Thought disorganization</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Evidence for thought disorganization is derived from patients&rsquo; patterns of speech during the interview. While disorganized speech is a frequently observed symptom in psychosis, it is nonspecific and can also be present in delirium or other neurological or cognitive disorders. Commonly observed forms of thought disorganization include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><span class=\"nowrap\">Alogia/poverty</span> of content &ndash; Very little information conveyed by speech</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Thought blocking &ndash; Suddenly losing train of thought, exhibited by abrupt interruption in speech</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Loosening of association &ndash; Speech content notable for ideas presented in sequence that are not closely related</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Tangentiality &ndash; Answers to interview questions diverging increasingly from topic being asked about (called circumstantiality if content eventually returns to original topic)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Clanging or clang association &ndash; Using words in a sentence that are linked by rhyming or phonetic similarity (eg, &ldquo;I fell down the well sell bell.&rdquo;)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Word salad &ndash; Real words are linked together incoherently, yielding nonsensical content</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Perseveration &ndash; Repeating words or ideas persistently, often even after interview topic has changed</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H261969392\"><span class=\"h2\">Agitation/aggression</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Agitation is an acute state of anxiety, heightened emotional arousal, and increased motor activity. Although not specific to psychosis, untreated psychosis is associated with an increased risk for agitation and aggressive behaviors. These can sometimes lead to intentional or unintentional bodily harm to self or others. Clinicians should observe the patient&rsquo;s behaviors, including body language and voice intonation, and use appropriate safety measures for the evaluation.

A thorough history, physical examination, mental status examination, and additional tests as indicated can help narrow the differential, rule out psychoses with treatable underlying causes, and guide the appropriate intervention or referral [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-differential-diagnosis-and-initial-management-of-psychosis-in-adults/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H261969404\"><span class=\"h2\">Primary psychiatric illnesses</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Psychiatric illnesses are generally classified by diagnostic criteria established by the DSM-5 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-differential-diagnosis-and-initial-management-of-psychosis-in-adults/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>] or the International Classification of Diseases (ICD, World Health Organization).

If the individual has never had psychotic symptoms without mood symptoms, the diagnosis will be major depressive disorder with psychotic features or bipolar disorder with psychotic features (depending on a history of manic symptoms). If the individual has an overlap of mood symptoms with psychosis for the majority (but not all) of the psychotic illness, schizoaffective disorder will be the likely diagnosis.</p><p>If there is a more limited overlap of psychosis and mood symptoms (either no overlap or overlap only for a minority of the illness duration), then brief psychotic disorder, schizophreniform disorder, schizophrenia, or delusional disorder would be possible diagnoses. The duration of the psychotic episode will differentiate between brief psychotic disorder (&lt;one month), schizophreniform disorder (one to six months), and schizophrenia (&gt;six months).</p><p>Delusional disorder would be considered if the psychotic symptoms are limited to delusions, functioning is not markedly impaired, and other symptoms and behaviors associated with schizophrenia are not present. Schizotypal personality disorder would be considered if there is no period of significant persistent psychotic symptoms and if there is a &ldquo;pervasive pattern of social and interpersonal deficits marked by acute discomfort with, and reduced capacity for, close relationships as well as by cognitive or perceptual distortions and eccentricities of behavior&rdquo; [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-differential-diagnosis-and-initial-management-of-psychosis-in-adults/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H261969460\"><span class=\"h1\">INITIAL MANAGEMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients with psychosis should be evaluated for agitation, risk of harm to themselves or others, and their ability to take care of themselves. Patients at risk of harm to themselves or others may need to be hospitalized. Management of agitated patients with psychosis is described in detail separately. A rapidly acting first-generation antipsychotic <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> a rapidly acting benzodiazepine are suggested to sedate severely agitated, potentially violent patients with psychosis.

Families or caregivers should be advised to reduce environmental stimulation, not argue with delusional ideas, and interact with psychotic patients in a calm and gentle manner.</p><p>We recommend symptomatic treatment of psychosis with an antipsychotic medication, even if the psychiatric disorder or medical condition underlying the psychosis has not yet been established. While antipsychotics have been most extensively studied in the treatment of schizophrenia, the medications appear to be broadly effective for psychotic symptoms. As examples, meta-analyses have found antipsychotics are effective in the treatment of psychotic mania in bipolar disorder [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-differential-diagnosis-and-initial-management-of-psychosis-in-adults/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>], major depressive disorder with psychotic features (when combined with an antidepressant) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-differential-diagnosis-and-initial-management-of-psychosis-in-adults/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>], delirium [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-differential-diagnosis-and-initial-management-of-psychosis-in-adults/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>], psychosis in Parkinson&rsquo;s disease (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=clozapine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">clozapine</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-differential-diagnosis-and-initial-management-of-psychosis-in-adults/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>], and psychosis of Alzheimer&rsquo;s disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-differential-diagnosis-and-initial-management-of-psychosis-in-adults/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>].

If the psychosis is associated with a general medical condition, antipsychotic therapy should be added to the appropriate treatment for the underlying condition.

Antipsychotics can reduce agitation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-differential-diagnosis-and-initial-management-of-psychosis-in-adults/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>] and may reduce suicide risk [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-differential-diagnosis-and-initial-management-of-psychosis-in-adults/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. The benefits of antipsychotics should, however, be weighed against their risks and possible side effects (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PSYCH%2F82533\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef82533 \">table 2</a>). Appropriate steps should be taken to mitigate risk (eg, performing baseline EKGs on older adult patients or those with cardiac history and considering possibility for antipsychotic-induced QTc prolongation). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pharmacotherapy-for-schizophrenia-acute-and-maintenance-phase-treatment#H2758642\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pharmacotherapy for schizophrenia: Acute and maintenance phase treatment&quot;, section on 'Drug efficacy'</a>.)</p><p>With the exception of&nbsp;<a href=\"topic.htm?path=clozapine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">clozapine</a>, which is used for treatment-resistant chronic psychosis, there is an absence of rigorous evidence that any one antipsychotic drug is more effective than other antipsychotics. The choice among antipsychotics is usually made on the basis of side effect profile, cost, and formulations available (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PSYCH%2F82533\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef82533 \">table 2</a>).</p><p>The dose of most antipsychotic drugs should be titrated from an initial dose to the therapeutic range, as described in the tables, as quickly as tolerated (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PSYCH%2F82533\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef82533 \">table 2</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PSYCH%2F60624\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef60624 \">table 3</a>). As an example, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=risperidone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">risperidone</a> can be started at 1 to 2 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day</span> and titrated to a therapeutic dose (typically 2 to 6 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day)</span>. If a satisfactory clinical response is not seen within seven days, the dose can be increased in 0.5 to 1 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day</span> increments to a maximum of 8 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day</span>. If there is no improvement in psychotic symptoms after two weeks of a therapeutic dose, a different antipsychotic should be considered. The recommended duration of antipsychotic therapy varies according to the underlying etiology: in chronic schizophrenia, antipsychotics should be offered indefinitely to reduce relapse risk [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-differential-diagnosis-and-initial-management-of-psychosis-in-adults/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]; with time-limited psychoses (such as delirium), antipsychotic therapy can be continued for two weeks after the resolution of symptoms and then tapered off gradually.

Evaluation and treatment for psychosis should be voluntary whenever possible, but the nature of the illness may lead patients to fear or avoid treatment. In most states, dangerousness to self or others, or the inability to provide for one's basic needs of food, clothing, and shelter, is sufficient cause for involuntary treatment. The legal mechanism for initiating this differs significantly by legal jurisdiction. Clinicians, especially those in emergency settings, should become familiar with involuntary treatment procedures within their legal jurisdictions. The local community mental health agency or the nearest psychiatric emergency service should be able to assist with information, legal forms, and other aid in arranging involuntary care.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"PATIENT_INFORMATION\"><span class=\"h1\">INFORMATION FOR PATIENTS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>UpToDate offers two types of patient education materials, &ldquo;The Basics&rdquo; and &ldquo;Beyond the Basics.&rdquo; The Basics patient education pieces are written in plain language, at the 5th to 6th grade reading level, and they answer the four or five key questions a patient might have about a given condition.
