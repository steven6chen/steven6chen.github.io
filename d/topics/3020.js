To accomplish the first goal, most patients with AF will require oral anticoagulation.(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=atrial-fibrillation-anticoagulant-therapy-to-prevent-embolization\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Atrial fibrillation: Anticoagulant therapy to prevent embolization&quot;</a>.) </p><p>With regard to the other two goals, they can be achieved with either a rhythm or a rate control strategy in most patients. The process for deciding between the two is discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=rhythm-control-versus-rate-control-in-atrial-fibrillation\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Rhythm control versus rate control in atrial fibrillation&quot;</a>.)</p><p>For patients in whom a rhythm control strategy is chosen, catheter ablation (CA) and antiarrhythmic drug therapy are the two principal interventions to reduce the frequency of or eliminate episodes of AF.

Thus, the principal efficacy outcome is symptom reduction by reducing atrial fibrillation (AF) burden. </p><p>Three categories of recurrent atrial arrhythmias should be considered when evaluating the efficacy of AF ablation procedures: early recurrence of AF, late recurrence of AF, and post-ablation atrial <span class=\"nowrap\">flutter/atrial</span> tachycardia. Each has distinct mechanisms and management implications [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/catheter-ablation-to-prevent-recurrent-atrial-fibrillation-clinical-applications/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p>Early recurrences of AF are defined as those that occur within the first two to three months after CA. This period is often referred to as the &quot;blanking period&quot; and is not included in studies examining the long-term success of AF ablation. Early recurrences occur as often as 40 percent of the time with radiofrequency ablation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/catheter-ablation-to-prevent-recurrent-atrial-fibrillation-clinical-applications/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>] and about 17 percent of the time for those treated with second generation cryoballoon [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/catheter-ablation-to-prevent-recurrent-atrial-fibrillation-clinical-applications/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. It is postulated to be related to several potential mechanisms including sterile pericarditis, recovered pulmonary vein (PV) conduction, or proarrhythmic effects of the ablation procedure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/catheter-ablation-to-prevent-recurrent-atrial-fibrillation-clinical-applications/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].</p><p>Some studies suggest that early recurrence appears to be a predictor of late recurrence, especially when the episodes occur late in the blanking period. However, most clinicians will treat early recurrences with antiarrhythmic drug therapy before consideration of repeat ablation in these patients.</p><p>Episodes of AF occurring after three months are considered to be recurrent AF and are referred to as late recurrent AF. The possible mechanisms for late recurrent AF following CA are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=mechanisms-of-atrial-fibrillation#H186292675\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Mechanisms of atrial fibrillation&quot;, section on 'Specific clinical situations'</a>.)</p><p>The frequency of late recurrent AF varies significantly in part due to factors such as the method and intensity of surveillance, whether other atrial arrhythmias are counted, components of the ablation technique used, whether patients require antiarrhythmic drug therapy, patient characteristics (paroxysmal or persistent AF), and, most importantly, the definition of success applied [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/catheter-ablation-to-prevent-recurrent-atrial-fibrillation-clinical-applications/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].

The total atrial arrhythmia burden was significantly reduced by 86 percent from a mean of 2.0 hours per day per patient before to 0.3 hours per day after. However, the ratio of asymptomatic to symptomatic episodes increased significantly after ablation from 1.1 to 3.7.

The mechanism is postulated to be extension of RF injury to the vagus nerve plexus surrounding the esophagus.

Firstly, inflammation is associated with the development of AF and a systemic as well as a local inflammatory response may result from radiofrequency ablation (RFA) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/catheter-ablation-to-prevent-recurrent-atrial-fibrillation-clinical-applications/abstract/82\" class=\"abstract_t\">82</a>].

Secondly, glucocorticoid prophylaxis reduces the risk of the development of perioperative AF in patients undergoing coronary artery bypass graft surgery. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=atrial-fibrillation-and-flutter-after-cardiac-surgery#H97330379\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Atrial fibrillation and flutter after cardiac surgery&quot;, section on 'Ineffective or possibly effective therapies'</a>.)<br/><br/>The possibility of benefit from prophylactic glucocorticoid therapy was evaluated in a study of 125 patients with paroxysmal AF who were randomly assigned to either three days of glucocorticoid therapy or placebo starting immediately after the procedure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/catheter-ablation-to-prevent-recurrent-atrial-fibrillation-clinical-applications/abstract/83\" class=\"abstract_t\">83</a>]. The rate of AF recurrence (primary end point) was significantly lower in the glucocorticoid group at one month (27 versus 49 percent), with most of the benefit occurring during the first three days (7 versus 31 percent). <br/><br/>We do not believe there is sufficient evidence to recommend the use of prophylactic glucocorticoid therapy.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><a href=\"topic.htm?path=colchicine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Colchicine</a> &ndash; Colchicine, another drug with antiinflammatory properties, has been shown to decrease the risk of postoperative AF after cardiac surgery, particularly in patients with the post-pericardiotomy syndrome. However, pending additional studies showing benefit, we do not use prophylactic colchicine. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=post-cardiac-injury-syndromes#H5921218\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Post-cardiac injury syndromes&quot;, section on 'Prevention'</a>.) <br/><br/>The potential ability of colchicine to reduce the incidence of early recurrent AF after pulmonary vein isolation was evaluated in a study of 206 individuals with paroxysmal AF who were randomly assigned to colchicine 0.5 mg twice daily or placebo beginning on the day of catheter ablation (CA) and continuing for three months [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/catheter-ablation-to-prevent-recurrent-atrial-fibrillation-clinical-applications/abstract/84\" class=\"abstract_t\">84</a>]. After follow-up of about 15 months, there was a lower recurrence rate of AF in patients taking colchicine (31.1 versus 49.5 percent; odds ratio 0.46, 95% CI 0.26-0.81). </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Angiotensin inhibition</strong> &ndash; The data are mixed as to whether angiotensin converting enzyme <span class=\"nowrap\">inhibitors/angiotensin</span> II receptor blockers reduce AF after CA procedures.

With the exception of implantable cardiac monitor or a pre-existing dual chamber pacemaker or implantable cardioverter-defibrillator with AF detection capabilities, these methods may underestimate the incidence of recurrence due to sampling error [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/catheter-ablation-to-prevent-recurrent-atrial-fibrillation-clinical-applications/abstract/89\" class=\"abstract_t\">89</a>]. In addition, as has been well demonstrated, patients with AF have a high rate of asymptomatic episodes.

Based upon the recurrence rates of AF after ablation, many patients are candidates for repeat ablation. We tell our patients that the success rate is in the range of 50 to 85 percent for a single procedure based primarily on AF type and anatomy and that about 20 percent of patients have at least a second procedure. Success rates after a second procedure can be as high as 90 percent. Some experts and some patients have agreed to repeat the procedure a third time. Patients with a history of persistent AF have a lower success rate and are less often felt to be good candidates for repeat procedures.</p><p>The issue of whether patients with AF recurrence should undergo a repeat procedure or be placed on antiarrhythmic drug therapy was addressed in a study that randomly assigned 154 patients with symptomatic, paroxysmal AF recurrence to either repeat ablation or antiarrhythmic drugs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/catheter-ablation-to-prevent-recurrent-atrial-fibrillation-clinical-applications/abstract/90\" class=\"abstract_t\">90</a>].
