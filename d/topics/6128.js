Differentiating gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), proton pump inhibitor-responsive esophageal eosinophilia (PPI-REE), and EoE is reviewed in greater detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-eosinophilic-esophagitis#H7\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of eosinophilic esophagitis&quot;, section on 'Distinction from GERD'</a>.)</p><p>The esophagus is normally devoid of eosinophils, although they are permanent residents in the rest of the gastrointestinal tract beginning during early embryonic development. Thus, the finding of esophageal eosinophils denotes pathology, typically EoE or GERD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/eosinophilic-esophagitis-eoe-genetics-and-immunopathogenesis/abstract/2,3\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,3</a>]. The diagnosis of EoE requires the presence of esophageal eosinophilia that is resistant to PPI therapy, but it is now appreciated that a substantial number of patients with esophageal eosinophilia can respond to PPI therapy. This entity is now referred to as PPI-responsive esophageal eosinophilia (PPI-REE) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/eosinophilic-esophagitis-eoe-genetics-and-immunopathogenesis/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].</p><p>Antigenic proteins, typically derived from food and less commonly from inhaled proteins, trigger an adaptive T helper type 2 (Th2) cell-mediated response that produces cytokines, such as interleukin (IL)-5 and IL-13 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/eosinophilic-esophagitis-eoe-genetics-and-immunopathogenesis/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. IL-13 subsequently triggers resident cells, such as esophageal epithelial cells, to produce a large set of proteins. The most strongly induced gene in this process is eotaxin-3, which in turn recruits eosinophils from the peripheral blood into the tissue [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/eosinophilic-esophagitis-eoe-genetics-and-immunopathogenesis/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. Antigen-driven Th2 cells also produce IL-5, which is a chief eosinophil growth and activation factor that primes eosinophils to have enhanced responsiveness to eotaxin-3 and prolongs their cellular survival.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H20860162\"><span class=\"h2\">Role of the immune system and environmental factors</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Host immune system mechanisms in EoE appear to fall somewhere in between pure immunoglobulin E (IgE) mediated and delayed Th2 responses [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/eosinophilic-esophagitis-eoe-genetics-and-immunopathogenesis/abstract/3,7-9\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,7-9</a>]. Eosinophils, T cells, and mast cells are elevated in esophageal mucosal biopsies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/eosinophilic-esophagitis-eoe-genetics-and-immunopathogenesis/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>], and mast cell degranulation and eosinophil cytolysis and degranulation are common findings in tissue specimens from patients with eosinophilic gastrointestinal disorders (EGIDs) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/eosinophilic-esophagitis-eoe-genetics-and-immunopathogenesis/abstract/11-13\" class=\"abstract_t\">11-13</a>]. Studies have identified contributory roles for allergens, cytokines, micro-ribonucleic acid (microRNA or miRNA), chemokines, and polarization of Th2 immunity in the disease pathophysiology. In addition, EoE is uniquely characterized by high levels of systemic and esophageal immunoglobulin G4 (IgG4), which include food-specific responses [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/eosinophilic-esophagitis-eoe-genetics-and-immunopathogenesis/abstract/14-16\" class=\"abstract_t\">14-16</a>]. The high levels of IgG4 may play a role in blocking IgE responses and possibly explain the dissociation between positive skin tests and effective elimination diets.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H17470568\"><span class=\"h3\">Allergens</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The association of EoE with allergies suggests that eosinophil recruitment to the esophagus may be an immune response to environmental antigens in genetically predisposed individuals. Several lines of evidence support an allergic etiology. The role of allergies in EoE is briefly reviewed here and is discussed in greater detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=allergy-testing-in-eosinophilic-esophagitis#H21496977\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Allergy testing in eosinophilic esophagitis&quot;, section on 'Evidence for role of allergies in EoE'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dietary-management-of-eosinophilic-esophagitis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Dietary management of eosinophilic esophagitis&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Approximately 75 percent of patients with EoE or other EGIDs are atopic [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/eosinophilic-esophagitis-eoe-genetics-and-immunopathogenesis/abstract/17-26\" class=\"abstract_t\">17-26</a>]. The majority of patients have evidence of food allergen and aeroallergen sensitization, as defined by skin prick <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> allergen-specific IgE tests, although only a minority has a history of food anaphylaxis (an IgE-mediated reaction) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/eosinophilic-esophagitis-eoe-genetics-and-immunopathogenesis/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. The disease can typically be reversed by institution of an allergen-free diet [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/eosinophilic-esophagitis-eoe-genetics-and-immunopathogenesis/abstract/17,18,27,28\" class=\"abstract_t\">17,18,27,28</a>], and relapse is common upon food reintroduction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/eosinophilic-esophagitis-eoe-genetics-and-immunopathogenesis/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. In addition, priming with epicutaneous exposure to antigens can result in esophageal eosinophil recruitment in a mouse model [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/eosinophilic-esophagitis-eoe-genetics-and-immunopathogenesis/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. Patients with EoE also frequently report seasonal variations in their symptoms, with fewer cases being diagnosed in the winter months (when outdoor aeroallergens are relatively low) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/eosinophilic-esophagitis-eoe-genetics-and-immunopathogenesis/abstract/30-32\" class=\"abstract_t\">30-32</a>]. In addition, increased eosinophil accumulation is seen in the esophagus of patients with EoE and seasonal allergic rhinitis with hypersensitivity to grass pollen [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/eosinophilic-esophagitis-eoe-genetics-and-immunopathogenesis/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>]. EoE has also been reported in a few patients treated with sublingual pollen immunotherapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/eosinophilic-esophagitis-eoe-genetics-and-immunopathogenesis/abstract/34,35\" class=\"abstract_t\">34,35</a>] and can be triggered by oral immunotherapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/eosinophilic-esophagitis-eoe-genetics-and-immunopathogenesis/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H17470669\"><span class=\"h3\">Eosinophils and chemokines</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>EoE occurs in the absence of peripheral blood eosinophilia in more than one-half of patients, indicating the potential significance of esophageal-specific mechanisms for regulating eosinophil levels. Eotaxin plays a central role in antigen-mediated eosinophil recruitment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/eosinophilic-esophagitis-eoe-genetics-and-immunopathogenesis/abstract/5,6,37,38\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,6,37,38</a>], and the importance of a local eotaxin pathway in this process has been demonstrated in several studies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/eosinophilic-esophagitis-eoe-genetics-and-immunopathogenesis/abstract/37-42\" class=\"abstract_t\">37-42</a>]. Collectively, these results strongly implicate eotaxin-3 in the pathoetiology of EoE and offer a molecular connection between Th2 inflammation and the development of EoE.</p><p>In murine models of EoE, eosinophil recruitment is attenuated in the absence of eotaxin [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/eosinophilic-esophagitis-eoe-genetics-and-immunopathogenesis/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>], and mice with a genetic ablation of the eotaxin receptor (CCR3) are protected from the development of experimental EoE [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/eosinophilic-esophagitis-eoe-genetics-and-immunopathogenesis/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>]. The later study also reported on a genome-wide microarray expression profile analysis of esophageal tissue that was used to compare gene transcript expression in the esophageal tissue of patients with EoE or chronic esophagitis (typical of GERD) and normal individuals. Eotaxin-3 (also called chemokine [C-C motif] ligand 26, CCL26) was the most overexpressed gene in patients with EoE. In addition, single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the eotaxin-3 gene were overrepresented in patients with EoE compared with normal individuals.</p><p>Levels of eotaxin-3 correlated with disease severity in a study in which overexpression of eotaxin-3 alone had a predictive value of 89 percent in diagnosing EoE from a single esophageal biopsy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/eosinophilic-esophagitis-eoe-genetics-and-immunopathogenesis/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>]. Another study demonstrated that treatment of EoE with topical corticosteroids downregulated esophageal eotaxin-3 levels (as well as other cytokines implicated in EoE) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/eosinophilic-esophagitis-eoe-genetics-and-immunopathogenesis/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>]. A number of studies in experimental systems in rodents have shown that eosinophils have an effector role in mediating the pathologic features of EoE [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/eosinophilic-esophagitis-eoe-genetics-and-immunopathogenesis/abstract/43\" class=\"abstract_t\">43</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H17470704\"><span class=\"h3\">Th2 immunity and cytokines</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Adaptive T cell immunity, driven by Th2 cells and involving IL-13, IL-5, and IL-15 expression, appears to play a major role in the pathogenesis of EoE [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/eosinophilic-esophagitis-eoe-genetics-and-immunopathogenesis/abstract/10,44-48\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,44-48</a>].</p><p>Studies of cytokines in EoE have shown the following:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>IL-5 is expressed by Th2 cells and eosinophils. It is a key mediator in eosinophil activation and appears to mediate eosinophil-induced esophageal remodeling and collagen deposition [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/eosinophilic-esophagitis-eoe-genetics-and-immunopathogenesis/abstract/43\" class=\"abstract_t\">43</a>]. IL-5 expression is increased in tissue samples from children with EoE [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/eosinophilic-esophagitis-eoe-genetics-and-immunopathogenesis/abstract/49\" class=\"abstract_t\">49</a>]. In a murine model of EoE, eosinophil recruitment was ablated in the absence of IL-5 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/eosinophilic-esophagitis-eoe-genetics-and-immunopathogenesis/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>]. Overexpression of IL-5 in mice leads to increased esophageal eosinophils, and development of EoE is blocked in IL-deficient mice [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/eosinophilic-esophagitis-eoe-genetics-and-immunopathogenesis/abstract/50\" class=\"abstract_t\">50</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>IL-13 is secreted by Th2 cells in particular. One of its effects is to increase eotaxin-3 expression. Elevated levels of IL-13 messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA) are seen in esophageal biopsy specimens from patients with EoE [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/eosinophilic-esophagitis-eoe-genetics-and-immunopathogenesis/abstract/51\" class=\"abstract_t\">51</a>]. These findings are ablated with glucocorticoid treatment. In addition, IL-13 stimulation induces an EoE-specific esophageal transcriptome, as well as the gene product from the main EoE susceptibility locus, calpain-14 (CAPN14) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/eosinophilic-esophagitis-eoe-genetics-and-immunopathogenesis/abstract/52,53\" class=\"abstract_t\">52,53</a>]. Repeated delivery of specific allergens or IL-13 to the lung of mice, as well transgenic overexpression of IL-13 in the lung of mice, induces experimental EoE [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/eosinophilic-esophagitis-eoe-genetics-and-immunopathogenesis/abstract/46,54,55\" class=\"abstract_t\">46,54,55</a>], suggesting that esophageal eosinophilic inflammation is mechanistically linked with pulmonary inflammation.

TSLP and its receptor, in concert with transforming growth factor-beta-1 (TGF-beta-1), affect tolerance mechanisms in dendritic cells in vitro [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/eosinophilic-esophagitis-eoe-genetics-and-immunopathogenesis/abstract/57\" class=\"abstract_t\">57</a>]. This suggests mechanistically that food tolerance mechanisms are disrupted in patients with EoE. A nonsynonymous polymorphism in the gene for the TSLP receptor was associated with EoE in male patients only [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/eosinophilic-esophagitis-eoe-genetics-and-immunopathogenesis/abstract/58\" class=\"abstract_t\">58</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H55380570\" class=\"local\">'Genetic defects'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Increased expression of fibroblast growth factor 9 (FGF9) and other profibrogenic cytokine genes, such as IL-5 in the subepithelial layer of the esophagus, is seen in patients with EoE, suggesting that these cytokines may have a role in the fibrogenic response [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/eosinophilic-esophagitis-eoe-genetics-and-immunopathogenesis/abstract/59,60\" class=\"abstract_t\">59,60</a>]. Prolonged treatment with swallowed glucocorticoids is associated with a downregulation of profibrogenic cytokine gene expression [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/eosinophilic-esophagitis-eoe-genetics-and-immunopathogenesis/abstract/60\" class=\"abstract_t\">60</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H55380336\"><span class=\"h3\">Mast cells</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Increased numbers of mast cells are seen in esophageal tissue samples from patient with EoE, and degranulation is common. The exact role of mast cells in EoE is unclear. Results from a murine model of EoE suggest that mast cells may play an important role in esophageal remodeling in EoE by promoting muscle cell hyperplasia and hypertrophy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/eosinophilic-esophagitis-eoe-genetics-and-immunopathogenesis/abstract/61\" class=\"abstract_t\">61</a>]. Elevated TGF-beta, produced by eosinophils and mast cells, contributes to esophageal tissue remodeling and smooth muscle dysfunction in patients with EoE, similar to that seen in the airways of patients with asthma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/eosinophilic-esophagitis-eoe-genetics-and-immunopathogenesis/abstract/62\" class=\"abstract_t\">62</a>], further supporting the link between esophageal and pulmonary inflammation.

These two microRNAs may play a role in regulation of eosinophilia and polarization of adaptive immunity. miR-375 was the most downregulated. Levels of these microRNAs mostly reverted to normal with glucocorticoid treatment. Patients in remission showed increased expression of miR-675. In the plasma, the most differentially expressed microRNAs were miR-146a, miR-146b, and miR-223.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H20860190\"><span class=\"h2\">Genetics and family history</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A genetic predisposition to EoE is supported by evidence of familial clustering [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/eosinophilic-esophagitis-eoe-genetics-and-immunopathogenesis/abstract/64\" class=\"abstract_t\">64</a>] and twin studies, which have revealed a 58 percent concordance in monozygotic twins and a 36 percent concordance in dizygotic twins compared with regular fraternal siblings [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/eosinophilic-esophagitis-eoe-genetics-and-immunopathogenesis/abstract/65\" class=\"abstract_t\">65</a>]. The risk of EoE for other siblings was 2.4 percent. Collectively, twin studies have indicated a strong heritability of EoE, largely accounted for by shared environment in early life. In addition, several genetic variants that may predispose to EoE have been identified, especially at 5q22 (<em>TSLP</em> gene) and 2p23 (<em>CAPN14</em> gene). The identified genetic markers for EoE are primarily common genetic variants, although one appears to be specific for EoE.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H55380564\"><span class=\"h3\">Family history</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Over 30 families with multiple affected individuals were reported by 2008 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/eosinophilic-esophagitis-eoe-genetics-and-immunopathogenesis/abstract/66\" class=\"abstract_t\">66</a>]. In a study of 103 children with EoE, a positive family history was observed in 7 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/eosinophilic-esophagitis-eoe-genetics-and-immunopathogenesis/abstract/64\" class=\"abstract_t\">64</a>]. This included three sibling pairs and the mother of one of the pairs of siblings. A report from an EGID registry database showed that 16 percent of patients had an immediate family member with a similar disorder [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/eosinophilic-esophagitis-eoe-genetics-and-immunopathogenesis/abstract/67\" class=\"abstract_t\">67</a>]. Almost 10 percent of patients with EoE and evidence of esophageal strictures have parents diagnosed with EoE [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/eosinophilic-esophagitis-eoe-genetics-and-immunopathogenesis/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. There is also a large sibling risk ratio, estimated at approximately 50-fold compared with the general population [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/eosinophilic-esophagitis-eoe-genetics-and-immunopathogenesis/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].

Additional dysregulated transcripts, including several long-noncoding RNAs (lcnRNA) that act as transcriptional regulators, were identified when RNA sequencing on esophageal biopsies was performed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/eosinophilic-esophagitis-eoe-genetics-and-immunopathogenesis/abstract/68\" class=\"abstract_t\">68</a>]. The genome-wide association study identified linkages between EoE and eotaxin-3 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/eosinophilic-esophagitis-eoe-genetics-and-immunopathogenesis/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>]. A SNP (+2496 T&gt;G, rs2302009) in the eotaxin-3 gene was associated with disease susceptibility.</p><p>An EoE susceptibility locus was also identified at 5q22, involving the gene encoding TSLP [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/eosinophilic-esophagitis-eoe-genetics-and-immunopathogenesis/abstract/56\" class=\"abstract_t\">56</a>]. The genes for TSLP and its receptor are both associated with EoE [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/eosinophilic-esophagitis-eoe-genetics-and-immunopathogenesis/abstract/57\" class=\"abstract_t\">57</a>]. In addition, genetic susceptibility has been found at 5p23, encoding for the <em>CAPN14</em> gene [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/eosinophilic-esophagitis-eoe-genetics-and-immunopathogenesis/abstract/52\" class=\"abstract_t\">52</a>]. Calpain-14 is an esophageal-specific enzyme that regulates IL-13 responses in esophageal epithelial cells and probably explains, at least in part, the tissue-specific nature of the disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/eosinophilic-esophagitis-eoe-genetics-and-immunopathogenesis/abstract/53\" class=\"abstract_t\">53</a>].</p><p>EoE involves loss of esophageal barrier function, probably mediated by depressed expression of desmoglein-1 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/eosinophilic-esophagitis-eoe-genetics-and-immunopathogenesis/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. In addition, genetic variants in the filaggrin gene are linked with EoE, highlighting the potential key role of alterations in barrier function in EoE. Finally, genetic mutations in TGF receptors <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> genes associated with inherited connective tissue disorders involving hypermobility syndrome are associated with EoE [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/eosinophilic-esophagitis-eoe-genetics-and-immunopathogenesis/abstract/57\" class=\"abstract_t\">57</a>]. These genetic findings have provided insight into molecular etiology and disease susceptibility, but they have not elucidated why patients develop the tissue-specific response characteristic of EoE, since genes such as TSLP have been linked with other atopic disorders.</p><p>A relatively large genome-wide association study has determined that a major susceptibility linkage exists at 2p23 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/eosinophilic-esophagitis-eoe-genetics-and-immunopathogenesis/abstract/52\" class=\"abstract_t\">52</a>]. This region of the chromosome contains the <em>CAPN14</em> gene, which encodes for calpain-14. This protein is specifically expressed in the esophagus, is markedly upregulated in patients with EoE compared with controls in a manner dependent upon the CAPN14 genotype, and is dramatically induced by IL-13 in esophageal epithelial cells by an epigenetic mechanism.

(See <a href=\"#H20860156\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The pathogenesis of EoE is incompletely understood but involves an interplay between genetic, environmental, and host immune system factors. (See <a href=\"#H17470358\" class=\"local\">'Pathogenesis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Host immune system mechanisms in EoE appear to fall somewhere in between pure immunoglobulin E (IgE)-mediated and delayed T helper type 2 (Th2) responses. Studies have identified contributory roles for allergens, cytokines, micro-ribonucleic acids (microRNAs or miRNAs), chemokines, and polarization of Th2 immunity in the disease pathophysiology. (See <a href=\"#H20860162\" class=\"local\">'Role of the immune system and environmental factors'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A genetic predisposition to EoE is supported by evidence of familial clustering and twin studies. In addition, several genetic defects that may predispose to EoE have been identified, especially at 2p23, encoding for the esophagus specific gene product, calpain-14. Genetic testing for the EoE molecular transcriptome is available and may be useful in both diagnosis and management of EoE.
