Although the phrase &quot;gum elastic bougie&quot; is common, we find it confusing since the ETI is neither gum nor elastic and is not used as a bougie (ie, dilator). In this topic, we will refer to the device as an endotracheal or tracheal tube introducer.</p><p>The ETI consists of a 60 cm stylet with the distal tip bent at a 30 degree angle. The bend allows the intubator to direct the tip anteriorly under the epiglottis and through the vocal cords, which may not be visible. </p><p>Dimensions and use are comparable among the three main types of ETI available:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Eschmann Introducer &ndash; Woven Dacron rod with resin coating, can be sterilized and reused. This is commonly referred to as a &quot;gum elastic bougie&quot; (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F90268\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef90268 \">picture 1</a>)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><span class=\"nowrap\">SunMed/Flex</span> Guide &ndash; Solid polyethylene, single use (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F63503\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef63503 \">picture 2</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F90653\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef90653 \">picture 3</a>)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Frova &ndash; Hollow, single use plastic introducer with fenestrated tip to allow oxygenation; includes 15 mm adapter for standard bag-valve assembly (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F55895\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef55895 \">picture 4</a>)</p><p/><p>Although the Eschmann introducer is more expensive, it can be used multiple times, so the average cost per intubation is comparable to that of a single use introducer. Nevertheless, some clinicians prefer single use introducers because multiple use introducers are sometimes inadvertently thrown away. The plastic of the SunMed stylet has &quot;memory&quot; so J-shaped anterior curvatures can be maintained for use with video devices. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=devices-for-difficult-emergency-airway-management-outside-the-operating-room-in-adults#H11\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Devices for difficult emergency airway management outside the operating room in adults&quot;, section on 'Advanced laryngoscopes'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2222177\"><span class=\"h1\">INDICATIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The endotracheal tube introducer (ETI) is a useful tool for intubation when the epiglottis is visible, but the vocal cords cannot be seen (Grade III Cormack-Lehane view) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endotracheal-tube-introducers-gum-elastic-bougie-for-emergency-intubation/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. The ETI can be used in conjunction with standard laryngoscopes, video laryngoscopes, and fiberoptic intubation devices. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2222184\"><span class=\"h1\">CONTRAINDICATIONS AND PRECAUTIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>An endotracheal tube introducer (ETI) should be used with caution if at all when there is possible laryngeal or tracheal injury. In such cases the ETI may exacerbate the injury or be advanced outside the airway into adjacent structures. An ETI is unlikely to be beneficial when no part of the airway can be seen (Grade IV Cormack-Lehane view).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2222191\"><span class=\"h1\">PREPARATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Lubrication may be applied to the endotracheal tube introducer (ETI) if the endotracheal tube is a tight fit. Lubricant allows the endotracheal tube to pass over the ETI more easily. If the fit is not tight, lubricant can make the ETI difficult to grasp and control. &#160;</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2222198\"><span class=\"h1\">TECHNIQUE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Placement of the endotracheal tube introducer (ETI) and the subsequent advancement of the tracheal tube over it are performed as described here. A video clip demonstrating the technique is provided (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F90649\" class=\"graphic graphic_movie graphicRef90649 \">movie 1</a>).</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Identify the epiglottis.</strong> External laryngeal manipulation (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F52096\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef52096 \">picture 5</a>) or other positioning techniques may be needed to find the epiglottis (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F80885\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef80885 \">figure 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F52253\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef52253 \">picture 6</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F80234\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef80234 \">picture 7</a>), depending upon the device being used for laryngoscopy and the clinical scenario.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Place the ETI.</strong> Advance the ETI, with its tip pointing anteriorly and under the epiglottis, into the trachea. When advancing the ETI, be sure to maintain the tip in the midline with its anterior orientation (do not allow it to rotate to either side); if it rotates significantly, the anteriorly located tracheal rings may not be appreciated. Care must be taken to avoid forceful insertion as this can cause injury (ie, bleeding or perforation).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Confirm placement of the ETI.</strong> Two tactile sensations suggest correct placement in the trachea [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endotracheal-tube-introducers-gum-elastic-bougie-for-emergency-intubation/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>]. One sign is the feeling of vibrations or &quot;clicks&quot; as the tip of the ETI is advanced over the tracheal rings. However, it is important to remember that the angled tip of the ETI must be oriented anteriorly for the tip to encounter the rings. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Another sign is resistance to further insertion. As the introducer advances to between 24 and 40 cm from the teeth, the distal tip becomes lodged in smaller airways and cannot advance. This is sometimes referred to as the &quot;stop sign&quot; or &quot;hard stop.&quot; In contrast, if the ETI is in the esophagus, the tracheal rings cannot be felt and the introducer advances easily into the stomach, far past the 40 cm mark where the &quot;stop sign&quot; would normally occur if the ETI were in the tracheobronchial tree.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">When advancing the ETI, avoid applying too much pressure if resistance is encountered. Excessive force can traumatize the airway [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endotracheal-tube-introducers-gum-elastic-bougie-for-emergency-intubation/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. In addition, it may be helpful to withdraw the introducer several centimeters before railroading the endotracheal tube over the introducer (next step in the technique) to avoid forceful advancement. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Place the endotracheal tube (ETT).</strong> Once the ETI is in the trachea, place the distal end of the ETT over the free end of the ETI and advance it using a Seldinger-like technique. This generally requires an assistant to place the ETT on the proximal end of the introducer. Advance the ETT over the introducer into the trachea, <strong>while keeping the laryngoscope in place</strong>. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Withdraw the ETI.</strong> Once the ETT is advanced the appropriate distance, withdraw the introducer.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Confirm that the ETT is in the trachea.</strong> Confirmation proceeds as usual and we recommend the use of an end-tidal CO<sub>2</sub> detector.</p><p/><p>The following tips may facilitate placement of the ETT over the introducer:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Throughout the procedure, the operator should maintain proper position of the laryngoscope with the left hand. The tendency is to remove the laryngoscope after the introducer is in the trachea, but doing so allows the tongue to fall posteriorly and potentially hinder tube passage.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Passage of the ETT is easier if it is close in size to the introducer. The greater the disparity, the more likely the ETT will have an overhanging leading edge that can catch on the arytenoids or aryepiglottic folds during insertion. This may require using a smaller ETT than would otherwise be used, but this is a small price to pay for success in a difficult situation.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>If the ETT impinges on the arytenoids, slight withdrawal of the ETT (to disengage the tip from the arytenoids), followed by careful counterclockwise rotation and relaxation of cricoid pressure (if used) may facilitate passage. A video clip demonstrating the technique is provided (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F93564\" class=\"graphic graphic_movie graphicRef93564 \">movie 2</a>).</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H156376030\"><span class=\"h1\">PEDIATRIC CONSIDERATIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The techniques described above can be used in children. Pediatric-sized endotracheal tube introducers (ETIs) are as small as 10 French and can accommodate an endotracheal tube (ETT) as small as 5 mm.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2222220\"><span class=\"h1\">EVIDENCE OF EFFECTIVENESS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Multiple randomized and observational trials demonstrate that endotracheal tube introducers (ETIs) aid intubation in the operating room, especially with Cormack-Lehane Grade III glottic views (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F55034\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef55034 \">figure 2</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endotracheal-tube-introducers-gum-elastic-bougie-for-emergency-intubation/abstract/1,4-6\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,4-6</a>]. In an observational study of consecutive intubations performed in a single, urban academic emergency department (n = 543), use of an ETI was independently associated with greater first-pass success (adjusted odds ratio 2.83 [95% CI 1.35-5.92]) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endotracheal-tube-introducers-gum-elastic-bougie-for-emergency-intubation/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. </p><p>Little training is needed before introducers can be used successfully [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endotracheal-tube-introducers-gum-elastic-bougie-for-emergency-intubation/abstract/8-10\" class=\"abstract_t\">8-10</a>]. This is likely because of the similarity to standard intubating technique and familiarity with the Seldinger method. In an observational study of prehospital airway management, physicians used an ETI to intubate 78 percent of difficult airways in which standard techniques had failed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endotracheal-tube-introducers-gum-elastic-bougie-for-emergency-intubation/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2222227\"><span class=\"h1\">COMPLICATIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Complications from airway introducers are rare and involve mechanical trauma to airway structures [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endotracheal-tube-introducers-gum-elastic-bougie-for-emergency-intubation/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. Excessive force while advancing the endotracheal tube introducer (ETI) or the endotracheal tube (ETT) might damage the larynx, trachea, or branches of the airway [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endotracheal-tube-introducers-gum-elastic-bougie-for-emergency-intubation/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. The endotracheal tube might catch on the arytenoids during placement and impede advancement. Forceful advancement can then dislocate the arytenoid cartilage or cause other trauma to the airway.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2222234\"><span class=\"h1\">OTHER USES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Additional uses of endotracheal tube introducers (ETIs) include the following:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Means for distinguishing tracheal from esophageal endotracheal tube (ETT) placement.</strong> This approach has been advocated in cardiac arrest patients, where end-tidal CO<sub>2</sub> may not be measurable. However, there is insufficient evidence to recommend that introducers be relied upon as the sole indicator of proper ETT placement [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endotracheal-tube-introducers-gum-elastic-bougie-for-emergency-intubation/abstract/2,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,12</a>]. In a study using 20 human cadavers, clinicians without prior experience using an ETI were able, using the techniques described above, to determine esophageal placement in 95 percent of cases (95% CI 88-98) and tracheal placement in 93 percent (95% CI 86-97) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endotracheal-tube-introducers-gum-elastic-bougie-for-emergency-intubation/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H2222198\" class=\"local\">'Technique'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Adjunct for cricothyrotomy.</strong> There is an increasing body of evidence that ETI-aided cricothyrotomy may be a sound alternative procedure to the standard surgical techniques. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=emergency-cricothyrotomy-cricothyroidotomy#H19\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Emergency cricothyrotomy (cricothyroidotomy)&quot;, section on 'Rapid four step technique'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Endotracheal tube exchanger.</strong> If an intubated patient has a malfunctioning ETT (eg, cuff leak), an ETI can be advanced through the ETT to maintain a track into the trachea, over which the malfunctioning ETT can be removed and a new ETT placed.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Adjunct for video laryngoscopes.</strong> Some manufacturers (King Vision, Pentax AWS) advocate use of an ETI to assist with difficult intubations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endotracheal-tube-introducers-gum-elastic-bougie-for-emergency-intubation/abstract/13,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,14</a>]. In some video laryngoscopes (Copilot VL), a specific channel for ETIs has been created to assist with routine intubations. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=devices-for-difficult-emergency-airway-management-outside-the-operating-room-in-adults#H12\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Devices for difficult emergency airway management outside the operating room in adults&quot;, section on 'Video laryngoscopes'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Adjunct with blind digital intubation.</strong> Some practitioners prefer to use an ETI, rather than an ETT, when performing digital intubations since the smaller diameter and malleability allow for easier manipulation within the oropharynx when directing the tip towards the glottic opening [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endotracheal-tube-introducers-gum-elastic-bougie-for-emergency-intubation/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. In addition, when the ETI enters the trachea, palpable clicks and a positive &quot;stop sign&quot; help to confirm proper placement, as opposed to digital intubations without an ETI in which tactile confirmation of tracheal placement may not be possible. (See <a href=\"#H2222198\" class=\"local\">'Technique'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2222241\"><span class=\"h1\">SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The endotracheal tube introducer (ETI) is an effective and inexpensive adjunct to difficult airway management that is easy to use. We recommend that an ETI be readily available in every emergency department. The ETI consists of a 60 cm stylet with the distal tip bent at a 30 degree angle.
