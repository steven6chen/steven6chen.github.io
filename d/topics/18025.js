The acute process is self-limited, rarely causes hepatic failure, and usually leads to chronic infection. Chronic HCV infection often follows a progressive course over many years and can ultimately result in cirrhosis, hepatocellular carcinoma, and the need for liver transplantation. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-natural-history-of-chronic-hepatitis-c-virus-infection\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and natural history of chronic hepatitis C virus infection&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The goal of treatment is to eradicate HCV RNA, which is predicted by the achievement of a sustained virologic response (SVR) as defined by the absence of HCV RNA by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) 12 weeks after stopping treatment. An SVR is associated with a 99 percent chance of being HCV RNA negative during long-term follow-up and can therefore be considered cure of the HCV infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-regimens-for-chronic-hepatitis-c-virus-genotypes-2-and-3-infection-in-adults/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].

Genotype 3 is also uniquely associated with an increase in hepatic steatosis, which is believed to be related to direct effects on lipid metabolism in liver cells [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-regimens-for-chronic-hepatitis-c-virus-genotypes-2-and-3-infection-in-adults/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].

An all-oral regimen that meets many of these objectives for most patients with genotype 2 and 3 infection became possible with the introduction of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sofosbuvir-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">sofosbuvir</a>, a nucleotide analogue that potently inhibits HCV viral replication through interference with RNA-dependent RNA polymerase function (NS5B polymerase inhibitor). </p><p>The introductions of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sofosbuvir-and-velpatasvir-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">sofosbuvir-velpatasvir</a> and subsequently <a href=\"topic.htm?path=glecaprevir-and-pibrentasvir-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">glecaprevir-pibrentasvir</a>, each a highly effective once-daily pangenotypic combination regimen, offer the opportunity to streamline antiviral treatment for most patients. Antiviral selection among patients without cirrhosis or with compensated cirrhosis is discussed by genotype in the sections that follow.

These regimens are extremely effective against genotype 2 and do not require the addition of ribavirin. The choice between them depends primarily on the potential for drug interactions and patient preference regarding dosing (eg, glecaprevir-pibrentasvir is three pills once daily with food but can be given for 8 rather than 12 weeks in the absence of cirrhosis). </p><p>The following studies illustrate their efficacy: </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><a href=\"topic.htm?path=sofosbuvir-and-velpatasvir-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Sofosbuvir-velpatasvir</a> &ndash; In the initial trials, there were no cases of virologic failure or relapse among genotype 2-infected patients treated with sofosbuvir-velpatasvir for 12 weeks [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-regimens-for-chronic-hepatitis-c-virus-genotypes-2-and-3-infection-in-adults/abstract/6-8\" class=\"abstract_t\">6-8</a>]. As an example, a randomized, placebo-controlled trial reported SVR in 100 percent of the 104 genotype 2-infected individuals, 10 of whom had cirrhosis and 25 of whom had previously failed treatment (predominantly with peginterferon and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ribavirin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ribavirin</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-regimens-for-chronic-hepatitis-c-virus-genotypes-2-and-3-infection-in-adults/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].
