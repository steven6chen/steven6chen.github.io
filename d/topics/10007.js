With improved long-term survival, more patients are being cared for outside of a transplant center, requiring more widespread familiarity with the complications seen in this patient population. Several medical problems are routinely encountered by clinicians caring for patients after liver transplantation. These include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Acute or chronic rejection.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Complications of immunosuppression including hypertension, renal insufficiency, infection, malignancy, a variety of dermatologic conditions, and metabolic diseases such as diabetes mellitus, obesity, hyperlipidemia, and bone disease.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Biliary complications.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Recurrence of the primary liver disease.</p><p/><p>This topic will review the general management of patients following liver transplantation and the nonimmunologic complications of liver transplantation. Acute and chronic rejection, infectious complications of liver transplantation, recurrent hepatitis, and recurrent hepatocellular carcinoma are discussed in detail elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=liver-transplantation-diagnosis-of-acute-cellular-rejection\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Liver transplantation: Diagnosis of acute cellular rejection&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=infectious-complications-in-liver-transplantation\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Infectious complications in liver transplantation&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=recurrence-of-hepatitis-c-virus-infection-following-liver-transplantation\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Recurrence of hepatitis C virus infection following liver transplantation&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=liver-transplantation-for-chronic-hepatitis-b-virus-infection\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Liver transplantation for chronic hepatitis B virus infection&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=liver-transplantation-for-hepatocellular-carcinoma\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Liver transplantation for hepatocellular carcinoma&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1052710311\"><span class=\"h1\">ROLE OF THE PRIMARY CARE CLINICIAN</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Immediately following liver transplantation, patients are managed by transplant surgeons <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> transplant hepatologists. However, after several months, the general medical care of a liver transplant recipient is often transferred back to the patient's primary care clinician [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/liver-transplantation-in-adults-long-term-management-of-transplant-recipients/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. While practices vary in different transplant centers, the transplant center typically continues to manage the administration of immunosuppressive agents, to treat recurrent liver disease, and to manage biliary complications. In addition, the transplant center may also manage some of the complications of immunosuppression, such as renal disease. The patient's other medical issues, including other complications of immunosuppression, are often managed by the primary care clinician. </p><p>In general, transplant centers and primary care clinicians experienced with caring for patients who have undergone liver transplantation have similar expectations regarding who should manage various aspects of the patient's care. A survey of the liver transplant coordinators from 45 programs examined opinions regarding which healthcare provider(s) should primarily be responsible for the patient's general medical care [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/liver-transplantation-in-adults-long-term-management-of-transplant-recipients/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Most reported that the primary clinician who should be responsible for the overall care of the patient six months after transplantation is the patient's family <span class=\"nowrap\">practitioner/internist</span> (40 percent). Others favored that the care be provided by a transplant hepatologist (35 percent), a primary care clinician in conjunction with a hepatologist (14 percent), or a transplant surgeon (11 percent). None reported that the referring gastroenterologist should be the primary care giver.</p><p>In addition, the survey looked at which elements of the patient's care transplant centers wanted the primary care clinician to manage:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Preventive medicine &ndash; 100 percent</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Annual examinations &ndash; 65 percent</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Vaccinations &ndash; 65 percent</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Diabetes &ndash; 60 percent</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Bone disease &ndash; 40 percent</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Hypertension &ndash; 37 percent</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pregnancy &ndash; 15 percent</p><p/><p>All of the transplant centers wanted to manage the immunosuppressive regimen, graft rejection, infections, recurrent liver disease, and renal dysfunction. </p><p>Finally, the survey asked primary care clinicians who had experience caring for liver transplant recipients whether they felt comfortable managing the patient's overall health care following transplantation. Seventy-three percent of respondents reported they were comfortable managing the patient's health care. In particular, they were comfortable managing the liver transplant recipient's hypertensive medications (100 percent), general preventive care (91 percent), annual physical examinations (91 percent), diabetes mellitus (82 percent), hyperglycemia (82 percent), vaccinations (82 percent), and bone disease (73 percent).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1052710303\"><span class=\"h1\">PREVENTIVE MEDICINE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>General health maintenance for liver transplant recipients is similar to that for the general population (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=preventive-care-in-adults-recommendations\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Preventive care in adults: Recommendations&quot;</a>). However, certain disorders require more intensive screening because they are more common following liver transplantation (eg, hypertension, diabetes, dyslipidemia, renal disease, and malignancy). In addition, because there are numerous drugs that interact with immunosuppressive agents, at each visit patients should be asked about any new medications or supplements they are taking (including over-the-counter medications) and be reminded not to start any new medications or supplements without first talking to their clinicians (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEPH%2F110436\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef110436 \">table 1</a>).

However, not all insurance covers cardiovascular disease screening in this setting, which may influence whether testing is performed. Exercise stress testing is preferred for those who are able to do the test. For those unable to do exercise stress testing, adenosine and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dobutamine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">dobutamine</a> stress tests are alternatives.

Because immunosuppression can affect the patient's ability to mount an immune response to vaccinations, it is recommended that many of the vaccinations (eg, hepatitis A and B vaccines) be administered prior to transplantation when possible. In addition, live virus vaccinations should be avoided. The role of immunizations in patients undergoing solid organ transplantation is discussed in detail elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=immunizations-in-solid-organ-transplant-candidates-and-recipients\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Immunizations in solid organ transplant candidates and recipients&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3273353\"><span class=\"h2\">Physical activity</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Increasing physical activity provides a potential means to reduce metabolic complications after liver transplantation. In a prospective study, lack of physical exercise was associated with abdominal obesity in liver transplant recipients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/liver-transplantation-in-adults-long-term-management-of-transplant-recipients/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Another study showed a reduction in percent body fat in liver transplant patients who participated in a structured 12-week exercise program [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/liver-transplantation-in-adults-long-term-management-of-transplant-recipients/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. A retrospective analysis of patients greater than one-year post-transplant found an inverse association between exercise intensity and metabolic syndrome [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/liver-transplantation-in-adults-long-term-management-of-transplant-recipients/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H154134169\" class=\"local\">'Metabolic syndrome'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H75299348\"><span class=\"h2\">Recommendations regarding alcohol consumption</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>All patients should be advised to avoid alcohol consumption following liver transplantation. Patients who consume excessive alcohol following liver transplantation have lower survival rates than those who do not, regardless of the indication for liver transplantation. In a study of 441 patients who underwent liver transplantation for various indications, the five-year survival rates for those with and without sustained excessive alcohol consumption (&gt;20 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/day</span> for women and &gt;30 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/day</span> for men (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F56818\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef56818 \">figure 1</a>)) were 49 and 75 percent, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/liver-transplantation-in-adults-long-term-management-of-transplant-recipients/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].</p><p>In particular, it is recommended that patients with alcoholic liver disease abstain from alcohol completely [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/liver-transplantation-in-adults-long-term-management-of-transplant-recipients/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. Studies have not addressed whether light to moderate alcohol consumption following liver transplantation for non-alcohol-related indications is safe. As a result, we take a conservative approach and suggest that patients abstain from alcohol following liver transplantation.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H154135359\"><span class=\"h1\">IMMUNOSUPPRESSION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Most transplant centers use either two or three agents to prevent allograft rejection in the immediate post-transplantation period (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F67917\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef67917 \">table 3</a>). This typically involves a combination of a glucocorticoid such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prednisone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">prednisone</a>, a calcineurin inhibitor (CNI) such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cyclosporine-ciclosporin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cyclosporine</a> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tacrolimus-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">tacrolimus</a>, and a third agent such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=mycophenolate-mofetil-cellcept-and-enteric-coated-mycophenolate-sodium-myfortic-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">mycophenolate</a> mofetil, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=azathioprine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">azathioprine</a>, or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sirolimus-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">sirolimus</a>. Once patients achieve adequate liver function and are free from rejection for six months, ongoing immunosuppression can often be with monotherapy, typically a CNI. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=liver-transplantation-in-adults-overview-of-immunosuppression\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Liver transplantation in adults: Overview of immunosuppression&quot;</a>.) </p><p>All immunosuppressive agents have undesired effects, the spectrum of which vary and in some cases overlap (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F67917\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef67917 \">table 3</a>). Common side effects include hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and renal dysfunction. In addition, there are numerous medications that may interact with immunosuppressive agents, leading to changes in the serum concentrations of the immunosuppressants (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEPH%2F110436\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef110436 \">table 1</a>). In order to decrease the risk of graft rejection or toxicity due to drug interactions, possible interactions should be reviewed prior to starting any new medications or supplements. If there are any concerns about the safety of a given medication or supplement, they should be discussed with the patient's transplant center prior to initiation.</p><p>The approach to immunosuppression and issues related to acute and chronic rejection following liver transplantation are discussed in detail elsewhere.

In one autopsy series, infections accounted for 64 percent of 321 deaths [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/liver-transplantation-in-adults-long-term-management-of-transplant-recipients/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. Serious infections occur most frequently within the first three months post-transplantation, which is the time of greatest immunosuppression [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/liver-transplantation-in-adults-long-term-management-of-transplant-recipients/abstract/7,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,8</a>]. However, patients with poor graft function who require increased levels of immunosuppression to treat recurrent cellular rejection or chronic rejection continue to be at risk for opportunistic infections [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/liver-transplantation-in-adults-long-term-management-of-transplant-recipients/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. A variety of pathogens can cause infections post-transplantation, including bacteria, fungi, and viruses (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F58770\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef58770 \">figure 2</a>). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=infectious-complications-in-liver-transplantation\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Infectious complications in liver transplantation&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Liver transplant recipients who develop a fever or other signs of infection require urgent evaluation because even common infections, such as pharyngitis or urinary tract infections, can rapidly progress to sepsis with multiorgan failure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/liver-transplantation-in-adults-long-term-management-of-transplant-recipients/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. In addition, patients with signs of sepsis should be transferred to a transplant center whenever possible. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sepsis-syndromes-in-adults-epidemiology-definitions-clinical-presentation-diagnosis-and-prognosis#H2\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Sepsis syndromes in adults: Epidemiology, definitions, clinical presentation, diagnosis, and prognosis&quot;, section on 'Definitions'</a>.)</p><p>Our approach to patients with a fever following liver transplantation begins with a thorough history and physical examination (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F75619\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef75619 \">table 4</a>). Laboratory and radiographic evaluation consists of complete blood count, comprehensive metabolic panel, urinalysis, urine culture, sputum Gram stain, blood cultures, and chest radiograph. Abnormalities on chest radiograph or persistent pulmonary symptoms are evaluated by chest computed tomography (CT) <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> bronchoscopy, and abdominal symptoms are evaluated by expanded abdominal imaging such as CT or magnetic resonance imaging with magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography (MRCP).</p><p>Other testing is based upon the clinical setting:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients with arthralgia and leukopenia, recent treatment for rejection, or those within 90 days of transplant are tested for cytomegalovirus (CMV) by a rapid antigen assay or, preferably, quantitative polymerase chain reaction.

However, not all fevers in transplant recipients are due to infection. Graft rejection or the development of malignancy should also be considered.

Liver transplant recipients may meet criteria for the metabolic syndrome prior to transplantation, in which case immunosuppressive medications can exacerbate the problem. In addition, many patients will develop the metabolic syndrome de novo. A study of 252 liver transplant patients found that 52 percent had metabolic syndrome following transplantation, compared with only 5 percent prior to transplantation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/liver-transplantation-in-adults-long-term-management-of-transplant-recipients/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>].

Because hypertension is common post-transplantation, we suggest that for the first six months following transplantation, the patient's blood pressure be assessed at home with self-monitoring every week and by a healthcare provider every month. In patients without hypertension after six months, blood pressure monitoring should be performed by a healthcare provider every six months. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-hypertension-in-adults#H13\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of hypertension in adults&quot;, section on 'Diagnosis'</a>.) </p><p>The cause of hypertension is multifactorial but is mostly related to the use of calcineurin inhibitors (CNIs; eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cyclosporine-ciclosporin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cyclosporine</a> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tacrolimus-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">tacrolimus</a>) and glucocorticoids [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/liver-transplantation-in-adults-long-term-management-of-transplant-recipients/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. CNIs act by increasing both systemic vascular resistance and renal vascular resistance (primarily affecting the afferent arterioles) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/liver-transplantation-in-adults-long-term-management-of-transplant-recipients/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. How this occurs is incompletely understood, but increased release of vasoconstrictors, particularly endothelin, has been thought to play an important role. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pharmacology-of-cyclosporine-and-tacrolimus#H19\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pharmacology of cyclosporine and tacrolimus&quot;, section on 'Hypertension'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hypertension-after-renal-transplantation\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Hypertension after renal transplantation&quot;</a>.)</p><p>By comparison, glucocorticoids are usually not a major risk factor for chronic hypertension in transplant recipients because of rapid dose reduction. However, they may play a contributory role, and gradual withdrawal of glucocorticoid therapy results in a fall in blood pressure in most patients. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=major-side-effects-of-systemic-glucocorticoids\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Major side effects of systemic glucocorticoids&quot;</a>.)</p><p>There are conflicting data concerning the frequency of hypertension induced by <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tacrolimus-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">tacrolimus</a> compared with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cyclosporine-ciclosporin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cyclosporine</a>. Two long-term trials, the European FK506 Multicentre Liver Study Group and the US Multicenter FK506 Liver Study Group, found no difference in the frequency of hypertension between the two drugs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/liver-transplantation-in-adults-long-term-management-of-transplant-recipients/abstract/19,20\" class=\"abstract_t\">19,20</a>]. By comparison, other trials in liver transplant recipients have found a lower incidence of late-onset hypertension with tacrolimus [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/liver-transplantation-in-adults-long-term-management-of-transplant-recipients/abstract/21,22\" class=\"abstract_t\">21,22</a>]. A meta-analysis of randomized trials in heart transplant recipients included eight studies that compared tacrolimus and cyclosporine with regard to hypertension [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/liver-transplantation-in-adults-long-term-management-of-transplant-recipients/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. Patients who received tacrolimus were at decreased risk for developing hypertension compared with patients who received cyclosporine (relative risk 0.80; 95% CI 0.69-0.93). A lesser degree of weight gain and lower doses of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prednisone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">prednisone</a> used with tacrolimus may have been contributing factors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/liver-transplantation-in-adults-long-term-management-of-transplant-recipients/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. Because of inconclusive data among liver transplant recipients, switching from cyclosporine to tacrolimus solely for treating hypertension is not recommended. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pharmacology-of-cyclosporine-and-tacrolimus\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pharmacology of cyclosporine and tacrolimus&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cyclosporine-and-tacrolimus-nephrotoxicity\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Cyclosporine and tacrolimus nephrotoxicity&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Most transplant centers approach hypertension with a stepwise approach, including limiting salt intake, assessing CNI serum levels, and modulating CNI dose if the level is inappropriately elevated. If antihypertensive medications are required, we suggest initiating therapy with a calcium channel blocker since part of the mechanism of hypertension is thought to be due to renal arteriolar vasoconstriction (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F81578\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef81578 \">table 6</a>). <a href=\"topic.htm?path=amlodipine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Amlodipine</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=felodipine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">felodipine</a>, and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nicardipine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">nicardipine</a> are preferred as first-line agents since they are long-acting, minimally interact with CNIs, and have limited side effects. First-generation calcium channel blockers (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nifedipine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">nifedipine</a> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=verapamil-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">verapamil</a>) may inhibit cytochrome P450, increasing CNI levels, and should be avoided. </p><p>Up to 30 percent of patients will require more than one agent to control their blood pressure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/liver-transplantation-in-adults-long-term-management-of-transplant-recipients/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. If calcium channel blockers are not effective or are not tolerated, we suggest the addition or substitution of a cardioselective beta blocker such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=metoprolol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">metoprolol</a> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=atenolol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">atenolol</a> (nonselective beta blockers may decrease portal blood flow). An angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor or angtioensin-2 receptor blocker (ARB) can also be used in patients with difficult-to-control hypertension and may have additional benefits in diabetic patients with microalbuminuria. However, ACE inhibitors and ARBs may have untoward effects on renal function in patients taking CNIs and may induce hyperkalemia, so they should therefore be used with caution. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=moderately-increased-albuminuria-microalbuminuria-in-type-2-diabetes-mellitus#H13\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Moderately increased albuminuria (microalbuminuria) in type 2 diabetes mellitus&quot;, section on 'ACE inhibitors and ARBs'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hypertension-after-renal-transplantation#H20\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Hypertension after renal transplantation&quot;, section on 'Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors/angiotensin receptor blockers and other agents'</a>.)</p><p>Diuretics are not used as primary therapy for hypertension due to concerns related to the potential to exacerbate electrolyte disturbances and dyslipidemias induced by CNIs.

The risk also appears to be increased in patients transplanted for hepatitis C virus [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/liver-transplantation-in-adults-long-term-management-of-transplant-recipients/abstract/25,26\" class=\"abstract_t\">25,26</a>]. To screen for diabetes we obtain fasting plasma glucose levels or hemoglobin A1C every six months. We also obtain annual eye examinations to look for cataracts or diabetic changes. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=screening-for-type-2-diabetes-mellitus\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Screening for type 2 diabetes mellitus&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Patients who are diabetic prior to transplantation typically require insulin following transplantation. In addition, 5 to 30 percent of recipients develop de novo diabetes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/liver-transplantation-in-adults-long-term-management-of-transplant-recipients/abstract/13,27-33\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,27-33</a>].

A meta-analysis that included 16 studies with 3813 liver transplant recipients found that the risk of developing de novo insulin-requiring diabetes was significantly higher among patients treated with tacrolimus compared with those treated with cyclosporine (relative risk 1.38; 95% CI 1.01-1.86) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/liver-transplantation-in-adults-long-term-management-of-transplant-recipients/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=new-onset-diabetes-after-transplant-nodat-in-renal-transplant-recipients\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;New-onset diabetes after transplant (NODAT) in renal transplant recipients&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The development of diabetes does not adversely affect survival in the first year following transplantation, but it is associated with decreased survival after 5 to 10 years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/liver-transplantation-in-adults-long-term-management-of-transplant-recipients/abstract/35-37\" class=\"abstract_t\">35-37</a>]. This was illustrated in a series in which 26 of 497 liver transplant recipients (5 percent) who developed diabetes mellitus post-transplantation were compared with matched nondiabetic post-transplantation controls [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/liver-transplantation-in-adults-long-term-management-of-transplant-recipients/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>]. The total number of days in the hospital, graft survival, renal function, and the type and number of infections were similar between the groups during the subsequent 12 months. However, increased 10-year mortality related to infection was reported in a cohort of liver transplant recipients with sustained new-onset diabetes compared with a group of patients with established diabetes pretransplant, transient post-transplantation diabetes, or without diabetes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/liver-transplantation-in-adults-long-term-management-of-transplant-recipients/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>]. Similarly, in a database study that looked at more than 35,000 patients who received a liver transplant and had at least five years of follow-up, development of diabetes mellitus post-transplant was associated with increased mortality (adjusted odds ratio 1.06; 95% CI 1.02-1.11) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/liver-transplantation-in-adults-long-term-management-of-transplant-recipients/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>].</p><p>The lack of deleterious effects of diabetes in the first year is important clinically because diet, weight loss, and tapering of immunosuppressant medications results in amelioration or resolution of de novo diabetes in many patients. In one series of 88 patients who were not diabetic prior to liver transplantation, the prevalence of diabetes fell from 27 percent at one year to 7 percent at three years, in association with a reduction in the mean daily <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prednisone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">prednisone</a> dose from 13 to 2 mg [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/liver-transplantation-in-adults-long-term-management-of-transplant-recipients/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>].

In the peri- and early postoperative period, insulin is generally required. In addition, modulating immunosuppression, including lowering or stopping glucocorticoids, may be of benefit. As steroids are tapered, treatment with lifestyle modification with or without oral hypoglycemic medications may be possible. Finally, switching from <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tacrolimus-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">tacrolimus</a> to <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cyclosporine-ciclosporin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cyclosporine</a> in patients with difficult-to-control diabetes following liver transplantation is also an option [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/liver-transplantation-in-adults-long-term-management-of-transplant-recipients/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>].

Excessive weight gain often leads to reduced physical activity, which predisposes to further weight gain and a sedentary lifestyle.

Thus, medical therapy is rarely indicated early in the course when steroid doses are relatively high. Treatment is indicated in patients whose dyslipidemia does not improve with steroid withdrawal. Treatment is similar to treatment in nontransplant recipients.

CNI-related acute renal failure is due to renal vasoconstriction and improves with dose reduction. Chronic renal disease can also be induced by these drugs, warranting continued monitoring of the plasma creatinine concentration and urinalysis.

Diseases that do not recur following liver transplantation include congenital anatomic anomalies (biliary atresia, polycystic liver disease, Caroli disease, Alagille syndrome, congenital hepatic fibrosis), metabolic diseases (Wilson disease, alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency), and acute hepatic insults (drug-induced liver failure), provided the source of injury is removed. However, all other causes of liver disease, including hepatitis B and C, primary biliary cirrhosis, primary sclerosing cholangitis, autoimmune hepatitis, nonalcoholic fatty liver disease, hemochromatosis, alcohol-associated liver disease, and hepatocellular carcinoma may recur after liver transplantation and can be associated with graft injury and failure.</p><p>The disorders most commonly associated with recurrence include hepatitis B virus (HBV) and hepatitis C virus (HCV). Fortunately, recurrence of HBV after liver transplantation can be prevented by administering <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hepatitis-b-immune-globulin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">hepatitis B immune globulin</a> at the time of transplantation and at regular intervals thereafter in combination with antivirals such as tenofovir or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=entecavir-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">entecavir</a>. Strategies to minimize or eliminate the use of hepatitis B immune globulin are evolving, including the use of entecavir or tenofovir. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=liver-transplantation-for-chronic-hepatitis-b-virus-infection#H20\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Liver transplantation for chronic hepatitis B virus infection&quot;, section on 'Management of recurrent HBV infection'</a>.)</p><p>By contrast, HCV recurrence following liver transplantation has been a significant source of morbidity and mortality. HCV viremia and histologic injury following transplantation is essentially universal. Although histologic injury in the allograft due to HCV is common, disease progression after the development of hepatitis is variable, with some patients experiencing indolent disease and others rapidly progressing to cirrhosis and liver failure. </p><p>Data are emerging regarding the use of oral interferon-free therapies using a combination of multiple drugs with different mechanisms of action (direct-acting antivirals [DAAs]). These therapies appear to be well tolerated and highly efficacious.
