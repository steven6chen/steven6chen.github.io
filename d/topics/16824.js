The term &quot;tardive&quot; differentiates these dyskinesias from acute dyskinesia, parkinsonism, and akathisia, which appear very soon after exposure to antipsychotic drugs.</p><p>This topic will review the etiology and epidemiology of TD. Other aspects of this condition are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tardive-dyskinesia-clinical-features-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Tardive dyskinesia: Clinical features and diagnosis&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tardive-dyskinesia-prevention-and-treatment\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Tardive dyskinesia: Prevention and treatment&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">ETIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>TD is a unique complication of antipsychotic drugs and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=metoclopramide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">metoclopramide</a>; convincing cases have not occurred after the chronic use of antidepressants or anti-anxiety medications [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tardive-dyskinesia-etiology-and-epidemiology/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Pathophysiology</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The prolonged and often irreversible course of TD suggests that structural cellular alterations in the brain are responsible for the disorder. However, pathologic studies in laboratory animals and humans have failed to demonstrate consistent findings following chronic exposure to antipsychotic drugs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tardive-dyskinesia-etiology-and-epidemiology/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].</p><p>The uniform capacity of antipsychotic drugs to block postsynaptic dopamine receptors seems a likely mechanism for the development of both antipsychotic drug-induced extrapyramidal reactions and TD. In animal models, repeated treatment with antipsychotic drugs leads to dopamine receptor supersensitivity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tardive-dyskinesia-etiology-and-epidemiology/abstract/1,4\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,4</a>]. In humans, there is evidence for upregulation of striatal dopamine receptors following chronic antipsychotic drug exposure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tardive-dyskinesia-etiology-and-epidemiology/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>], but correlation with clinical evidence of TD is uncertain. In addition, dopamine supersensitivity in animal models is a universal and rapidly appearing pharmacologic phenomenon that lasts for only several weeks. This raises some doubt about its relevance to TD in humans, where it is possible that more lasting structural changes in neurons or receptors may have taken place.</p><p>An updated version of the dopamine hypothesis suggests that an imbalance between D1 and D2 receptor-mediated effects in the basal ganglia may be responsible for TD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tardive-dyskinesia-etiology-and-epidemiology/abstract/6,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,7</a>]. According to this theory, traditional antipsychotic drugs preferentially block D2 receptors, resulting in excessive activity of D1-mediated striatopallidal output, altered firing patterns in medial globus pallidus, and eventual evolution of the clinical features of TD. This model explains the low tendency of the second-generation antipsychotic <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clozapine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">clozapine</a> to cause TD, since clozapine produces relatively less D2 and relatively more D1 blockade.</p><p>The development of TD may also involve changes in other basal ganglia neuronal systems. TD could result from loss of striatal interneurons that exert a feedback influence on nigrostriatal dopamine neurons and also form part of an efferent output pathway from the basal ganglia. Such interneurons may utilize gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), acetylcholine, or peptides as their neurotransmitter.</p><p>Of these possibilities, the GABA hypothesis has been given the most consideration. Chronic treatment of monkeys with antipsychotic drugs over a period of several years has produced persistent dyskinesia and reduced GABA and glutamic acid decarboxylase levels in several regions of the basal ganglia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tardive-dyskinesia-etiology-and-epidemiology/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. An excitotoxic mechanism may account for this selective destruction of a localized population of basal ganglia neurons [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tardive-dyskinesia-etiology-and-epidemiology/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. According to this hypothesis, chronic blockade of D2 receptors may lead to increased release of glutamate within the striatum, thereby causing excitotoxic destruction of striatopallidal GABA and peptide-containing neurons.</p><p>There are two potential mechanisms by which this might occur: first, interference with the inhibitory action of dopamine on corticostriatal terminal D2 receptors could cause excessive release of glutamate in the striatum, leading to degeneration of striatopallidal GABA and peptide neurons; second, blockade of nigrostriatal dopamine activity could, as in Parkinson disease, lead to increased firing of glutamate-mediated subthalamic neurons causing excitotoxic degeneration of globus pallidus neurons. A possible role of free radicals generated by increased neuronal dopamine turnover caused by antipsychotic drugs has also been considered [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tardive-dyskinesia-etiology-and-epidemiology/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. The major flaw in this hypothetical excitotoxic cascade is the lack of supporting pathologic evidence from animal and human brain tissue.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h1\">EPIDEMIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Prevalence estimates of TD at a specific time have several limitations when used to establish risks in different patient populations or in those with different treatment exposures. Antipsychotic drugs cause TD but can also mask its manifestations by their hypokinetic effects [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tardive-dyskinesia-etiology-and-epidemiology/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. The severity of TD often fluctuates with behavioral and emotional arousal [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tardive-dyskinesia-etiology-and-epidemiology/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>], and differences in population age, gender, treatment duration, and type and dose of antipsychotic drugs add complexity to the ascertainment process [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tardive-dyskinesia-etiology-and-epidemiology/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>].</p><p>Misclassification of spontaneous dyskinesia (ie, dyskinesia occurring independent of antipsychotic drug treatment) may inflate prevalence estimates of TD. Spontaneous orofacial dyskinesia are common in persons older than age 65 even without exposure to antipsychotic drugs; point-prevalence estimates have ranged from 3 to 77 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tardive-dyskinesia-etiology-and-epidemiology/abstract/14,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">14,15</a>].</p><p>The incidence of new cases of TD appearing in a population during a specified period of exposure is a better measure of risk than cross-sectional estimates of prevalence at a particular observation point. However, incidence data are much more difficult to acquire since they require repeated observations over time.</p><p>The prevalence and incidence data for TD associated with first-generation (conventional) antipsychotic drugs and second-generation antipsychotic drugs are reviewed in the following sections.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h1\">FIRST-GENERATION ANTIPSYCHOTIC DRUGS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>When first described in the 1960s, the frequency of TD was widely regarded to be low. This misperception was due to a failure of patients with chronic psychosis to complain of dyskinesia, and to the limited familiarity of movement disorders among psychiatric clinicians [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tardive-dyskinesia-etiology-and-epidemiology/abstract/12,16\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,16</a>]. By the late 1970s, it became apparent that the prevalence of TD was substantial, ranging from 5 to 45 percent in patients with psychiatric disorders [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tardive-dyskinesia-etiology-and-epidemiology/abstract/11,17\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,17</a>].</p><p>An influential report from 1982 analyzed 56 studies involving nearly 35,000 patients treated with antipsychotic drugs and estimated the overall prevalence of TD to be 20 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tardive-dyskinesia-etiology-and-epidemiology/abstract/18,19\" class=\"abstract_t\">18,19</a>]. In 19 studies involving 11,000 patients not exposed to antipsychotic drugs, the prevalence of spontaneous dyskinesia was approximately 5 percent, suggesting a best-estimate, corrected rate for antipsychotic drug-associated TD of about 15 percent (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=first-generation-antipsychotic-medications-pharmacology-administration-and-comparative-side-effects\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;First-generation antipsychotic medications: Pharmacology, administration, and comparative side effects&quot;</a>.).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Incidence of tardive dyskinesia</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Most prospective studies of patients treated with conventional antipsychotics suggest the annual incidence of TD is between 3 and 8 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tardive-dyskinesia-etiology-and-epidemiology/abstract/19-22\" class=\"abstract_t\">19-22</a>].</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Beginning in 1977, the Hillside study enrolled 908 consecutive patients (19 to 40 years old) who were admitted to a single psychiatric hospital in New York [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tardive-dyskinesia-etiology-and-epidemiology/abstract/20,21\" class=\"abstract_t\">20,21</a>].

It is commonly stated that these drugs have lower risks of causing acute dystonia and parkinsonism than the conventional antipsychotic drugs, and produce less cataleptic and other motor-inhibitory effects in laboratory animals.

Two patients (7.1 percent) developed TD that persisted for at least five years.

The following observations were reported:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Across all 11 studies, the mean annual incidence of TD associated with second-generation antipsychotic drugs was 2.1 percent.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>In three studies that directly compared treatment using a second-generation antipsychotic drug with a conventional antipsychotic (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=haloperidol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">haloperidol</a>) in young and middle-aged adults (mean age 39 years, range 18 to 65), the mean annual incidence of TD was approximately five- to sixfold lower with second-generation antipsychotic drugs than with haloperidol (&lt;1 percent versus 5.4 percent).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A later systematic review from the same investigators identified antipsychotic drug treatment studies of at least one-year duration published or presented from 2004 to 2007 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tardive-dyskinesia-etiology-and-epidemiology/abstract/43\" class=\"abstract_t\">43</a>]. Included were 12 studies with over 28,000 patients (mean age 40 years; dementia was the diagnosis in 92 percent) that reported TD incidence rates. The following observations were noted:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Across all studies and age groups, the annual incidence rate of TD was significantly lower with second-generation antipsychotic drugs than with conventional antipsychotic drugs (4.0 percent [95% CI 3.6-4.3] versus 5.5 percent [95% CI 5.1-6.1]).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>In six studies directly comparing second-generation antipsychotic drug treatment with conventional antipsychotics, there were 12,924 patients (mean age 51 years, range 25 to 83). The annual incidence rate of TD was again significantly lower with second-generation antipsychotic drugs than with conventional antipsychotic drugs (4.2 percent [95% CI 3.8-4.5] versus 5.5 percent [95% CI 5.0-6.1]).</p><p/><p>Thus, the earlier systematic review suggested that second-generation antipsychotic treatment reduced the risk of TD by up to sixfold compared with conventional agents [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tardive-dyskinesia-etiology-and-epidemiology/abstract/44\" class=\"abstract_t\">44</a>], while the later review suggests that the risk reduction is much less [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tardive-dyskinesia-etiology-and-epidemiology/abstract/43\" class=\"abstract_t\">43</a>]. However, these data are not definitive for the following reasons:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Most findings are based primarily on short-term studies not designed to address TD risk.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Few of the studies included specific neurologic assessments.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The studies included very few patients not previously exposed to conventional antipsychotic drugs that may also contribute to TD risk.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In the earlier systematic review, the three studies with a comparator used <a href=\"topic.htm?path=haloperidol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">haloperidol</a>, a high-potency conventional antipsychotic drug, sometimes given in relatively high doses [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tardive-dyskinesia-etiology-and-epidemiology/abstract/44\" class=\"abstract_t\">44</a>]. The later systematic review covering 2004 to 2007 included several studies that used moderately dosed, mid-potency conventional antipsychotics [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tardive-dyskinesia-etiology-and-epidemiology/abstract/43\" class=\"abstract_t\">43</a>]. Furthermore, most patients in the earlier systematic review had schizophrenia, while most in the later review had dementia.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A majority of the included studies in the 2004 to 2007 review used nonstandard definitions of TD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tardive-dyskinesia-etiology-and-epidemiology/abstract/43\" class=\"abstract_t\">43</a>].</p><p/><p>Interpretation of such findings is further complicated by spontaneous remission of TD over time and by suppression of dyskinetic symptoms by antipsychotic drug treatment, even with second-generation agents [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tardive-dyskinesia-etiology-and-epidemiology/abstract/25,45-47\" class=\"abstract_t\">25,45-47</a>], possibly resulting in a misleadingly low incidence of TD. However, since several prospective studies excluded patients with dyskinesia at baseline, suppression of TD is unlikely to entirely account for the lower rates of new TD cases observed during treatment with second-generation antipsychotic drugs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tardive-dyskinesia-etiology-and-epidemiology/abstract/44\" class=\"abstract_t\">44</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h2\">Conclusion</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>While the risk of TD is probably lower with most second-generation antipsychotic drugs than with high-potency conventional antipsychotic drugs, the risk with second-generation agents is not necessarily lower than that associated with low-potency conventional antipsychotic drugs taken at moderate doses [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tardive-dyskinesia-etiology-and-epidemiology/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>]. TD still occurs with second-generation agents other than <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clozapine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">clozapine</a>, possibly most often with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=risperidone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">risperidone</a> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=olanzapine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">olanzapine</a>&nbsp;[<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tardive-dyskinesia-etiology-and-epidemiology/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>].</p><p>Further studies of patients never treated with first-generation antipsychotic drugs and exposed to only a single second-generation antipsychotic drug are necessary to establish and quantify any hypothesized decline in the incidence of TD in association with use of particular drugs.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h1\">METOCLOPRAMIDE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span><a href=\"topic.htm?path=metoclopramide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Metoclopramide</a> is a dopamine receptor antagonist that blocks both D1 and D2 receptors in the central nervous system.

It is approved in the United States by the US Food and Drug Administration for short-term therapy (&le;12 weeks) of gastroesophageal reflux, and for treatment of diabetic gastroparesis (&le;8 weeks). However, gastroparesis is a chronic condition, and some patients have been exposed to long-term metoclopramide use.</p><p>Accumulating evidence, mainly retrospective, suggests that chronic <a href=\"topic.htm?path=metoclopramide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">metoclopramide</a> use is a major cause of TD in adults [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tardive-dyskinesia-etiology-and-epidemiology/abstract/2,48-51\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,48-51</a>].

Metoclopramide treatment was associated with a significantly increased risk of drug-induced parkinsonism (RR 4.0, 95% CI 1.5-10.5) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tardive-dyskinesia-etiology-and-epidemiology/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a study that included 10 patients treated with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=metoclopramide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">metoclopramide</a> who developed TD, the average duration of metoclopramide exposure before TD onset was approximately one year [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tardive-dyskinesia-etiology-and-epidemiology/abstract/50\" class=\"abstract_t\">50</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In some referral centers, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=metoclopramide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">metoclopramide</a> has replaced <a href=\"topic.htm?path=haloperidol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">haloperidol</a> as the medication most commonly associated with TD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tardive-dyskinesia-etiology-and-epidemiology/abstract/51\" class=\"abstract_t\">51</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14\"><span class=\"h1\">RISK FACTORS FOR TD</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Older age is the most robust risk factor for TD.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>One study found that the incidence of new cases of TD for patients exposed to conventional antipsychotic drugs was three to five times greater in patients above age 50 than in younger patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tardive-dyskinesia-etiology-and-epidemiology/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. In addition, the prevalence of TD was five to six times greater in patients older than age 65 when compared with younger patients.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In two systematic reviews evaluating second-generation antipsychotic drugs, the incidence of TD was very low in studies involving children, higher in studies involving predominantly middle-aged adults, and highest in studies involving older adults [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tardive-dyskinesia-etiology-and-epidemiology/abstract/43,44\" class=\"abstract_t\">43,44</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Rates of spontaneous TD remission decrease with increasing age [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tardive-dyskinesia-etiology-and-epidemiology/abstract/18,52\" class=\"abstract_t\">18,52</a>].</p><p/><p>Other factors that have been tentatively associated with greater prevalence of TD include female sex, brain damage, dementia, major affective disorder, diabetes, longer duration of antipsychotic drug exposure, use of anticholinergic-antiparkinson drugs, and a history of previous acute extrapyramidal reactions to antipsychotic drugs. Most of these associations are based on prevalence rather than incidence studies. Thus, their role as risk factors for TD is not firmly established.</p><p>Drug exposure by dose is particularly difficult to evaluate as a potential risk factor. Dosing may be an important risk factor in elderly patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tardive-dyskinesia-etiology-and-epidemiology/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>], but several retrospective studies have reported little difference in TD prevalence between moderate and high doses of conventional antipsychotic drugs, or between the daily equivalent of 300 and 3000 mg of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=chlorpromazine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">chlorpromazine</a>&nbsp;[<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tardive-dyskinesia-etiology-and-epidemiology/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. The risk of TD may already be maximal at chlorpromazine-equivalent doses of approximately 300 mg daily, which is in the mid-range of typical antipsychotic doses [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tardive-dyskinesia-etiology-and-epidemiology/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>].</p><p>In a prospective study, 57 patients with first-episode psychotic disorders and no evidence of TD at baseline were treated with low-dose <a href=\"topic.htm?path=haloperidol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">haloperidol</a> (mean 1.7 mg daily) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tardive-dyskinesia-etiology-and-epidemiology/abstract/53\" class=\"abstract_t\">53</a>]. At 12 months, dyskinesia developed in seven (12.3 percent). Although there was no control group, the incidence of apparent TD was similar to that in other prospective studies of TD incidence involving treatment with conventional antipsychotic drugs at standard doses.</p><p>In a prospective study of 9000 patients with schizophrenia, the presence of extrapyramidal symptoms (dystonia, akathisia, or parkinsonism) at baseline predicted an increased risk for the development of TD over one year of treatment with several different antipsychotics (hazard ratio 2.0, 95% CI 1.6-2.6) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tardive-dyskinesia-etiology-and-epidemiology/abstract/54\" class=\"abstract_t\">54</a>]. In the prospective Hillside studies, patients with a history of severe, early extrapyramidal reactions to antipsychotic drugs developed TD more frequently than those without early extrapyramidal reactions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tardive-dyskinesia-etiology-and-epidemiology/abstract/20,26\" class=\"abstract_t\">20,26</a>]. However, the high rates of acute extrapyramidal reactions may have reflected use of more potent antipsychotic drugs at relatively high doses.</p><p>Among older patients, a history of electroconvulsive treatment was a predictor of TD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tardive-dyskinesia-etiology-and-epidemiology/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>].
