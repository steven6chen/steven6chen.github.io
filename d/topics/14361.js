However, national surveillance data should be interpreted with caution because local resistance rates are closely linked with local antimicrobial usage patterns and patient type, and thus are highly variable. </p><p>In the United States, data on hospital-acquired infections from over 4500 hospitals have been collected through the National Healthcare Safety Network. From 2011 to 2014, the multidrug resistance rates among <em>P. aeruginosa </em>isolates at the participating sites were as follows [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/principles-of-antimicrobial-therapy-of-pseudomonas-aeruginosa-infections/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Ventilator-associated pneumonia &ndash; 20 percent (in 2012)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Central line-associated blood stream infection &ndash; 18 percent</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Catheter-associated urinary tract infection &ndash; 18 percent</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Surgical site infection &ndash; 4 percent</p><p/><p>Globally, the Study for Monitoring Antimicrobial Resistance Trends (SMART) has been collecting surveillance data on resistance among gram-negative pathogens isolated from intra-abdominal and urinary tract infections.

In North America between 2005 and 2010, resistance to fluoroquinolones increased from 22 to 33 percent, but resistance rates to imipenem, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=piperacillin-and-tazobactam-sodium-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">piperacillin-tazobactam</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cefepime-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cefepime</a>, and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ceftazidime-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ceftazidime</a> remained stable (20 to 26 percent). </p><p>Rates of resistance appear higher in resource-limited than in resource-rich settings. In a 2010 to 2015 study of <em>P. aeruginosa</em> device-associated bacteremia isolates collected from over 700 intensive care units (ICU) in 50 resource-limited countries, rates of resistance to <a href=\"topic.htm?path=amikacin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">amikacin</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=imipenem-and-cilastatin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">imipenem</a> were 30 and 44 percent, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/principles-of-antimicrobial-therapy-of-pseudomonas-aeruginosa-infections/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].

Such circumstances include the following:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>When signs of severe sepsis or septic shock are present</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Neutropenic patients with bacteremia</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Burn patients (who have a high incidence of multidrug-resistant <em>P. aeruginosa</em> infections) with serious infections</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In other settings where the incidence of resistance to the chosen antibiotic class is high (eg, &gt;10 to 15 percent)</p><p/><p>The rationale for using combination therapy in these settings is to increase the likelihood that empiric antibiotic therapy is active. (See <a href=\"#H6675759\" class=\"local\">'Ensure receipt of an active agent'</a> below.)</p><p>Empiric treatment with one agent active against <em>Pseudomonas</em> is appropriate for other infections in the absence of severe sepsis or shock.</p><p>As above, the choice of agents for empiric therapy depends on the site and severity of the infection, local resistance rates of <em>P. aeruginosa</em>, prior culture data, patient allergy history, and hospital formulary. If combination empiric therapy is used, two agents with different mechanisms of action should be chosen. In general, we use a beta-lactam as the first agent and an aminoglycoside as the second, provided there are no contraindications to its use. Aminoglycosides should be avoided in patients with renal insufficiency or in those hospitalized in institutions with a high percentage of <em>P. aeruginosa</em> resistant to aminoglycosides. In such cases, we use a fluoroquinolone as a second agent. One study suggested better outcomes when using a fluoroquinolone rather than an aminoglycoside as the second agent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/principles-of-antimicrobial-therapy-of-pseudomonas-aeruginosa-infections/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>], but further data are warranted before routinely favoring a fluoroquinolone over an aminoglycoside in this setting.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3016715\"><span class=\"h3\">Directed therapy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Once results of susceptibility are available, definitive therapy can be tailored accordingly. For most infections, definitive therapy with a single active agent is appropriate, as there is <strong>no</strong> convincing clinical data that demonstrate a mortality benefit to combination therapy. (See <a href=\"#H6675708\" class=\"local\">'Rationale'</a> below.) </p><p>Nevertheless, there are certain situations in which the morbidity and mortality or risk of emergent resistance are high enough that combination therapy are often used despite the paucity of clinically demonstrated benefit. Such circumstances include <em>P. aeruginosa</em> endocarditis and bacteremia in certain hosts. These are discussed in more detail elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pseudomonas-aeruginosa-bacteremia-and-endocarditis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pseudomonas aeruginosa bacteremia and endocarditis&quot;</a>.) </p><p>Additionally, initiation of a second antipseudomonal agent may be reasonable in infections that are slow or fail to respond to a single active agent, although there are few data to support this practice. </p><p>Combination antibiotic strategies for multidrug-resistant <em>P. aeruginosa</em> have also been evaluated in vitro and small studies, but clinical data are scant. If combination therapy is used for a multidrug-resistant organism, it should be done in consultation with an expert in treating such infections. (See <a href=\"#H6675731\" class=\"local\">'Strategies for multidrug-resistant organisms'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6675708\"><span class=\"h2\">Rationale</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The use of combination therapy in patients with serious <em>P. aeruginosa</em> infections remains controversial, largely because of the paucity of well controlled comparison trials using clinically important end points. There is no convincing clinical evidence that using two active agents instead of one leads to improved outcomes despite theoretical synergistic activity or decreases the risk of emergent resistance. However, using two agents for empiric therapy may increase the likelihood that an active agent will be used for a potentially resistant organism, and this, in turn, is associated with better outcomes for serious infections.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6675759\"><span class=\"h3\">Ensure receipt of an active agent</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The best rationale for the use of combination therapy is to provide initial broad spectrum of activity when there is risk for multidrug-resistant <em>P. aeruginosa </em>so that if the <em>P. aeruginosa</em> is resistant to one agent, it may be susceptible to the other. Delays in active antimicrobial therapy of <em>P. aeruginosa</em> infections have been associated with increased mortality, and the role of a second agent may thus be to cover possible resistant pathogens when resistance rates to the primary agent are high [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/principles-of-antimicrobial-therapy-of-pseudomonas-aeruginosa-infections/abstract/1,26-30\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,26-30</a>]. Delay in treatment has been linked to increased mortality even when a patient is considered clinically stable at the time of initial evaluation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/principles-of-antimicrobial-therapy-of-pseudomonas-aeruginosa-infections/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]. </p><p>This is a similar rationale to that used to support empiric combination therapy for gram-negative bacillary bacteremia in certain settings. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=gram-negative-bacillary-bacteremia-in-adults#H15\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Gram-negative bacillary bacteremia in adults&quot;, section on 'Indications and rationale for combination therapy'</a>.)</p><p>In one retrospective study of patients with <em>P. aeruginosa</em> ventilator-associated pneumonia, empiric combination therapy was associated with appropriate antibiotic therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/principles-of-antimicrobial-therapy-of-pseudomonas-aeruginosa-infections/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>]. A statistically significant impact on mortality was not demonstrated. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6675766\"><span class=\"h3\">Possible synergistic activity</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A commonly cited reason for use of combination therapy is the potential for synergistic activity against <em>P. aeruginosa</em> with two agents, which in turn can result in better outcomes than single drug therapy. However, there is no compelling evidence that two agents offer improved survival outcomes for treating <em>P. aeruginosa</em> infections. </p><p>Data on the use of combination versus single drug therapy for <em>P. aeruginosa</em> infections are mixed, but overall, the best current evidence suggests that there is no additional benefit of a second active agent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/principles-of-antimicrobial-therapy-of-pseudomonas-aeruginosa-infections/abstract/33-43\" class=\"abstract_t\">33-43</a>].</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a meta-analysis of 64 randomized trials that compared beta-lactam monotherapy with combination therapy with a beta-lactam and an aminoglycoside for over 7500 immunocompetent patients with sepsis of all-cause (bacteremia did not need to be present), there was no survival advantage with combination therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/principles-of-antimicrobial-therapy-of-pseudomonas-aeruginosa-infections/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>]. A lack of additional benefit was also observed in the subset of 426 patients with <em>P. aeruginosa</em> infection. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a meta-analysis of 2 randomized trials and 15 observational studies that included patients with documented gram-negative bacteremia, many of whom were immunocompromised, combination therapy was not associated with a mortality benefit overall [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/principles-of-antimicrobial-therapy-of-pseudomonas-aeruginosa-infections/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>]. However, among the subgroup of patients with <em>P. aeruginosa</em> bacteremia, there was a mortality benefit associated with combination therapy (OR 0.50; 95% CI 0.30-0.79). Of note, several of the studies that provided data on <em>P. aeruginosa</em> infections included aminoglycosides as a single agent in the monotherapy group, which is considered inadequate therapy, as below [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/principles-of-antimicrobial-therapy-of-pseudomonas-aeruginosa-infections/abstract/44\" class=\"abstract_t\">44</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Observational studies have also not supported an association between empiric or definitive combination therapy (generally with a beta-lactam plus an aminoglycoside or fluoroquinolone) and improved mortality [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/principles-of-antimicrobial-therapy-of-pseudomonas-aeruginosa-infections/abstract/43,45\" class=\"abstract_t\">43,45</a>]. In one study of patients with <em>P. aeruginosa</em> bacteremia, definitive combination therapy was associated with reduced 30-day mortality when <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ciprofloxacin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ciprofloxacin</a> was the second agent, but not when <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tobramycin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">tobramycin</a> was the second agent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/principles-of-antimicrobial-therapy-of-pseudomonas-aeruginosa-infections/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>].</p><p/><p>For the most part, these results are in contrast to a frequently quoted retrospective study analyzing data collected more than 20 years ago, which concluded that combination therapy was associated with a reduced mortality rate compared with monotherapy for <em>P. aeruginosa</em> bacteremia (27 versus 47 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/principles-of-antimicrobial-therapy-of-pseudomonas-aeruginosa-infections/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>]. However, questions about the validity of these results have arisen because of a number of methodologic problems, including the lack of randomization, the choice of therapy (which may have been influenced by the severity of illness), and the observation that monotherapy in the majority of patients consisted of an aminoglycoside, which is associated with a mortality as high as 70 to 80 percent when used for the treatment of <em>P. aeruginosa</em> bacteremia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/principles-of-antimicrobial-therapy-of-pseudomonas-aeruginosa-infections/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>]. </p><p>Although not all studies showed clear evidence for a survival benefit with the use of combination therapy, it is possible that it offers other clinical benefits. As an example, studies comparing combination therapy with monotherapy in pulmonary infections in patients with cystic fibrosis have shown no differences in outcome, but the density of bacteria was lower in the sputum, and the time to the next pulmonary infection requiring hospitalization was more prolonged in patients receiving combination therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/principles-of-antimicrobial-therapy-of-pseudomonas-aeruginosa-infections/abstract/46,47\" class=\"abstract_t\">46,47</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H371759537\"><span class=\"h3\">Prevent emergent resistance</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There is limited clinical evidence evaluating the ability of combination therapy to prevent the emergence of antimicrobial resistance in patients with <em>P. aeruginosa</em> bacteremia. </p><p>Emergence of resistance during therapy for <em>P. aeruginosa</em> infections can occur, resulting in increased rates of morbidity and mortality and higher costs. However, most studies of human <em>P. aeruginosa</em> infections have been underpowered to evaluate whether combination therapy can prevent emergent resistance. An observational study reported that resistant <em>P. aeruginosa</em> emerged in 10.2 percent of 271 cases during treatment with four individual antipseudomonal agents [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/principles-of-antimicrobial-therapy-of-pseudomonas-aeruginosa-infections/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ceftazidime-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Ceftazidime</a> was associated with the lowest risk and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=imipenem-and-cilastatin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">imipenem</a> with the highest risk. Addition of an aminoglycoside did not alter this risk.</p><p>This is in contrast to animal and in vitro studies that have suggested that combination therapy may alter this risk. As an example, combination therapy with two antipseudomonal antimicrobial agents limited the risk of emergence of resistant pseudomonal strains compared to monotherapy in an animal model of pseudomonal peritonitis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/principles-of-antimicrobial-therapy-of-pseudomonas-aeruginosa-infections/abstract/48,49\" class=\"abstract_t\">48,49</a>]. Additionally, an in vitro study suggested that <a href=\"topic.htm?path=levofloxacin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">levofloxacin</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=imipenem-and-cilastatin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">imipenem</a> might be an effective combination for preventing the emergence of resistance during treatment of <em>P. aeruginosa</em> infections [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/principles-of-antimicrobial-therapy-of-pseudomonas-aeruginosa-infections/abstract/50\" class=\"abstract_t\">50</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6675780\"><span class=\"h3\">Drawbacks</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The main drawbacks to combination therapy include additional cost and toxicity.

All infected catheters should be removed, and abscesses should be drained and obstructions relieved, whenever possible.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><em>P. aeruginosa</em> is intrinsically resistant to a number of antibiotics and can acquire resistance during therapy. These features limit the choices of antibiotics for <em>P. aeruginosa</em>. (See <a href=\"#H6674788\" class=\"local\">'Antimicrobial resistance'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A limited number of antimicrobial agents have reliable activity against <em>P. aeruginosa</em> isolates that have not acquired additional resistance mechanisms. Additionally, certain agents require higher dosing when used for presumptive or known <em>P. aeruginosa</em> infections (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F91115\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef91115 \">table 2</a>). Fluoroquinolones are the only class of antibiotics which has an oral formulation that is reliably active against <em>P. aeruginosa</em>. Aminoglycosides (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=gentamicin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">gentamicin</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tobramycin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">tobramycin</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=amikacin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">amikacin</a>) are active against <em>P. aeruginosa</em> but are generally not used as single agents because of inadequate clinical efficacy at most sites. (See <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Antibiotics with antipseudomonal activity'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The use of combination antimicrobial therapy in patients with serious <em>P. aeruginosa</em> infections remains controversial, largely because of the paucity of well controlled comparison trials using clinically important end points. There is no convincing clinical evidence that using two active agents instead of one leads to improved outcomes despite theoretical synergistic activity or decreases the risk of emergent resistance. However, using two agents for empiric therapy may increase the likelihood that an active agent will be used for a potentially resistant organism, and this, in turn, is associated with better outcomes for serious infections. (See <a href=\"#H6675708\" class=\"local\">'Rationale'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We typically reserve combination therapy for empiric treatment of serious infections known or suspected to be caused by <em>P. aeruginosa</em> that are associated with high mortality or when the risk of resistance is high. (See <a href=\"#H3016697\" class=\"local\">'Empiric therapy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Thus, for patients who have sepsis or septic shock, have neutropenia and bacteremia, have severe burns, or are in a setting where the incidence of resistance to the chosen antibiotic class is high (eg, &gt;10 to 15 percent), we suggest empiric therapy with a combination of two antipseudomonal agents (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). The two agents should be from different antibiotic classes, eg, a beta-lactam with an aminoglycoside or a quinolone.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>For patients without any of these additional risk factors for mortality or resistant organisms, we recommend empiric treatment with a single antipseudomonal agent (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=5\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2B</a>).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Once antimicrobial susceptibility data are available, we typically use a single active antipseudomonal agent. The rare exceptions when a combination regimen may be warranted include neutropenia and bacteremia, endocarditis, failure to improve on therapy, and multidrug resistance. (See <a href=\"#H3016715\" class=\"local\">'Directed therapy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Multidrug resistance in many organisms, including <em>P. aeruginosa</em>, is a growing clinical problem, and often treatment with alternative antibiotics, such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=colistin-colistimethate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">colistin</a>, is necessary. Certain strategies for treatment of resistant <em>P. aeruginosa</em> include the use of alternative drug combinations, and, for pneumonia, inhaled antibiotics as adjunctive therapy. However, the clinical data for some of these strategies are limited. Multidrug-resistant <em>P. aeruginosa</em> should be managed with the assistance of an expert in the treatment of such infections. (See <a href=\"#H6675731\" class=\"local\">'Strategies for multidrug-resistant organisms'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The general principles of antipseudomonal therapy in children are similar to those in adults with the main exception that antimicrobial dosing is weight-based.
