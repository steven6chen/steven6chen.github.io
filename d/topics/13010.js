The Greek words kakos, meaning &quot;bad things,&quot; and hexus, meaning &quot;state of being,&quot; have led to the term cachexia to describe this syndrome. Cachexia, a hypercatabolic state defined as accelerated loss of skeletal muscle in the context of a chronic inflammatory response, can occur in the setting of advanced cancer as well as in chronic infection, acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS), heart failure, rheumatoid arthritis, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-clinical-features-and-assessment-of-cancer-cachexia/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Although body composition changes are not identical in all of these disease states, the term cachexia is used in all of these settings.

However, the profound weight loss suffered by patients with cachexia cannot be entirely attributed to poor caloric intake. Insufficient oral intake is superimposed upon complex metabolic aberrations that lead to an increase in basal energy expenditure and culminate in a loss of lean body mass from skeletal muscle wasting. In contrast to simple starvation, which is characterized by a caloric deficiency that can be reversed with appropriate feeding, the weight loss of cachexia cannot be adequately treated with aggressive feeding.</p><p>This topic will review the definitions, pathogenesis, and clinical characteristics of cancer cachexia. Potential pharmacologic therapies for cancer-related <span class=\"nowrap\">anorexia/cachexia</span> syndrome and a separate discussion of assessment and management of <span class=\"nowrap\">anorexia/cachexia</span> in palliative care patients are discussed separately.

However, the measurement of body weight may underestimate the frequency of cachexia in patients who are <span class=\"nowrap\">overweight/obese,</span> or who have gained weight because of edema or a growing tumor mass [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-clinical-features-and-assessment-of-cancer-cachexia/abstract/6,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,7</a>]. As an example, largely because of the obesity epidemic in industrialized nations, cancer patients who historically were visibly cachectic with a body mass index (BMI) &lt;20 may not be discernible as cachectic and in fact, have a normal or increased BMI [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-clinical-features-and-assessment-of-cancer-cachexia/abstract/8,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,9</a>].</p><p>More recently, clinicians and researchers interested in cachexia have gathered formally to consider the definition of cachexia and its underlying or component elements as well as diagnostic criteria. The evolution of the concept of cachexia is expanding to encompass specific elements of body composition, functional consequences, and biochemical signs of specific metabolic change:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In 2007 at the Cachexia Consensus Conference, an expert panel agreed to the following definition [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-clinical-features-and-assessment-of-cancer-cachexia/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">&quot;Cachexia is a complex metabolic syndrome associated with underlying illness and characterized by loss of muscle with or without loss of fat mass. The prominent clinical feature of cachexia is weight loss in adults (corrected for fluid retention) or growth failure in children (excluding endocrine disorders). Anorexia, inflammation, insulin resistance, and increased muscle protein breakdown are frequently associated with cachexia. Cachexia is distinct from starvation, age-related loss of muscle mass, primary depression, malabsorption, and hyperthyroidism, and is associated with increased morbidity.&quot;</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Common findings in cachectic patients include anorexia or reduced nutritional intake, a systemic inflammatory response, decreased muscle strength, and fatigue [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-clinical-features-and-assessment-of-cancer-cachexia/abstract/6,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,11</a>]. Taking all of these factors into consideration, another proposed generic definition for <span class=\"nowrap\">cachexia/wasting</span> includes weight loss with or without fat loss, and as additional criteria (three of which are required for diagnosis), decreased muscle strength, reduced muscle mass, fatigue, anorexia, or biochemical alterations (anemia, evidence of an ongoing inflammatory response, low albumin) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-clinical-features-and-assessment-of-cancer-cachexia/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>More recently, an international group of researchers developed a definition and classification system for cachexia in cancer patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-clinical-features-and-assessment-of-cancer-cachexia/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. The criteria for cancer cachexia were weight loss greater than 5 percent, or weight loss greater than 2 percent in individuals already showing depletion according to current body weight and height BMI &lt;20 <span class=\"nowrap\">kg/m<sup>2</sup></span> or skeletal muscle mass (sarcopenia). These experts considered three stages, precachexia, cachexia, and refractory cachexia (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F90162\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef90162 \">figure 1</a>), with severity of nutritional depletion classified according to the degree of depletion of energy stores and body protein in combination with degree of ongoing weight loss. The five domains to be assessed for classification and clinical management were anorexia or reduced food intake, catabolic drive, stores depletion, muscle mass and strength, and functional and psychosocial impact. However, due to the lack of formal validated cachexia assessment instruments based upon these domains, malnutrition assessment tools can be used to assess cachexia.

Whereas most people with cachexia are sarcopenic (here defined as a loss of muscle mass), most sarcopenic individuals are not considered cachectic. Muscle loss without the loss in fat is known as sarcopenic obesity, which is prevalent in older adults [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-clinical-features-and-assessment-of-cancer-cachexia/abstract/14,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">14,15</a>] and is also noted in advanced cancer patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-clinical-features-and-assessment-of-cancer-cachexia/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. The causes of sarcopenia are multifactorial and can include disuse atrophy, changing endocrine function, chronic diseases, inflammation, insulin resistance, nutritional deficiencies, and some forms of cancer treatment, notably <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sorafenib-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">sorafenib</a> and androgen deprivation. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=geriatric-nutrition-nutritional-issues-in-older-adults#H6\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Geriatric nutrition: Nutritional issues in older adults&quot;, section on 'Undernutrition syndromes'</a>.)</p><p>Importantly, the above definitions serve a more important role in a research setting than in a clinical setting. In a clinical setting, such definitions should not detract from providing patients with optimal therapeutic and palliative care.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h1\">PATHOGENESIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Cachexia is a hypercatabolic state that appears to be defined in part by an accelerated loss of skeletal muscle in the context of an inflammatory response. A number of studies have focused on the mechanisms underlying the metabolic and body composition changes observed in cancer cachexia. They suggest a potentially important role for cytokine activation and for several tumor-derived and potentially cachexia-inducing substances, the target of which appears to be skeletal muscle gene products [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-clinical-features-and-assessment-of-cancer-cachexia/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Cytokines, inflammation, and the hypermetabolic state</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Increases in resting energy expenditure (REE, also called basal metabolic rate) may contribute to the energy deficits that lead to wasting. An increase in REE, as measured by indirect calorimetry, has been observed in patients with lung cancer [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-clinical-features-and-assessment-of-cancer-cachexia/abstract/18,19\" class=\"abstract_t\">18,19</a>], hematologic malignancies, and sarcomas [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-clinical-features-and-assessment-of-cancer-cachexia/abstract/20,21\" class=\"abstract_t\">20,21</a>], and is thought to contribute to the weight loss observed in cancer cachexia. In one series of patients with lung cancer, 74 percent had an elevation in REE, while 30 percent had a weight loss of 10 percent or more [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-clinical-features-and-assessment-of-cancer-cachexia/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. In contrast to this apparent hypermetabolic state, simple calorie restriction alone typically leads to a decline in REE [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-clinical-features-and-assessment-of-cancer-cachexia/abstract/22-24\" class=\"abstract_t\">22-24</a>].</p><p>A large number of observations point towards cytokines, polypeptides released mainly by immune cells, as responsible for some of the metabolic derangements associated with the hypermetabolic state that partially characterizes cancer cachexia. Because of their ability to increase REE [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-clinical-features-and-assessment-of-cancer-cachexia/abstract/25,26\" class=\"abstract_t\">25,26</a>] and induce anorexia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-clinical-features-and-assessment-of-cancer-cachexia/abstract/27,28\" class=\"abstract_t\">27,28</a>], tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), interleukin (IL)-1 beta, and IL-6 have been viewed as plausible mediators of cancer cachexia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-clinical-features-and-assessment-of-cancer-cachexia/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. Initial studies provided conflicting data as to whether an increase in serum cytokines occurs in cancer cachexia; the majority of studies have detected elevations in peripheral blood mononuclear cell cytokine concentrations, especially TNF-alpha and IL-6, among weight-losing patients with cancer [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-clinical-features-and-assessment-of-cancer-cachexia/abstract/30-34\" class=\"abstract_t\">30-34</a>]. TNF-alpha has also been implicated in weight loss in other settings such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nutritional-support-in-advanced-lung-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Nutritional support in advanced lung disease&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The possible role of cytokines in several different cancers has been demonstrated:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A study of 87 patients with non-small cell lung cancer found that 26 had lost more than 10 percent of their pre-illness weight [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-clinical-features-and-assessment-of-cancer-cachexia/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>]. The patients with weight loss manifested a significantly greater systemic inflammatory response characterized by increased plasma concentrations of soluble TNF receptor 55, IL-6, the acute phase reactant C-reactive protein, as well as other adhesion molecules.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a study of blood samples from 164 patients with prostate cancer, elevated serum IL-6 levels were observed in 38 patients with relapsed metastatic disease, compared with those with newly diagnosed prostate cancer or disease in remission [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-clinical-features-and-assessment-of-cancer-cachexia/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>]. Among the entire study population, high IL-6 levels were associated with lower serum albumin, total protein, serum hemoglobin, and body mass index (BMI), and also were associated with poor performance status. Among patients with relapsed disease, an elevated serum IL-6 level correlated with significantly shorter survivals.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Similar observations were made in cachectic patients with pancreatic cancer [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-clinical-features-and-assessment-of-cancer-cachexia/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>]. Hypermetabolic patients with evidence of an acute phase response had higher concentrations of TNF-alpha and IL-6 in peripheral blood mononuclear cells than patients without an acute inflammatory response.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>TWEAK (TNF-related weak inducer of apoptosis) is a cytokine that is related to the <span class=\"nowrap\">TNF/TNFR</span> superfamily. In preclinical work, its receptor, Fn14 (also called TWEAKR), when expressed in malignancies, appears to be associated with the development of cachexia. Moreover, antibodies that target Fn14 appear to improve survival in animal models, preventing loss of fat and muscle with no evidence of an antineoplastic effect [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-clinical-features-and-assessment-of-cancer-cachexia/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Additional evidence in support of the hypothesis that TNF-alpha, IL-1 beta, and IL-6 serve as mediators in cancer cachexia come from animal studies:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Administration of any of these cytokines to laboratory animals induces cachexia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-clinical-features-and-assessment-of-cancer-cachexia/abstract/37-39\" class=\"abstract_t\">37-39</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Pro-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-6 superfamily, TNF-alpha, IL-1, and others elicit anorexia, lipolysis, and muscle breakdown when injected systemically [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-clinical-features-and-assessment-of-cancer-cachexia/abstract/1,40-42\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,40-42</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>A large set of different transcription factors have been identified to play important roles in tissue wasting; many are activated by pro-inflammatory stimuli [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-clinical-features-and-assessment-of-cancer-cachexia/abstract/43-46\" class=\"abstract_t\">43-46</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>The cachexia in tumor-bearing animals can be partially attenuated by the administration of anti-cytokine antibodies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-clinical-features-and-assessment-of-cancer-cachexia/abstract/47-51\" class=\"abstract_t\">47-51</a>]. Similarly, transgenic IL-6 mice develop muscle atrophy, which can be reversed by anti-IL-6 receptor antibodies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-clinical-features-and-assessment-of-cancer-cachexia/abstract/50-52\" class=\"abstract_t\">50-52</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>In knockout mice lacking the gene for the TNF-alpha receptor type I protein, tumor implantation is not associated with the protein breakdown and muscle wasting seen in wild-type mice [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-clinical-features-and-assessment-of-cancer-cachexia/abstract/53\" class=\"abstract_t\">53</a>]. In mice, TNF activates the transcription factor nuclear factor kappa B, which inhibits the expression of MyoD, a factor normally required for muscle function and repair [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-clinical-features-and-assessment-of-cancer-cachexia/abstract/54\" class=\"abstract_t\">54</a>]. The wasting effect of these pro-inflammatory cytokines appears to be targeted against the myosin heavy chain of skeletal muscle [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-clinical-features-and-assessment-of-cancer-cachexia/abstract/55\" class=\"abstract_t\">55</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\">However, it should be noted that an etiologic role for TNF-alpha in cancer-associated <span class=\"nowrap\">anorexia/cachexia</span> syndrome is not entirely supported clinically. Clinical trials have shown a lack of benefit from treatment with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=etanercept-including-biosimilars-of-etanercept-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">etanercept</a>, a TNF-alpha inhibitor, in a randomized trial from the North Central Cancer Treatment Group.

One study evaluated 50 patients: 24 with cancer, 10 with Alzheimer disease with weight loss, nine with Alzheimer disease without weight loss, and seven healthy individuals [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-clinical-features-and-assessment-of-cancer-cachexia/abstract/57\" class=\"abstract_t\">57</a>].

It appears to be a 43-kilodalton proteoglycan similar in its amino acid sequence to Zn-alpha-2-glycoprotein, a ubiquitous protein whose function is largely unknown. In an animal model, administration of LMF stimulated glycerol release led to weight loss and caused a 42 percent reduction in carcass adiposity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-clinical-features-and-assessment-of-cancer-cachexia/abstract/59\" class=\"abstract_t\">59</a>].
