Non-HIV-associated EF has also been described as a rare side effect of medication, including chemotherapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hiv-associated-eosinophilic-folliculitis/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].</p><p>This topic reviews the presentation and management of HIV-associated EF. Bacterial folliculitis is discussed separately.

EF has been reported in HIV-infected men, women, and children [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hiv-associated-eosinophilic-folliculitis/abstract/7-9\" class=\"abstract_t\">7-9</a>]. The prevalence is uncertain, although one series of HIV patients reported folliculitis in 9 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hiv-associated-eosinophilic-folliculitis/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. In our experience, since the advent of antiretroviral therapy, EF has become less common.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">PATHOGENESIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The etiology of EF is unknown. Clinical characteristics of EF suggest that it may be an inflammatory disease related to immune dysregulation, perhaps in association with an underlying infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hiv-associated-eosinophilic-folliculitis/abstract/11,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,12</a>].</p><p>Etiologic hypotheses include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong><em>Demodex</em></strong><strong> mites </strong>&ndash; It has been suggested that <em>Demodex</em> may play a role in the pathogenesis of EF [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hiv-associated-eosinophilic-folliculitis/abstract/13,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,14</a>]. However, a case series of 18 patients found <em>Demodex</em> in only four, and in those four cases the mite was not associated with a surrounding inflammatory response, suggesting that it was not the cause of the folliculitis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hiv-associated-eosinophilic-folliculitis/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong><em>Pityrosporum</em></strong><strong> yeast </strong>&ndash; It has been hypothesized that HIV-infected persons with immunodysregulation could develop a hypersensitivity reaction to commensal follicular <em>Pityrosporum</em> organisms; however, histopathologic examination in 70 cases demonstrated appreciable yeast forms in just one case [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hiv-associated-eosinophilic-folliculitis/abstract/15,16\" class=\"abstract_t\">15,16</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Bacteria </strong>&ndash; Responses to antibiotics such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=metronidazole-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">metronidazole</a> have raised the possibility of a bacterial infection; however, bacteria are not consistently found in patients who respond to antibiotic treatment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hiv-associated-eosinophilic-folliculitis/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. Additionally, most patients do not get prolonged benefits from antibiotic therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hiv-associated-eosinophilic-folliculitis/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Autoimmunity </strong>&ndash; Based on the known association of autoimmune disease with HIV infection, and the sebaceous distribution of lesions in EF, it has been suggested that EF might be an autoimmune reaction to sebocytes or a constituent of sebum [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hiv-associated-eosinophilic-folliculitis/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h1\">RISK FACTORS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>HIV-associated EF was first described in patients with acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hiv-associated-eosinophilic-folliculitis/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>], and it typically occurs in late-stage disease. Patients typically have CD4 cell counts below 250 <span class=\"nowrap\">cells/mm<sup>3</sup></span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hiv-associated-eosinophilic-folliculitis/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>], with a mean CD4 count of 64 <span class=\"nowrap\">cells/mm<sup>3</sup></span> in a series of 18 patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hiv-associated-eosinophilic-folliculitis/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>], and a mean CD4 count of 116 <span class=\"nowrap\">cells/mm<sup>3</sup></span> in a series of 57 patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hiv-associated-eosinophilic-folliculitis/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL MANIFESTATIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>HIV-associated EF is characterized by recurrent, pruritic crops of discrete, erythematous, urticarial follicular papules and rare pustules, with a diameter of 3 to 5 mm (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F87125%7EDERM%2F54404\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef87125 graphicRef54404 \">picture 1A-B</a>).</p><p>The most common areas of involvement are the scalp, face, neck, and upper trunk; all are areas with a high concentration of sebaceous glands. In a series of 13 patients, all 13 had lesions on the trunk, 11 had lesions on the head and neck, and 8 had lesions on the proximal aspects of their extremities [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hiv-associated-eosinophilic-folliculitis/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Two main patterns of distribution were identified: lesions concentrated on the trunk with a few on the face; lesions predominantly on the forehead and beard areas with limited truncal involvement. Facial involvement may be particularly common in women with EF [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hiv-associated-eosinophilic-folliculitis/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>].</p><p>Intense, intractable pruritus is typical [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hiv-associated-eosinophilic-folliculitis/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. True pustules are rarely observed, as the lesions are typically so pruritic that the lesions are excoriated [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hiv-associated-eosinophilic-folliculitis/abstract/1,21\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,21</a>].</p><p>Peripheral eosinophilia and elevated serum IgE are seen in about 25 to 50 percent of patients with HIV-associated EF [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hiv-associated-eosinophilic-folliculitis/abstract/15,21\" class=\"abstract_t\">15,21</a>]. Because of this low sensitivity, these tests are not routinely performed for diagnosis.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H449688580\"><span class=\"h1\">HISTOPATHOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Common histopathologic findings of EF include perifollicular infiltrates of lymphocytes and eosinophils along with spongiosis of follicular epithelium [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hiv-associated-eosinophilic-folliculitis/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. The lymphocytic and eosinophilic infiltrate is often focused at the level of the isthmus, where the sebaceous gland and duct enter the follicle [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hiv-associated-eosinophilic-folliculitis/abstract/15,16\" class=\"abstract_t\">15,16</a>]. Lysis of sebaceous ducts can be seen.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h1\">DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Although the diagnosis can be strongly suspected clinically in patients with a low CD4 count and a pruritic follicular papular eruption on the upper body, skin biopsy is needed to confirm the diagnosis. Aside from HIV testing, serologic studies are not useful for diagnosis. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=infectious-folliculitis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Infectious folliculitis&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H449685756\"><span class=\"h2\">Biopsy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A 4 mm punch biopsy of an inflamed papule or pustule usually provides a sufficient specimen for evaluation. Key histopathologic findings that support EF include eosinophilic spongiosis involving the follicular epithelium and perifollicular inflammatory infiltrate containing lymphocytes and eosinophils. (See <a href=\"#H449688580\" class=\"local\">'Histopathology'</a> above and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=skin-biopsy-techniques#H12\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Skin biopsy techniques&quot;, section on 'Punch biopsy'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H449684813\"><span class=\"h1\">DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The differential diagnosis of EF includes other follicular or pruritic disorders. Some of the most common disorders requiring differentiation from EF include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Acne vulgaris </strong>&ndash; Acne vulgaris is a common condition that like EF presents with papules and pustules that are primarily distributed on the upper body (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F70809%7EPC%2F68412\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef70809 graphicRef68412 \">picture 2A-B</a>). Clinical features that suggest a diagnosis of acne vulgaris over EF include the presence of comedones and the absence of prominent pruritus. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pathogenesis-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-acne-vulgaris\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pathogenesis, clinical manifestations, and diagnosis of acne vulgaris&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Bacterial folliculitis </strong>&ndash; Bacterial folliculitis typically presents with erythematous papules and pustules at the sites of hair follicles (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F62930%7EDERM%2F50187\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef62930 graphicRef50187 \">picture 3A-B</a>). In contrast to bacterial folliculitis, intact pustules are rare in EF and EF pustules are typically smaller than pustules in bacterial folliculitis. Unlike the sterile pustules of EF, Gram stain and culture of bacterial folliculitis will demonstrate a causative organism. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=infectious-folliculitis#H604478849\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Infectious folliculitis&quot;, section on 'Bacterial folliculitis'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Biopsy is not usually necessary to distinguish EF from bacterial folliculitis. However, in a series that compared 52 specimens from 50 patients with HIV-associated EF with 6 specimens of suppurative folliculitis in patients with HIV infection, biopsies of EF were distinct from those of suppurative folliculitis in that suppurative folliculitis demonstrated a predominance of neutrophils and macrophages within the infiltrate, microorganisms were easily identified, and there was often rupture of the involved follicle (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F78005%7EPC%2F67192\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef78005 graphicRef67192 \">picture 4A-B</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hiv-associated-eosinophilic-folliculitis/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong><em>Pityrosporum</em></strong><strong> folliculitis </strong>&ndash; <em>Pityrosporum</em> folliculitis presents with follicle-based erythematous papules and pustules distributed on the upper body, but unlike EF, rarely involves the face. A potassium hydroxide (KOH) preparation demonstrating yeast forms supports the diagnosis (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F86997\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef86997 \">picture 5</a>). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=office-based-dermatologic-diagnostic-procedures#H4044416\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Office-based dermatologic diagnostic procedures&quot;, section on 'Potassium hydroxide preparation'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Pruritic papular eruption </strong>&ndash; Pruritic papular eruption (PPE) is an intensely pruritic skin condition seen commonly in people infected with HIV in Sub-Saharan Africa. Although the etiology is uncertain, there is some evidence that it involves an exaggerated reaction to arthropod bites (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F82671\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef82671 \">picture 6</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hiv-associated-eosinophilic-folliculitis/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. Patients present with skin-colored papules on the extremities, face, and trunk that are often excoriated [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hiv-associated-eosinophilic-folliculitis/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. Postinflammatory hyperpigmentation may also be present.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">The results of a small retrospective study suggest that histologic features and immunohistochemical stains may be of value for distinguishing EF from PPE [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hiv-associated-eosinophilic-folliculitis/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. Patients with EF demonstrated more intense inflammatory infiltrates, higher counts of tissue mast cells, and higher expression levels of CD15, CD4, and CD7. Additional studies are necessary to confirm these findings. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Scabies </strong>&ndash; Scabies can present as a widespread pruritic papular eruption (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F75169%7EDERM%2F64806\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef75169 graphicRef64806 \">picture 7A-B</a>). Recognition of classic areas of involvement (eg, interdigital areas), scabies burrows, or detection of the mite on a skin scraping are useful for the diagnosis of scabies. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=scabies-epidemiology-clinical-features-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Scabies: Epidemiology, clinical features, and diagnosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p>The main distinction is between EF and infective folliculitis. In a prospective study of 51 HIV-positive patients with pruritic folliculitis, histopathologic examination revealed evidence for EF in 23 (45 percent), bacterial folliculitis in 21 (41 percent), <em>Pityrosporum</em> folliculitis in 5 (10 percent), and<em> Demodex</em> folliculitis in 2 (4 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hiv-associated-eosinophilic-folliculitis/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. In addition, in a series of 23 HIV-infected patients with itchy folliculitis, 18 (78 percent) had EF and 5 (22 percent) had infective folliculitis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hiv-associated-eosinophilic-folliculitis/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>].</p><p>Other pruritic or pustular disorders such as atopic dermatitis, steroid folliculitis (also known as steroid acne (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F86994%7EDERM%2F86995\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef86994 graphicRef86995 \">picture 8A-B</a>)), papular urticaria, and drug eruptions may also enter the differential diagnosis. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=insect-bites#H4\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Insect bites&quot;, section on 'Papular urticaria'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h1\">TREATMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Unlike Ofuji's disease (EF in otherwise healthy individuals), human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-associated EF does not normally respond to <a href=\"topic.htm?path=indomethacin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">indomethacin</a> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hiv-associated-eosinophilic-folliculitis/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. Various treatments have been tried for HIV-associated EF, but there are no controlled trials comparing treatments with each other or with placebo, precluding definitive conclusions about the best approach to treatment.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H449687444\"><span class=\"h2\">First-line therapy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Antiretroviral treatment is our preferred first-line treatment for HIV-associated EF because patients in whom HIV infection responds to antiretroviral therapy generally show improvement or resolution of their EF. We also usually prescribe topical corticosteroids to aid with improvement in pruritus. We have not had much personal success with oral antihistamines for EF pruritus; however, other clinicians utilize this therapy.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H449684957\"><span class=\"h3\">Antiretroviral therapy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Although not formally studied in clinical trials, there is widespread recognition that HIV-associated EF improves or resolves in most patients treated with antiretroviral therapy (ART). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=selecting-antiretroviral-regimens-for-the-treatment-naive-hiv-infected-patient\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Selecting antiretroviral regimens for the treatment-na&iuml;ve HIV-infected patient&quot;</a>.) </p><p>However, there are case reports of EF flaring during the first two to six months of ART, consistent with immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (IRIS) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hiv-associated-eosinophilic-folliculitis/abstract/19,26\" class=\"abstract_t\">19,26</a>]. In a series of 34 cases of EF in patients on ART, 28 (82 percent) occurred within six months of initiating ART [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hiv-associated-eosinophilic-folliculitis/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>] (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=immune-reconstitution-inflammatory-syndrome\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome&quot;</a>). Patients who appear to have a flare of EF as a manifestation of IRIS are typically treated with another therapy for EF for a period of several weeks to months. (See <a href=\"#H449686143\" class=\"local\">'Second-line therapy'</a> below and <a href=\"#H449686618\" class=\"local\">'Third-line therapies'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h3\">Topical corticosteroids</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Potent topical corticosteroids (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F62402\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef62402 \">table 1</a>) are common first-line therapies for EF. However, data on the efficacy of topical corticosteroids are limited. Of the 38 patients with topical corticosteroid-treated HIV-associated EF identified in a review of articles published between 1965 and 2013, 47 percent had documentation of at least partial improvement with topical corticosteroid treatment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hiv-associated-eosinophilic-folliculitis/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. In general, topical corticosteroids can decrease pruritus and improve inflammation of existing lesions but do not suppress the development of new lesions and may not fully control symptoms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hiv-associated-eosinophilic-folliculitis/abstract/11,28\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,28</a>]. </p><p>We typically instruct patients to apply a potent topical corticosteroid (eg, group 2 or group 3 (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F62402\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef62402 \">table 1</a>)) to affected areas on the trunk and extremities twice daily for two to three weeks, after which the patient returns for reassessment. For facial involvement we prefer to use a lower-potency agent (eg, group 6 (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F62402\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef62402 \">table 1</a>)) to reduce the risk for local corticosteroid side effects. If satisfactory improvement in pruritus is achieved, we then instruct patients to taper the topical steroid. One example of a taper is to use the agent every other day, then every third day, and so on until the topical treatment is no longer needed. If improvement is insufficient, we then add a second-line therapy. (See <a href=\"#H449686143\" class=\"local\">'Second-line therapy'</a> below.)</p><p>Cutaneous atrophy is a common side effect of topical corticosteroid treatment that is particularly likely to occur with the use of potent topical corticosteroids. The adverse effects of topical corticosteroids are reviewed in greater detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=general-principles-of-dermatologic-therapy-and-topical-corticosteroid-use\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;General principles of dermatologic therapy and topical corticosteroid use&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h3\">Antihistamines</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A variety of H1 and H2 blocking agents, including <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hydroxyzine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">hydroxyzine</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=doxepin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">doxepin</a>, are also used as first-line treatments to control pruritus. A single case report of a patient successfully treated with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cetirizine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cetirizine</a> led the authors to hypothesize that antieosinophilic properties possessed by cetirizine may result in increased efficacy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hiv-associated-eosinophilic-folliculitis/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. In our experience, the efficacy of systemic antihistamines in patients with HIV-associated EF has been disappointing.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H449686143\"><span class=\"h2\">Second-line therapy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Phototherapy is a well-tolerated therapy that may improve EF in affected patients.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H449685994\"><span class=\"h3\">Phototherapy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Data from an uncontrolled study suggest that phototherapy with broadband ultraviolet B (UVB) is effective for HIV-associated EF [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hiv-associated-eosinophilic-folliculitis/abstract/30-32\" class=\"abstract_t\">30-32</a>]. In the study, which included 14 HIV-positive patients with eosinophilic folliculitis and 7 HIV-positive patients with primary pruritus, treatment of intractable pruritus with UVB phototherapy three times per week resulted in a statistically significant reduction in pruritus severity scores [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hiv-associated-eosinophilic-folliculitis/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>]. In addition, in a series of six patients with EF who were treated with thrice-weekly broadband UVB phototherapy sessions after not responding to other therapies, all patients reported a decrease in pruritus within the first nine treatment sessions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hiv-associated-eosinophilic-folliculitis/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. Narrowband UVB also appeared to improve HIV-associated EF in a case report; a woman who failed to respond to multiple other treatments experienced resolution of papules and pruritus with twice-weekly narrowband UVB treatments [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hiv-associated-eosinophilic-folliculitis/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>]. Improvement occurred within the first several treatments. However, recurrence of EF is likely after discontinuation of UVB treatment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hiv-associated-eosinophilic-folliculitis/abstract/30,34\" class=\"abstract_t\">30,34</a>].</p><p>When treating with UVB phototherapy, we typically administer broadband or narrowband UVB two to three times per week. A response is expected within the first two to three weeks. Once sufficient improvement is achieved, we attempt to taper treatments to the lowest effective frequency. If no response is evident within two months of treatment, we discontinue UVB phototherapy and consider other treatments.
