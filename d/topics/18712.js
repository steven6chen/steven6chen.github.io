Some children with rickets have legs that bend to the side, called &quot;bow-legs&quot; (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F86459\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef86459 \">picture 1</a>).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H97415217\"><span class=\"h1\">Is my baby or child at risk of getting too little vitamin D?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Maybe. If your baby only gets breast milk, or breast milk and some formula, he or she needs extra vitamin D. Breast milk has most of the nutrients a baby needs, but it does not have enough vitamin D in it.</p><p>Babies and children can also be at risk if they:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Have dark skin</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Do not drink enough milk or eat other foods with vitamin D in them</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Take certain medicines</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Were born premature</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Have a medical condition that makes it hard to get enough vitamin D, such as cystic fibrosis or celiac disease</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Spend most of their time inside or live in a place with little sun</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H97415234\"><span class=\"h1\">How can I make sure my baby or child gets enough vitamin D?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Vitamin D supplements are the best way to make sure your baby or child gets enough vitamin D for healthy bones. Supplements are pills, capsules, or liquids that have nutrients in them.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H97415251\"><span class=\"h1\">How much vitamin D does my baby or child need?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Experts recommend that all babies and children take 400 to 600 international units of vitamin D a day starting a few days after birth. If your child has a condition that makes it hard to get enough vitamin D, he or she might need to take more.</p><p>Talk to your child's doctor or nurse about which type of vitamin D to give your baby or child, how much, and when to give the supplements. The right dose will depend on your child's diet, whether he or she has any medical conditions, and other factors.</p><p>It is important not to give your child too much vitamin D. Giving too much vitamin D can make your child sick.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H97415268\"><span class=\"h1\">Is there a test for vitamin D?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Yes. Your child's doctor or nurse can do a blood test to check your child's vitamin D levels.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H97415285\"><span class=\"h1\">Can my baby or child get vitamin D from foods and drinks?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Yes. Foods and drinks that have a lot of vitamin D include (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F78586\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef78586 \">figure 1</a>):</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Baby formula, milk, orange juice, or yogurt with vitamin D added</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Cooked salmon or mackerel</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Canned tuna fish</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Cereals with vitamin D added</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Cod liver oil</p><p/><p>Your baby or child can also get vitamin D from the sun. The body uses sunlight that shines on the skin to make vitamin D. Playing outside can help your child exercise and get vitamin D at the same time. But it is important to ask your child's doctor or nurse how much sun is enough. Your child should wear sunscreen at least part of the time to prevent sunburn and other conditions caused by too much sun.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H97415319\"><span class=\"h1\">More on this topic</span></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=calcium-and-vitamin-d-for-bone-health-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Calcium and vitamin D for bone health (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=health-and-nutrition-for-women-who-breastfeed-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Health and nutrition for women who breastfeed (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=vitamin-d-deficiency-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Vitamin D deficiency (The Basics)</a></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=calcium-and-vitamin-d-for-bone-health-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Calcium and vitamin D for bone health (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=vitamin-d-deficiency-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Vitamin D deficiency (Beyond the Basics)</a></p></div><div id=\"reviewProcess\"><span>All topics are updated as new evidence becomes available and our <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/home/editorial-policy\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"policy policy_editorialpolicy\">peer review process</a> is complete.</span></div><div id=\"topicRetrievedDate\"><span class=\"emphasis\">This topic retrieved from UpToDate on: </span>Apr 02, 2018.</div><div id=\"disclaimer\">The content on the UpToDate website is not intended nor recommended as a substitute for medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.
