One or both ovaries and fallopian tubes may also be removed during the procedure (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F57901\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef57901 \">figure 2</a>).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">FEMALE ANATOMY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A brief review of female reproductive anatomy may be of help in understanding hysterectomy.</p><p>The uterus is a hollow, pear-shaped muscular organ located in the lower abdomen and pelvis (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F80271\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef80271 \">figure 3</a>). At the upper end of the uterus, the fallopian tubes open on each side. The outer end of each tube lays next to an ovary. The ovaries lay next to and slightly behind the uterus.</p><p>At its lower end, the uterus narrows and opens into the vagina. The lower end of the uterus is called the cervix.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">REASONS FOR ABDOMINAL HYSTERECTOMY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A hysterectomy may be recommended for a number of conditions. For some of these conditions, there may be an alternative to hysterectomy, described below. (See <a href=\"#H28\" class=\"local\">'Alternatives to hysterectomy'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Abnormal uterine bleeding</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Excessive uterine bleeding, called menorrhagia, can lead to anemia (low blood iron count), fatigue, and contribute to missed days at work or school. Menorrhagia is generally defined as bleeding that lasts longer than seven days or saturates more than one pad per hour for several hours. Abnormal uterine bleeding (or any uterine bleeding after menopause) can also be a sign of uterine cancer. All women with these symptoms should undergo evaluation.</p><p>Heavy or irregular bleeding are generally treated first with medication or other surgical alternatives to hysterectomy. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=heavy-or-prolonged-menstrual-bleeding-menorrhagia-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">&quot;Patient education: Heavy or prolonged menstrual bleeding (menorrhagia) (Beyond the Basics)&quot;</a>.) However, abnormal uterine bleeding that does not improve with conservative treatments may require hysterectomy.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Fibroids</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Fibroids (also known as leiomyoma) are noncancerous growths of uterine muscle that occur in up to one-third of all women. Fibroids may become larger during pregnancy, and typically shrink after menopause. They may cause excessive bleeding and pelvic pain or pressure. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=uterine-fibroids-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">&quot;Patient education: Uterine fibroids (Beyond the Basics)&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Pelvic organ prolapse</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Pelvic organ prolapse occurs due to stretching and weakening of the pelvic muscles and ligaments. This allows the uterus to fall (or prolapse) into the vagina. Prolapse is more common in women who have been pregnant, had vaginal childbirth, and in those with certain genetic factors, lifestyle factors (repeated heavy lifting over the lifetime), or chronic constipation.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Cervical abnormalities</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Hysterectomy is rarely needed for severe cervical precancer that does not resolve after other procedures (such as cone biopsy). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=follow-up-of-low-grade-abnormal-pap-tests-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">&quot;Patient education: Follow-up of low-grade abnormal Pap tests (Beyond the Basics)&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=follow-up-of-high-grade-abnormal-pap-tests-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">&quot;Patient education: Follow-up of high-grade abnormal Pap tests (Beyond the Basics)&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Endometrial hyperplasia</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Endometrial hyperplasia is the term used to describe excessive growth of the endometrium (the tissue that lines the uterus). It can sometimes lead to endometrial cancer. Although endometrial hyperplasia can often be treated with medication, a hysterectomy is sometimes needed or preferred to medical therapy.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h2\">Cancer</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Cancer of the uterus (endometrium), cervix, or ovaries may require hysterectomy. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cervical-cancer-treatment-early-stage-cancer-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">&quot;Patient education: Cervical cancer treatment; early-stage cancer (Beyond the Basics)&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=endometrial-cancer-treatment-after-surgery-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">&quot;Patient education: Endometrial cancer treatment after surgery (Beyond the Basics)&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=first-line-medical-treatment-of-epithelial-ovarian-cancer-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">&quot;Patient education: First-line medical treatment of epithelial ovarian cancer (Beyond the Basics)&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h2\">Severe bleeding after childbirth</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Hysterectomy may rarely be required in women who have uncontrollable bleeding after childbirth.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h2\">Chronic pelvic pain</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Chronic pelvic pain can be due to the effects of endometriosis or scarring (adhesions) in the pelvis and between pelvic organs. However, pelvic pain can also be caused by other sources, including the gastrointestinal and urinary systems. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=chronic-pelvic-pain-in-women-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">&quot;Patient education: Chronic pelvic pain in women (Beyond the Basics)&quot;</a>.) It is important for a woman with pelvic pain to ask about the probability that her pain will improve after hysterectomy.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h1\">PRE-OPERATIVE PLANNING AND EVALUATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Before surgery, there are two main decisions that need to be made about the procedure: whether the cervix should be removed and whether the ovaries and tubes should be removed. If the ovaries are removed, a woman may need to decide if she should take estrogen replacement therapy.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h2\">Supracervical/subtotal hysterectomy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A standard abdominal hysterectomy includes removal of the entire uterus and cervix. However, there are situations in which the entire uterus is not removed. A supracervical, subtotal, or partial hysterectomy refers to a procedure in which the cervix is left in place, while the top of the uterus is removed. Supracervical hysterectomy may be done if difficulties arise during surgery, making removal of the cervix complicated. Prior to planned supracervical hysterectomy, you should discuss the risks and benefits of leaving the cervix in place with your doctor.</p><p>Women who undergo supracervical hysterectomy must continue to have routine screening (Pap smear) for cervical cancer. Some women continue to have menstrual bleeding since the retained cervix is attached to a small remaining portion of the uterus.</p><p>There was initial concern that removing the cervix would interfere with sexual satisfaction. However, studies have demonstrated that sexual satisfaction does not appear to differ after hysterectomy between women with and without a cervix.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14\"><span class=\"h2\">Removal of ovaries</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The ovaries may be removed during hysterectomy, a procedure known as an oophorectomy. Oophorectomy is not always required; the decision depends upon several considerations.</p><p>Premenopausal women may decide to keep the ovaries to provide a continued, natural source of hormones, including estrogen, progesterone, and testosterone. These hormones are important in maintaining sexual interest and preventing hot flashes and loss of bone density loss. On the other hand, women who have menstrual cycle-related migraines, epilepsy, or severe premenstrual syndrome (PMS) may have an improvement in symptoms when hormone levels are reduced by removing the ovaries. Discuss the risks and preferences of removing the ovaries with your doctor before surgery.</p><p>Postmenopausal women are often advised to have their ovaries removed because of a small risk of developing ovarian cancer at some point during their lifetime. The benefits of removing or keeping ovaries should be discussed with a physician.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15\"><span class=\"h2\">Estrogen therapy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Estrogen therapy (ET) may be recommended after surgery for women who have not reached menopause who had their ovaries removed. ET can help to prevent hot flashes, night sweats, and loss of bone density, which may occur when the ovaries are surgically removed. Women who plan to use ET should talk with their clinician about the risks and benefits, and about how long to use this treatment. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=early-menopause-primary-ovarian-insufficiency-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">&quot;Patient education: Early menopause (primary ovarian insufficiency) (Beyond the Basics)&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Women who have completed menopause generally do not require ET after hysterectomy. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=menopausal-hormone-therapy-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">&quot;Patient education: Menopausal hormone therapy (Beyond the Basics)&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H16\"><span class=\"h2\">Pre-operative testing</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Standard pre-operative testing may include a physical examination, EKG, chest x-ray, and blood testing, depending upon age and other medical conditions.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H17\"><span class=\"h1\">ABDOMINAL HYSTERECTOMY PROCEDURE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Abdominal hysterectomy is performed in a hospital setting, and generally requires approximately two hours in the operating room. Patients are given general or spinal anesthesia plus sedation so that they feel no pain. Heart rate, blood pressure, blood loss, and respiration are closely observed throughout the procedure. After surgery, patients are transferred to the recovery room (also known as the post-anesthesia care unit) so that they can be monitored while waking up. Most patients will then be transferred to a hospital room, where they will spend one to two nights.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H18\"><span class=\"h1\">ABDOMINAL HYSTERECTOMY COMPLICATIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A number of complications can occur as a result of hysterectomy. Fortunately, most can be easily managed and do not cause long-term problems.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H19\"><span class=\"h2\">Hemorrhage</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Excessive bleeding (hemorrhage) occurs in a small number of cases and may require a return to the operating room to identify and stop the bleeding.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H20\"><span class=\"h2\">Infection</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Low-grade fever is common after hysterectomy, is not always caused by infection, and usually resolves without treatment. However, a high or persistent fever may signal an infection. Serious infection occurs in less than ten percent of women, and can usually be treated with intravenous antibiotics. Much less commonly, patients require another surgical procedure.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H21\"><span class=\"h2\">Constipation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Constipation occurs in most women following hysterectomy, and can usually be controlled with a regimen of stool softeners, dietary fiber, and laxatives.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H22\"><span class=\"h2\">Urinary retention</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Urinary retention, or the inability to pass urine, can occur after abdominal hysterectomy. It is more common in women who have vaginal hysterectomy. (See <a href=\"#H28\" class=\"local\">'Alternatives to hysterectomy'</a> below.) Urine can be drained using a catheter until retention resolves, usually within 24 to 48 hours.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H23\"><span class=\"h2\">Blood clots</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Pelvic surgery increases the risk of developing blood clots in the large veins of the leg or lung. The risk is increased for approximately six weeks after surgery. Medications may be given to some women to prevent blood clots. In addition, women taking oral contraceptives or hormone replacement should ideally discontinue them prior to surgery since they can further increase the risk of blood clots. Women who are sexually active and premenopausal should use alternative methods of birth control (e.g. condoms) to prevent pregnancy before surgery. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=deep-vein-thrombosis-dvt-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">&quot;Patient education: Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) (Beyond the Basics)&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H24\"><span class=\"h2\">Damage to adjacent organs</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The urinary bladder, ureters (small tubes leading from the kidneys to the bladder), and large and small intestines are located in the lower abdomen and pelvis and can be injured during hysterectomy. Injury occurs in less than one percent of all women undergoing hysterectomy, and can usually be detected and corrected at the time of surgery. If detected after surgery, another operation may be needed.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H25\"><span class=\"h2\">Early menopause</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Women who have undergone hysterectomy may experience menopause earlier than the average age of menopause (age 51). This may be due to an interruption in blood flow to the ovaries as a result of removing the uterus.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H26\"><span class=\"h1\">RECOVERY AFTER ABDOMINAL HYSTERECTOMY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Fluids and food are generally offered soon after surgery. Intravenous (IV) fluids may be administered during the first day, particularly if there is nausea or vomiting. Pain medicine is given as needed, either intravenously, or by intramuscular (IM) injection, or as a pill. Patients are encouraged to resume their normal daily activities as soon as possible. Being active is particularly important since it helps to prevent complications, such as blood clots, pneumonia, and gas pains.</p><p>More information about recovery from hysterectomy is available separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=care-after-gynecologic-surgery-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">&quot;Patient education: Care after gynecologic surgery (Beyond the Basics)&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H27\"><span class=\"h1\">LIFE AFTER ABDOMINAL HYSTERECTOMY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Studies of women's response to hysterectomy show that most women are satisfied with their results (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F68886\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef68886 \">table 1</a>). Most reported improvement in symptoms, such as pain and vaginal bleeding.</p><p>Sexual function and enjoyment, interest in sex, and pain with sex were improved for most women. However, this improvement may depend upon several factors, including the age of a woman at the time of surgery, the reason for surgery, and history of any prior difficulties with mood.</p><p>Younger women may grieve after hysterectomy due to their loss of fertility. A woman who has new feelings of sadness, anxiety, or depression after surgery should speak with her healthcare provider. These feelings may be treated by talking with a therapist, with antidepressant medication, or may resolve with time. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=early-menopause-primary-ovarian-insufficiency-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">&quot;Patient education: Early menopause (primary ovarian insufficiency) (Beyond the Basics)&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H28\"><span class=\"h1\">ALTERNATIVES TO HYSTERECTOMY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Women who wish to avoid or postpone hysterectomy may be able to use medications or less invasive surgical procedures. Medical and surgical alternatives to hysterectomy depend upon the underlying disorder. The decision as to which treatment is &quot;best&quot; should be based upon a woman's particular medical problem, all available treatment options, and the risks and benefits of each type of treatment.</p><p>Some alternatives to abdominal hysterectomy include the following:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In some cases the uterus may be removed through the vagina, avoiding the need for an incision in the abdomen. This procedure is called a vaginal hysterectomy. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=vaginal-hysterectomy-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">&quot;Patient education: Vaginal hysterectomy (Beyond the Basics)&quot;</a>.) A vaginal approach may be used if the uterus is not too big, there is not too much scar tissue, and if the condition prompting the surgery is benign and limited to the uterus. Most women can return to normal activities sooner after a vaginal hysterectomy than after an abdominal hysterectomy.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Uterine artery embolization and myomectomy may be used to treat symptomatic leiomyoma (fibroids). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=uterine-fibroids-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">&quot;Patient education: Uterine fibroids (Beyond the Basics)&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pain clinics may be able to treat patients with severe and chronic pelvic pain without surgery. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=chronic-pelvic-pain-in-women-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">&quot;Patient education: Chronic pelvic pain in women (Beyond the Basics)&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Endometrial ablation, in which a physician destroys or removes most of the endometrium using an instrument inserted through the vagina and cervix and into the uterus. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=heavy-or-prolonged-menstrual-bleeding-menorrhagia-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">&quot;Patient education: Heavy or prolonged menstrual bleeding (menorrhagia) (Beyond the Basics)&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Medical therapy using hormonal medications, such GnRH analogs (for example, leuprolide) or progestins can help reduce the pain associated with endometriosis. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=endometriosis-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">&quot;Patient education: Endometriosis (Beyond the Basics)&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Cone biopsy (eg, cold knife cone), cryosurgery, laser surgery, or loop electrocautery (eg, LEEP or LLETZ) are usually used to treat women with cervical dysplasia (an abnormal Pap smear). These procedures remove the abnormal part of the cervix rather than the entire cervix and uterus (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cervical-cancer-screening-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">&quot;Patient education: Cervical cancer screening (Beyond the Basics)&quot;</a>).</p><p/><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H29\"><span class=\"h1\">WHERE TO GET MORE INFORMATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Your healthcare provider is the best source of information for questions and concerns related to your medical problem.</p><p>This article will be updated as needed on our web site (<a href=\"http://www.uptodate.com/patients&amp;token=nygaOTnDuGxGrKiuwLIxjMIsa91xyzRx3QvmgfDh4FTTVfpiGy3XGWFyzaLmJXXU&amp;TOPIC_ID=8404\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">www.uptodate.com/patients</a>).
