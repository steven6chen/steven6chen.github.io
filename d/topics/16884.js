Certain CD4 T cell thresholds are used as benchmarks to either initiate prophylaxis against opportunistic infections (OIs) <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> to begin antiretroviral therapy (ART). The CD4 cell count is also a relatively consistent indicator of treatment response [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/techniques-and-interpretation-of-measurement-of-the-cd4-cell-count-in-hiv-infected-patients/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Thus, it is important for clinicians to learn about the techniques and interpretation of flow cytometry and to understand the factors that may lead to variations in test results. </p><p>This topic will address flow cytometry and other techniques for measuring CD4 T cells and the various factors that can affect CD4 cell counts, such as medications, infections, and other conditions. Issues related to the immunology and pathogenesis of HIV infection and the use of HIV RNA testing are discussed elsewhere. Guidance on when to start ART or OI prophylaxis is discussed elsewhere.

Helper T lymphocytes express cluster determinant 4 (abbreviated as &quot;CD4&quot;) whereas cytotoxic T cells express cluster determinant 8 (abbreviated as &quot;CD8&quot;). The CD4 and CD8 molecules are members of the immunoglobulin superfamily and mediate adhesion to major histocompatibility complex class II and class I molecules, respectively. In addition, CD4 and CD8 amplify stimulatory signals through the T cell receptor [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/techniques-and-interpretation-of-measurement-of-the-cd4-cell-count-in-hiv-infected-patients/abstract/2-4\" class=\"abstract_t\">2-4</a>]. </p><p>A CD4:CD8 ratio is calculated by dividing the number of CD4+ T cells by the number of CD8+ T cells; this ratio is usually greater than 1 in immunocompetent individuals [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/techniques-and-interpretation-of-measurement-of-the-cd4-cell-count-in-hiv-infected-patients/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. However, in HIV infection, the CD4:CD8 ratio is usually less than 1. This reflects increasing numbers of CD8+ T cells and depletion of CD4+ T cells in chronic infection. This ratio usually increases with the initiation of antiretroviral therapy (ART) although the CD4:CD8 ratio normalizes in only a minority of patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/techniques-and-interpretation-of-measurement-of-the-cd4-cell-count-in-hiv-infected-patients/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H801004\"><span class=\"h2\">How does HIV affect CD4 T cells?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>HIV infection leads to severe depletion of CD4 T cells in the gut-associated lymphoid tissue with subsequent reduced levels of circulating CD4 lymphocytes in the peripheral blood [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/techniques-and-interpretation-of-measurement-of-the-cd4-cell-count-in-hiv-infected-patients/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. CD4 cells are reduced precipitously in acute HIV infection, but usually rebound in the blood over several weeks as HIV-specific CD8 T cells help to lower plasma viremia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/techniques-and-interpretation-of-measurement-of-the-cd4-cell-count-in-hiv-infected-patients/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. In the untreated patient, CD4 T cells subsequently decline over several years. Population-based studies of the natural history of HIV infection among men who have sex with men (MSM) show that the mean CD4 count prior to seroconversion is about 1000 <span class=\"nowrap\">cells/microL;</span> CD4 counts decline to a mean of 780 <span class=\"nowrap\">cells/microL</span> at six months post-seroconversion and to 670 <span class=\"nowrap\">cells/microL</span> at one year of follow-up [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/techniques-and-interpretation-of-measurement-of-the-cd4-cell-count-in-hiv-infected-patients/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. Subsequently, the CD4 cell count declines at an average yearly rate of approximately 50 <span class=\"nowrap\">cells/microL,</span> but there is substantial variation among patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/techniques-and-interpretation-of-measurement-of-the-cd4-cell-count-in-hiv-infected-patients/abstract/9-11\" class=\"abstract_t\">9-11</a>]. Significant depletion of CD4 T cells can lead to opportunistic infections and mortality in the untreated patient. The stages and natural history of HIV infection are discussed elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=the-natural-history-and-clinical-features-of-hiv-infection-in-adults-and-adolescents\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;The natural history and clinical features of HIV infection in adults and adolescents&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">MECHANISMS OF CD4 T CELL DEPLETION IN HIV INFECTION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Although other viruses can infect CD4 T cells, HIV selectively targets and infects activated, expanding CD4 T cells [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/techniques-and-interpretation-of-measurement-of-the-cd4-cell-count-in-hiv-infected-patients/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>].</p><p>During acute infection, viral replication occurs at an extremely rapid rate, often producing the highest level of circulating virus observed at any time during infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/techniques-and-interpretation-of-measurement-of-the-cd4-cell-count-in-hiv-infected-patients/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. Rapidly proliferating virus-specific CD4 T cells become activated and expand in the presence of high viremia, resulting in subsequent infection, functional impairment, and death of these CD4 T cells. Viremia declines with the recruitment of HIV-specific CD8 T cells (host immune response) and depletion of the pool of susceptible CD4 cells.</p><p>Within the first weeks of infection there is a massive loss of T cells in the gut-associated mucosa associated with disruption of mucosal integrity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/techniques-and-interpretation-of-measurement-of-the-cd4-cell-count-in-hiv-infected-patients/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. This is followed by a progressive loss of CD4 cells in the peripheral blood, which is a hallmark of HIV infection. Disruption of the integrity of the gut mucosa is associated with translocation of microbial products from the gut, including lipopolysaccharide (LPS) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/techniques-and-interpretation-of-measurement-of-the-cd4-cell-count-in-hiv-infected-patients/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. This &quot;leaky gut&quot; is associated with chronic immune activation, as evidenced by markers of T cell activation (ie, CD38 and HLA-DR) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/techniques-and-interpretation-of-measurement-of-the-cd4-cell-count-in-hiv-infected-patients/abstract/15-17\" class=\"abstract_t\">15-17</a>]. Chronic activation of the immune system is a hallmark of progressive HIV infection and may be a better predictor of disease outcome than plasma viral load. Unlike viral load, however, immune activation cannot be readily measured in clinical practice. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=techniques-and-interpretation-of-hiv-1-rna-quantitation\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Techniques and interpretation of HIV-1 RNA quantitation&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Treatment with antiretroviral therapy leads to viral suppression and immunologic improvement; the extent of the immune recovery is dependent on the degree of immune compromise prior to treatment. Incomplete immunologic recovery among patients with advanced disease may be related to collagen formation in the gut and lymphoid tissues leading to disruption of normal architecture [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/techniques-and-interpretation-of-measurement-of-the-cd4-cell-count-in-hiv-infected-patients/abstract/18,19\" class=\"abstract_t\">18,19</a>].

These systems perform well compared with standard flow cytometry and are cheaper and less technically demanding [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/techniques-and-interpretation-of-measurement-of-the-cd4-cell-count-in-hiv-infected-patients/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. </p><p>Absolute counts may differ when different assays are used, or even when done by the same test in different laboratories [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/techniques-and-interpretation-of-measurement-of-the-cd4-cell-count-in-hiv-infected-patients/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. As a result, sequential samples that are processed using different methods or by different laboratories should be interpreted with caution.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H801717\"><span class=\"h2\">What is a normal CD4 cell count?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The normal adult CD4 count for most laboratories falls in a range of 800 to 1050 <span class=\"nowrap\">cells/microL;</span> however, when considering laboratory variations of two standard deviations, the normal CD4 count range falls within 500 to 1400 <span class=\"nowrap\">cells/microL</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/techniques-and-interpretation-of-measurement-of-the-cd4-cell-count-in-hiv-infected-patients/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. This broad range in normal values reflects the fact that the CD4 cell count is the product of three variables: the white blood cell count, the percentage of lymphocytes, and the percentage of lymphocytes that bears the CD4 receptor. (See <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Variability of CD4 cell counts'</a> below.)</p><p>Laboratory testing also reports CD4:CD8 ratios, which are usually greater than 1 in a normal host.

In general, these two numbers are concordant; corresponding values are listed below:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>An absolute CD4 count &gt;500 <span class=\"nowrap\">cells/microL</span> corresponds to a CD4 percentage of &gt;29 percent</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>An absolute CD4 count between 200 to 500 <span class=\"nowrap\">cells/microL</span> corresponds to a CD4 percentage of 14 to 28 percent</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>An absolute CD4 count &lt;200 <span class=\"nowrap\">cells/microL</span> corresponds to a CD4 percentage of &lt;14 percent</p><p/><p>Laboratory testing in HIV-infected patients typically demonstrates an inversed CD4:CD8 ratio of &lt;1. It is important for clinicians to be aware that significant changes in the total WBC will have an effect on the absolute CD4 cell count, while the CD4 percentage will remain the same. (See <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Variability of CD4 cell counts'</a> below.)</p><p>HIV-infected patients with a CD4 count &lt;200 <span class=\"nowrap\">cells/microL</span> are classified as having AIDS and are at risk for opportunistic infections.

Significant changes in the total WBC can lead to marked changes in the absolute CD4 cell count. Certain medications or infections associated with leukopenia may result in depression of the absolute CD4 cell count. In contrast, specific medications or infections which lead to leukocytosis can result in elevated CD4 cell counts. In such cases, the absolute CD4 cell count and percentage may be discordant. These types of changes do not indicate a true change in the patient&rsquo;s immunologic status per se and should be interpreted with caution. If the CD4 cell count changes dramatically without significant changes in the CD4 percentage, the clinician needs to assess other factors that may be leading to artifactual changes in the absolute count. Flow cytometry results that would lead to a therapeutic intervention may need confirmation if the result is dramatically different from a prior result performed within three to six months. </p><p>The CD4 cell percentage is sometimes used in preference to the absolute number since there is less variation with this parameter [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/techniques-and-interpretation-of-measurement-of-the-cd4-cell-count-in-hiv-infected-patients/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. In the AIDS Clinical Trial Group laboratories, the within-subject coefficient of variation for the CD4 percentage was 18 percent compared with 25 percent for the CD4 cell count [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/techniques-and-interpretation-of-measurement-of-the-cd4-cell-count-in-hiv-infected-patients/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>].</p><p>Even among healthy adults, there are seasonal or month-to-month changes in the CD4 cell count [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/techniques-and-interpretation-of-measurement-of-the-cd4-cell-count-in-hiv-infected-patients/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. There are also diurnal changes with the lowest levels of CD4 cell counts in the evening and peak values in the morning [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/techniques-and-interpretation-of-measurement-of-the-cd4-cell-count-in-hiv-infected-patients/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>].

(See <a href=\"#H1\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In the untreated HIV-infected patient, CD4 T cells subsequently decline over several years. Significant depletion of CD4 T cells can lead to opportunistic infections and mortality in the untreated patient. (See <a href=\"#H800928\" class=\"local\">'Background'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>During acute infection, virus titers are extremely high. Rapidly proliferating virus-specific CD4 T cells become activated and expand in the presence of high viremia, resulting in subsequent infection, functional impairment, and death of CD4 T cells. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Mechanisms of CD4 T cell depletion in HIV infection'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The normal CD4 count for most laboratories falls in a range of 800 to 1050 <span class=\"nowrap\">cells/microL</span>. Flow cytometry reports CD4 percentages; the absolute CD4 cell count is calculated by multiplying the percentage and the total white blood cell count (WBC). In general, these two numbers are concordant. (See <a href=\"#H801811\" class=\"local\">'Absolute CD4 counts and percentages in HIV infection'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A significant change (eg, 2 standard deviations) between two tests is approximately a 30 percent change in the absolute count or an increase or decrease in CD4 percentage by 3 percentage points. (See <a href=\"#H22439973\" class=\"local\">'What is a significant change in CD4 cell counts?'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A CD4 count of &lt;200 <span class=\"nowrap\">cells/microL</span> indicates the clinical stage of AIDS, which implies a high susceptibility to opportunistic infections, such as Pneumocystis pneumonia. (See <a href=\"#H34797445\" class=\"local\">'Definition of AIDS'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A number of factors other than HIV infection influence CD4 cell counts. Significant changes in the total WBC can lead to marked changes in the absolute CD4 cell count. Certain medications or infections, which are associated with leukopenia, may result in depression of the absolute CD4 cell count. In contrast, specific medications or infections, which lead to leukocytosis, can result in elevated CD4 cell counts. These types of changes do not indicate a true change in the patient&rsquo;s immunologic status per se and should be interpreted with caution. (See <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Variability of CD4 cell counts'</a> above.)</p></div><div id=\"topicAgreement\">Use of UpToDate is subject to the <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/legal/license\" class=\"licenseLink\" id=\"sla_in_page\">Subscription and License Agreement</a>.</div><div id=\"references\" class=\"headingAnchor\"><h1>REFERENCES</h1><ol id=\"reference\"><li><a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/techniques-and-interpretation-of-measurement-of-the-cd4-cell-count-in-hiv-infected-patients/abstract/1\" class=\"nounderline abstract_t\">Graham NM, Park LP, Piantadosi S, et al.
