Aphasia is the loss of ability to produce <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> understand language. This usually manifests as a difficulty speaking or understanding spoken language but reading and writing are also usually impacted. Aphasia can also impact the use of manual sign language and Braille.</p><p>This topic reviews the clinical assessment of aphasia, the major aphasia syndromes, and an initial approach to diagnostic evaluation and management. Specific conditions that cause aphasia are discussed in detail separately (see appropriate topic reviews). Other aspects of the neurologic examination, as well as the prognosis and treatment of aphasia, are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=the-detailed-neurologic-examination-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;The detailed neurologic examination in adults&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=the-mental-status-examination-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;The mental status examination in adults&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aphasia-prognosis-and-treatment\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Aphasia: Prognosis and treatment&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">NEUROANATOMY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A large, complex neurocognitive network, usually located in the left hemisphere, subserves the capacity for human language [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-patient-with-aphasia/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Language centers</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The language network comprises areas of perisylvian cortex, including the classical language areas of Broca and Wernicke. While these are not anatomically discrete areas, important neural networks subserving critical language function have been identified:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Broca's area or Brodmann's area 44 in the posterior inferior frontal gyrus innervates adjacent motor neurons subserving the mouth and larynx, and controls the output of spoken language.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Wernicke's area or Brodmann's area 22, comprising the posterior two-thirds of the superior temporal gyrus, receives information from the auditory cortex and accesses a network of cortical associations to assign word meanings.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The angular gyrus in the inferior parietal lobule is adjacent to visual receptive areas and subserves the perception of written language, as well as other language processing functions.</p><p/><p>Other regions of the cerebrum contribute importantly to normal language. These include the insula, which is integral to normal articulation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-patient-with-aphasia/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>], several frontal and temporal lobe regions that support sentence-level processing [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-patient-with-aphasia/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>], and vast regions of temporal, occipital, and parietal cortex that support knowledge of words and their meanings [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-patient-with-aphasia/abstract/4-6\" class=\"abstract_t\">4-6</a>].</p><p>Although it is likely that subcortical nuclei make a contribution to normal language performance [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-patient-with-aphasia/abstract/7,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,8</a>], evidence from perfusion imaging indicates that aphasic syndromes associated with ischemic subcortical lesions are often accompanied by perfusion defects that involve cortical language regions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-patient-with-aphasia/abstract/9,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,10</a>]. The fact that these subcortical aphasias have been associated with a better prognosis than cortical varieties may be explained by their tendency to resolve with restoration of cortical perfusion.</p><p>Finally, there is increasing evidence that cerebellar lesions may result in linguistic deficits, including grammatical disturbances [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-patient-with-aphasia/abstract/11-14\" class=\"abstract_t\">11-14</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Cerebral dominance</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Most individuals are left hemisphere dominant for language function. Cerebral dominance is influenced by handedness; of the 90 to 95 percent of people who are right handed, more than 95 percent have left-sided language dominance [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-patient-with-aphasia/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. A smaller proportion of left-handed individuals, variably estimated between 31 to 70 percent, have left-sided language dominance [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-patient-with-aphasia/abstract/16,17\" class=\"abstract_t\">16,17</a>].</p><p>Patients with right-sided language dominance tend to have less severe and less enduring aphasia after right-sided brain injury, suggesting that language lateralization is incomplete in these individuals. The presence of bilateral representation of language function in certain individuals is further supported by functional neuroimaging studies, as well as in studies of WADA testing performed in patients prior to epilepsy surgery. Such studies indicate that language networks are not as strongly lateralized in women compared to men, and in left-handed versus right-handed individuals [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-patient-with-aphasia/abstract/7,11,16,18,19\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,11,16,18,19</a>].</p><p>Abnormalities of the left cerebral hemisphere that are present during development may result in atypical hemispheric dominance. A substantial left hemisphere injury in childhood (before the age of six years) is likely to be associated with a shift in at least some language functions to the right [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-patient-with-aphasia/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. Atypical language dominance is also noted to be more common in patients with temporal lobe epilepsy, particularly when the pathology is most prominent in the left side [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-patient-with-aphasia/abstract/21-23\" class=\"abstract_t\">21-23</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h1\">ETIOLOGIES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Any insult or pathologic process that results in damage or dysfunction of the language network may cause aphasia. The most common etiology is ischemic stroke [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-patient-with-aphasia/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. Other structural causes include hemorrhagic stroke; neoplasm; cerebral abscess, encephalitis or other central nervous system infections; and traumatic brain injury [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-patient-with-aphasia/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. Multiple sclerosis and acute disseminated encephalomyelitis are uncommon but reported causes of aphasia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-patient-with-aphasia/abstract/26-28\" class=\"abstract_t\">26-28</a>]. Structural etiologies usually produce fixed deficits with either an acute or subacute presentation depending upon the tempo of the underlying disease.</p><p>Transient episodes of aphasia may occur with transient cerebral ischemia (TIA), migraine, and seizures [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-patient-with-aphasia/abstract/29,30\" class=\"abstract_t\">29,30</a>]. The presence of aphasia during a TIA is one risk factor that identifies an individual at relatively high risk of stroke in the next few days and weeks [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-patient-with-aphasia/abstract/31,32\" class=\"abstract_t\">31,32</a>]. In seizures, aphasia may be either an ictal phenomenon (eg, brief speech arrest at onset of a complex partial or secondary generalized seizure) or a postictal manifestation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-patient-with-aphasia/abstract/33-36\" class=\"abstract_t\">33-36</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pathophysiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-migraine-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pathophysiology, clinical manifestations, and diagnosis of migraine in adults&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=definition-etiology-and-clinical-manifestations-of-transient-ischemic-attack\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Definition, etiology, and clinical manifestations of transient ischemic attack&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=localization-related-focal-epilepsy-causes-and-clinical-features\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Localization-related (focal) epilepsy: Causes and clinical features&quot;</a>.)</p><p>A progressive aphasia can be a manifestation of neurodegenerative disease. In children, certain forms of epilepsy (such as Landau-Kleffner syndrome and epilepsy with continuous spike-and-waves during slow-wave sleep) are associated with a progressive loss of previously attained language function [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-patient-with-aphasia/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>]. The aphasia may be the presenting symptom in 40 percent of Landau-Kleffner cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-patient-with-aphasia/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epilepsy-syndromes-in-children#H10\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Epilepsy syndromes in children&quot;, section on 'Syndromes with electrical status epilepticus during sleep'</a>.) Primary progressive aphasia and semantic dementia are syndromes that occur in older adults and most commonly represent frontotemporal degeneration, less commonly Alzheimer disease, Creutzfeldt Jacob disease, or another form of neurodegenerative dementia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-patient-with-aphasia/abstract/39-42\" class=\"abstract_t\">39-42</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=frontotemporal-dementia-clinical-features-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Frontotemporal dementia: Clinical features and diagnosis&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-alzheimer-disease#H14\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical features and diagnosis of Alzheimer disease&quot;, section on 'Atypical presentations'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL ASSESSMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Aphasias are classically subdivided based on observed vascular syndromes &mdash; cerebral infarction being the most common etiology of aphasia. These are categorized as fluent or nonfluent aphasias, and then are further subdivided according to observed deficits in content, repetition, naming, comprehension, reading, and writing.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Fluency</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Fluency is usually assessed qualitatively by listening to the patient's spontaneous speech. Nonfluent speech has the following characteristics:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Sparse output, with a decreased number of words per minute.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Shortened phrases, typically five words or less.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Agrammatism, characterized by the omission or substitution of function words (eg, prepositions, articles, conjunctions) or suffixes (eg, &quot;ed&quot; for past events). This type of speech pattern is the most specific feature of dysfluency and often referred to as &quot;telegraphic&quot;.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Effortfulness, with hesitations and a disruption of the normal melodic rhythm. Occasionally, patients with normal speech melody and little effort in spontaneous speech will exhibit word-finding pauses that make the assessment of fluency more difficult; however, these patients should be classified as fluent.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A breakdown of speech praxis, the ability to coordinate the articulatory movements required for comprehensible speech [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-patient-with-aphasia/abstract/43\" class=\"abstract_t\">43</a>]. This may be tested by asking the patient to repeatedly pronounce the syllables, <span class=\"nowrap\">/pa/,</span> <span class=\"nowrap\">/ta/,</span> and <span class=\"nowrap\">/ka/</span> (individually) and then to link the three together into a sequence <span class=\"nowrap\">/pa-ta-ka/</span>. Another approach is to ask the patient to repeat the word 'catastrophe' or 'artillery' as many times as possible in five or ten seconds.</p><p/><p>The best objective measure of fluency is to record the patient's speech, count the number of words or morphemes in a group of utterances, and take the mean. However, even this may vary considerably in a given patient depending on the emotional valence and complexity of the conversational topic.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Content</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Language errors during spontaneous or tested speech should be noted. Patients with Wernicke's aphasia, for example, make paraphasic errors and neologisms. &#160;Paraphasic errors are usually either whole word (semantic) substitutions, eg, &quot;chair&quot; for &quot;table,&quot; or phonemic (literal) substitutions, eg, &quot;cable&quot; for &quot;table.&quot; Neologisms are entirely new nonwords. Patients are often unaware of their paraphasic errors.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h2\">Repetition</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Repetition is tested by asking the patient to repeat phrases of increasing complexity. &quot;Serial speech,&quot; consisting of over-learned sequences (such as &quot;one, two, three&quot; or &quot;A, B, C&quot;) is preserved in all but the most severe cases. This should be followed by short sentences using high-frequency words (&quot;She did it,&quot; and &quot;This is it&quot;), then longer utterances with less frequent words (&quot;They heard him speak on the radio last night&quot;), and finally, complex, low-frequency phrases (&quot;Hopping hippopotamus,&quot; &quot;Methodist Episcopal,&quot; &quot;No ifs, ands, or buts&quot;).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h2\">Naming</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>When testing naming, patients are asked to give the names of real objects available to the examiner, such as &quot;key,&quot; &quot;buttonhole,&quot; &quot;eyebrow,&quot; and &quot;knuckles.&quot; Words used less frequently are more difficult for the aphasic patient to retrieve and constitute a more sensitive test for anomia. Photographs or line drawings may also be used to assess anomia. The retrieval of verbs is generally best tested by using pictures.</p><p>In addition to confrontational naming, word retrieval and production may be tested by asking the patient to &quot;name by definition,&quot; ie, the examiner provides a definition of an object or action, and the patient provides the appropriate name.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h2\">Comprehension</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Comprehension is evaluated by giving a sequence of commands, beginning with one-step, midline commands (&quot;Close your eyes,&quot; or &quot;Stick out your tongue&quot;), and progressing to multi-step commands and those involving the extremities (&quot;Show me two fingers,&quot; &quot;Close your eyes and point to the window,&quot; &quot;Stand up, turn around, clap two times, and sit down&quot;).</p><p>Commands that require a body part to cross the midline (eg, &quot;Touch your right ear with your left thumb&quot;) are more complex than those that do not. Commands involving increasingly complex grammatical structures can also be used (eg, &quot;Touch the coin with the pencil&quot;; &quot;With the comb, touch the coin&quot;). More complex questions (eg, &quot;Does a stone sink in water?&quot; &quot;Do you put on your shoes before your socks?&quot;) and those using complex grammatical structures such as passive voice or possessive (eg, &quot;Is my aunt's uncle a man or a woman?&quot; &quot;If a lion was killed by a tiger, which one is still alive?&quot;) can elicit comprehension deficits in those who can follow simple commands.</p><p>The Token test is a structured evaluation of auditory comprehension [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-patient-with-aphasia/abstract/44\" class=\"abstract_t\">44</a>]. A series of commands involving twenty tokens of different shapes, size, and color is presented in increasing complexity from &quot;touch the small red square&quot; to &quot;put the large green circle under the small yellow square, before you touch the white circle.&quot;</p><p>Impaired comprehension may be due to failure of speech sound discrimination, word recognition, auditory working memory, or syntactic structure building. Word recognition can be tested by asking the patient to point to items that are plainly visible or accessible. &quot;Two-way&quot; naming deficits, in which the patient can neither name an item nor point to it on command (despite being able to repeat the name) represent abnormal word comprehension; this is a characteristic feature of semantic dementia, a form of frontotemporal lobar dementia. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=frontotemporal-dementia-clinical-features-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Frontotemporal dementia: Clinical features and diagnosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h2\">Reading</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients are asked to read aloud from a newspaper or from a list of single words. There may be dissociations in the ability to read regularly spelled words, irregular words, or pronounceable nonwords. Reading comprehension may be tested with written commands (eg, &quot;Fold this paper in half and put it on the table&quot;) or with a written word-picture matching test.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h2\">Writing</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The patient is asked to write a sentence spontaneously. It may also be useful to dictate material to the patient, particularly for testing of regularly spelled words, irregular words, and pronounceable nonwords. The patient can also be asked to write names of objects or actions in response to pictures. Accuracy with written naming may be dissociated from spoken naming [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-patient-with-aphasia/abstract/45\" class=\"abstract_t\">45</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14\"><span class=\"h2\">Other language assessments</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Bedside examination is sufficient in most cases to assess aphasia. Validated scales such as the Boston diagnostic aphasia examination and Western aphasia battery are often used in clinical studies and as part of neuropsychologic test batteries [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-patient-with-aphasia/abstract/46\" class=\"abstract_t\">46</a>].</p><p>Although not specific for aphasia, verbal fluency tasks provide a means for rapid assessment of word knowledge and verbal executive function and are useful in the assessment of semantic memory in neurodegenerative disease. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-alzheimer-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical features and diagnosis of Alzheimer disease&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=frontotemporal-dementia-clinical-features-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Frontotemporal dementia: Clinical features and diagnosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15\"><span class=\"h2\">Other neurologic examination features</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The language examination is best interpreted in the context of the entire neurologic examination. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=the-detailed-neurologic-examination-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;The detailed neurologic examination in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p>A broad mental status examination that includes the assessment of level of consciousness, attention, memory, praxis, executive function, and visuospatial abilities is important to avoid mistaking aphasia for other conditions causing mental status changes and vice versa. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=the-mental-status-examination-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;The mental status examination in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The diagnosis of aphasia should be usually made only in the setting of an otherwise intact sensorium. (See <a href=\"#H29\" class=\"local\">'Conditions mistaken for aphasia'</a> below.)</p><p>Hearing should be specifically tested; if abnormal, this must be taken into account when interpreting the examination of comprehension and repetition.</p><p>Dysarthria may be present and should be noted. In the setting of the examination, it is usually easy to distinguish dysarthria from aphasia; however, when obtaining historical information from patients and observers about a past episode of speech disturbance it can be surprisingly challenging. Asking them to mimic the speech disturbance can be helpful.</p><p>The presence or absence of other neurologic deficits contributes to localization and underlying etiology.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A right-sided visual field disturbance suggests a left hemisphere lesion of the optic tract, lateral geniculate nucleus, optic radiations, or posterior cortices. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=homonymous-hemianopia\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Homonymous hemianopia&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A right hemiparesis with spasticity, abnormal reflexes, and a Babinski sign is common in the setting of nonfluent aphasias. At times, weakness will be very subtle, consisting only of a facial weakness <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> a pronator drift.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Cerebellar findings, such as dysmetria and dysdiadochokinesia, are not commonly caused by lesions that result in aphasia, but cases have been reported in which aphasia seemed to result from cerebellar damage.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Hemianesthesia suggests a parietal lobe or thalamic lesion. Fluent aphasia is more commonly associated with sensory deficits. Sensory deficits from parietal lobe lesions may include failure of two-point discrimination, astereognosis, and agraphesthesia. These may be difficult to reliably test in the patient with aphasia.</p><p/><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H16\"><span class=\"h1\">APHASIA SYNDROMES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Based on the assessment of language as described above, it should be possible to classify the aphasia according to one of the classic language syndromes listed in the Table (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F72780\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef72780 \">table 1</a>). </p><p>Although modern aphasiology is increasingly viewing the language faculty according to more complex models, the Wernicke-Lichtheim model and this classification scheme maintains clinical utility as these syndromes are at least to some degree associated with neuroanatomic localization, etiology, and prognosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-patient-with-aphasia/abstract/47\" class=\"abstract_t\">47</a>]. As an example, in one study of 325 patients with aphasia resulting from cerebral infarction, 95 percent of patients had MRI lesions that corresponded to their clinical syndrome [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-patient-with-aphasia/abstract/48\" class=\"abstract_t\">48</a>]. Limitations of this model include that it does not formally consider basic linguistic elements such as phonology (the sound pattern of language), morphology (the combination of language's smallest meaningful units), syntax (the structure of sentences), semantics (the relationship of language to meaning), and pragmatics (nuances of articulation and discourse).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H17\"><span class=\"h2\">Broca's aphasia</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Classically localized to lesions affecting the frontal lobe, Broca's aphasia is characterized by nonfluency with sparse output and agrammatism (see <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'Fluency'</a> above) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-patient-with-aphasia/abstract/47,48\" class=\"abstract_t\">47,48</a>]. Repetition is also impaired. Comprehension is relatively spared but is usually not completely normal, particularly for grammatically complex speech. Writing is generally affected in proportion to speech. The association between Broca's aphasia and Broca's area is most consistently observed in acute rather than chronic stroke [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-patient-with-aphasia/abstract/49\" class=\"abstract_t\">49</a>].</p><p>There is often an associated right hemiparesis and oral apraxia reflecting injury to contiguous structures in the motor and supplementary motor areas.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H18\"><span class=\"h2\">Wernicke's aphasia</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Wernicke's aphasia is a fluent aphasia with markedly impaired comprehension [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-patient-with-aphasia/abstract/47\" class=\"abstract_t\">47</a>]. In its classic form, speech is voluminous, but meaningless, containing paraphasic errors and neologisms. This is often described as &quot;word salad&quot;. The speech usually retains normal cadence and intonation. Comprehension and production of written language is similarly impaired. The patient appears unaware of the deficit.</p><p>Associated with lesions in the posterior superior temporal gyrus (Wernicke's area), there is typically no motor deficit with this syndrome [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-patient-with-aphasia/abstract/47,50\" class=\"abstract_t\">47,50</a>]. However, a right superior visual field defect may be present</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H19\"><span class=\"h2\">Conduction aphasia</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Conduction aphasia refers to a syndrome of fluent aphasia with impaired repetition, frequent paraphasic errors (usually phonemic) but relatively preserved comprehension [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-patient-with-aphasia/abstract/47\" class=\"abstract_t\">47</a>]. Patients often try repeatedly to correct their errors. Written language may be similarly affected [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-patient-with-aphasia/abstract/51\" class=\"abstract_t\">51</a>].</p><p>This syndrome may be observed during recovery from a Wernicke aphasia and also with lesions in the supramarginal gyrus or deep parietal white matter [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-patient-with-aphasia/abstract/36,48,51,52\" class=\"abstract_t\">36,48,51,52</a>].

Patients are often mute or produce only nonword utterances. They cannot follow commands, although they may respond to the intonation or expression of the speech.</p><p>Because this syndrome is usually associated with extensive perisylvian injury affecting both Broca's and Wernicke's areas, patients generally have a right hemiparesis and often a right visual field deficit [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-patient-with-aphasia/abstract/47,48\" class=\"abstract_t\">47,48</a>]. However, case reports of global aphasia without hemiparesis have been reported in the setting of encephalitis, selective lesions involving both Broca's and Wernicke's areas, and as a late manifestation of degenerative dementia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-patient-with-aphasia/abstract/53,54\" class=\"abstract_t\">53,54</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H21\"><span class=\"h2\">Transcortical motor aphasia</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Characterized by a nonfluent speech output, with good comprehension and repetition, patients with this type of aphasia appear to have difficulty initiating speech, as well as completing a thought. Writing is disrupted proportionately. This can occur during recovery from a Broca's aphasia or as a primary deficit [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-patient-with-aphasia/abstract/55\" class=\"abstract_t\">55</a>].</p><p>This syndrome has been described in infarcts involving the anterior cerebral artery <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> the anterior-middle cerebral artery watershed that damage the supplementary motor area <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> connections to the frontal perisylvian speech area [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-patient-with-aphasia/abstract/47,48,56,57\" class=\"abstract_t\">47,48,56,57</a>]. It may also occur in patients recovering from a Broca's aphasia. When associated with lesions in the mesial frontal lobe, patients may demonstrate apathy and lateralized frontal release signs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-patient-with-aphasia/abstract/57\" class=\"abstract_t\">57</a>]. In contrast, when associated with damage in the supplementary motor area, patients appear to make a great effort to speak, and may also demonstrate right-sided long tract signs (weakness, hyperreflexia, Babinski sign) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-patient-with-aphasia/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H22\"><span class=\"h2\">Transcortical sensory aphasia</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>This is a fluent aphasia with frequent paraphasic errors and impaired comprehension that appears similar to a Wernicke's aphasia. One difference is intact repetition that can take the form of echolalia. Patients can often read aloud (sometimes with errors), but without comprehension. Among other theories, this syndrome has been interpreted as representing a disconnection between phonological processing, which remains intact, and lexical-semantic decoding, which is impaired [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-patient-with-aphasia/abstract/58\" class=\"abstract_t\">58</a>].</p><p>This syndrome has been produced by lesions adjacent to Wernicke's area in the temporal-occipital or parietal-occipital areas (eg, angular gyrus) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-patient-with-aphasia/abstract/48,59\" class=\"abstract_t\">48,59</a>]. This can be a watershed zone between middle and posterior cerebral artery territories. Consistent with this localization, patients generally have no motor deficits, but may have lateralized sensory or visual field deficits (inferior quadrantanopia or hemianopia).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H23\"><span class=\"h2\">Transcortical mixed aphasia</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients with a transcortical mixed aphasia have all features of a global aphasia except that repetition is spared. They have little to no spontaneous verbal speech, but may repeat what has just been said [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-patient-with-aphasia/abstract/60\" class=\"abstract_t\">60</a>]. When given the start of a common phrase, they are sometimes able to repeat and then finish it on their own. Comprehension of written and spoken language is severely impaired.</p><p>Produced by injury to the anterior and posterior watershed area or by multifocal cerebral emboli [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-patient-with-aphasia/abstract/48,60,61\" class=\"abstract_t\">48,60,61</a>], there are often other neurologic deficits. Depending on the clinical setting, this syndrome can occur in the setting of bihemispheric watershed damage that produces bilateral spastic quadriparesis (&quot;man in a barrel&quot; syndrome) <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> visual field loss.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H24\"><span class=\"h2\">Anomic aphasia</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>While anomia is a common feature of most aphasia syndromes, an isolated deficit of anomia can also occur. Patients with anomic aphasia cannot name (or write) the word for a particular item. Often, they can state the meaning and retrieve words related to the one for which they are searching. Spontaneous speech is characterized by pauses, circumlocution (substitution of related words or phrases), and occasional paraphasic errors, but is otherwise fluent with intact repetition and sentence comprehension [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-patient-with-aphasia/abstract/25,62\" class=\"abstract_t\">25,62</a>].</p><p>Associated lesions in different anatomic sites have been described, including the basal temporal lobe, anterior inferior temporal lobe, the temporo-parieto-occipital junction, and the inferior parietal lobe [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-patient-with-aphasia/abstract/25,48,62\" class=\"abstract_t\">25,48,62</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H25\"><span class=\"h2\">Aphasia-related disorders</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Pure word deafness, alexia without agraphia, and pure word mutism are not technically disturbances in language, but are related to aphasia.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H26\"><span class=\"h3\">Pure word deafness</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>This is a rare syndrome. Patients can comprehend written but not spoken language [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-patient-with-aphasia/abstract/63,64\" class=\"abstract_t\">63,64</a>]. Spontaneous speech is usually normal, sometimes with paraphasic errors. Repetition is often preserved. The general neurologic examination is normal. Pure word deafness is usually associated with restricted lesions in the superior temporal gyrus [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-patient-with-aphasia/abstract/65\" class=\"abstract_t\">65</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H27\"><span class=\"h3\">Alexia without agraphia</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients with this syndrome can write, but not read. Their ability to understand and produce oral speech remains intact. Lesions producing this deficit are in the left occipital lobe and extend to the splenium of the corpus callosum (eg, left posterior cerebral artery occlusion) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-patient-with-aphasia/abstract/27,28\" class=\"abstract_t\">27,28</a>]. The patient has a right visual field defect.

Dysarthria and facial paresis usually accompany this syndrome. Lesions typically lie in or around Broca's area, involving the lowermost part of the precentral gyrus [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-patient-with-aphasia/abstract/66-68\" class=\"abstract_t\">66-68</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H29\"><span class=\"h1\">CONDITIONS MISTAKEN FOR APHASIA</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A number of conditions may either obscure or be mistaken for aphasia.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patient with metabolic encephalopathy or delirium may have difficulty naming and fail to follow commands. Paraphasic errors, while relatively uncommon, may occur in an agitated delirium. This condition may be recognized by fluctuating attention and level of consciousness, along with agitation, hallucinations, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> asterixis. Other focal neurologic signs that can accompany fluent aphasia (eg, visual field deficits) are generally absent in patients with metabolic encephalopathy. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acute-toxic-metabolic-encephalopathy-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Acute toxic-metabolic encephalopathy in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Akinetic mutism can result from lesions of the mesial frontal region. Patients demonstrate a paucity of speech output and poor response to commands that may suggest aphasia. Observation of bilaterally decreased motor responses, not restricted to speech, helps identify akinetic mutism [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-patient-with-aphasia/abstract/69,70\" class=\"abstract_t\">69,70</a>]. Hypophonia is often present in akinetic mutism, but not in aphasia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-patient-with-aphasia/abstract/71\" class=\"abstract_t\">71</a>]. These patients may exhibit signs of catatonia (waxy flexibility). However, a nonfluent aphasia may also accompany frontal lobe lesions (see <a href=\"#H17\" class=\"local\">'Broca's aphasia'</a> above and <a href=\"#H21\" class=\"local\">'Transcortical motor aphasia'</a> above).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients who are depressed may be reluctant to converse and be examined, and may therefore appear to have comprehension or naming difficulties.

(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=unipolar-depression-in-adults-assessment-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Unipolar depression in adults: Assessment and diagnosis&quot;</a>.) Contributing to potential diagnostic confusion is the fact that many patients with chronic aphasia are depressed; clinicians should consider that both conditions may be contributing to the clinical picture [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-patient-with-aphasia/abstract/72-74\" class=\"abstract_t\">72-74</a>].

Listening carefully to the speech content can help distinguish the two. An underlying theme or preoccupation is often discernible in the disorganized speech of a schizophrenic patient, but not in the patient with aphasia. The jargon output of a fluent aphasia seems accidental rather than volitional, while the neologisms produced by schizophrenic patients often seem to be &quot;made up&quot; and inflected in a manner appropriate for their context [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-patient-with-aphasia/abstract/78,79\" class=\"abstract_t\">78,79</a>]. Semantic and phonemic paraphasic errors are common with aphasia but rarely occur in schizophrenic speech [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-patient-with-aphasia/abstract/75\" class=\"abstract_t\">75</a>]. While fluent aphasia is associated with aberrant production of grammatical affixes and function words (paragrammatism) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-patient-with-aphasia/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>], schizophrenic language is not associated with a morphological disturbance [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-patient-with-aphasia/abstract/78\" class=\"abstract_t\">78</a>].

The presence of an ischemic stroke should trigger further evaluation. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-the-evaluation-of-stroke\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of the evaluation of stroke&quot;</a>.) Other identified structural brain lesions will usually also warrant further testing.</p><p>Episodes of transient aphasia should prompt investigation of possible seizures or transient cerebral ischemia. Electroencephalography (EEG) <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> cerebrovascular imaging may be helpful in such patients. Prolonged EEG monitoring may be required to detect active seizure activity in some patients with aphasic status epilepticus [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-patient-with-aphasia/abstract/80\" class=\"abstract_t\">80</a>].
