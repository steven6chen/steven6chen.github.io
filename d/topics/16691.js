For repetitive episodes of SMVT, consideration should be given to catheter ablation.

The choice of initial treatments for hemodynamically stable SMVT includes electrical or pharmacologic cardioversion (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F108831\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef108831 \">algorithm 1</a>). We generally prefer to begin with an intravenous antiarrhythmic agent and reserve electrical cardioversion for refractory patients or for those who become unstable. If SMVT is not terminated with the initial antiarrhythmic drug, external cardioversion may be performed or additional antiarrhythmic therapy may be administered (eg, second bolus of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=amiodarone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">amiodarone</a>, adding <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lidocaine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">lidocaine</a> to amiodarone, etc). Rarely, electrical cardioversion may be chosen as the initial therapy for patients with SMVT who are hemodynamically stable, but only if adequate procedural sedation can be administered prior to delivery of the shock.</p><p><strong>Pharmacologic cardioversion &mdash; </strong>For pharmacologic cardioversion, we administer one of the following antiarrhythmic drugs:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Intravenous <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lidocaine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">lidocaine</a> (1 to 1.5 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> [typically 75 to 100 mg] at a rate of 25 to 50 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/minute;</span> lower doses of 0.5 to 0.75 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> can be repeated every 5 to 10 minutes as needed), which may be more effective in the setting of acute myocardial ischemia or infarction</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Intravenous <a href=\"topic.htm?path=procainamide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">procainamide</a> (20 to 50 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/minute</span> until arrhythmia terminates or a maximum dose of 15 to 17 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> is administered)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Intravenous <a href=\"topic.htm?path=amiodarone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">amiodarone</a> (150 mg IV over 10 minutes, followed by 1 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/minute</span> for the next six hours) </p><p/><p>Often administration of these drugs may result in hypotension, which may hasten the need for electrical cardioversion.</p><p>Intravenous pharmacologic therapy with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=amiodarone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">amiodarone</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=procainamide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">procainamide</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lidocaine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">lidocaine</a>, or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sotalol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">sotalol</a> (not available in all countries) may be attempted prior to electrical cardioversion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sustained-monomorphic-ventricular-tachycardia-in-patients-with-structural-heart-disease-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/2-8\" class=\"abstract_t\">2-8</a>]. For patients in whom VT terminates during drug infusion, the intravenous drug can usually be discontinued at that point, unless the patient has been experiencing recurrent episodes.&nbsp;For patients with frequent recurrent episodes, the infusion should be continued, and consideration should be given to initiating oral antiarrhythmic drug therapy or referring for catheter ablation. Regardless of the choice of antiarrhythmic drug, the patient should be reevaluated daily (or more frequently if unstable) to determine the optimal approach to antiarrhythmic therapy.</p><p>Intravenous <a href=\"topic.htm?path=amiodarone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">amiodarone</a> is slower in action than <a href=\"topic.htm?path=procainamide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">procainamide</a> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lidocaine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">lidocaine</a>, but it improves the reversion rate of refractory SMVT and decreases its recurrence after reversion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sustained-monomorphic-ventricular-tachycardia-in-patients-with-structural-heart-disease-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/3,6-8\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,6-8</a>]. Procainamide has the advantage of slowing VT even when it fails to terminate, usually resulting in greater hemodynamic stability, whereas lidocaine usually does not slow SMVT. Procainamide terminates over 50 percent of episodes of SMVT, while lidocaine usually terminates only 10 to 20 percent. </p><p><strong>Electrical cardioversion &mdash; </strong>If electrical cardioversion with appropriate procedural sedation is the chosen approach, intravenous analgesics or sedatives should be cautiously administered if the blood pressure will tolerate their use. If the QRS complex and T wave can be distinguished, an attempt at synchronized cardioversion can be performed with a synchronized shock of at least 100 joules using either a biphasic or monophasic defibrillator. If the QRS complex and T wave cannot be distinguished accurately, and a synchronized shock is not possible, we administer an unsynchronized 120 to 200 joule shock from a biphasic defibrillator or a 360 joule shock from a monophasic defibrillator. If the initial shock is unsuccessful, subsequent shocks should be delivered at escalating energy levels.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2730096104\"><span class=\"h3\">Initial dosing of antiarrhythmic drugs</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>When an antiarrhythmic drug is prescribed, the following regimens can be used:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><a href=\"topic.htm?path=lidocaine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Lidocaine</a> &ndash; Intravenous lidocaine can be given in an initial dose of 1 to 1.5 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> (typically 75 to 100 mg at a rate of 25 to 50 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/minute);</span> lower doses of 0.5 to 0.75 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> can be repeated every 5 to 10 minutes as needed.

The maximum total dose is 3 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> (300 mg) over one hour.

Repeated boluses can be given over 10 minutes every 10 to 15 minutes to a maximum total dose of 2.2 g in 24 hours.

The presence of hypokalemia or hypomagnesemia should prompt correction of these electrolyte disturbances, but electrolyte abnormalities alone should not be accepted as the cause for SMVT.

In a separate multicenter cohort of 1365 patients (mean age 64 years, mean LVEF 30 percent) with HF undergoing VT ablation, including 111 patients with NYHA class 4 symptoms, there was no significant difference in the rate of acute complications between patients with NYHA class <span class=\"nowrap\">2/3</span> symptoms (7 percent) and those with NYHA class 4 symptoms (10 percent), suggesting that VT ablation is safe for patients with the most severe HF symptoms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sustained-monomorphic-ventricular-tachycardia-in-patients-with-structural-heart-disease-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/51\" class=\"abstract_t\">51</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2971619522\"><span class=\"h3\">Other therapies</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Not all patients will have their VT controlled with antiarrhythmic medications or RFA.

Arrhythmia surgery is particularly useful when surgical revascularization (coronary artery bypass grafting [CABG]) is also planned, since it offers added hemodynamic benefits, including improvement in LVEF and alleviation of symptoms of HF, especially those requiring CABG <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> LV aneurysmectomy. </p><p>Surgical ablation using endocardial resection was the mainstay of therapy for recurrent SMVT following MI unresponsive to pharmacologic therapy until the early 1990s, when RF catheter ablation for VT became feasible. A variety of surgical approaches with inconsistent efficacy have been performed, including LV aneurysmectomy, bilateral sympathectomy, encircling endocardial ventriculotomy, and subendocardial resection. Using LV aneurysmectomy as an example, the association of VT with LV aneurysms has been noted since the early 1900s, but aneurysmectomy alone has shown to have limited success in curing VT, presumably due to the fact that VTs may arise from the border of the aneurysm which is rarely excised during conventional aneurysmectomy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sustained-monomorphic-ventricular-tachycardia-in-patients-with-structural-heart-disease-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/52\" class=\"abstract_t\">52</a>]. By contrast, long-term control of <span class=\"nowrap\">VT/VF</span> has been excellent when LV aneurysmectomy is combined with LV reconstruction and subendocardial resection guided by VT mapping, with or without cryoablation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sustained-monomorphic-ventricular-tachycardia-in-patients-with-structural-heart-disease-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/53,54\" class=\"abstract_t\">53,54</a>].

In a single-center case series of five patients with structural heart disease (three with nonischemic cardiomyopathy, two with ischemic cardiomyopathy) with failed prior radiofrequency ablation (or who were not candidates for ablation) and ongoing VT in spite of two or more antiarrhythmic drugs, episodes of VT decreased following stereotactic radiation therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sustained-monomorphic-ventricular-tachycardia-in-patients-with-structural-heart-disease-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/56\" class=\"abstract_t\">56</a>].

(See <a href=\"#H1\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>All patients with SMVT should have a brief immediate assessment of the symptoms, vital signs, and level of consciousness to determine if they are hemodynamic stable or unstable. Differentiation between a hemodynamically unstable versus stable patient depends upon hemodynamic compromise, such as hypotension, altered mental status, chest pain, or heart failure (HF). (See <a href=\"#H4098573235\" class=\"local\">'Initial management'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients with SMVT who are <strong>hemodynamically unstable and pulseless</strong>, or who become pulseless during the course of evaluation and treatment, should be managed according to standard advance cardiac life support (ACLS) resuscitation algorithms, with immediate high-energy countershock and cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F73862\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef73862 \">algorithm 2</a>). Patients should initially be treated with a synchronized 120 to 200 joule shock from a biphasic defibrillator or a 360 joule shock from a monophasic defibrillator. (See <a href=\"#H7842526\" class=\"local\">'Unstable patients'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients with wide complex tachycardia (WCT) who are hemodynamically unstable, but still responsive with a discernible blood pressure and pulse, we recommend urgent cardioversion (following administration of sedation) (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=2\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1B</a>). (See <a href=\"#H7842526\" class=\"local\">'Unstable patients'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients with SMVT who are <strong>hemodynamically stable on presentation</strong>, after recording a 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG) we generally prefer to begin with an intravenous antiarrhythmic agent and reserve electrical cardioversion for refractory patients or for those who become unstable (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F108831\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef108831 \">algorithm 1</a>).

If the QRS complex and T wave can be distinguished, an attempt at synchronized cardioversion can be performed with a synchronized shock of 100 joules using either a biphasic or monophasic defibrillator.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Treatment of underlying conditions associated with VT, such as myocardial ischemia, electrolyte disturbances, drug proarrhythmia, and HF, as well as decreasing the sympathetic facilitation of SMVT, are important components of the acute management of VT. (See <a href=\"#H7842429\" class=\"local\">'Treatment of associated conditions'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Chronic therapy of patients with SMVT usually requires utilization of multiple therapeutic modalities, including the implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD), antiarrhythmic drugs, radiofrequency catheter ablation, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> arrhythmia surgery. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>In the absence of a clearly identifiable and reversible cause for SMVT, nearly all patients with a history of SMVT will be candidates for ICD insertion for secondary prevention of sudden cardiac death, unless the patient refuses or the risks of ICD insertion are felt to outweigh the potential benefits. (See <a href=\"#H12\" class=\"local\">'ICD therapy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Nearly all patients who experience SMVT have an indication for therapy with a beta blocker, including patients with a prior myocardial infarction, patients with HF and reduced LV systolic function, etc. Beta blockers provide some level of protection against recurrent SMVT, primarily by reducing myocardial oxygen demand and blocking sympathetic input to the heart. (See <a href=\"#H2414188765\" class=\"local\">'Beta blockers'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Antiarrhythmic drugs may also be used to improve quality of life in patients with frequent SMVT leading to ICD shocks, or in those patients who are not candidates for, or who decline, ICD implantation. <a href=\"topic.htm?path=amiodarone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Amiodarone</a> has generally been the most effective antiarrhythmic drug for preventing ventricular arrhythmias (and associated ICD shocks). (See <a href=\"#H13\" class=\"local\">'Antiarrhythmic drugs'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>For patients with recurrent SMVT resulting in ICD shocks despite treatment with an antiarrhythmic drug, we suggest radiofrequency ablation (RFA) rather than the addition of a second antiarrhythmic agent (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). RFA is also an alternative to antiarrhythmic drugs as the initial therapy for SMVT. In addition, RFA, with or without antiarrhythmic drug therapy, is an option for patients with SMVT who are not candidates for or who refuse ICD implantation.
