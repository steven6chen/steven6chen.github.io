Most of these genital infections are caused by herpes simplex virus-2 (HSV-2), but herpes simplex virus-1 (HSV-1) also produces a clinically similar disease. Antiviral therapy can shorten the duration of symptoms and signs in primary infection which, when untreated, can be associated with significant morbidity. Clinical recurrences are also common and can be treated episodically or prevented with continual antiviral suppression.</p><p>This topic review addresses the natural history of genital HSV infection, clinical recurrences, and data supporting treatment efficacy of primary and repeated episodes of infection. The epidemiology, clinical manifestations, and diagnosis of genital HSV infection and issues related to pregnancy are presented separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-genital-herpes-simplex-virus-infection\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Epidemiology, clinical manifestations, and diagnosis of genital herpes simplex virus infection&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=genital-herpes-simplex-virus-infection-and-pregnancy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Genital herpes simplex virus infection and pregnancy&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prevention-of-genital-herpes-virus-infections\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Prevention of genital herpes virus infections&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">NATURAL HISTORY OF INFECTION</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Primary infection</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>An HSV outbreak is defined as &quot;primary&quot; if the patient was HSV-seronegative for both HSV-1 and HSV-2 before the episode of genital lesions. The primary episode of genital HSV infection can be associated with a multitude of constitutional symptoms and signs, such as fever, malaise, and headache. In addition to painful genital lesions, dysuria can be severe. Symptoms may last two to four weeks if left untreated. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-genital-herpes-simplex-virus-infection\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Epidemiology, clinical manifestations, and diagnosis of genital herpes simplex virus infection&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=genital-herpes-simplex-virus-infection-and-pregnancy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Genital herpes simplex virus infection and pregnancy&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Nonprimary infection</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Nonprimary episode infection refers to HSV-2 infection in a person with preexisting HSV-1 immunity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-genital-herpes-simplex-virus-infection/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. The signs and symptoms of nonprimary infection tend to be less severe than in the person without any existing HSV antibodies.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Recurrent symptomatic disease</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Although treatment during primary infection lessens morbidity, it does not eradicate latent virus, which can subsequently reactivate. Genital HSV infection often leads to frequent clinical recurrences, although the risk of genital recurrence is lower in those infected with HSV-1 versus HSV-2 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-genital-herpes-simplex-virus-infection/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. In the absence of suppressive antiviral therapy, the median recurrence rate after the first episode of HSV-2 infection is about four recurrences a year, with about 40 percent of patients having at least six recurrences and 20 percent having more than 10 recurrences in the first year [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-genital-herpes-simplex-virus-infection/abstract/1,3\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,3</a>]. In contrast, recurrences of HSV-1 occur much less frequently (approximately once per year). Over time, recurrences due to either viral type generally decrease in number and severity, although there is substantial variability in the clinical course from patient to patient [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-genital-herpes-simplex-virus-infection/abstract/3,4\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,4</a>].</p><p>With recurrent infection, genital lesions may be asymptomatic, few in number, or atypical in appearance, especially in women (eg, fissures or vulvar irritation). In addition, the mean duration of lesions is shorter than that seen with the primary episode (10 versus 19 days) and the duration of viral shedding is shorter (two versus nine days) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-genital-herpes-simplex-virus-infection/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. Finally, antiviral therapy does not eradicate latent HSV infection and thus does not change the frequency or severity of recurrences, once therapy is stopped [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-genital-herpes-simplex-virus-infection/abstract/1,2,4\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2,4</a>].

The following findings were noted:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Among patients with newly acquired genital herpes, the median rate of recurrence in the first year was lower in patients with HSV-1 compared with HSV-2 infection (one versus five per year, respectively). Second year rates were lower in both groups.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients infected with HSV-2 who were followed for more than four years had a decreased recurrence rate over time. However, about one-fourth of patients experienced an increase in recurrences at the five-year follow-up, highlighting the variability in disease course among HSV-2-infected persons.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h1\">ANTIVIRAL AGENTS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>As discussed in detail in the next section, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acyclovir-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">acyclovir</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=famciclovir-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">famciclovir</a>, and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=valacyclovir-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">valacyclovir</a> appear to have similar efficacy for the treatment of primary genital herpes and for the suppression of recurrent infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-genital-herpes-simplex-virus-infection/abstract/6,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,7</a>]. Famciclovir and valacyclovir have greater oral bioavailability than acyclovir. Topical therapy is of marginal benefit and should not be used [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-genital-herpes-simplex-virus-infection/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. The margin of safety and tolerability of all three medications is excellent.

Thus, all patients with a suspected primary episode of HSV should be treated with antiviral therapy. Initiation of oral antiviral therapy within 72 hours of lesion appearance may decrease duration and severity of illness by days to weeks [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-genital-herpes-simplex-virus-infection/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. Furthermore, antiviral therapy can decrease the risk of complicated primary infection (eg, meningitis or sacral radiculitis) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-genital-herpes-simplex-virus-infection/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H12\" class=\"local\">'Complicated HSV'</a> below.)</p><p>All of the available agents (ie, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acyclovir-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">acyclovir</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=famciclovir-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">famciclovir</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=valacyclovir-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">valacyclovir</a>) are efficacious in the treatment of primary genital HSV infection. The dosing frequency varies from agent to agent. Multiple trials have been conducted to determine the shortest duration of therapy that may be effective in achieving symptomatic relief. Oral therapy is usually adequate, except in cases of complicated HSV infection. (See <a href=\"#H12\" class=\"local\">'Complicated HSV'</a> below.)</p><p>The following is a survey of the major clinical trials that have assessed the efficacy of antiviral therapy.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Acyclovir versus placebo</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Most data on the treatment of primary genital herpes come from studies with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acyclovir-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">acyclovir</a> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-genital-herpes-simplex-virus-infection/abstract/5,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,11</a>]. As an example, in a randomized, controlled trial, 48 patients with a first episode of genital herpes were assigned to acyclovir (200 mg) or placebo five times daily for ten days [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-genital-herpes-simplex-virus-infection/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. Acyclovir significantly reduced pain, length of time to healing, and duration of viral shedding. Similar benefits, including resolution of constitutional symptoms, were associated with acyclovir use in another placebo-controlled trial [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-genital-herpes-simplex-virus-infection/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h2\">Famciclovir versus acyclovir</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span><a href=\"topic.htm?path=famciclovir-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Famciclovir</a>, the oral prodrug of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=penciclovir-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">penciclovir</a>, has increased bioavailability as well as a substantially longer half-life compared with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acyclovir-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">acyclovir</a>.

In three separate double-blind controlled studies, several different dosing regimens of famciclovir (125, 250, 500, 750 mg) were compared with acyclovir for either 5 or 10 days of dosing in a total of 951 patients; one-third of the enrolled patients had primary HSV [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-genital-herpes-simplex-virus-infection/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. Famciclovir was given three times daily and acyclovir was given five times daily. Duration of shedding, median time to lesion healing, and time to resolution of symptoms were comparable among the famciclovir and acyclovir arms.

The threshold level of six or more lesions per year is largely arbitrary, but is based upon the perceived modest benefits with antiviral therapy. Patient preference is clearly an important factor in determining treatment strategy. (See <a href=\"#H36\" class=\"local\">'Suppressive therapy for recurrent genital herpes'</a> below.)</p><p>It is also important to realize that a number of patients may have few, if any, recurrent episodes of genital herpes.

Subsequent studies of all three anti-herpes agents demonstrated that early initiation of therapy (within 24 hours of symptoms) leads to faster resolution of recurrent cutaneous lesions and clinical symptoms compared with placebo [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-genital-herpes-simplex-virus-infection/abstract/9,25\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,25</a>]. Earlier trials generally used five days of episodic treatment, while later trials evaluated the efficacy of shorter courses of therapy (ie, one to three days) to improve patient convenience.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H30\"><span class=\"h2\">Duration of therapy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Early studies of episodic treatment utilized five days of antiviral therapy; however, subsequent studies have demonstrated that patients treated with high-dose antiviral medications for only one to three days have similar clinical benefits as those treated three times daily for the standard five-day regimen [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-genital-herpes-simplex-virus-infection/abstract/21,24\" class=\"abstract_t\">21,24</a>].

This was shown in a study in which 131 patients with recurrent infections were randomly assigned to 800 mg of acyclovir three times daily for two days or placebo; treatment was begun within 12 hours of first signs or symptoms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-genital-herpes-simplex-virus-infection/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. Compared with placebo, acyclovir was associated with more rapid healing of lesions (four versus six days) and decreased duration of viral shedding (25 versus 59 hours). Acyclovir therapy was also associated with a higher proportion of aborted clinical HSV episodes (ie, those lesions never progressing past a papule).</p><p>The optimal dosing regimen for <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acyclovir-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">acyclovir</a> is unclear. Similar efficacy has been reported with 800 mg three times daily for two days, 200 mg five times daily for five days, or 800 mg twice daily for five days [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-genital-herpes-simplex-virus-infection/abstract/26,27\" class=\"abstract_t\">26,27</a>].

Subjects were instructed to perform cultures and to start therapy within six hours of lesion or symptom onset.</p><p>Compared with placebo, each <a href=\"topic.htm?path=famciclovir-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">famciclovir</a> dose produced a significant acceleration in cutaneous healing and symptom resolution (by approximately one day) and cessation of viral shedding (by approximately two days). There was no difference with respect to lesion healing among the famciclovir dosage arms. A subsequent randomized controlled trial demonstrated that a two-day short-course regimen of famciclovir (500 mg initially, then 250 mg twice daily) was non-inferior to five days of famciclovir [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-genital-herpes-simplex-virus-infection/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>].</p><p>The efficacy of a shorter course of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=famciclovir-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">famciclovir</a> (two 1000 mg doses on a single day) was evaluated for episodic treatment of genital HSV in immunocompetent patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-genital-herpes-simplex-virus-infection/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. In this multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of 329 patients, famciclovir resulted in a faster median healing time compared with placebo (4.3 versus 6.1 days) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-genital-herpes-simplex-virus-infection/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. Furthermore, the proportion of patients with aborted lesions was greater in the famciclovir group than in the placebo group (23 versus 13 percent). These preliminary data suggest that early, high-dose antiviral therapy for a brief duration of time may also be a potential therapeutic option.

Antiviral therapy may be useful for the treatment of recurrent genital lesions in patients with fewer than six episodes annually to decrease the duration of signs and symptoms associated with HSV infection and to decrease the duration of viral shedding. However, alternative strategies include no treatment or chronic suppressive therapy, as discussed above. (See <a href=\"#H16\" class=\"local\">'Treatment strategies for recurrent disease'</a> above.)</p><p>Although few head-to-head comparisons have been performed, all available antiviral therapies appear to be similarly efficacious. Single-day therapy is an option with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=famciclovir-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">famciclovir</a> (1000 mg twice daily), which has been compared with a three-day course of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=valacyclovir-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">valacyclovir</a> (500 mg twice daily) with similar efficacy. If cost is a significant issue, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acyclovir-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">acyclovir</a> is generally less expensive, although it requires more frequent dosing and a longer duration of therapy. Some patients may prefer less frequent daily dosing and a longer duration of therapy, while others may prefer a shorter course of therapy.</p><p>Regardless of the antiviral agent used, treatment of recurrent episodes is associated with faster resolution of cutaneous lesions and clinical symptoms if initiated within the first 24 hours [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-genital-herpes-simplex-virus-infection/abstract/25,26,28\" class=\"abstract_t\">25,26,28</a>]. This is easiest to achieve if the patient is given a supply of medication, and therapy is initiated by the patient at the first sign of recurrence. It is important to counsel the patient that symptoms of recurrence can include tingling or paresthesias prior to the development of discrete lesions.</p><p>We agree with the 2015 Centers for Disease Control and Prevention guidelines, which recommend the following oral treatment options for episodic therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-genital-herpes-simplex-virus-infection/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><a href=\"topic.htm?path=acyclovir-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Acyclovir</a>: 800 mg three times daily for two days; or 800 mg twice daily for five days; or 400 mg three times daily for five days</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><a href=\"topic.htm?path=famciclovir-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Famciclovir</a>: 1000 mg twice daily for a single day duration; or 125 mg twice daily for five days; or 500 mg once, followed by 250 mg twice daily for two days</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><a href=\"topic.htm?path=valacyclovir-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Valacyclovir</a>: 500 mg twice daily for three days or 1000 mg once daily for five days</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H36\"><span class=\"h1\">SUPPRESSIVE THERAPY FOR RECURRENT GENITAL HERPES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Suppressive therapy for recurrent genital herpes involves the administration of daily chronic therapy, which reduces viral shedding [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-genital-herpes-simplex-virus-infection/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>]. Studies of suppressive therapy for recurrent HSV have assessed efficacy according to time to first recurrence, frequency of recurrences, severity and duration of recurrences, viral shedding, and frequency of recurrences after treatment. Of these, the most reliable clinical measures of antiviral benefit include the time to first recurrence and frequency of recurrences over time [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-genital-herpes-simplex-virus-infection/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>].</p><p>Studies have demonstrated that approximately half of patients on suppressive therapy remain recurrence-free and other patients have a significant reduction in frequency of recurrences (70 to 80 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-genital-herpes-simplex-virus-infection/abstract/9,37\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,37</a>]. Chronic suppressive therapy is usually offered to patients who experience six or more clinical episodes per year or who experience significant anxiety or distress related to their clinical recurrences. Suppressive therapy also decreases the risk of transmission to an uninfected sexual partner. (See <a href=\"#H43\" class=\"local\">'Valacyclovir use in discordant couples'</a> below.)</p><p>The safety of long-term therapy has been demonstrated over six years of continuous treatment in one study of 239 patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-genital-herpes-simplex-virus-infection/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. However, as noted above, in the natural course of disease, the number of recurrences diminishes with time, whether or not antiviral therapy is administered [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-genital-herpes-simplex-virus-infection/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>].

However, some patients may not desire treatment discontinuation due to concerns about severity of recurrent lesions during treatment interruption, which has been reported [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-genital-herpes-simplex-virus-infection/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>].</p><p>The relative efficacy of the available antiviral medications for suppression of genital herpes has been analyzed in a large meta-analysis of 6158 immunocompetent patients from 14 randomized placebo-controlled trials [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-genital-herpes-simplex-virus-infection/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>].

After the primary episode, genital HSV infection can recur frequently in a subset of patients, particularly those infected with HSV-2. (See <a href=\"#H1\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Over time, clinical HSV recurrences generally decrease in frequency, although there is substantial variability in the clinical course from patient to patient. Antiviral therapy does not change the biology of latent HSV, whether given during the first episode of primary infection or during recurrent disease. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Natural history of infection'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><a href=\"topic.htm?path=acyclovir-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Acyclovir</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=famciclovir-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">famciclovir</a>, and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=valacyclovir-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">valacyclovir</a> all have similar antiviral activity against HSV, although famciclovir and valacyclovir have improved bioavailability versus acyclovir. Safety and tolerability are excellent with all three agents. (See <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'Antiviral agents'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Among patients with a primary episode of genital HSV, we recommend antiviral therapy (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=1\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1A</a>). Clinical trials have demonstrated comparable efficacy of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acyclovir-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">acyclovir</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=famciclovir-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">famciclovir</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=valacyclovir-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">valacyclovir</a>; the last has the convenience of twice-daily dosing. (See <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'Treatment of primary HSV'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients with recurrent genital HSV, clinical considerations that influence the management strategy include the frequency of recurrent episodes and the severity of symptoms. Specific options include episodic therapy, chronic suppressive therapy, or no treatment.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a patient with &ge;6 recurrent episodes per year <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> severely symptomatic disease, we suggest chronic suppressive antiviral therapy rather than episodic treatment (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=5\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2B</a>). <a href=\"topic.htm?path=valacyclovir-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Valacyclovir</a> offers the convenience of once-daily therapy in this situation.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Among patients with &lt;6 recurrent episodes per year or moderately symptomatic disease, we suggest administration of episodic antiviral therapy rather than chronic suppression (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=5\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2B</a>). Clinical trials have demonstrated comparable efficacy of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acyclovir-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">acyclovir</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=famciclovir-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">famciclovir</a>, and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=valacyclovir-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">valacyclovir</a>. Single-day therapy with famciclovir (1000 mg twice daily) is a convenient option with similar efficacy as a three-day course of valacyclovir (500 mg twice daily). (See <a href=\"#H28\" class=\"local\">'Episodic treatment of recurrent genital herpes'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patient preference must also be strongly considered in choosing between these treatment strategies. The presence of severe psychological stress related to HSV outbreaks may favor suppressive therapy, regardless of frequency, whereas the lower cost and convenience of short-term therapy may favor episodic treatment for some patients. (See <a href=\"#H16\" class=\"local\">'Treatment strategies for recurrent disease'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>No therapeutic intervention may be appropriate for some patients, particularly those with infrequent episodes <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> minimal symptoms.
