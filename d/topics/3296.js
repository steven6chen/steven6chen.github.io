Osteosarcomas are uncommon; approximately 750 to 900 cases are diagnosed each year in the United States, of which 400 are in children and adolescents under the age of 20 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chemotherapy-and-radiation-therapy-in-the-management-of-osteosarcoma/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=osteosarcoma-epidemiology-pathogenesis-clinical-presentation-diagnosis-and-histology\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Osteosarcoma: Epidemiology, pathogenesis, clinical presentation, diagnosis, and histology&quot;</a>.)</p><p>This topic review will cover the use of adjuvant and neoadjuvant chemotherapy and radiation therapy (RT) in the management of osteosarcoma. The same principles apply to other primary bone tumors, such as fibrosarcoma and undifferentiated high-grade pleomorphic sarcoma (previously referred to as malignant fibrous histiocytoma of bone), and they are treated similarly [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chemotherapy-and-radiation-therapy-in-the-management-of-osteosarcoma/abstract/3,4\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,4</a>]. On the other hand, primary bone angiosarcomas do not behave clinically like other primary bone tumors, and these patients are treated according to the principles of soft tissue sarcoma rather than osteosarcoma. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-multimodality-treatment-for-primary-soft-tissue-sarcoma-of-the-extremities-and-chest-wall\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of multimodality treatment for primary soft tissue sarcoma of the extremities and chest wall&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=adjuvant-and-neoadjuvant-chemotherapy-for-soft-tissue-sarcoma-of-the-extremities\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Adjuvant and neoadjuvant chemotherapy for soft tissue sarcoma of the extremities&quot;</a>.) </p><p>The surgical management of patients with primary bone tumors, the clinical features, epidemiology, diagnosis, pathology, and pathogenesis of osteosarcoma, the management of osteosarcomas arising in the head and neck, the management of chondrosarcomas in general and of chordomas and chondrosarcomas arising in the skull base, and the treatment of Ewing sarcoma are addressed separately.

There are conflicting data on their management as soft tissue sarcomas or osteosarcoma of bone [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chemotherapy-and-radiation-therapy-in-the-management-of-osteosarcoma/abstract/5,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,6</a>]. These tumors are treated as soft tissue sarcomas at some institutions, with surgery and radiation alone or surgery, radiation, and soft tissue-based chemotherapy. At other institutions, they are treated as osteogenic sarcomas, with surgery, radiation, and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=doxorubicin-conventional-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">doxorubicin</a> plus <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cisplatin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cisplatin</a> with or without <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methotrexate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">methotrexate</a>. The choice of chemotherapy is best determined by the availability of clinical trials and, otherwise, is decided on a patient-by-patient basis, balancing the risks and benefits of chemotherapy for this high-risk diagnosis.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1780929\"><span class=\"h1\">PROGNOSIS AND EVOLUTION OF TREATMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The survival of patients with malignant bone sarcomas has improved dramatically over the past 40 years, largely as a result of the use of effective chemotherapy. Before the routine use of systemic therapy for conventional osteosarcoma, 80 to 90 percent of patients developed metastases, despite achieving local tumor control, and died of their disease. It was surmised (and subsequently demonstrated [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chemotherapy-and-radiation-therapy-in-the-management-of-osteosarcoma/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]) that subclinical metastatic disease was present at the time of diagnosis in the majority of patients and that chemotherapy can successfully eradicate these deposits if initiated at a time when disease burden is low. The benefits of chemotherapy are best illustrated by a systematic review of the literature, which showed that long-term survival after local tumor control without chemotherapy was only 16 percent (95% CI 9-23 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chemotherapy-and-radiation-therapy-in-the-management-of-osteosarcoma/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. In contrast, the addition of systemic chemotherapy with three or more drugs provided a five-year overall survival rate of 70 percent.</p><p>Chemotherapy is now considered a standard component of osteosarcoma treatment, both in children and in adults. The choice of regimen and the optimal timing (ie, preoperative versus postoperative) are controversial; however, many centers preferentially utilize preoperative chemotherapy, particularly if a limb-sparing procedure is being contemplated for an extremity osteosarcoma. (See <a href=\"#H82108693\" class=\"local\">'Neoadjuvant versus adjuvant chemotherapy'</a> below and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=bone-sarcomas-preoperative-evaluation-histologic-classification-and-principles-of-surgical-management\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Bone sarcomas: Preoperative evaluation, histologic classification, and principles of surgical management&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Despite an active search for new agents, the standards of care for neoadjuvant or adjuvant therapy have not changed materially in the last 20 years. Nonetheless, with present-day therapy, approximately two-thirds of children, adolescents, and adults under the age of 40 with nonmetastatic extremity osteosarcomas will be long-term survivors and presumably cured of their disease. Prognosis is worse for those with a primary tumor in the pelvis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chemotherapy-and-radiation-therapy-in-the-management-of-osteosarcoma/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].</p><p> Long-term survival can be expected in less than 20 percent of all other patients who present with or develop overt metastatic disease; however, up to 35 to 40 percent of those with limited pulmonary metastases may be cured with multimodality therapy. In most (but not all [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chemotherapy-and-radiation-therapy-in-the-management-of-osteosarcoma/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]) series, prognosis is worse for adults than for children [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chemotherapy-and-radiation-therapy-in-the-management-of-osteosarcoma/abstract/11-14\" class=\"abstract_t\">11-14</a>]. </p><p>A nomogram predicting metastasis-free and overall survival for patients undergoing neoadjuvant chemotherapy and surgery for nonmetastatic disease has been developed and validated [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chemotherapy-and-radiation-therapy-in-the-management-of-osteosarcoma/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">OVERVIEW OF PRIMARY MANAGEMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Surgery and systemic chemotherapy are the mainstays of treatment for patients with nonmetastatic osteosarcoma.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3273656185\"><span class=\"h2\">Local therapy</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Surgery is a standard of care for management of osteogenic sarcoma. For most patients, limb-sparing surgery is as effective as is amputation. As is outlined below, chemotherapy is usually given prior to surgery (neoadjuvant therapy) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chemotherapy-and-radiation-therapy-in-the-management-of-osteosarcoma/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>].

In some cases, if patients decline surgery or if surgical morbidity relative to a patient's comorbidities does not permit surgery, definitive radiation can be considered. Intensity-modulated radiation therapy is the standard of care in this scenario, while proton beam irradiation can be considered, particularly for younger patients, to reduce the radiation dose to noninvolved normal tissues [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chemotherapy-and-radiation-therapy-in-the-management-of-osteosarcoma/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>].

It is presumed that subclinical metastases are present at diagnosis in the majority of patients. The survival of patients with malignant bone sarcomas has improved dramatically over the past 30 years, largely owing to chemotherapeutic advances. Adjuvant chemotherapy significantly improves survival compared with surgery alone and is considered a standard component of therapy for both children and adults.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The optimal timing of chemotherapy (ie, preoperative versus postoperative) has not been established.

An important point is that chemotherapy is not a substitute for sound surgical judgment when assessing the need for amputation. It is reasonable to proceed to immediate surgery followed by adjuvant chemotherapy if the nature of the resection would not necessarily be influenced by a good response to chemotherapy.

If preoperative therapy is chosen, we administer 10 weeks of chemotherapy prior to surgery and continue postoperative chemotherapy for 29 weeks, beginning one week postoperatively. Where available, mifamurtide (muramyl tripeptide phosphatidylethanolamine [MTP-PE]) can be used in addition to MAP chemotherapy.

Two subsequent randomized studies conducted in the 1980s demonstrated significant relapse-free and overall survival benefits for adjuvant chemotherapy that persisted over time [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chemotherapy-and-radiation-therapy-in-the-management-of-osteosarcoma/abstract/21-24\" class=\"abstract_t\">21-24</a>], although the trials were limited in size, and the survival benefits were modest.

Because of the time needed for fabrication of custom metallic endoprostheses, chemotherapy was often given while awaiting definitive surgery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chemotherapy-and-radiation-therapy-in-the-management-of-osteosarcoma/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. The ability to function as an in vivo drug trial to determine the drug sensitivity of an individual tumor and to customize postoperative therapy is one of the most compelling rationales for neoadjuvant chemotherapy.</p><p>Responsiveness of an osteosarcoma to neoadjuvant chemotherapy is a major determinant of clinical outcome for most histologic subtypes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chemotherapy-and-radiation-therapy-in-the-management-of-osteosarcoma/abstract/26-33\" class=\"abstract_t\">26-33</a>]. Five-year survival rates for patients with an extremity sarcoma and a &quot;good&quot; response to chemotherapy (as defined by 90 percent or more necrosis in the surgical specimen) are significantly higher than for those with a lesser response (71 to 80 versus 45 to 60 percent, respectively) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chemotherapy-and-radiation-therapy-in-the-management-of-osteosarcoma/abstract/29,31,32,34\" class=\"abstract_t\">29,31,32,34</a>] (see <a href=\"#H782299759\" class=\"local\">'The option to change systemic therapy after neoadjuvant chemotherapy and surgery'</a> below). However, the demonstration of an inverse relationship between the predictive value of tumor necrosis and the intensity of induction therapy in one report has led to questions about the true value of histologic response as a prognostic marker [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chemotherapy-and-radiation-therapy-in-the-management-of-osteosarcoma/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>].</p><p>Certain subtypes, such as chondroblastic osteosarcoma, have lower rates of necrosis, yet there are no differences in outcome between good and poor responders to neoadjuvant chemotherapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chemotherapy-and-radiation-therapy-in-the-management-of-osteosarcoma/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>].

Chemotherapy consisted of alternating courses of HDMTX with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=leucovorin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">leucovorin</a> rescue, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cisplatin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cisplatin</a> plus <a href=\"topic.htm?path=doxorubicin-conventional-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">doxorubicin</a>, and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=bleomycin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">bleomycin</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cyclophosphamide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cyclophosphamide</a>, and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dactinomycin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">dactinomycin</a> (BCD). The five-year relapse-free survival rates were similar between the two groups (65 versus 61 percent for adjuvant and neoadjuvant therapy, respectively), as was the limb-salvage rate (55 and 50 percent for immediate and delayed surgery, respectively).</p><p>The study was criticized for the relatively low rate of limb-sparing surgery in both groups (by modern standards) and the inclusion of BCD as a component of the regimen. The contribution of BCD to the therapeutic efficacy of this regimen is unclear, while it can clearly contribute to long-term bleomycin-related pulmonary toxicity (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=bleomycin-induced-lung-injury\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Bleomycin-induced lung injury&quot;</a>). Nevertheless, this trial established that survival was similarly improved by either presurgical or postsurgical chemotherapy and established a benchmark outcome for future studies (five-year event-free survival [EFS] 65 percent).</p><p>Due to its success in killing cancer cells (although actual tumor shrinkage during treatment is not common, particularly with chondroblastic osteosarcomas), neoadjuvant chemotherapy has evolved to a method of increasing the proportion of patients who are suitable candidates for limb-salvage surgery. The majority of limb-sparing surgical procedures for extremity osteosarcomas are now performed at institutions using presurgical chemotherapy.</p><p>While it is clear that the number of patients with osteosarcoma who are deemed suitable candidates for limb-sparing surgery has increased in parallel with the increasing use of presurgical chemotherapy, this finding may reflect improvements in reconstructive techniques and the increased experience and confidence of tumor surgeons rather than a benefit attributable to the use of induction chemotherapy. A major concern in this regard is the possibility that inexperienced surgeons may expand selection criteria to accommodate inappropriate candidates who might be better served by amputation.
