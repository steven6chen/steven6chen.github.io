For most children, atherosclerotic vascular changes are minor and can be minimized or even prevented with adherence to a healthy lifestyle. However, in some children, the process is accelerated because of the presence of identifiable risk factors (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F109927\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef109927 \">table 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diseases-associated-with-atherosclerosis-in-childhood/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p>Pediatric diseases that are associated with an increased risk of accelerated atherosclerosis and CVD will be discussed here.

In a scientific statement from the American Heart Association (AHA), a panel of experts reviewed the literature on premature cardiovascular disease in children and established a disease risk stratification schema for coronary artery disease (CAD), which was revised into a two-tier schema by the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI) panel in 2011 (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F54963\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef54963 \">algorithm 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diseases-associated-with-atherosclerosis-in-childhood/abstract/2,3\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,3</a>].</p><p>This schema separates diseases into high and moderate risk categories for CVD as follows:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>High risk conditions</strong> &ndash;

A quarter of deaths in children with ESRD are due to CVD. Accelerated atherosclerosis has been demonstrated in iliac artery samples at the time of renal transplantation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diseases-associated-with-atherosclerosis-in-childhood/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>] or at autopsy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diseases-associated-with-atherosclerosis-in-childhood/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].</p><p>Children with ESRD are at risk for CVD risk factors, including hypertension and dyslipidemia.

In developed countries, KD has surpassed rheumatic fever as the leading cause of acquired cardiovascular disease (CVD) in childhood.</p><p>In untreated patients, the incidence of coronary artery aneurysms is about 20 to 25 percent, with a mortality rate of approximately 2 percent.

Increasing evidence suggests that children and adolescents affected by these disorders often have increased CVD risk factors, with nearly three-quarters reported to have accelerated atherosclerosis associated with dyslipidemia, and a higher risk of premature cardiovascular events [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diseases-associated-with-atherosclerosis-in-childhood/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>].

However, in children infected with HIV early in life, prolonged exposure to HIV and ART is associated with a number of long-term complications, including dyslipidemia, diabetes, lipodystrophy, and hypertension [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diseases-associated-with-atherosclerosis-in-childhood/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. As a consequence, individuals with long-term HIV infection are at risk for premature vasculopathy and CVD. Patients with perinatally-acquired HIV infection have been found to have indirect evidence of subclinical coronary vascular disease (ie, increased coronary artery wall thickness) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diseases-associated-with-atherosclerosis-in-childhood/abstract/22,23\" class=\"abstract_t\">22,23</a>]. The etiology of CVD risk in youth with perinatal HIV infection is likely multifactorial. In addition to traditional CVD risk factors, chronic inflammation, abnormal immune function, side effects of ART, and direct HIV viral effects may contribute. Long-term morbidities in HIV-infected children are discussed separately.

The association between depressive and bipolar disorders, particularly major depression, and CVD in adults is well-established.

These guidelines are based upon studies of childhood cancer survivors that have established the association of cancer survival with premature CVD. However, these guidelines have not been validated in clinical trials, because the relatively small size of the survivor population and the prevalence and latency of cardiovascular sequelae precludes the ability to evaluate the impact of screening upon CVD mortality and morbidity associated with childhood cancer therapy.

Because of improved palliative and corrective surgery, many more children are surviving to adulthood.
