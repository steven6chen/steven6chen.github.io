Perturbations in intestinal epithelial barrier function or innate immune bacterial killing, for example, can lead to an inflammatory response caused by increased uptake of bacterial and food antigens that stimulate the mucosal immune system [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/probiotics-for-gastrointestinal-diseases/abstract/1-4\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-4</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=immune-and-microbial-mechanisms-in-the-pathogenesis-of-inflammatory-bowel-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Immune and microbial mechanisms in the pathogenesis of inflammatory bowel disease&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Interactions between intestinal microbes and the host are the subject of intensive ongoing research since they may influence a variety of diseases. Part of this research involves the deliberate manipulation of the intestinal microflora with a therapeutic intention. The greatest experience has been in the inflammatory bowel diseases, ulcerative colitis, Crohn disease, and pouchitis, although clinical trials are emerging in several other conditions.</p><p>There are four general methods by which the intestinal microflora can be altered: administration of antibiotics, prebiotics (ie, dietary components that promote the growth and metabolic activity of beneficial bacteria), probiotics (ie, beneficial bacteria), or fecal transplant (bacteriotherapy). Combination of these methods is also possible (synbiotics). Interest in these approaches has extended well beyond the clinical sciences since a role for intestinal microbes in health and disease has been recognized in alternative and complementary forms of medicine for many years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/probiotics-for-gastrointestinal-diseases/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. In a case control study, 51 percent of ulcerative colitis patients and 43 percent of patients with Crohn disease used probiotics compared with 21 percent of healthy controls [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/probiotics-for-gastrointestinal-diseases/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. In comparison, systematic evaluation of the efficacy of probiotics is relatively recent. This topic review focuses on clinical trials of probiotics in gastrointestinal diseases.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">DEFINITION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Probiotics are microorganisms that have beneficial properties for the host. Most commercial products have been derived from food sources, especially cultured milk products. The list of such microorganisms continues to grow and includes strains of lactic acid bacilli (eg, <em>Lactobacillus</em> and <em>Bifidobacterium</em>), a nonpathogenic strain of <em>Escherichia coli</em> (eg, <em>E. coli </em>Nissle 1917), <em>Clostridium butyricum, Streptococcus salivarius</em>, and<em> </em><a href=\"topic.htm?path=saccharomyces-boulardii-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Saccharomyces boulardii</a> (a nonpathogenic strain of yeast). Also under development are strains of bacteria that have been genetically engineered to secrete immunomodulators (such as interleukin-10, trefoil factors, or defensins, or express altered surface proteins such as lipoteichoic acid), which have the potential to favorably influence the immune system [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/probiotics-for-gastrointestinal-diseases/abstract/7-9\" class=\"abstract_t\">7-9</a>]. More recently, the concept of restoring levels of protective commensal bacterial species that are diminished in certain disorders, such as Crohn disease, has been advanced [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/probiotics-for-gastrointestinal-diseases/abstract/10-12\" class=\"abstract_t\">10-12</a>]. </p><p>Initial studies of selected probiotic species (given alone or in combination) have suggested potential efficacy in several gastrointestinal illnesses, the best studied of which are the inflammatory bowel diseases (particularly pouchitis) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/probiotics-for-gastrointestinal-diseases/abstract/13-19\" class=\"abstract_t\">13-19</a>]. Therapeutic benefit has also been suggested in several other disorders, including antibiotic-related diarrhea, <em>Clostridium difficile</em> toxin-induced colitis, infectious diarrhea, hepatic encephalopathy, irritable bowel syndrome, and allergy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/probiotics-for-gastrointestinal-diseases/abstract/20,21\" class=\"abstract_t\">20,21</a>].</p><p>Some of the more commonly available probiotics include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>VSL#3 (<em>Bifidobacterium breve, B. longum, B. infantis, Lactobacillus acidophilus, L. plantarum, L. paracasei, L. bulgaricus, Streptococcus thermophilus</em>)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Align (<em>B. infantis</em>)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Culturelle (<em>L. rhamnosus </em>GG)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>DanActive (<em>L. casei</em>)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Mutaflor (<em>E. coli </em>Nissle 1917)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Florastor (<em>S. boulardii</em>)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">MECHANISMS OF BENEFIT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Mechanisms for the benefits of probiotics are incompletely understood. However, four general benefits have been described [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/probiotics-for-gastrointestinal-diseases/abstract/22,23\" class=\"abstract_t\">22,23</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Suppression of growth or epithelial <span class=\"nowrap\">binding/invasion</span> by pathogenic bacteria [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/probiotics-for-gastrointestinal-diseases/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Improvement of intestinal barrier function [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/probiotics-for-gastrointestinal-diseases/abstract/25-27\" class=\"abstract_t\">25-27</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Modulation of the immune system. Several probiotic species or their products induce protective cytokines, including IL-10 and TGF-beta, and suppress proinflammatory cytokines, such as TNF, in the mucosa of patients with pouchitis, ulcerative colitis, and Crohn disease, in murine experimental colitis, and in isolated splenocytes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/probiotics-for-gastrointestinal-diseases/abstract/10,24,26,28-32\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,24,26,28-32</a>]. <em>S. boulardii</em> limited the migration of T-helper 1 cells in inflamed colon tissue in a mouse model of inflammatory bowel disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/probiotics-for-gastrointestinal-diseases/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Modulation of pain perception. Some <em>Lactobacillus</em> strains appear to induce expression of micro-opioid and cannabinoid receptors in intestinal epithelial cells and mediate analgesic functions in the gut in a manner similar to the effects of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=morphine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">morphine</a> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/probiotics-for-gastrointestinal-diseases/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>].</p><p/><p>Probiotics differ in their ability to resist gastric acid and bile acids, colonize the intestinal tract, and influence cytokines secreted by intestinal epithelial cells [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/probiotics-for-gastrointestinal-diseases/abstract/26,28,35-40\" class=\"abstract_t\">26,28,35-40</a>]. Thus, not all probiotics are alike; as a result, benefits observed clinically with one species or with a combination of species are not necessarily generalizable to another.</p><p>Although yogurt is commonly recommended as a source of probiotics, not all of the live cultures contained in yogurt survive well in an acidic environment nor do they colonize the microbiota efficiently [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/probiotics-for-gastrointestinal-diseases/abstract/41,42\" class=\"abstract_t\">41,42</a>]. In addition, some yogurt preparations in the United States are pasteurized, thereby killing the bacteria. Furthermore, the residual lactose contained in yogurt can increase symptoms in patients with lactose intolerance, including those who develop secondary lactose intolerance due to an antecedent gastroenteritis (a setting in which probiotics have been recommended). Fermented dairy beverages containing much higher concentrations of live cultures than yogurt or cultures that are relatively resistant to gastric acid are also available.</p><p>An interesting observation indicates that it may not be necessary to administer living organisms to achieve a benefit. Secreted proteins and DNA of one probiotic preparation (VSL#3, Nature's Pharmaceuticals, Inc.) blocked cytokine activation and prevented apoptosis of epithelial cells [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/probiotics-for-gastrointestinal-diseases/abstract/43,44\" class=\"abstract_t\">43,44</a>]. The effects depended upon the specific DNA from the different bacterial species that were components of the preparation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/probiotics-for-gastrointestinal-diseases/abstract/43\" class=\"abstract_t\">43</a>]. Non-methylated DNA from VSL#3, as well as other randomly selected <em>E. coli</em> strains, suppressed experimental colitis in several animal models [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/probiotics-for-gastrointestinal-diseases/abstract/45\" class=\"abstract_t\">45</a>]. These therapeutic effects are mediated through toll-like receptor 9 and with induction of type 1 interferons <span class=\"nowrap\">alpha/beta</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/probiotics-for-gastrointestinal-diseases/abstract/46\" class=\"abstract_t\">46</a>]. Defined molecular weight proteins from other probiotic species, including <em>Lactobacillus </em>GG, can also inhibit proinflammatory signaling and inflammatory cytokine-induced apoptosis in colonic epithelial cells through an epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)-dependent mechanism [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/probiotics-for-gastrointestinal-diseases/abstract/26,27\" class=\"abstract_t\">26,27</a>], while secreted products from a variety of species can inhibit cytokine production [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/probiotics-for-gastrointestinal-diseases/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>].</p><p>Some studies demonstrate that products of endogenous commensal microbiota can have beneficial effects, creating opportunities for therapeutic manipulation beyond the traditional <em>Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium</em> species. For example, <em>Faecalibacterium prausnitzii</em>, which is decreased in Crohn disease, secretes yet to be defined products that suppress experimental colitis and proinflammatory cytokines [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/probiotics-for-gastrointestinal-diseases/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>], and polysaccharide A of <em>Bacteroides fragilis</em> stimulates regulatory T cells in a TLR2, IL-10-dependent fashion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/probiotics-for-gastrointestinal-diseases/abstract/47\" class=\"abstract_t\">47</a>]. Clostridium species comprising Groups IV and XIVA, which are selectively decreased in active IBD patients, can induce IL-10 producing immunosuppressive IL-10 and regulatory T cells [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/probiotics-for-gastrointestinal-diseases/abstract/11,48\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,48</a>]. This approach will likely be available for therapeutic use in the foreseeable future.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10298057\"><span class=\"h1\">GASTROINTESTINAL INFLAMMATION</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Pouchitis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>For the surgical treatment of ulcerative colitis (UC) and familial adenomatous polyposis, proctocolectomy with ileal pouch-anal anastomosis (IPAA) is the favored alternative to proctocolectomy with permanent ileostomy since it preserves intestinal continuity and sphincter function and removes almost all of the colorectal mucosa. This procedure consists of total abdominal colectomy and the construction of a J or S-shaped ileal pouch that is anastomosed to the anus.</p><p>The most frequently observed long-term complication of IPAA is acute <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> chronic inflammation of the ileal reservoir, called pouchitis. Symptoms of pouchitis include increased stool frequency, urgency, hematochezia, abdominal pain, fever, and extraintestinal manifestations of inflammatory bowel diseases (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pouchitis-epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pouchitis: Epidemiology, clinical manifestations, and diagnosis&quot;</a>). Pouchitis affects approximately 20 percent of ulcerative colitis patients in the first year after creation of the IPAA and 50 percent of patients after five years, but less than 1 percent of patients with colectomies to treat familial polyposis.</p><p>Detailed studies of the microflora in patients with pouchitis have demonstrated unique patterns, including the persistence of <em>Fusobacteria</em> and enteric species, increased <em>Clostridium perfringens</em>, and the absence of <em>Streptococcus</em> species in the inflamed pouch [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/probiotics-for-gastrointestinal-diseases/abstract/49,50\" class=\"abstract_t\">49,50</a>]. These observations and a high rate of response to various antibiotics support a role for bacteria in the pathogenesis of pouchitis and provide a rationale for clinical trials aimed at altering the microflora with probiotics.</p><p>Small controlled trials have suggested that at least one probiotic preparation (VSL#3) containing 5 X 10(11) per gram of four <em>Lactobacillus</em> species, three <em>Bifidobacterium</em> species, and one strain of <em>Streptococcus</em> salivarius subspecies thermophilus may be effective in prevention of recurrent pouchitis after antibiotic induction of remission.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A randomized, placebo-controlled trial included 40 patients with a history of chronic, relapsing pouchitis who were placed into clinical and endoscopic remission with broad spectrum antibiotics [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/probiotics-for-gastrointestinal-diseases/abstract/51\" class=\"abstract_t\">51</a>]. Patients were randomly assigned to VSL#3 6 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/day</span> or placebo. After nine months of daily treatment, significantly fewer patients in the probiotic group had experienced a relapse (15 versus 100 percent). Within three months of stopping treatment, all patients in the VSL#3 group had relapsed. Likewise, fecal <em>lactobacillus</em> and <em>bifidobacteria</em> concentrations returned to pretreatment levels within one month after therapy was discontinued, indicating that permanent colonization with the probiotic species did not occur.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A second study from the same group and investigators in London included 36 patients with recurrent or refractory pouchitis who had required antibiotics at least twice in the previous year [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/probiotics-for-gastrointestinal-diseases/abstract/52\" class=\"abstract_t\">52</a>]. After achieving remission, patients were randomly assigned to VSL#3 or placebo once daily for one year. Significantly more patients in the probiotic group remained in remission (85 versus 6 percent). Patients randomized to VSL#3 also had significantly better quality of life.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A third study from the same group included 40 consecutive patients who underwent IPAA for ulcerative colitis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/probiotics-for-gastrointestinal-diseases/abstract/53\" class=\"abstract_t\">53</a>]. Patients were randomly assigned to receive VSL#3 3 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/day</span> or placebo immediately after ileostomy closure for one year. Patients receiving the probiotic had significantly fewer episodes of pouchitis (10 versus 40 percent). Probiotic treatment was also associated with significant improvement in quality of life compared with placebo.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Somewhat different conclusions were reached in an observational study in the United States that involved 31 patients with antibiotic-dependent pouchitis who were treated with VSL#3 after achieving remission with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ciprofloxacin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ciprofloxacin</a> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/probiotics-for-gastrointestinal-diseases/abstract/54\" class=\"abstract_t\">54</a>]. After eight months, only a minority of patients remained on probiotic therapy and in symptomatic remission (most having stopped it due to recurrence of symptoms or adverse effects).</p><p/><p>No benefit from another probiotic (<em>Lactobacillus rhamnosus </em>GG) was found in another, albeit small, controlled trial [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/probiotics-for-gastrointestinal-diseases/abstract/55\" class=\"abstract_t\">55</a>]. Furthermore, only 40 percent of patients who received the probiotic became colonized. A systematic review concluded that VSL#3 was more effective than placebo for preventing relapse of chronic pouchitis and preventing onset of pouchitis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/probiotics-for-gastrointestinal-diseases/abstract/56\" class=\"abstract_t\">56</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Ulcerative colitis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Although various probiotic species have shown promise in the treatment of ulcerative colitis, given the small number of patients in these studies and the risks associated with probiotics, two systematic reviews have concluded that there is insufficient evidence to support the use of probiotics for the induction or maintenance of remission in ulcerative colitis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/probiotics-for-gastrointestinal-diseases/abstract/16,57\" class=\"abstract_t\">16,57</a>].

Finally, costs to the patient may be considerable since no preparation is FDA approved and most are not reimbursed by insurers. Enthusiasm for probiotics has outpaced the scientific evidence.
