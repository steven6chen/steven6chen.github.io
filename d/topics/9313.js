In countries around the world, 10 to 69 percent of women report physical assault by an intimate partner at some time in their life [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intimate-partner-violence-epidemiology-and-health-consequences/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p>The term &quot;intimate partner violence&quot; describes actual or threatened psychological, physical, or sexual harm by a current or former partner or spouse. IPV can occur among people with any gender identities and sexual orientations and does not require sexual intimacy.</p><p>Abusive relationships often begin as verbal and emotional abuse but may become physical. Most women who are victims of physical aggression experience multiple episodes of aggression over time [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intimate-partner-violence-epidemiology-and-health-consequences/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. &quot;Intimate terrorism,&quot; in which a passive victim in an abusive relationship lives in constant fear of the next episode of abuse, is the classic IPV paradigm. However, IPV may be <span class=\"nowrap\">mutual/bidirectional</span> (&quot;situational violence&quot;) or may take the form of &quot;violent resistance,&quot; in which the identified victim fights back [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intimate-partner-violence-epidemiology-and-health-consequences/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].</p><p>The underlying psychological dynamic in most types of violence is power and control of the victim by the abuser. The assumption that within a heterosexual relationship all violence is initiated by men and directed towards women is not correct, although women are far more likely to experience IPV than men [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intimate-partner-violence-epidemiology-and-health-consequences/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p>This topic will review the epidemiology and health consequences of intimate partner violence.

Experiencing abuse in one domain may increase the risk of other types of abuse.

Threats of physical or sexual violence use words, gestures, or weapons to communicate an intent to cause physical harm, injury, disability, or death.</p><p>Psychological violence may include humiliation, control over what a person can and cannot do, withholding information, isolating the victim from friends and family, or denying access to money or other basic resources. This type of IPV may also include stalking (repeated behavior that causes victims to experience a high level of fear) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intimate-partner-violence-epidemiology-and-health-consequences/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H86601645\"><span class=\"h2\">Physical violence</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Physical violence is the intentional use of physical force with the potential to cause harm, injury, disability, or death. Physical violence includes scratching, pushing, shoving, throwing, grabbing, biting, strangulating, shaking, slapping, punching, or burning. It may also include using a weapon, restraints, or one's size or strength against another person.</p><p>Physical violence varies in frequency and severity, ranging from one hit to chronic severe battering.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H86601652\"><span class=\"h2\">Sexual violence</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Sexual violence may occur in the context of intimate partners, including date rape, but may also occur between strangers.

Gender-based violence also encompasses rape by strangers, female genital mutilation, sexual harassment in the workplace, selective malnutrition of girls, and human trafficking. These problems are based in the family, the community, and the political system (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F86332\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef86332 \">table 1</a>).</p><p>This model is limited by the assumption that perpetration occurs only from men to women and that only women are victims. It also focuses more on physical and sexual, rather than emotional, types of IPV. However, it does provide a framework that may be useful in understanding how IPV occurs in societies worldwide. It also emphasizes the role of society and community, rather than individual factors, in promoting and perpetuating violence.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H86601666\"><span class=\"h1\">EPIDEMIOLOGY</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H86601674\"><span class=\"h2\">United States data</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Only a small percentage of intimate partner violence (IPV) episodes are reported, so that epidemiologic data are estimates only [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intimate-partner-violence-epidemiology-and-health-consequences/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. Among women in the United States, it has been estimated that about 20 percent of sexual assaults, 25 percent of physical assaults, and 50 percent of stalking episodes are reported [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intimate-partner-violence-epidemiology-and-health-consequences/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Even fewer IPV incidents against men are reported. There are limited data from survey studies suggesting higher rates of IPV among people with non-majority gender identities and sexual orientations.

Lifetime prevalence of physical or sexual IPV ranged from 15 to 75 percent; the prevalence was 50 to 75 percent in 6 of the 15 sites.

The proportion of female homicides attributable to IPV (38.6 percent) was six times higher than for male homicides (6.3 percent), but since homicide rates are four times higher in males than females, in absolute numbers, there are three IPV-related homicides in women for every two IPV-related homicides in men.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H86601695\"><span class=\"h2\">Pregnancy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Domestic violence often begins or increases during pregnancy and the postpartum period [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intimate-partner-violence-epidemiology-and-health-consequences/abstract/21-23\" class=\"abstract_t\">21-23</a>].

IPV can occur among people with any gender identity and sexual orientation and does not require sexual intimacy. (See <a href=\"#H86601624\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Three main types of IPV are psychological, physical, and sexual. Psychological violence relates to threats of actions or coercive tactics, including stalking. Physical violence is the intentional use of physical force with the potential to cause harm, injury, disability, or death. Sexual violence includes use of force to compel a sexual act, a sexual act with a person who is unable to consent, or abusive sexual contact. (See <a href=\"#H86601631\" class=\"local\">'Types of intimate partner violence'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Sexual and physical IPV assaults are greatly underreported. A United States survey found that 24 percent of women and 12 percent of men acknowledged a lifetime threatened or completed physical or sexual IPV. Worldwide, lifetime prevalence of physical or sexual IPV in women ranges from 15 to 75 percent. IPV was a factor in approximately 20 percent of United States homicides, with three-quarters of the victims being female. (See <a href=\"#H86601666\" class=\"local\">'Epidemiology'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>IPV often begins or escalates during pregnancy and pregnancy can result from reproductive coercion when IPV is already occurring. Other risk factors include being a young female, alcohol or drug use, being less educated, and family history or prior exposure to violence. (See <a href=\"#H86601702\" class=\"local\">'Risk factors'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>IPV is associated with an increased incidence of medical problems and pregnancy complications. IPV victims have significantly increased psychological illness, including major depression and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Additionally, IPV is associated with a variety of negative health behaviors including high-risk sexual behavior, substance abuse, eating disorders, and nonadherence to health recommendations.
