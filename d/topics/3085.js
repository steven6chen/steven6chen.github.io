A discussion of the emergent evaluation and algorithmic approach to children and adolescents with syncope is presented separately (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F53383\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef53383 \">algorithm 1</a>). The evaluation of adults with syncope is also discussed elsewhere.

Up to 15 percent of children experience a syncopal episode prior to the end of adolescence [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-of-syncope-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/2,3\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,3</a>].</p><p>Although the etiology of syncopal events in children is most often benign, syncope can also occur as the result of more serious (usually cardiac) disease with the potential for sudden death. The vast majority of cases of syncope in the pediatric age group represent benign alterations in vasomotor tone [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-of-syncope-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/4,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,5</a>]. Life-threatening causes of syncope generally have a cardiac etiology (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F60014\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef60014 \">table 1</a>).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">LIFE-THREATENING CONDITIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Life-threatening cardiac conditions cause syncope as the result of an abrupt decrease in cardiac output, either from an arrhythmia or related to structural heart disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-of-syncope-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. Arrhythmias are typically tachyarrhythmias. In children, syncope caused by isolated bradycardia (ie, complete AV block) is uncommon [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-of-syncope-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=bradycardia-in-children#H6\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Bradycardia in children&quot;, section on 'Clinical presentation'</a>.)</p><p>Primary electrical disturbances can occur in patients with structurally normal hearts. These arrhythmias may be related to exogenous factors (ie, a metabolic disturbance or drug ingestion) or an inherited electrophysiologic abnormality (ie, congenital long QT syndrome). Arrhythmias may also develop as the result of structural heart disease, such as myocarditis or repaired congenital heart disease. Finally, syncope can occur in conditions such as aortic stenosis and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) as the result of left ventricular outflow tract obstruction and compromised systemic blood flow, particularly during exercise.</p><p>Although rare, cardiac causes of syncope can be life-threatening. A review of the literature describing ventricular arrhythmias in children noted the following mortality risks for comparison [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-of-syncope-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Unselected population 1 to 18 years of age: 0.00001 cases per patient year</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Long QT syndrome: 0.001 cases per patient year</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>High-risk tetralogy of Fallot and congenital heart disease patients: 0.03 cases per patient year</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><span class=\"nowrap\">Infant/pediatric</span> dilated cardiomyopathy: 0.14 to 0.3 cases per patient year</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Myocardial infarction survivors, depressed ventricular function: 0.2 cases per patient year</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Primary electrical disturbances</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients without structural heart disease who develop syncope as the result of ventricular arrhythmias may have inherited primary electrical disturbances.

Patients with eating disorders may have prolongation of the QT interval, as well as other ECG abnormalities. These changes typically normalize during nutritional rehabilitation. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acquired-long-qt-syndrome-definitions-causes-and-pathophysiology#H13\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Acquired long QT syndrome: Definitions, causes, and pathophysiology&quot;, section on 'Other causes of TdP'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Two clinical phenotypes of congenital LQTS have been described. The more common autosomal dominant form, the Romano-Ward syndrome, has a purely cardiac phenotype. The autosomal recessive form, the Jervell and Lange-Nielsen syndrome, is associated with LQTS and sensorineural deafness and a more malignant clinical course (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=congenital-long-qt-syndrome-epidemiology-and-clinical-manifestations\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Congenital long QT syndrome: Epidemiology and clinical manifestations&quot;</a>). Causes of acquired LQTS (ie, drugs, hypokalemia, and hypomagnesemia) can also precipitate ventricular arrhythmia in patients with congenital LQTS.</p><p/><p>Prolongation of the QT interval is an essential component of the diagnosis of LQTS. However, the QTc varies in response to a number of factors, such as autonomic state, electrolyte imbalance, drugs, and diurnal changes. Thus, a normal QTc measurement on a single ECG does not exclude the possibility of long QT syndrome. The hand calculated QTc interval, in combination with clinical and historical features, can be used to establish the diagnosis of congenital LQTS in some cases. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=congenital-long-qt-syndrome-diagnosis#H3\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Congenital long QT syndrome: Diagnosis&quot;, section on 'General ECG principles'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=congenital-long-qt-syndrome-diagnosis#H3346885055\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Congenital long QT syndrome: Diagnosis&quot;, section on 'Diagnosis'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h3\">Brugada syndrome</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients with Brugada syndrome (BS) have a characteristic pattern on electrocardiogram (ECG) and an increased risk of sudden death. Sudden cardiac death may be the first and only clinical event in BS, occurring in as many as one-third of patients. Arrhythmic events generally occur between ages 22 and 65, although cases in children as young as three years of age have been reported [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-of-syncope-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/9-11\" class=\"abstract_t\">9-11</a>]. Arrhythmic events in children with BS are uncommon, but may be more likely during febrile episodes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-of-syncope-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/11,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,12</a>].</p><p>Typical ECG findings include pseudo-right bundle branch block and persistent ST segment elevation in leads V1 to V3 (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F64510\" class=\"graphic graphic_waveform graphicRef64510 \">waveform 2</a>). ECG changes may be transient in some patients.</p><p>A number of antiarrhythmic, antianginal, and psychotropic drugs can induce a Brugada-like ECG pattern (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F73611\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef73611 \">table 3</a>). The Brugada syndrome is discussed in detail elsewhere.

Familial and sporadic cases occur and several genetic patterns have been described. Arrhythmias typically cannot be induced at electrophysiologic study but can be provoked by exercise testing or IV catecholamine infusion. A detailed discussion of catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia can be found separately.

Three genetic mutations have been described. The corrected QT interval (QTc) in this syndrome is &le;0.30 seconds. Congenital short QT syndrome is considerably less common than long QT syndrome.

Children with congenital heart disease, including those who have undergone surgical palliation or correction, are also at risk for malignant arrhythmias. In particular, repaired defects such as tetralogy of Fallot, aortic stenosis, and transposition of great arteries have been associated with sudden cardiac death [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-of-syncope-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/8,16-19\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,16-19</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h3\">Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) is a relatively common autosomal dominant disorder (incidence of 1 in 500 in the general population) that is characterized by asymmetric hypertrophy of the left ventricle.

Other causes include viral myocarditis, severe anemia, and in patients with muscular dystrophy. Patients with cardiomyopathy who develop syncope as the result of ventricular arrhythmias also typically have severe heart failure.

This form of syncope usually occurs immediately after completing a race or workout and is commonly observed at distance running events. The mechanism for collapse is an abrupt decrease in venous return once that athlete completes the event. Given the typical degree of vasodilatation seen with prolonged exertion, the sudden loss of the pressure exerted by the skeletal muscles on the vasculature leads to a precipitous decline in venous return, as well as postural tone, causing the athlete to collapse.

The spells may be cyanotic or pallid. The cyanotic variety begins with breath holding, followed by cyanosis and loss of consciousness. In a pallid spell, loss of consciousness occurs before breath holding. Brief posturing or tonic-clonic motor activity may occur with either cyanotic or pallid spells. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nonepileptic-paroxysmal-disorders-in-infancy#H8\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Nonepileptic paroxysmal disorders in infancy&quot;, section on 'Breath-holding spells'</a>.)</p><p>The clinical course for children with breath holding spells is generally benign.

Accessory pathway mediated tachycardia and atrioventricular nodal reentry tachycardia are relatively common arrhythmias, but rarely present with syncope. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-supraventricular-tachycardia-in-children#H14\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical features and diagnosis of supraventricular tachycardia in children&quot;, section on 'Syncope and atrial fibrillation'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span><strong>Bradycardia</strong> &ndash; In children, syncope caused by isolated bradycardia is unusual [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-of-syncope-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. Causes of symptomatic bradycardia in children are corrective surgery for congenital heart disease, hypervagotonia, hypothyroidism, and medications (such as beta adrenergic blockers). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=bradycardia-in-children\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Bradycardia in children&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Postural tachycardia syndrome (POTS)</strong> &ndash; POTS is defined as a form of orthostatic intolerance characterized by an excessive increase in heart rate (&gt;40 bpm over baseline in children and adolescents and &gt;30 bpm or to &gt;120 bpm in adults) that occurs on standing without arterial hypotension. POTS is a common disorder among teenage girls that typically manifests as palpitations, anxiety, dizziness, and tremulousness. However, syncope may occur in up to 40 percent of patients. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=postural-tachycardia-syndrome\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Postural tachycardia syndrome&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H23\"><span class=\"h1\">CONDITIONS THAT MIMIC SYNCOPE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Conditions that may mimic syncope include the following:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Seizures</strong> &ndash; A seizure typically includes loss of consciousness and postural tone. However, seizures usually last longer than syncopal episodes and include features such as an aura, prolonged tonic clonic activity, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> the presence of a postictal phase.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Migraine syndromes</strong> &ndash; Migraine syndromes, particularly basilar migraines, may present with symptoms that are similar to syncope such as loss of conscious, ataxia, or vertigo. Loss of consciousness is usually longer than several seconds. In addition, patients generally have other neurologic symptoms, as well as headache and nausea. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=migraine-with-brainstem-aura-basilar-type-migraine#H3\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Migraine with brainstem aura (basilar-type migraine)&quot;, section on 'Clinical manifestations'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong><span class=\"nowrap\">Hysteria/conversion</span> disorder</strong> &ndash; <span class=\"nowrap\">Hysteria/conversion</span> disorder is most common in adolescent patients. These events typically occur in the presence of an audience, lack hemodynamic (heart rate, blood pressure) or autonomic (sweating, pallor) changes, may be prolonged, and rarely result in injury. Patients typically describe the event in a calm indifferent manner. They may disclose details of the event that indicate no loss of consciousness.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Hyperventilation</strong> &ndash; Hyperventilation is usually associated with emotional stress. It occurs more commonly in adolescent patients. The patient may complain of chest pain, chest tightness, and shortness of breath. In addition, symptoms may include lightheadedness, paresthesias, and visual disturbances.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Intentional strangulation activities (eg, the &ldquo;choking game&rdquo;)</strong> &ndash; The choking game is defined as self-strangulation or strangulation by another person with the hands or a ligature to produce a euphoric state caused by cerebral hypoxia. The plan is to release the pressure just before loss of consciousness, but failure to do so can result in death, particularly when the game is played alone using ligatures. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=the-choking-game-and-other-strangulation-activities-in-children-and-adolescents\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;The &quot;choking game&quot; and other strangulation activities in children and adolescents&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Narcolepsy</strong> &ndash; Patients with narcolepsy may have cataplexy, emotionally-triggered muscle weakness with collapse that may mimic syncope. However, they also have other features that indicate a disorder of sleep-wake control such as chronic daytime sleepiness, hypnagogic hallucinations (vivid, often frightening visual, tactile, or auditory hallucinations occurring as the patient falls asleep), or sleep paralysis (inability to move for one or two minutes immediately after awakening.
