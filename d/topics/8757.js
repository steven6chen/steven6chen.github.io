An ICD can sense and treat certain abnormal heartbeats.</p><p>A person's heart needs to beat normally in order to pump blood to the brain and rest of the body. But sometimes, a person's heartbeat can suddenly become abnormal. The heartbeat could be too slow, too fast, or out of rhythm.</p><p>Some abnormal heartbeats are dangerous, because they can prevent the heart from pumping blood to the brain and rest of the body. A &quot;cardiac arrest&quot; is when an abnormal heartbeat prevents the heart from pumping blood normally. A cardiac arrest can happen without warning, and can cause death if it is not treated right away.</p><p>An ICD can treat the abnormal heartbeats that can lead to a cardiac arrest. People who have an ICD have a greater chance of surviving a cardiac arrest.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H555736315\"><span class=\"h1\">Who might need an ICD?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>You might need an ICD if you:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Have a condition that can cause abnormal heartbeats</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Have had one or more episodes of abnormal heartbeats</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H555736322\"><span class=\"h1\">How does an ICD work?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>An ICD works to:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Sense abnormal heartbeats</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Give the heart one or more electrical shocks if the heartbeat becomes abnormal. This can get the heart to beat normally again.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Record abnormal heartbeats so that a doctor can see how a person's heart has been beating</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H555736329\"><span class=\"h1\">What does an ICD look like?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>An ICD has 2 parts:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Battery (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F104622\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef104622 \">picture 1</a>) &ndash; This sits under the skin. Depending on the type of ICD, it goes either in the upper chest or on the side, near the armpit. When the ICD senses an abnormal heartbeat, the battery creates an electrical shock or shocks that travel through wires to the heart.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Wires, also called &quot;leads&quot; &ndash; In many ICDs, these go from the battery through a vein (blood vessel) and into the heart. There is also a newer type of ICD, which has wires that go near the heart but not actually inside it.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H555736336\"><span class=\"h1\">Can there be side effects to having an ICD?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Yes. Your doctor will talk with you about the different side effects that can occur. Side effects can occur when a doctor puts in an ICD. People who have had an ICD for a long time can also have side effects. But most people do not have any side effects from having an ICD.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H555736343\"><span class=\"h1\">What should I do after my ICD treats an abnormal heartbeat?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>If your ICD gives you a shock (you will probably feel it), let your doctor know. He or she will look at the record of your heartbeats and might decide to make changes to the way your ICD works.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H555736350\"><span class=\"h1\">Do people with an ICD need other treatment?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Sometimes, people with an ICD will need other treatment. This can include medicines or procedures.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H555736357\"><span class=\"h1\">What if I want to get pregnant?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>If you want to get pregnant, talk with your doctor or nurse. Many women with an ICD are able to have a baby.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H555736364\"><span class=\"h1\">What will my life be like?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Most people with an ICD have a normal life. But you will need to:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Check your ICD on a regular basis to make sure that it works &ndash; Many people can check their ICD from their home, using either their phone or computer.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Talk to your doctor about driving &ndash; Many states do not allow people to drive for some amount of time after they have an ICD put in or after they get a shock from their ICD. Your doctor will tell you how long you need to wait before you drive again.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Avoid certain electric or magnetic sources &ndash; People who have an ICD need to avoid certain electric or magnetic sources or equipment. Your doctor will tell you which ones are safe for you to be near, and which ones you should avoid. For example, some people with an ICD should not walk through a metal detector at the airport. (People who cannot walk through a metal detector can have a security search by hand instead.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Let all of your doctors and nurses know that you have an ICD &ndash; Some procedures and tests are safe for people with an ICD, but others are not. For example, most people with an ICD should not have a type of imaging test called an MRI scan. Most doctors recommend that people wear a medical bracelet letting others know that they have an ICD.</p><p/><p>Some people who have an ICD feel worried or sad. If you feel worried or sad, let your doctor or nurse know so that he or she can help.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H555736060\"><span class=\"h1\">More on this topic</span></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=pacemakers-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Pacemakers (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=catheter-ablation-for-the-heart-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Catheter ablation for the heart (The Basics)</a></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=implantable-cardioverter-defibrillators-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Implantable cardioverter-defibrillators (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=pacemakers-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Pacemakers (Beyond the Basics)</a></p></div><div id=\"reviewProcess\"><span>All topics are updated as new evidence becomes available and our <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/home/editorial-policy\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"policy policy_editorialpolicy\">peer review process</a> is complete.</span></div><div id=\"topicRetrievedDate\"><span class=\"emphasis\">This topic retrieved from UpToDate on: </span>Apr 02, 2018.</div><div id=\"disclaimer\">The content on the UpToDate website is not intended nor recommended as a substitute for medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.
