These problems include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Preterm labor &ndash; This is labor that starts before 37 weeks of pregnancy (3 or more weeks before the woman's due date). Pregnancy normally lasts about 40 weeks, counting from the first day of the woman's last period. Going into labor before 37 weeks of pregnancy can be dangerous, because babies who are born premature (also called &quot;preterm&quot;) can have serious health problems.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Problems with the placenta (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F82935\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef82935 \">figure 1</a>) &ndash; These can include &quot;placenta previa&quot; and &quot;placental abruption.&quot; Placenta previa happens when the placenta covers the opening of the cervix. Placental abruption happens when the placenta separates from the mother's uterus before the baby is born. Both of these problems can cause bleeding from the vagina and be dangerous for the mother and baby.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Miscarriage &ndash; A miscarriage is when a pregnancy ends before a woman has been pregnant for 20 weeks.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Stillbirth &ndash; A stillbirth is when a baby dies before it is born, in the second half of pregnancy (after 20 weeks).</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H118310035\"><span class=\"h1\">How can smoking during pregnancy affect my baby?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Babies whose mothers smoke during pregnancy are more likely than babies whose mothers do not smoke to:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Be premature or be born too small &ndash; Babies who are premature or small are more likely to have problems with feeding, sleeping, breathing, seeing, and hearing.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Die suddenly for no known reason before the age of 1 year (this is called &quot;sudden infant death syndrome&quot; or &quot;SIDS&quot;)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H208721641\"><span class=\"h1\">What treatments can help me stop smoking during pregnancy?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Your doctor or nurse can give you advice on the best way to quit. He or she can also put you in touch with counselors or other people you can call for support. The letters in the word &quot;START&quot; can help you remember the steps to take:</p><p>S = Set a quit date.</p><p>T = Tell family, friends, and the people around you that you plan to quit.</p><p>A = Anticipate or plan ahead for the tough times you'll face while quitting.</p><p>R = Remove cigarettes and other tobacco products from your home, car, and work.</p><p>T = Talk to your doctor about getting help to quit.</p><p>The earlier you can quit smoking in your pregnancy, the better. But stopping at any point can still help. If you cannot quit, smoking fewer cigarettes can help, too.</p><p>It's also very important not to start smoking again after your baby is born. Babies who are around smoke from cigarettes (called &quot;second-hand smoke&quot;) have a higher-than-normal risk of health problems, such as colds and ear infections. Quitting for good also lowers your chances of heart disease and cancer. And it sets a good example for your child not to smoke.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H118310050\"><span class=\"h1\">Can I take medicines to help me quit smoking while I am pregnant?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Yes. If you have tried other ways to quit smoking but still can't stop, you can try medicines. Ask your doctor which would be safest for you and your baby. Medicines to help you quit include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Nicotine replacement therapy &ndash; This includes skin patches, lozenges, and gum that have nicotine. Prescription forms include nasal sprays and &quot;puffers&quot; (also called &quot;inhalers&quot;).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><a href=\"topic.htm?path=bupropion-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">Bupropion</a> (sample brand names: Zyban, Wellbutrin) &ndash; This prescription medicine reduces your desire to smoke. It is also available in a generic version, which is cheaper than the brand name ones.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H118310067\"><span class=\"h1\">More on this topic</span></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=how-to-plan-and-prepare-for-a-healthy-pregnancy-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: How to plan and prepare for a healthy pregnancy (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=preterm-labor-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Preterm labor (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=quitting-smoking-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Quitting smoking (The Basics)</a></p></div><div id=\"reviewProcess\"><span>All topics are updated as new evidence becomes available and our <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/home/editorial-policy\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"policy policy_editorialpolicy\">peer review process</a> is complete.</span></div><div id=\"topicRetrievedDate\"><span class=\"emphasis\">This topic retrieved from UpToDate on: </span>Apr 03, 2018.</div><div id=\"disclaimer\">The content on the UpToDate website is not intended nor recommended as a substitute for medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.
