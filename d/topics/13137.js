According to the current WHO classification, B cell CLL is considered to be identical (ie, one disease with different manifestations) to the mature (peripheral) B cell neoplasm small lymphocytic lymphoma (SLL) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-and-genetic-features-of-chronic-lymphocytic-leukemia/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. It is characterized by a progressive accumulation of functionally incompetent lymphocytes, which are usually monoclonal in origin.</p><p>The pathophysiology and molecular biology of B cell <span class=\"nowrap\">CLL/SLL</span> will be reviewed here. The incidence, epidemiology, clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and treatment of <span class=\"nowrap\">CLL/SLL</span> and its variants (T cell CLL, prolymphocytic leukemia), and the role of hematopoietic cell transplantation are discussed separately.

While some steps in this pathway have been elucidated, many remain unknown. It is believed that virtually all CLL cases are preceded by a premalignant B cell proliferative disorder known as monoclonal B cell lymphocytosis (MBL). MBL with a CLL-phenotype is present in 5 to 15 percent of the population above the age of 60 and progresses to <span class=\"nowrap\">CLL/SLL</span> or a related malignancy at a rate of approximately 1 percent per year [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-and-genetic-features-of-chronic-lymphocytic-leukemia/abstract/2,3\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,3</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=approach-to-the-adult-with-lymphocytosis-or-lymphocytopenia#H1359939611\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Approach to the adult with lymphocytosis or lymphocytopenia&quot;, section on 'Monoclonal B lymphocytosis'</a>.)</p><p>The pathogenesis of CLL can be conceptualized as two sequential processes:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Establishment of MBL &ndash; While the inciting event is unknown, MBL appears to develop as the result of multiple factors, such as response to antigenic stimulation, microenvironmental support, gene mutations, epigenetic modification, and cytogenetic abnormalities. The result is a clone of B cells with a CLL phenotype.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Progression from MBL to CLL &ndash; Further insults to the B cell clone, either through additional genetic abnormalities or changes in the bone marrow microenvironment, result in the progression of MBL to CLL [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-and-genetic-features-of-chronic-lymphocytic-leukemia/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. This progression occurs in a very minor portion of persons with MBL.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Over time and, in particular, under the selective pressure of (chemo)therapy, clonal evolution and selection leads to the accumulation of more and more harmful abnormalities leading to disease aggressiveness and treatment resistance. </p><p/><p>The CLL tumor cells express B cell antigen receptors (BCRs) with a restricted repertoire of mutations that result in stimulation-dependent and antigen-independent cell-autonomous signaling thought to promote survival [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-and-genetic-features-of-chronic-lymphocytic-leukemia/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. Once the clonal B cell population is created and progresses to CLL, a large subset of patients is asymptomatic. Ultimately, some patients develop signs and symptoms (eg, lymphadenopathy, hepatosplenomegaly, cytopenias, infections) related to the accumulation of functionally incompetent lymphocytes and suppression of normal organ function.</p><p>Complex studies using next-generation sequencing suggest that an individual CLL tumor is genetically heterogeneous, with several subpopulations of malignant cells evolving over time [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-and-genetic-features-of-chronic-lymphocytic-leukemia/abstract/6-10\" class=\"abstract_t\">6-10</a>]. The relative contribution of each subpopulation to the total tumor volume is likely affected by interactions with other subpopulations, the tumor microenvironment, and therapy.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">IMMUNOBIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Initially, it was thought that the majority of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) cells were in the G(0) phase of the cell cycle, with less than 1 percent spontaneous mitoses in vitro, suggesting that CLL was a disease of accumulation of long-lived lymphocytes. Indeed, malignant cells accumulate in CLL at least partly due to their inability to undergo apoptosis. Mechanisms of apoptosis resistance in CLL include overexpression of B cell <span class=\"nowrap\">leukemia/lymphoma</span> 2 (BCL2) and Fas-inhibitory molecules such as TOSO [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-and-genetic-features-of-chronic-lymphocytic-leukemia/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. However, in vivo kinetic studies have uncovered a wide range of cellular proliferation and death rates among individual patients. Those patients with cellular birth rates &gt;0.35 <span class=\"nowrap\">percent/day</span> were much more likely to exhibit active disease or develop progressive disease than those with lower cellular birth rates [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-and-genetic-features-of-chronic-lymphocytic-leukemia/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>].</p><p>Morphologically, CLL cells resemble the mature small lymphocytes seen in the peripheral blood of normal individuals. However, CLL lymphocytes are clonal B cells arrested in the B cell differentiation pathway at some intermediate stage between the pre-B cell and mature B cell, perhaps in the &quot;activated, antigen-experienced&quot; B cell subset [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-and-genetic-features-of-chronic-lymphocytic-leukemia/abstract/13-15\" class=\"abstract_t\">13-15</a>].</p><p>While the specific cellular origin of CLL remains to be fully defined, it likely differs between cases with unmutated immunoglobulin variable region (IgV) genes and those with mutated IgV genes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-and-genetic-features-of-chronic-lymphocytic-leukemia/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. When the gene expression profile of CLL cells is compared with that of major human mature B cell subsets, the genes expressed by unmutated CLL most closely resemble those of unmutated mature CD5+ B cells while those expressed by mutated CLL are similar to those of CD5+CD27+ post-germinal center B cells.

As an example, some cases of CLL are CD11c positive [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-and-genetic-features-of-chronic-lymphocytic-leukemia/abstract/27,28\" class=\"abstract_t\">27,28</a>], suggesting an immunophenotypic overlap between CLL and hairy cell leukemia.

CD5+ B cells (with many or all of the characteristics of B-CLL cells listed above, including monoclonality) can be found in the lymph nodes and spleen of the normal human fetus, and at the edge of germinal centers of lymph nodes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-and-genetic-features-of-chronic-lymphocytic-leukemia/abstract/29-31\" class=\"abstract_t\">29-31</a>], as well as in the peripheral blood of normal adults [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-and-genetic-features-of-chronic-lymphocytic-leukemia/abstract/32,33\" class=\"abstract_t\">32,33</a>]. The most frequent B-CLL phenotype corresponds to one or more cellular subsets within the mantle zone of lymph nodes. In addition, approximately 15 percent of normal B cells in the peripheral blood express CD5 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-and-genetic-features-of-chronic-lymphocytic-leukemia/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>].</p><p>CD5 positive B cells are increased in patients with autoimmune disorders, such as rheumatoid arthritis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-and-genetic-features-of-chronic-lymphocytic-leukemia/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>]. This observation is relevant to CLL since the pathophysiologic explanation for the increased frequency of Coombs positivity and other autoimmune phenomena in CLL has remained unresolved. In approximately 25 percent of CLL cases bearing kappa light chains on the lymphocyte surface, the leukemic cells react against an anti-idiotype antibody to a highly conserved region of one specific kappa gene (crossreactive idiotype) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-and-genetic-features-of-chronic-lymphocytic-leukemia/abstract/36-38\" class=\"abstract_t\">36-38</a>]. Analysis of kappa gene rearrangement showed considerable sequence homology in the rearranged regions.</p><p>These observations suggest that specific subsets of CD5+ B cells may be the normal counterparts of B-CLL [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-and-genetic-features-of-chronic-lymphocytic-leukemia/abstract/36-38\" class=\"abstract_t\">36-38</a>]. These normal counterparts likely differ between CLL cases with unmutated immunoglobulin variable region (IgV) genes (eg, normal counterpart unmutated mature CD5+ B cells) and those with mutated IgV genes (eg, normal counterpart CD5+CD27+ post-germinal center B cells) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-and-genetic-features-of-chronic-lymphocytic-leukemia/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. Evaluation of a naturally occurring CD5+ B cell subset that resembled autoantibody-producing B-CLL cells [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-and-genetic-features-of-chronic-lymphocytic-leukemia/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>] showed a restricted expression of IgV genes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-and-genetic-features-of-chronic-lymphocytic-leukemia/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>], raising the possibility that B-CLL may arise from a normal B cell subset engaged in autoantibody production [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-and-genetic-features-of-chronic-lymphocytic-leukemia/abstract/39,40\" class=\"abstract_t\">39,40</a>]. A minor subpopulation of normal human CD5+ cells is considered to be a long-lived population circulating between blood and lymph nodes, mostly located in the inner layer of mantle zones; these cells may be the normal counterpart of the neoplastic B-CLL cells [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-and-genetic-features-of-chronic-lymphocytic-leukemia/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H162054436\"><span class=\"h2\">BCR stereotypy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>CLL cells express B cell antigen receptors (BCRs) with a limited immunoglobulin repertoire characterized by restricted heavy and light chain usage. Large-scale studies that have sequenced these immunoglobulins in unrelated patients with CLL identified near identical immunoglobulin sequences (referred to as BCR stereotypy) in the heavy variable complementarity determining region 3 (VH CDR3) in greater than 20 percent of cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-and-genetic-features-of-chronic-lymphocytic-leukemia/abstract/42-51\" class=\"abstract_t\">42-51</a>]. The similarity of these BCRs is significantly greater than that which would be expected based on chance alone. BCR stereotypy is more common in clinically aggressive CLL with unmutated immunoglobulin heavy-chain genes. </p><p>BCR stereotypy in CLL cases suggests a role for antigens in the pathogenesis and evolution of CLL. BCR stereotypes can also be used to group CLL cases into subsets with presumably different biological backgrounds, prognosis, and response to treatment. Further study is needed to clarify how knowledge about BCR stereotype subclass may impact treatment decisions. &#160;</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H25649455\"><span class=\"h2\">Antigen-independent B cell receptor signaling</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The CLL tumor cells express BCRs with a restricted repertoire of mutations that, in one experimental setting, result in antigen-independent cell-autonomous signaling thought to promote survival [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-and-genetic-features-of-chronic-lymphocytic-leukemia/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. BCR signaling directs many cellular processes including growth, differentiation, survival, and adhesion or cellular migration. The exact details depend upon numerous variables including the cellular maturation, the antigen ligated, and the microenvironment. In CLL cells, constitutive activation of the BCR results in increased expression of SYK, LYN, Bruton's tyrosine kinase (BTK), and PI3K kinase [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-and-genetic-features-of-chronic-lymphocytic-leukemia/abstract/52\" class=\"abstract_t\">52</a>]. This increased signaling activates the cytoplasmic domain of an integrin, thereby causing a conformational change that increases its affinity for ligand binding (inside-out integrin signaling). Along with many other actions, ligand binding to the integrin's extracellular domain results in intracellular signals that promote growth, survival, differentiation, and migration. Drugs targeting the BCR signaling pathway (eg, BTK inhibitors, PI3K inhibitors) enable apoptosis, inhibit proliferation, and change traffic patterns of the leukemic cells between the blood, lymph nodes, bone marrow, and spleen. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">T cells and natural killer cells in CLL</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Because B cells account for almost 90 percent of all lymphocytes in B-CLL, the percentages of T cells and natural killer (NK) cells are invariably decreased. While the absolute T cell count is often high, it may be normal or low. NK cells are usually decreased in number as well as function in CLL.</p><p>Patients with B-CLL also may have an unusual T cell subpopulation expressing lower CD4 or CD8 levels than classic T cells, which may derive from nonclassic pathways of T cell development [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-and-genetic-features-of-chronic-lymphocytic-leukemia/abstract/53-56\" class=\"abstract_t\">53-56</a>] or through direct interaction with the malignant B cell population [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-and-genetic-features-of-chronic-lymphocytic-leukemia/abstract/57\" class=\"abstract_t\">57</a>].

Among the autoimmune phenomena are Coombs positive autoimmune hemolytic anemia (AIHA), immune thrombocytopenia (ITP), and pure red cell aplasia (PRCA) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-and-genetic-features-of-chronic-lymphocytic-leukemia/abstract/59,60\" class=\"abstract_t\">59,60</a>].

(See <a href=\"#H4346378\" class=\"local\">'Overview of pathogenesis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Morphologically, CLL cells resemble the mature small lymphocytes seen in the peripheral blood of normal individuals. However, CLL lymphocytes are clonal B cells arrested in the B cell differentiation pathway at some intermediate stage between the pre-B cell and mature B cell, perhaps in the &quot;activated, antigen-experienced&quot; B cell subset. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Immunobiology'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The pretreatment assessment of patients with CLL should include evaluation of the peripheral blood with fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) for del(17p), del(11q), trisomy 12, and del(13q). The impact of genetic abnormalities on prognosis is presented in more detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=staging-and-prognosis-of-chronic-lymphocytic-leukemia#H10\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Staging and prognosis of chronic lymphocytic leukemia&quot;, section on 'Genetic abnormalities'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>TP53 is a tumor-suppressor gene located on the short arm of chromosome 17. Patients with del(17p) or TP53 mutations are at high risk of either not responding to or relapsing soon after achieving remission with standard treatment. Therefore, the management of patients with these abnormalities differs from other patients with CLL and usually incorporates novel agents (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ibrutinib-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ibrutinib</a>). (See <a href=\"#H577199429\" class=\"local\">'del(17p) or TP53 mutations'</a> above.) &#160;</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Chromosome 11q contains the ataxia telangiectasia mutated (ATM) gene. Historically, patients with del(11q) have been at high risk of either not responding to initial treatment or relapsing soon after achieving remission. The prognosis of patients with del(11q) has improved following treatment with the combination of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fludarabine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">fludarabine</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cyclophosphamide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cyclophosphamide</a>, and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=rituximab-intravenous-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">rituximab</a>. (See <a href=\"#H11\" class=\"local\">'del(11q)'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>When present as the sole abnormalities, monoallelic or biallelic 13q abnormalities appear to be associated with a favorable outcome. (See <a href=\"#H162054841\" class=\"local\">'del(13q14)'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Favorable outcomes are also seen in cases with trisomy 12 as the sole abnormality or with normal genetics. (See <a href=\"#H162055071\" class=\"local\">'Trisomy 12'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>While other gene mutations have been found to affect tumor suppression genes, oncogenes, DNA damage repair, RNA splicing, and cellular signaling pathways, the prognostic significance of such mutations is not well characterized. (See <a href=\"#H12\" class=\"local\">'Molecular genetics'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are a novel class of small, noncoding RNAs that modulate the expression of genes at the post-transcriptional level, and are involved in cancer, apoptosis, and cell metabolism. They appear to interact with BCL2 and TP53 in CLL and may be important in the pathogenesis of this disorder. (See <a href=\"#H15\" class=\"local\">'MicroRNA'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1603885\"><span class=\"h1\">ACKNOWLEDGMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>UpToDate would like to acknowledge Michael J Keating, MD, who contributed to earlier versions of this topic review.</p></div><div id=\"topicAgreement\">Use of UpToDate is subject to the <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/legal/license\" class=\"licenseLink\" id=\"sla_in_page\">Subscription and License Agreement</a>.</div><div id=\"references\" class=\"headingAnchor\"><h1>REFERENCES</h1><ol id=\"reference\"><li class=\"breakAll\">Swerdlow SH, Campo E, Harris NL, et al.
