In a large, cross-sectional survey conducted in the United States, the self-reported prevalence of symptomatic hemorrhoids was 4.4 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hemorrhoids-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. The prevalence was equal in both sexes, peaked between the ages of 45 and 65, and declined thereafter. Development of symptoms prior to 20 years was unusual.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h1\">PATHOGENESIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Hemorrhoidal veins are normal anatomic structures located in the submucosal layer in the lower rectum and may be external or internal based upon whether they are below or above the dentate line. Both types of hemorrhoids often coexist. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Terminology'</a> above.)</p><p>Hemorrhoids arise from a plexus or cushion of dilated arteriovenous channels and connective tissue. Internal hemorrhoids arise from the superior hemorrhoidal cushion. Their three primary locations (left lateral, right anterior, and right posterior) correspond to the end branches of the middle and superior hemorrhoidal veins. The overlying columnar epithelium is viscerally innervated; therefore, these hemorrhoids are not sensitive to pain, touch, or temperature. </p><p>External hemorrhoids arise from the inferior hemorrhoidal plexus. They are covered by modified squamous epithelium (anoderm), which contains numerous somatic pain receptors, making external hemorrhoids extremely painful on thrombosis. Internal and external hemorrhoids communicate with one another and drain into the internal pudendal veins, and ultimately the inferior vena cava. </p><p>The development of symptomatic hemorrhoids has been associated with advancing age, diarrhea, pregnancy, pelvic tumors, prolonged sitting, straining, chronic constipation, and patients on anticoagulation and antiplatelet therapy, although it is unclear if the association is causal [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hemorrhoids-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p>The pathogenesis of symptomatic internal hemorrhoids is not well understood, but may be due to the following factors: </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Deterioration of the connective tissue that anchors hemorrhoids [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hemorrhoids-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. It is hypothesized that with advancing age or aggravating conditions the weakly anchored hemorrhoids then gradually begin to bulge, and &quot;slide&quot; into the anal canal leading to progressive symptoms.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Hypertrophy or increased tone of the internal anal sphincter [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hemorrhoids-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/4,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,5</a>]. During defecation, the fecal bolus forces the hemorrhoidal plexus against the internal sphincter, which causes them to enlarge and become symptomatic.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Abnormal distension of the arteriovenous anastomoses within the hemorrhoidal cushions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hemorrhoids-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. In support of this hypothesis is the observation that hemorrhoids regress following ligation of the hemorrhoidal arteries [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hemorrhoids-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Abnormal dilatation of the veins of the internal hemorrhoidal venous plexus.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL MANIFESTATIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Approximately 40 percent of individuals with hemorrhoids are asymptomatic [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hemorrhoids-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. Symptomatic patients usually seek treatment for hematochezia, pain associated with a thrombosed hemorrhoid, perianal pruritus, or fecal soilage.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Hemorrhoidal bleeding is almost always painless and is usually associated with a bowel movement, although can be spontaneous. The blood is typically bright red and coats the stool at the end of defecation or may drip into the toilet. Occasionally, bleeding can be copious and can be exacerbated by straining. In rare cases, chronic blood loss can cause iron deficiency anemia with associated symptoms of weakness, headache, irritability, and varying degrees of fatigue and exercise intolerance [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hemorrhoids-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].

Thrombosis is more common with external hemorrhoids as compared with internal hemorrhoids. Thromboses of external hemorrhoids may be associated with excruciating pain as the overlying perianal skin is highly innervated and becomes distended and inflamed (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F72916\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef72916 \">picture 2</a>). Thrombosed internal hemorrhoids can also cause pain, but to a lesser degree than external hemorrhoids. An exception is when internal hemorrhoids become prolapsed, strangulated, and develop gangrenous changes due to the associated lack of blood supply. </p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H94222678\"><span class=\"h1\">DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Symptomatic hemorrhoids should be suspected in patients with bright red blood per rectum, anal pruritus, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> acute onset of perianal pain.

Painful defecation is not associated with hemorrhoids, unless it is thrombosed, and is suggestive of an anorectal fissure, proctitis, perirectal fistula, abscess, solitary rectal ulcer syndrome, rectal cancer, or anal polyp. Acute onset of perianal pain with perianal swelling suggests the presence of a thrombosed hemorrhoid. (See <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Clinical manifestations'</a> above.)</p><p>Systemic symptoms such as night sweats, fever, weight loss, and abdominal pain are not associated with hemorrhoids and are suggestive of an underlying malignancy, chronic infection or inflammation. The presence of chronic diarrhea with hematochezia and tenesmus is suggestive of colitis. A change in the frequency, caliber, or consistency of stools is suggestive of a colorectal malignancy. </p><p>Past medical history should include a history of previous gastrointestinal blood loss and the evaluation performed, as well as previously resected colorectal cancer or polyps, inflammatory bowel disease, and pelvic radiation therapy. A detailed family history should be sought including a history of inflammatory bowel disease and a detailed cancer history to stratify colorectal cancer risk. This should include not only a history of confirmed colorectal cancers, but also a history of family members known to have colonic polyps or other malignancies that could be associated with familial colon cancer syndromes.

Internal hemorrhoids are generally not palpable on digital examination in the absence of thrombosis. A thrombosed hemorrhoid is extremely tender to palpation, and a thrombus may be palpable within the hemorrhoid. The presence of thickening or scar in the posterior midline or roughening of the otherwise smooth anoderm is suggestive of a partially healed anal fissure. Hypertrophic, edematous, and tender skin tags should raise suspicion for underlying Crohn disease (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F75104\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef75104 \">picture 8</a>).

Internal hemorrhoidal bundles appear as bulging purplish-blue veins [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hemorrhoids-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. Prolapsed internal hemorrhoids appear as dark pink, glistening, and sometimes tender masses at the anal margin. Thrombosed external hemorrhoids are acutely tender and have a purplish hue. Anoscopy has the advantage of being a quick, relatively painless, inexpensive procedure that can be performed in an unprepped patient to diagnose hemorrhoids and exclude distal anorectal disorders [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hemorrhoids-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>].
