By the year 2020, it is predicted that 50 million people will fall into this age range, one-half of whom will be over age 75 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-evaluation-of-older-drivers/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. More than 79 percent of people aged 70 and older have a driver&rsquo;s license in the United States, and more than 60 percent of people aged 75 and older are licensed drivers in Australia, while the proportion of older drivers is rising and drivers are traveling greater distances in later life [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-evaluation-of-older-drivers/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].</p><p>Older drivers have become front page news not only because of the aging of the population, but also because they are involved in more fatal car crashes per miles driven than any other age group except teenagers. Drivers over the age of 75 years also have more traffic violations and nonfatal collisions than younger drivers. Two of the most common violations, failure to yield the right of way and failure to obey a traffic sign, often lead to accidents at intersections where situations require a quick response, full peripheral vision, and interaction with other drivers.</p><p>These observations have prompted individual states to consider legislation that would tighten license renewal requirements for older drivers. As an example, in 1999 the California state senate debated but did not pass the &quot;Brandi Jo&quot; bill, an amendment requiring drivers ages 75 years and older to take a written, vision, and road test at every renewal period [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-evaluation-of-older-drivers/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. The bill also proposed shortening the renewal periods from the usual every four years to every year after age 90.</p><p>However, while statistics might suggest that severe restrictions should be imposed on older drivers, the task is not that simple. Driving is an important issue for older adults. The majority of Americans rely upon private automobiles for their transportation, and most older adults regard driving as critical to their independence and self-esteem. A cross-sectional telephone survey in the United States, conducted by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in 2001-2003, found that among survey respondents (48 percent of those surveyed), 75 percent of adults aged 75 to 84 years, and 70 percent of adults aged 85 and older were current drivers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-evaluation-of-older-drivers/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. Older adults who are forced to stop driving rely more upon their families, reduce their social activities, and often become depressed.</p><p>Furthermore, despite a moderate decline in mental, motor, optic, and auditory functions with aging, many older people drive safely. Driving performance is usually impaired only after a considerable loss of function since most driving patterns are learned and become second nature. In addition, we often regulate our own driving as we age; seniors drive fewer miles, shorter distances, less at night, and seldom in rush hour. In the CDC survey, 82 percent of older drivers (&ge;age 75) reported that they limited driving for weather conditions, distance, or night [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-evaluation-of-older-drivers/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. Interestingly, however, only 15 percent limited driving for medical reasons, and none for cognitive impairment. There is consensus among traffic safety experts that older drivers should be kept on the road as long as they can drive safely.</p><p>No one wants to use chronological age as the sole indicator of driving ability, but it is difficult to otherwise determine whether an older person can drive safely. There is not currently one effective, easily administered test, or series of tests, to evaluate driving competence [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-evaluation-of-older-drivers/abstract/6-10\" class=\"abstract_t\">6-10</a>]. Thus, the task of evaluating the older adult's functional capacity to drive often falls to their primary care provider, when a spouse or adult child asks &quot;Is my husband or father safe to drive?&quot; The difficult task then is to evaluate the older patient's functional capacity to drive, balancing public safety with patient autonomy. In a survey of family physicians in Canada, about one half of the respondents lacked confidence in their ability to assess driving fitness, and 75 percent felt that reporting a patient as unsafe would potentially undermine their relationship with the patient [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-evaluation-of-older-drivers/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">AGE RELATED CHANGES AND DRIVING</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In addition to the normal changes in vision, psychomotor ability, and cognitive status with aging, older people are more likely to have medical conditions that can affect driving performance. Several studies have attempted to identify the specific medical conditions and functional deficits that predict motor vehicle crashes or adverse driving events in the older population. The following factors have been identified:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A history of falls in the past one to two years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-evaluation-of-older-drivers/abstract/12,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,13</a>]</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The presence of visual [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-evaluation-of-older-drivers/abstract/14-17\" class=\"abstract_t\">14-17</a>] and cognitive deficits [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-evaluation-of-older-drivers/abstract/18,19\" class=\"abstract_t\">18,19</a>]</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A prior history of motor vehicle crashes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-evaluation-of-older-drivers/abstract/17,20\" class=\"abstract_t\">17,20</a>]</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Current use of medications such as tricyclic antidepressants and benzodiazepines [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-evaluation-of-older-drivers/abstract/13,21\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,21</a>]</p><p/><p>The majority of studies examining these factors utilized a self-reported history of adverse driving events. One prospective study of 1910 drivers aged 55 to 96, recruited at the time of driver's license renewal, evaluated these individuals with a battery of tests for mobility, vision, and cognition [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-evaluation-of-older-drivers/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. After follow-up of four to five years, the risk of at-fault motor vehicle accidents was found to approximately double with impaired performance on individual tests of agility, visual perception, and cognition, as well as with age &gt;78 years; male sex and history of falls also increased risk. One case-control study of 174 older drivers between 55 and 90 years of age identified four variables associated with at-fault car crashes: failed UFOV (useful field of view) test (OR 6.1), black race (OR 6.6), not taking a beta blocker (OR 4.3), and history of a fall in the past two years (OR 2.6) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-evaluation-of-older-drivers/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. The association with race is questionable, however, since there were few blacks in the control population.</p><p>In the Second Injury Control and Risk Survey conducted by the Centers for Disease Control in the United States between 2001 and 2003, self-reported motor vehicle crashes occurred more frequently in older adults who lived alone or who were men [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-evaluation-of-older-drivers/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. &#160;</p><p>The variables most significantly associated with crashes were related to functional status and medications rather than the presence of medical diagnoses or chronological age. Failed UFOV, which evaluates several visual and cognitive processing domains as well as attentional capacity, has also been linked to crashes in other studies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-evaluation-of-older-drivers/abstract/14,23\" class=\"abstract_t\">14,23</a>]. Falling and car crashes have similar risk factors, such as the use of sedative or psychotropic medications, cognitive impairment, and balance and gait abnormalities. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=falls-in-older-persons-risk-factors-and-patient-evaluation\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Falls in older persons: Risk factors and patient evaluation&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The finding that beta blocker use was associated with reduced odds of at-fault crashes had not been noted in previous studies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-evaluation-of-older-drivers/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. Although none of the medical conditions associated with beta blocker use were associated with crashes, the authors suggested that, as shown in other studies, beta blockers may reduce performance anxiety and tremor, thereby strengthening vehicle control in some older people.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">EVALUATING OLDER DRIVERS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Assessment of driving ability should be based on performance of objective measures, rather than age alone. Several areas of the history, physical examination, and functional assessment are particularly relevant. There are also resources available in the community to supplement the primary care clinician's driving evaluation.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Pertinent medical history</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Although medical conditions alone have not been found to have a strong effect upon driving performance, a past or current history of ischemic heart disease, cerebrovascular disease, movement disorders, diabetes mellitus, epilepsy, sleep disorders, and arthritis should be evaluated during the primary care examination [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-evaluation-of-older-drivers/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>].</p><p>Some acute conditions that impair consciousness, especially transient ischemic attacks, syncope, and seizures, make driving potentially dangerous [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-evaluation-of-older-drivers/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. For patients with a recent history of these conditions, the clinician should recommend cessation of driving for some period of time until recovery is assured and the baseline level of functioning has returned (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F62343\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef62343 \">table 1</a>).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Medications, alcohol, and other substances</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Older people (65 years and older) comprise approximately 13 percent of the United States population, but receive about 32 percent of the prescription drugs dispensed each year. In 1990 the Health Care Financing Administration (HCFA) estimated that an older person received an average of 17 to 20 prescription drugs per year [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-evaluation-of-older-drivers/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. The physiologic changes associated with aging affect drug absorption, distribution, and renal excretion.</p><p>Thus, a careful history of prescription, over-the-counter, and herbal medications is important in all seniors. Medications with effects on the central nervous system, such as benzodiazepines, antihistamines, anticholinergics, and some tricyclic antidepressants, can be harmful alone and especially in combination. More than one-third of all benzodiazepine prescriptions are written for people ages 60 and older. The traffic accident risk increases by nearly 50 percent in the first week after starting benzodiazepine therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-evaluation-of-older-drivers/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. A population study of older drivers involved in traffic accidents resulting in hospitalization found a five-fold increased risk for serious accident associated with the use of benzodiazepines (OR 5.3); increased risk was also associated with use of antidepressants (OR 1.8) or opioids (OR 1.5) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-evaluation-of-older-drivers/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>].</p><p>One common approach to medication assessment in the primary care setting is to ask the older patient to bring all their medications, including prescription, over the counter, and herbals, in a &quot;brown bag&quot; to the visit. The contents of the &quot;brown bag&quot; can be reviewed with a nurse prior to the clinician visit to determine the older adult's understanding of the indications for use and side effects. In those adults using multiple medications, it is often helpful to have a pharmacist review the contents of the &quot;brown bag&quot; yearly for cost issues and drug interactions.</p><p>The use of alcohol and other substances is hazardous for drivers of any age. However, the physiologic changes of aging such as a decrease in lean body mass and increase in adipose tissue, as well as the potential for multiple drug interactions, make this a significant issue for older drivers.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Social history, including driving</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Often clinicians are so focused upon managing the medical aspects of multiple chronic diseases that they forget to explore areas of the history that relate to the older person's quality of life in the community, such as social support, activities of daily living, alcohol use, and transportation. Social support is a critical element in maintaining health, recovering from acute illness, and managing chronic disease. Asking about family and social supports can provide insight into how the older adult is managing at home and what resources are available should <span class=\"nowrap\">he/she</span> become ill.</p><p>For all patients ages 65 and older, specific questions about driving should be included in the primary care history:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>How did the older patient get to the primary care visit?</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>How often and under what circumstances does <span class=\"nowrap\">he/she</span> drive?</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Any traffic violations, accidents, or close calls within the past six months, year, two years?</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Any episodes of getting lost while driving?</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Does the older person feel comfortable and want to continue driving?</p><p/><p>In addition, asking who would be able to drive to appointments or for groceries if <span class=\"nowrap\">he/she</span> became ill or was unable to drive will provide useful information about social support resources if driving became unadvisable. In some instances, the clinician may want to contact the family, with the older patient's consent, for their observations.</p><p>Also, as with all patients who ride in cars, it is appropriate to ask about seatbelts and encourage their use.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Physical examination</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The areas of the physical examination most closely related to driving safety are mobility and functional status [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-evaluation-of-older-drivers/abstract/12,13,17\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,13,17</a>], visual attention [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-evaluation-of-older-drivers/abstract/14-17\" class=\"abstract_t\">14-17</a>], and cognitive status [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-evaluation-of-older-drivers/abstract/18,19\" class=\"abstract_t\">18,19</a>]. The recommended functional assessment of older drivers is summarized in Table 2 (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F71095\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef71095 \">table 2</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-evaluation-of-older-drivers/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h3\">Mobility</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Aging precipitates changes in muscle strength, reaction time, and mobility, particularly of the neck, shoulder, and wrist. Decreased muscle strength can significantly impact driving ability. Grip strength appears to decline after age 75, although exercise can help to avoid significant loss [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-evaluation-of-older-drivers/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. Restrictions in neck, shoulder, and wrist movement, often caused by rheumatologic conditions, can restrict the field of view in traffic situations, as well as the ability to control the steering wheel.</p><p>Psychomotor ability is not evaluated with a driver's license renewal, except in states that require on-the-road testing. Drivers with diminished strength, reaction time, or mobility may not pass the road test. Older drivers with limited flexibility can have their cars equipped with adaptive equipment, such as special mirrors or power assistive devices, to enhance their driving ability.</p><p>Mobility issues relevant to driving can be assessed in several ways during the primary care visit.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Evaluate range of motion of the neck, shoulders, and wrists.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Evaluate balance and gait with the Get Up and Go Test [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-evaluation-of-older-drivers/abstract/30,31\" class=\"abstract_t\">30,31</a>]. In this brief and practical test, the older patient is asked to rise from a chair, walk 10 feet, turn around, walk back, and then sit down in the chair. The test is timed and usually takes 15 seconds. The clinician should observe the use of the arms or hands to assist the rise from the chair, the height and length of the steps, use of the arms when walking, balance and ease of the turnaround (the most unstable portion of the gait), and how easily the older patient sits down again. There are no established norms to score the test, but observation of these aspects of the older patient's performance during the Get Up and Go Test can provide important information on the risk for falls and driving problems.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The functional reach test is another test for balance and fall risk that is easily administered in the primary care office [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-evaluation-of-older-drivers/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>]. A yardstick is mounted to the wall. The patient stands close to the wall with feet flat on the floor and raises one arm parallel to the yardstick, with the arm at 90 degrees of shoulder flexion, the elbow extended, and the hand fisted. The patient is asked to keep the fist in line with the yardstick and lean forward as far as possible, without taking a step or falling forward. As the patient leans forward, the fist moves along the yardstick. If the starting and ending point of the fist is less than six inches, the patient is at a high risk of falling within the next 6 months.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Measuring grip strength with a dynamometer can be useful for older drivers who have had a stroke. The general rule is that 35 pounds of strength in the dominant hand is necessary for safe driving [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-evaluation-of-older-drivers/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h3\">Vision</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The majority of visual impairment and blindness in older people is caused by age-related macular degeneration, glaucoma, cataracts, and diabetic retinopathy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-evaluation-of-older-drivers/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>]. Age-related changes in vision that can affect driving include decreases in central visual acuity and peripheral vision, diminished ability to accommodate, and heightened sensitivity to glare [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-evaluation-of-older-drivers/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. Over age 50, the total horizontal peripheral visual field declines from 170 degrees to 140 degrees [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-evaluation-of-older-drivers/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. Drivers with deficits in peripheral vision have twice as many collisions as those with normal vision. Many older adults avoid driving at dusk and twilight because of these changes.</p><p>Visual acuity and peripheral vision are evaluated in most states as part of the driver's license renewal process. Retesting visual acuity between the renewal periods is required only if there has been a driving incident. The most common acceptable requirements are a visual acuity of <span class=\"nowrap\">20/40</span> in the better eye and 120 degrees of horizontal peripheral vision.</p><p>In the primary care setting, the most effective measures for detecting significant age-related eye problems are the history, visual acuity testing, and fundoscopy. In addition to past and current medical history and medications, the specific visual history should include a family history of eye disease and the presence of current visual symptoms. Distance visual acuity can be evaluated with the Snellen chart. Near visual acuity can be measured with the Rosenbaum pocket vision screening card or by having the older patient read a newspaper or magazine held 14 inches (at arm's length) from the eyes; generally newspaper type is equivalent to <span class=\"nowrap\">20/40</span> on the Snellen near visual acuity chart. Fundoscopic evaluation of the optic disc, macula, and red reflex will reveal macular degeneration, diabetic changes, glaucoma and cataracts [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-evaluation-of-older-drivers/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>].</p><p>While visual acuity is critical to driving performance, peripheral vision and visual attention are more closely associated with motor vehicle crashes. As mentioned above, the Useful Field of View Test (UFOV: Visual Resources Inc., Bowling Green, KY) is a sensitive predictor of driving safety, with a reduction of 40 percent or more in the UFOV closely associated with crash involvement in older drivers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-evaluation-of-older-drivers/abstract/14,16\" class=\"abstract_t\">14,16</a>]. The UFOV measures how well one can pay attention to a large area all at once, including how fast one can process visual targets on the screen and filter out irrelevant events in the environment to accomplish two tasks at one time. When there are concerns about visual acuity and the older adult's ability to drive, referral can be made to a rehabilitation setting or specialist for UFOV testing.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h3\">Hearing</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Hearing impairment is the third most prevalent chronic health condition in older adults [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-evaluation-of-older-drivers/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>]. Significant hearing loss can affect driving performance and safety. Screening for hearing loss should begin with the history, such as difficulties hearing the television and telephone or understanding speech in a crowded room, and otoscopic inspection for cerumen impaction. The whisper test can be used as a brief screening tool to determine whether there is a difference in hearing in each ear and whether referral for formal audiologic examination is necessary. In this test, one ear is occluded and the older patient is asked to repeat the words or numbers whispered softly by the clinician standing one to two feet away, usually to the back of the patient. The whispered words or numbers used for the test should be those with equally accented syllables, such as baseball or twenty-two [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-evaluation-of-older-drivers/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h2\">Cognitive function</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Fourteen percent of community-residing older adults between 75 and 84 years of age, and over 20 percent of those 85 years and older, have cognitive impairments. While older patients with cognitive impairment tend to self-limit their driving, a significant number still continue to drive, and the cognitive impairment is frequently not recognized by their physicians [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-evaluation-of-older-drivers/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>].</p><p>A systematic review of drivers with dementia found consistent evidence for poorer performance on road or simulated tests of driving, compared with drivers without cognitive impairment, but did not find consistent reports of higher crash rates [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-evaluation-of-older-drivers/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>]. However, statistics of motor vehicle accidents may under-represent the risk since older patients substantially reduce their driving [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-evaluation-of-older-drivers/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>]. In another systematic review, 76 to 85 percent of subjects with mild dementia (Clinical Dementia Rating [CDR] scale of 0.5 to 1.0) were found to be safe drivers by a road driving test subjects, but were significantly more likely to fail an on-road driving test than those without dementia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-evaluation-of-older-drivers/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. Studies of driving evaluations consistently demonstrate worse performance in patients with dementia compared with age-matched controls [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-evaluation-of-older-drivers/abstract/37,38\" class=\"abstract_t\">37,38</a>].</p><p>Whether patients with mild cognitive impairment should be allowed to drive is the subject of much debate but limited consensus. Mild cognitive impairment increases the risk for unsafe driving but, alone, does not establish that a patient is an unsafe driver. Studies are not available to determine whether compensatory strategies for patients with cognitive impairment (driving with co-pilots, restricted licensing, education) are effective in improving driving safety. Cognitive training may be effective for those with minimal cognitive impairment, however. In a randomized trial of cognitive training for older subjects with no or mild impairment (MMSE &ge;23), those randomized to participate in 8 to 10 sessions of training to improve speed-of-processing and reasoning had lower rates of at-fault motor vehicle collisions at six years compared to controls [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-evaluation-of-older-drivers/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>]. </p><p>In the primary care setting, evaluation of cognitive function should begin with the history. Mental status changes may become apparent in the older adult's responses to areas of the medical and social history. However, even signs of moderately severe dementia can be subtle and difficult to detect without formal cognitive testing. A systematic review of studies that evaluated predictors of driving capacity in persons with dementia found that the Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR) scale (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F53706\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef53706 \">table 3</a>) had the best evidence of utility in evaluating driving safety [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-evaluation-of-older-drivers/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>].</p><p>An American Academy of Neurology practice parameter suggests an algorithm for evaluating driving safety in patients with dementia based upon the clinical dementia rating (CDR) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F53706\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef53706 \">table 3</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-evaluation-of-older-drivers/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients with a CDR = 2 are at high risk for unsafe driving.

Considering this along with the other risk factors noted above, patients and families should be encouraged to develop alternative sources of transportation, to consider voluntary surrender of driving privileges, limiting driving to familiar routes during daylight hours, and to consider referral for a professional driving evaluation. A substantial proportion (41 to 85 percent) of patients in this CDR range will be judged to be safe drivers by an on-road driving evaluation.</p><p/><p>Alternative testing that may be used includes tests of dementia (Trails A, Trails B [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-evaluation-of-older-drivers/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>], clock drawing [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-evaluation-of-older-drivers/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>], and copying intersecting geometric figures) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-evaluation-of-older-drivers/abstract/19,42-44\" class=\"abstract_t\">19,42-44</a>], a multicomponent Roadwise Review [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-evaluation-of-older-drivers/abstract/45\" class=\"abstract_t\">45</a>], and the Mini-Mental State Exam (MMSE) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-evaluation-of-older-drivers/abstract/46\" class=\"abstract_t\">46</a>]. While a 2010 guideline from the American Academy of Neurology suggests that a MMSE score &le;24 is useful in identifying patients at increased risk for unsafe driving [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-evaluation-of-older-drivers/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>], there is conflicting data correlating MMSE scores with unsafe driving and crashes. For example, in a prospective study of over 17,000 individuals aged 55 and over who had a baseline MMSE and who drove at least one time per week, at 4.5 years there was no correlation between MMSE score and risk of motor vehicle crash [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-evaluation-of-older-drivers/abstract/47\" class=\"abstract_t\">47</a>]. The MMSE may best be used as a piece of ancillary information in the overall assessment of the patient, to be interpreted in light of the patient&rsquo;s education and comorbidities. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-of-cognitive-impairment-and-dementia#H8\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation of cognitive impairment and dementia&quot;, section on 'Mini-Mental State Examination'</a>.)</p><p>Mandatory reporting of a moderate or severe dementia is required in some states in the US (eg, California, Pennsylvania) as well as certain provinces in Canada and Australia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-evaluation-of-older-drivers/abstract/48\" class=\"abstract_t\">48</a>]. Although a number of driving safety tests have been suggested, no guidelines have been broadly implemented [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-evaluation-of-older-drivers/abstract/18,49,50\" class=\"abstract_t\">18,49,50</a>]. Local programs may exist to evaluate these patients with neuropsychological and roadside tests. In the absence of these programs, the department of motor vehicles will often perform roadside testing, but patients must be informed that even if they pass they will need to be retested at regular intervals as their disease progresses. Families must be warned about potential liability for accidents. They may need to take possession of car keys, or even the cars, and restrict all driving.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h2\">Multimodal evaluation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Research is ongoing to identify specific functional tests that correlate with formal driving assessment and can be used to determine driving safety. One report, based on multivariate analysis of a number of tests for vision, cognitive ability, and motor performance, found that assessment for color choice reaction time, postural sway, motion sensitivity and self-reported distance driven regularly could classify drivers as safe or unsafe (based on road testing) with a sensitivity of 91 percent and specificity of 70 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-evaluation-of-older-drivers/abstract/51\" class=\"abstract_t\">51</a>]. Another multicomponent test, the Hazard Predictions Test, correlated to a modest extent with on-road driving performance [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-evaluation-of-older-drivers/abstract/52\" class=\"abstract_t\">52</a>]. These test batteries need further validation in other populations of older drivers to confirm reliability.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h1\">COMMUNICATING WITH PATIENT AND FAMILY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Although it is challenging to identify the unsafe older driver during the primary care visit, once the driver is identified, the clinician and the family often find it even more difficult to talk with the older driver about their concerns. Many clinicians are also unsure of what to do if the primary care evaluation suggests that the older patient should stop driving.</p><p>In a 1997 New York State survey of families and caregivers of older drivers, over 70 percent of the family members reported that they had been concerned over one year about driving safety (<a href=\"http://www.aging.ny.gov/&amp;token=+nBbE+swKN2OqCEe27jjxD0ZoMDmt59mZyZA8k/JcWCvALUkLBSw0hah5bEtTSir&amp;TOPIC_ID=3005\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">www.aging.ny.gov/</a>). The first indication came from watching the older driver, damage to the car, comments from passengers, or an accident. Over 50 percent of the family members reported that the older driver was also having problems with other activities of daily living. They had noticed a recent event, such as an illness or hospitalization, that signaled a decrease in driving performance. Surprisingly, 60 percent of the family members reported that they were not able to discuss the issue with the older driver or to intervene to stop the older adult from driving.</p><p>These family members described three areas in which the primary care clinician could help them intervene with the older driver:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Assessment of the older adult's health and functional status to provide an objective assessment of medical issues that might interfere with driving. </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Support from the clinician to discuss their concerns with the older driver. </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Information about areas such as independent evaluation of on-the-road driving competence and alternative resources for transportation in the community.</p><p/><p>Communication can be facilitated by initiating discussion about the potential to develop driving limitations as part of routine health care for older adults, before a crisis has been reached &ndash; essentially &quot;advance planning for driving retirement&quot; [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-evaluation-of-older-drivers/abstract/53\" class=\"abstract_t\">53</a>]. A proposed approach includes anticipating transportation needs, identifying available options for transportation, recognizing and addressing emotional factors related to loss of mobility and independence, and the potential impact of not driving on social connectedness. Older adults who are approaching the time to stop driving may benefit from multidisciplinary support, including physicians, nurses, case managers, social workers, and physical and occupational therapists. Formal driving safety evaluations may be helpful in borderline cases or for older drivers who are reluctant to stop driving despite the recommendation. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H20073437\"><span class=\"h1\">RESOURCES FOR FAMILY AND CLINICIANS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The primary care history and physical examination can provide critical information about age-related problems that may affect driving performance. However, often even after a complete examination with special attention to these areas, the answer to the question, &quot;Is my husband or dad safe to drive?&quot; is still not clear. At this point, if the clinician suspects that the older adult may not be safe to drive, and the patient, family, and the clinician desire an objective assessment, several resources are available to supplement the primary care driving evaluation.</p><p>The <a href=\"http://www.alz.org/&amp;token=0SM8TegfFRL7gaY+yqo9TIzF4NFgBRokcVREgaqxgUU=&amp;TOPIC_ID=3005\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">Alzheimer's Association website</a> is an excellent resource for clinicians, patients, and families on many aspects of Alzheimer dementia, including driving. They describe the warning signs of unsafe driving, such as forgetting how to locate familiar places, failure to obey traffic signals, making slow or poor decisions, driving at an inappropriate speed, and becoming angry and confused while driving. These signs can be useful for the older adult and the family to identify the unsafe older driver.</p><p>The organization suggests the following approaches for caregivers who are unable to convince the older adult to stop driving. First, control the older adult's access to the car by hiding the keys, disabling the car by removing the battery or the distributor cap, or parking the car on another block or in another driveway. Second, arrange for substitute transportation. Third, ask the clinician to write a prescription for &quot;Do Not Drive,&quot; and finally, arrange on-the-road evaluation by the state department of motor vehicles. The latter approach is truly a last resort as there are many implications in involving the state department of motor vehicles in the evaluation of older drivers.</p><p>The American Association of Retired Persons (AARP) has an active older drivers program, 55 Alive, which offers an eight-hour class on driving safety for a nominal charge. Over five million older drivers have completed the program since it was developed in 1979. Graduates of the program who live in 34 states and the District of Columbia are eligible to receive a multi-year car insurance discount. The <a href=\"http://www.aarp.org/&amp;token=TCZoDJKkgSsgDea9026wfM9vLjvrbkXgNocLCELtNig=&amp;TOPIC_ID=3005\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">AARP website</a> contains information about their driving programs, as well as a helpful &quot;Close Call Quiz&quot; that can be used by older drivers as a self-assessment. The AARP program and a more general class sponsored by the American Automobile Association (AAA) are helpful in reviewing the rules of driving and helping older drivers self-assess their driving knowledge. However, these programs do not evaluate the most critical component of the driving evaluation, on-the-road performance. Many local driving schools will perform an on-the-road evaluation for a small fee. In addition, veterans' and rehabilitation hospitals also have driving programs available. The veterans' hospitals are free of charge for veterans.</p><p>The American Geriatrics Society is also a good resource for clinicians and families. Their website (<a href=\"http://www.americangeriatrics.org/&amp;token=S6o2rcH3fCsJrnf6UkSdIJYdkYz3ha0V8RVHBcHn3+mw1PGKmWmeV1d34rOyMszx&amp;TOPIC_ID=3005\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">www.americangeriatrics.org</a>) contains information for clinicians on age-related issues as well as excellent patient education materials. The Patient Education Forum, Safe Driving for Seniors, is particularly useful in a question and answer format for older drivers.</p><p>On-the-road driving evaluation is often the most effective way of convincing an older driver that he or she may not be safe to drive. This objective evaluation of driving performance takes the pressure off the family and the clinician who want to maintain a positive relationship with the older patient.</p><p>Social workers and case managers can be very helpful in identifying other resources in the community and working with the older adult and family around transportation issues. Another strategy to use with resistant older drivers is to remind them that insurance companies may refuse to pay for damages that occur after their clinician recommends driving cessation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-evaluation-of-older-drivers/abstract/54\" class=\"abstract_t\">54</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14\"><span class=\"h1\">US STATE LICENSE RENEWAL REQUIREMENTS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The US public expects the states, through the department of motor vehicles or transportation safety, to detect, examine, and regulate problem drivers. Each state has different license renewal requirements, and most states have no procedures specific for age. Driving competency tests, usually vision and on-the-road exams, can be done after self or others report driving problems. It is difficult for the states to take an active role because the most common age-related issues that affect driving safety are multifactorial, and often occur between licensing periods.</p><p>Illinois requires residents who are 75 years and older to take vision and on-the-road tests each year to renew their license. Restrictions can also be placed on the license, such as &quot;daylight only&quot; or &quot;local area only.&quot; For example, the District of Columbia requires a physician certification each renewal period. In 1996, California changed its driving policies regarding older adults with dementia. The California Division of Motor Vehicles requires that the licenses of older adults with moderately advanced dementia be revoked without testing. Florida, where there are many older drivers, is one of the least restrictive states; drivers ages 70 years and older can renew their license by mail for two renewal periods (ie, eight years), with only a vision test required at the third renewal.</p><p>The issue of age-based testing is controversial. Those in favor say that routine testing should be mandatory starting with a certain age because many older adults are unwilling to recognize their limitations. However, those against are concerned about age discrimination and advocate that testing should be mandatory based upon driving history and performance, not solely on the basis of age. In those states with age-based mandatory testing, less than 5 percent of older drivers actually lose their license after the testing.</p><p>A retrospective study that used a multivariate analysis to look at the relationship between fatal crashes and state laws in the United States found that for people aged 85 and older, states with in-person license renewal requirements were associated with a lower driver fatality rate (incident rate ratio 0.83, 95% CI 0.72-0.96) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-evaluation-of-older-drivers/abstract/55\" class=\"abstract_t\">55</a>]. Requirements for in-person renewal in younger age groups did not reduce fatality rates. State-mandated vision tests, road tests, and more frequent license renewal for older drivers also did not reduce fatality rates.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15\"><span class=\"h1\">LEGAL ISSUES IN EVALUATING OLDER DRIVERS</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13088552\"><span class=\"h2\">United States</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A nationwide survey in the United States found that almost 30 percent of geriatricians did not know how to make a report in their state about an older patient with dementia who is a potentially dangerous driver [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-evaluation-of-older-drivers/abstract/56\" class=\"abstract_t\">56</a>]. In addition, the courts have provided little clear guidance on this issue. Although lawsuits have been filed by innocent people who were injured as a result of an accident, the courts have been inconsistent in their findings against clinicians who allowed their potentially impaired patients to continue to drive. For the most part, the legal decisions depend upon the issue of &quot;foreseeability.&quot; Was the clinician able to &quot;reasonably foresee&quot; that the medical issues would significantly impair the patient's ability to drive safely [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-evaluation-of-older-drivers/abstract/57\" class=\"abstract_t\">57</a>]?</p><p>Six states (California, Delaware, Nevada, New Jersey, Oregon, and Pennsylvania) have mandatory reporting requirements regarding potentially unsafe drivers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-evaluation-of-older-drivers/abstract/58\" class=\"abstract_t\">58</a>]. California, for example, requires physicians to report drivers with dementia to the local health department, who then reports them to the Department of Motor Vehicles. In many states the reporter's name is confidential. However, reporting the older adult to the state is uncomfortable for many clinicians who consider it a breach of confidentiality and a threat to the clinician-patient relationship.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13088559\"><span class=\"h2\">Canada</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A policy in Ontario, Canada requires that physicians report patients who are &quot;suffering from a condition that may make it dangerous for the person to operate a motor vehicle&quot; [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-evaluation-of-older-drivers/abstract/59\" class=\"abstract_t\">59</a>]. Physicians are offered a small monetary incentive to report unfit patients. In a study of the impact of reporting, approximately one-half of the 59,000 patients reported one year after the incentive was introduced were older than age 60; road crashes resulting in emergency department visits for reported at-risk drivers decreased by 45 percent at one year [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-evaluation-of-older-drivers/abstract/60\" class=\"abstract_t\">60</a>].
