The majority of fetal Ca accretion occurs in the third trimester. This process results in higher plasma Ca concentrations in the fetus than in the mother, which in turn results in fetal total and ionized Ca concentrations of 10 to 11 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> (2.5 to 2.75 <span class=\"nowrap\">mmol/L)</span> and 6 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> (1.5 <span class=\"nowrap\">mmol/L),</span> respectively, in umbilical cord blood at term [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neonatal-hypocalcemia/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p>After the abrupt cessation of placental transfer of Ca at birth, neonatal total serum Ca falls to 8 to 9 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> (2 to 2.25 <span class=\"nowrap\">mmol/L),</span> and ionized Ca falls to as low as 4.4 to 5.4 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> (1.1 to 1.35 <span class=\"nowrap\">mmol/L)</span> at 24 hours after delivery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neonatal-hypocalcemia/abstract/3,4\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,4</a>]. Serum Ca concentration subsequently rises, reaching levels seen in older children and adults by two weeks of age [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neonatal-hypocalcemia/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">MEASUREMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>To evaluate calcium (Ca) status, we recommend measurement of ionized Ca in whole blood rather than total Ca, because it more accurately reflects the physiologically available Ca [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neonatal-hypocalcemia/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=relation-between-total-and-ionized-serum-calcium-concentrations\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Relation between total and ionized serum calcium concentrations&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Within the plasma, Ca circulates in different forms. Approximately 40 percent is bound to serum proteins, principally albumin; 10 percent is complexed with citrate, bicarbonate, sulfate, or phosphate; and 50 percent exists as the physiologically important ionized (or free) Ca [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neonatal-hypocalcemia/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. The ionized Ca concentration is tightly regulated by parathyroid hormone (PTH) and vitamin D.</p><p>Correlation between ionized and total Ca is poor when the serum albumin concentration is low, or to a lesser degree, with disturbances in acid-base status, both of which occur frequently in preterm or ill infants.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>With hypoalbuminemia, the total Ca concentration will be low, while the ionized fraction will be normal unless some other factor is affecting Ca metabolism. In general, the plasma Ca concentration falls by 0.8 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> (0.2 <span class=\"nowrap\">mmol/L)</span> for every 1 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/dL</span> (10 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/L)</span> decrease in the plasma albumin concentration.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Disturbances in acid-base status can change the ionized Ca concentration without affecting the total Ca level. An elevation in extracellular pH, for example, increases the binding of Ca to albumin, thereby lowering the plasma ionized Ca concentration [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neonatal-hypocalcemia/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. The fall in ionized Ca with acute respiratory alkalosis is approximately 0.16 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> (0.04 <span class=\"nowrap\">mmol/L</span> or 0.08 <span class=\"nowrap\">mEq/L)</span> for each 0.1 unit increase in pH [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neonatal-hypocalcemia/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. Thus, acute respiratory alkalosis can induce signs of hypocalcemia. Conversely, with metabolic acidosis, binding of Ca to albumin is reduced, and the ionized Ca concentration will be increased.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h1\">DEFINITION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The definition of hypocalcemia depends upon gestational age (GA) and birth weight (BW):</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For term infants or preterm infants with BW &gt;1500 g, we define hypocalcemia as a total serum calcium (Ca) less than 8 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> (2 <span class=\"nowrap\">mmol/L)</span> or an ionized fraction of less than 4.4 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> (1.1 <span class=\"nowrap\">mmol/L)</span>.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For very low birth weight (VLBW) infants (BW &lt;1500 g), hypocalcemia is defined as a total serum Ca less than 7 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> (1.75 <span class=\"nowrap\">mmol/L)</span> or an ionized fraction of less than 4 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> (1 <span class=\"nowrap\">mmol/L)</span>.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h1\">EARLY HYPOCALCEMIA</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The causes of neonatal hypocalcemia are classified by the timing of onset. Hypocalcemia is considered to be early when it occurs in the first two to three days after birth. Early hypocalcemia is an exaggeration of the normal decline in calcium (Ca) concentration after birth. It occurs more commonly in infants who are preterm or fetal growth restricted (FGR), born to mothers with diabetes, after perinatal asphyxia, or who have hypoparathyroidism. In these patients, nutritional support alone is adequate treatment to increase Ca levels. (See <a href=\"#H1117798084\" class=\"local\">'Asymptomatic infants'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Prematurity</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Approximately one-third of preterm infants and the majority of very low birth weight (VLBW) infants have low total serum Ca concentrations during the first two days after birth [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neonatal-hypocalcemia/abstract/9,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,10</a>]. Multiple factors contribute to the fall in total serum Ca. These include hypoalbuminemia, which does not lower the ionized Ca, and factors that lower both total and ionized Ca, such as reduced intake of Ca because of low intake of milk, possible impaired response to parathyroid hormone (PTH), increased calcitonin levels, and increased urinary losses accompanying high renal sodium excretion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neonatal-hypocalcemia/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. Most preterm infants are asymptomatic because the fall in total serum Ca typically is greater than the fall in ionized Ca, because they are at risk for hypoalbuminemia (fall in total Ca but not ionized Ca) and in some cases, mild metabolic acidosis, which tends to raise the ionized Ca. (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Measurement'</a> above.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3306481790\"><span class=\"h2\">Fetal growth restriction</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Hypocalcemia occurs with increased frequency in infants with FGR. The risk increases with the severity of growth failure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neonatal-hypocalcemia/abstract/11,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,12</a>]. The mechanism is thought to involve decreased transfer of Ca across the placenta.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Infants of diabetic mothers</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Hypocalcemia occurs in at least 10 to 20 percent of infants of diabetic mothers (IDMs) and in as many as 50 percent in some series [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neonatal-hypocalcemia/abstract/13,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,14</a>] (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=infant-of-a-diabetic-mother\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Infant of a diabetic mother&quot;</a>). The lowest serum Ca concentration typically occurs between 24 to 72 hours after birth and often is associated with hyperphosphatemia. The extent of hypocalcemia is related to the severity and duration of maternal diabetes. Hypocalcemia is thought to be caused by lower PTH concentrations after birth in IDMs compared with normal infants [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neonatal-hypocalcemia/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. Why this lower concentration occurs is not well understood. Higher serum ionized Ca concentrations in utero in IDMs may suppress the fetal parathyroid glands [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neonatal-hypocalcemia/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. The development of hypomagnesemia, prematurity, and birth asphyxia may be contributing factors.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Birth asphyxia</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Infants with birth asphyxia frequently have hypocalcemia and may also have hyperphosphatemia. Possible mechanisms include increased phosphate load caused by tissue catabolism, decreased intake due to delayed initiation of feedings, renal insufficiency, and increased serum calcitonin concentration [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neonatal-hypocalcemia/abstract/16,17\" class=\"abstract_t\">16,17</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=systemic-effects-of-perinatal-asphyxia\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Systemic effects of perinatal asphyxia&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H79640569\"><span class=\"h2\">Hypoparathyroidism</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Hypoparathyroidism associated with excess phosphorus (P) intake is a common cause of early neonatal hypocalcemia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neonatal-hypocalcemia/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. Hypoparathyroidism can be due to lack of parathyroid glands, which may occur as part of a genetic syndrome, or to defects in the synthesis or release of PTH.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2923428924\"><span class=\"h3\">Syndromes</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Several syndromes have been associated with neonatal hypocalcemia, with DiGeorge syndrome (DGS) being the most common cause. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=etiology-of-hypocalcemia-in-infants-and-children#H9\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Etiology of hypocalcemia in infants and children&quot;, section on 'Genetic mechanisms'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2144694267\"><span class=\"h4\">CATCH-22 and DiGeorge syndrome</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The most prevalent syndrome that includes hypoparathyroidism is DGS (also called DiGeorge anomaly). It is the most severe phenotype of a group of related disorders known as CATCH-22 syndrome, an acronym for cardiac defects, abnormal facies, thymic hypoplasia, cleft palate, and hypocalcemia caused by chromosome 22q11 deletion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neonatal-hypocalcemia/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. DGS arises from a failure of migration of neural crest cells into the third and fourth pharyngeal pouches. Affected patients typically present in the first week after birth with signs of hypocalcemia, such as tetany or seizures, secondary to hypoplastic or absent parathyroid glands. They have characteristic facial features that include a small mouth, a submucous cleft palate, abnormal and low set ears, upturned nose, and a widened distance between the inner canthi (telecanthus) with short palpebral fissures [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neonatal-hypocalcemia/abstract/20,21\" class=\"abstract_t\">20,21</a>]. Cardiac defects, especially abnormalities of the outflow tract or aortic arch (eg, truncus arteriosus, tetralogy of Fallot, or interrupted aortic arch), are frequently present. Thymic hypoplasia results in an immune defect that is highly variable.

The mechanism is related to increased transplacental transport of Ca caused by high maternal Ca concentrations, which results in fetal hypercalcemia that leads to suppression of fetal and neonatal PTH secretion. Affected infants typically develop increased neuromuscular irritability in the first three weeks after birth, but they can present later [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neonatal-hypocalcemia/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].

The most common etiology in newborns is transient hypomagnesemia, although rare disorders of intestinal <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> renal tubular magnesium (Mg) transport can occur. In transient cases, the serum Mg concentration typically is 0.8 to 1.4 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> (0.33 to 0.58 <span class=\"nowrap\">mmol/L)</span> (normal values are 1.6 to 2.8 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> [0.66 to 1.16 <span class=\"nowrap\">mmol/L]);</span> more severe reductions occur in the transport defects [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neonatal-hypocalcemia/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h1\">LATE HYPOCALCEMIA</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Late hypocalcemia develops after the second or third day after birth and typically occurs at the end of the first week [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neonatal-hypocalcemia/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. Infants with late-onset hypocalcemia usually present with signs of hypocalcemia including severe neuromuscular irritability or seizures.

The mechanism is uncertain, but the high P level may antagonize parathyroid hormone (PTH) secretion or actions, or it may produce increased calcium (Ca) and P deposition in bones, leading to hypocalcemia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neonatal-hypocalcemia/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. Symptomatic infants typically present with tetany or seizures at 5 to 10 days of age [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neonatal-hypocalcemia/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>].

However, 25 <span class=\"nowrap\">ng/mL</span> has not been established as a biologically valuable threshold for any clinical disorders in preterm infants. Therefore, the true role of low vitamin D status has yet to be determined. Maternal levels of low 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels were not measured, but the authors speculate based on other reports that maternal vitamin D insufficiency was a contributing factor to low vitamin D levels. In addition, these infants had severe hypomagnesemia and PTH levels that were inappropriately low. The combination of multiple biochemical abnormalities may have led to severe late-onset hypocalcemia.

Thus, management is directed at providing adequate calcium (Ca) intake by initiating early feedings. For infants who require parenteral nutrition, Ca is added to the solution as 10 percent Ca gluconate (500 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg,</span> 50 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> of elemental Ca) per day and given as a continuous infusion. If parenteral Ca infusion is continued for more than 48 hours, additional phosphorus (P) also must be provided, based on serum P measurements.</p><p>Treatment should be directed against any underlying disease, if possible. Examples include hypomagnesemia and hyperphosphatemia. (See <a href=\"#H25\" class=\"local\">'Correction of hypomagnesemia'</a> below and <a href=\"#H26\" class=\"local\">'Hyperphosphatemia'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H23\"><span class=\"h2\">Symptomatic infants</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H21065652\"><span class=\"h3\">Acute therapy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>As noted above, infants with late-onset hypocalcemia usually present with signs consistent with abnormally low serum Ca, including severe neuromuscular irritability or seizures. They are treated with 10 percent Ca gluconate (100 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> or 1 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/kg</span> intravenously [IV]) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neonatal-hypocalcemia/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. The solution is infused over 5 to 10 minutes while the heart rate and infusion site are monitored. The dose can be repeated in 10 minutes if no response occurs. Alternatively, Ca chloride (20 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> or 0.2 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/kg)</span> can be given; this preparation is metabolized more rapidly and may be preferable if it is readily available.</p><p>Similar to the asymptomatic patient, treatment should be directed against any underlying disease (hypomagnesemia, hyperphosphatemia, and vitamin D deficiency), if possible.

Risks include bradyarrhythmias that can result from rapid elevations in serum Ca concentration, and extravasation into subcutaneous tissues, resulting in necrosis and subcutaneous calcifications. Hepatic necrosis can be caused by infusion through an umbilical venous catheter if the tip is in a branch of the portal vein.</p><p>Ca should <strong>not</strong> be infused acutely into an umbilical artery catheter because arterial spasm may result, potentially compromising intestinal blood flow.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H906264391\"><span class=\"h3\">Maintenance therapy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>After acute treatment, maintenance Ca gluconate should be added to the IV solution. If enteral feedings are tolerated, we use Ca glubionate, if available (oral administration of 30 to 50 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> per day in four divided doses), although its high osmolality and sugar content can cause gastrointestinal irritability or diarrhea. Alternatively, 10 percent Ca gluconate (500 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> per day of the gluconate) can be divided and given in four to six feedings. Ca glubionate is not readily available in the United States. Ca carbonate is not generally recommended as an alternative in the newborn period, due to the possibility, not tested in clinical studies, that the higher pH of the neonatal stomach may limit solubility and absorption of the Ca carbonate.</p><p>For late hypocalcemia, we provide 400 international <span class=\"nowrap\">units/day</span> of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=vitamin-d3-cholecalciferol-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">vitamin D3</a>. This usually is discontinued after one to two weeks. Alternatively, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=calcitriol-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">calcitriol</a> as an adjuvant therapy to gastrointestinal absorption of Ca may be used. If calcitriol is used, a dose of 0.08 to 0.1 <span class=\"nowrap\">mcg/kg</span> is provided.

Magnesium sulfate (25 to 50 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> or 0.2 to 0.4 <span class=\"nowrap\">mEq/kg</span> per dose every 12 hours, IV over at least two hours or intramuscular [IM]) is given until the serum magnesium concentration is greater than 1.5 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> (0.62 <span class=\"nowrap\">mmol/L)</span>. The magnesium concentration is measured before each dose. One or two doses usually is adequate to achieve normal levels.

Causes include prematurity, maternal diabetes, birth asphyxia, fetal growth restriction (FGR), and hypoparathyroidism. (See <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Early hypocalcemia'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Late hypocalcemia usually occurs at the end of the first week of life, but may occur earlier after the second or third day after birth. Late hypocalcemia is usually caused by high phosphate intake. It is unclear whether vitamin D insufficiency (possibly caused by maternal vitamin D deficiency) has a causative role in late neonatal hypocalcemia. (See <a href=\"#H13\" class=\"local\">'Late hypocalcemia'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Most infants with hypocalcemia are asymptomatic. If symptomatic, neuromuscular irritability is the most common sign, with jitteriness and muscle jerking. Less common findings include seizures and, rarely, laryngospasm, wheezing, or vomiting. (See <a href=\"#H20\" class=\"local\">'Clinical manifestations'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Calcium (Ca) levels are measured for at-risk neonates including very low birth weight (VLBW) infants (BW &lt;1500 g), those with congenital heart disease, and in patients with symptoms consistent with hypocalcemia. (See <a href=\"#H21\" class=\"local\">'Screening'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The diagnosis is made by an abnormally low serum Ca value, which is defined by BW. If available, ionized Ca is the optimal test because this measurement most accurately assesses the risk of symptoms in all neonatal patient groups. (See <a href=\"#H1999371125\" class=\"local\">'Diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>In term infants or preterm infants with BW &gt;1500 g, hypocalcemia is confirmed when the total serum Ca is less than 8 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> (2 <span class=\"nowrap\">mmol/L)</span> or an ionized fraction of less than 4.4 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> (1.1 <span class=\"nowrap\">mmol/L)</span>.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>In VLBW preterm infants (BW &lt;1500 g), hypocalcemia is diagnosed when the total serum Ca is less than 7 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> (1.75 <span class=\"nowrap\">mmol/L)</span> or an ionized fraction of less than 4 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> (1 <span class=\"nowrap\">mmol/L)</span>.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In asymptomatic infants, we suggest providing adequate Ca intake by initiating early feedings, if possible, or parenteral nutrition (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). In addition, any underlying disorder resulting in a low Ca value should be corrected. (See <a href=\"#H1117798084\" class=\"local\">'Asymptomatic infants'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In symptomatic patients, we suggest providing initial parenteral Ca therapy as a 10 percent Ca gluconate solution at a dose of 100 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> or 1 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/kg</span> (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). Further Ca supplementation is provided either parenterally or orally, if enteral feeds are tolerated. (See <a href=\"#H23\" class=\"local\">'Symptomatic infants'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Further evaluation is warranted if infants have persistent early hypocalcemia that does not respond to dietary treatment, develop late hypocalcemia, or have associated seizures.
