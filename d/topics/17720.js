This genetic abnormality results in the formation of a unique gene product (BCR-ABL1), which results in a constitutively active tyrosine kinase. It is this deregulated tyrosine kinase that is implicated in the development of CML and is the target of current therapies. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=molecular-genetics-of-chronic-myeloid-leukemia\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Molecular genetics of chronic myeloid leukemia&quot;</a>.)</p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=imatinib-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Imatinib</a> mesylate was the first tyrosine kinase inhibitor used in the treatment of CML. Since then, several other tyrosine kinase inhibitors have been developed and tested in patients with CML, most notably <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dasatinib-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">dasatinib</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nilotinib-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">nilotinib</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=bosutinib-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">bosutinib</a>, and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ponatinib-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ponatinib</a>. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-use-of-tyrosine-kinase-inhibitors-for-chronic-myeloid-leukemia\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical use of tyrosine kinase inhibitors for chronic myeloid leukemia&quot;</a>.)</p><p>CML has historically been a triphasic disease. Approximately 85 to 90 percent of patients present in a chronic stable phase. Without treatment, this inevitably progresses to a more aggressive, accelerated phase and then culminates in a very difficult to treat blast crisis. As advances are made in the treatment of chronic phase CML, fewer patients (approximately 6 percent at five years) are progressing to accelerated phase and blast crisis. In addition, 10 to 15 percent of patients will initially present in accelerated phase or blast crisis. Interestingly, some patients progress to blast crisis without a clinically discernible accelerated phase. This is supported by an analysis of gene expression profiles in different stages of CML demonstrated relatively distinct patterns in chronic and blast phases without an identifiable &quot;signature&quot; of accelerated phase suggesting that CML is biologically more likely to be a &quot;bi&quot; rather than a triphasic disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-chronic-myeloid-leukemia-in-accelerated-phase/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p>The treatment of CML in accelerated phase is discussed here. The treatment of CML in chronic phase or blast crisis is discussed separately as is the use of hematopoietic cell transplantation.

The most frequently used criteria from the World Health Organization (WHO) define the accelerated phase in patients with CML by the presence of one or more of the following features:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>10 to 19 percent blasts in the peripheral blood or bone marrow</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Peripheral blood basophils &ge;20 percent</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Platelets <span class=\"nowrap\">&lt;100,000/microL,</span> unrelated to therapy</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Platelets <span class=\"nowrap\">&gt;1,000,000/microL,</span> unresponsive to therapy</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Progressive splenomegaly and increasing white cell count, unresponsive to therapy</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Cytogenetic evolution (defined as the development of chromosomal abnormalities in addition to the Philadelphia chromosome)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">OVERVIEW OF TREATMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Once a patient progresses from chronic to accelerated phase CML their disease is much more difficult to control. Among patients who have <strong>not</strong> received a BCR-ABL1 tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI), treatment options for accelerated phase CML include TKIs and allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT). Eligibility criteria for allogeneic HCT vary by institution. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=determining-eligibility-for-allogeneic-hematopoietic-cell-transplantation\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Determining eligibility for allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation&quot;</a>.)</p><p>A small percentage of patients initially treated with a TKI for chronic phase disease will progress to accelerated phase. In addition, many patients initially treated with a TKI for accelerated phase disease will have resistance. Both of these patient groups should undergo testing for <em>BCR-ABL1</em> kinase mutations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-chronic-myeloid-leukemia-in-accelerated-phase/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Mutations are detected in approximately 50 percent of these patients. The mechanisms of resistance in the other patients are poorly understood. A more detailed discussion of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=imatinib-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">imatinib</a> resistance can be found elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-use-of-tyrosine-kinase-inhibitors-for-chronic-myeloid-leukemia\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical use of tyrosine kinase inhibitors for chronic myeloid leukemia&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-the-treatment-of-chronic-myeloid-leukemia#H1013391\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of the treatment of chronic myeloid leukemia&quot;, section on 'Evaluation at loss of response'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h1\">INITIAL TREATMENT</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Patients eligible for HCT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Among patients with accelerated phase CML who are candidates for allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT), we recommend initial therapy with a tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI; <a href=\"topic.htm?path=imatinib-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">imatinib</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dasatinib-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">dasatinib</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nilotinib-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">nilotinib</a>) followed by HCT, rather than initial HCT. Despite the risks of short-term morbidity and mortality, allogeneic HCT is potentially curative in accelerated phase. The most important prognostic factor for survival following allogeneic HCT for CML is the disease phase at the time of transplantation, with four-year disease-free survival (DFS) rates of 30 to 40 percent in patients with accelerated phase versus up to 80 percent in patients with chronic phase disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-chronic-myeloid-leukemia-in-accelerated-phase/abstract/4,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,5</a>]. Given this disparity between survival of patients in different disease phases, it is logical to attempt to bring a patient from accelerated phase to chronic phase or even into remission by treatment with a TKI prior to transplantation. Therefore, the initial management of a patient with accelerated phase CML includes both the initiation of a search for a donor and treatment with a TKI.</p><p>Small retrospective studies suggest that approximately 80 to 90 percent of patients who present with features of accelerated phase CML at the time of diagnosis will achieve a complete cytogenetic response with a TKI [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-chronic-myeloid-leukemia-in-accelerated-phase/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. The use of a TKI does not appear to increase rates of morbidity and mortality with the subsequent transplant [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-chronic-myeloid-leukemia-in-accelerated-phase/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. The choice of initial TKI and trials supporting the use of TKIs in accelerated phase CML are described in detail in the following section. (See <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'Patients ineligible for HCT'</a> below.)</p><p>The optimal timing of transplantation in patients in accelerated phase in the era of TKIs is unknown. When patients undergo initial treatment with a TKI, the principal options are:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Transplantation after the best response has been achieved.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Initial treatment with a TKI with transplantation when there is evidence of worsening response. This is an option for patients who achieve complete cytogenetic remission and sustained major molecular response after TKI therapy. Such patients should be monitored closely (eg, every two to three months) with plans to proceed with HCT upon evidence of worsening response. If this approach is considered, donor searches should be initiated at the time of diagnosis of accelerated phase and not delayed until the time of disease progression.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Initial treatment with a TKI followed by treatment with another TKI at relapse followed by transplantation.</p><p/><p>There have been no randomized trials comparing HCT to treatment with a TKI. The main data come from retrospective analyses and clinical experience. As an example, a retrospective analysis of 132 patients with accelerated phase CML examined outcomes among those treated with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=imatinib-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">imatinib</a> therapy alone or a short course of imatinib followed by allogeneic HCT [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-chronic-myeloid-leukemia-in-accelerated-phase/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. When compared with imatinib therapy alone, imatinib therapy followed by allogeneic HCT resulted in significantly longer event-free survival (72 versus 39 percent), overall survival (83 versus 51 percent), and progression-free survival (95 versus 48 percent) at six years. Of note, this was an analysis of a heterogeneous mixture of patients and the patients treated with imatinib alone were older, had received more prior treatment, and had higher risk clinical features. Indeed, there was no difference in outcome in a small subset of patients felt to have lower risk disease.</p><p>We suggest transplantation once a maximum response to a TKI has been realized. The rationale for this approach is that success with HCT is most likely in patients with relatively quiescent disease. There are no data comparing continuation of a TKI versus transplantation in the relatively small group of patients in whom a complete cytogenetic response is obtained with TKI treatment. There is concern, however, that if HCT is postponed until a second TKI is required for relapse, the chance of inducing a similar level of response is lower. The studies that have examined the use of TKIs in accelerated disease are discussed in the next section. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hematopoietic-cell-transplantation-in-chronic-myeloid-leukemia\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Hematopoietic cell transplantation in chronic myeloid leukemia&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Patients ineligible for HCT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Among patients with accelerated phase CML who are not candidates for allogeneic HCT, we recommend initial therapy with a TKI. For such patients who respond to a TKI, we recommend continuing the TKI as long as they continue to respond in the hope that the responses will be durable. A detailed discussion on the risk of discontinuing treatment in responding patients is presented separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=initial-treatment-of-chronic-myeloid-leukemia-in-chronic-phase#H13\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Initial treatment of chronic myeloid leukemia in chronic phase&quot;, section on 'Aims of initial therapy and duration of treatment'</a>.)</p><p>There is a paucity of data regarding the choice of TKI to be used as the initial therapy for patients with accelerated phase CML, regardless of whether the patient is a candidate for HCT. In general, we suggest treatment with a second generation TKI (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nilotinib-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">nilotinib</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dasatinib-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">dasatinib</a>) rather than <a href=\"topic.htm?path=imatinib-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">imatinib</a>. This is largely based on extrapolation of data from randomized trials of these agents as initial therapy in patients with chronic phase CML. In these trials, second generation TKIs resulted in faster and deeper responses than imatinib, especially among patients with higher risk chronic phase CML [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-chronic-myeloid-leukemia-in-accelerated-phase/abstract/9-12\" class=\"abstract_t\">9-12</a>]. Given the expected lower response rates in accelerated phase, the greater potency of these agents would be expected to have an even more important role. In addition, second generation TKIs have been proven to induce responses in imatinib-resistant CML, and this resistance is more likely to occur in accelerated phase. A choice among agents should also take into consideration the drug side effect profiles and the patient's comorbidities (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F89930\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef89930 \">table 2</a>). Randomized trials comparing these agents in chronic phase CML are presented separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=initial-treatment-of-chronic-myeloid-leukemia-in-chronic-phase#H8\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Initial treatment of chronic myeloid leukemia in chronic phase&quot;, section on 'Second generation TKIs'</a>.)</p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=imatinib-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Imatinib</a> therapy may be considered for patients in whom second generation TKIs would be cost prohibitive. For patients with accelerated phase CML treated with imatinib, we recommend the use of the 600 mg daily starting dose of imatinib rather than the 400 mg daily starting dose used for patients with chronic phase CML. This is based upon significantly higher response rates and survival at 12 months as noted in a number of studies (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F66546\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef66546 \">figure 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-chronic-myeloid-leukemia-in-accelerated-phase/abstract/13-16\" class=\"abstract_t\">13-16</a>]. As an example, in a phase II trial of imatinib in 200 patients with CML in accelerated phase, 90 percent had a clinical response and 24 percent had a complete cytogenetic response [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-chronic-myeloid-leukemia-in-accelerated-phase/abstract/13-15\" class=\"abstract_t\">13-15</a>]. Drug discontinuation for severe toxicity was needed in 3 percent of patients. A critical part of this study was the comparison of a 400 mg dose (given to the initial cohort of patients) versus a 600 mg daily starting dose, given to the subsequent group of patients. The 600 mg dose had significantly higher rates of complete hematologic response (37 versus 27 percent), complete cytogenetic response (19 versus 11 percent) and survival at 12 months (78 versus 65 percent).</p><p>Prior to the development of TKIs, interferon alfa plus <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cytarabine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cytarabine</a> was used as the initial treatment of choice for patients with CML who were not candidates for transplantation. Treatment of patients in accelerated phase with interferon alfa-based regimens resulted in overall response rates of 20 to 30 percent with rare cytogenetic responses [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-chronic-myeloid-leukemia-in-accelerated-phase/abstract/17,18\" class=\"abstract_t\">17,18</a>]. The randomized IRIS trial demonstrated the superiority of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=imatinib-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">imatinib</a> over interferon plus cytarabine in previously untreated patients with CML in chronic phase [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-chronic-myeloid-leukemia-in-accelerated-phase/abstract/19,20\" class=\"abstract_t\">19,20</a>]. Although no such direct comparison is available for patients in accelerated phase, extrapolation of these results in chronic phase along with historical comparisons in accelerated phase and the results of phase II trials in patients with accelerated phase disease, have led to the use of a TKI as the initial therapy of choice.</p><p>The following is a survey of reports on the use of TKIs in accelerated phase CML [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-chronic-myeloid-leukemia-in-accelerated-phase/abstract/14-16,21,22\" class=\"abstract_t\">14-16,21,22</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A phase II trial of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=imatinib-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">imatinib</a> 600 mg daily in 111 patients with accelerated phase CML (10 percent at diagnosis) with a median follow-up of 82 months reported that 107 patients (96 percent) returned to chronic phase and hematologic, major cytogenetic, and complete cytogenetic responses were attained in 71, 30, and 21 percent, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-chronic-myeloid-leukemia-in-accelerated-phase/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>].

Ponatinib, hematopoietic cell transplant (HCT), or enrollment in a clinical trial would be appropriate choices for such patients.

We suggest that this treatment be followed by an allogeneic HCT in eligible patients.</p><p>Although patient noncompliance is not a common cause of progression in patients with accelerated phase, it is important to ask patients with apparent resistance about their compliance with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=imatinib-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">imatinib</a> dose and schedule and the use of other medications or herbal supplements which may impair the metabolism of the imatinib.

In addition, 10 to 15 percent of patients will initially present in accelerated phase or blast crisis and it is likely that a larger fraction of patients will present in more advanced stages in less medically-developed countries. Treatment of these more advanced phases of CML is difficult. In general, an attempt is made to return the patient to a chronic phase with plans to proceed to allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) after an initial response.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For most patients with newly diagnosed CML in accelerated phase, we recommend initial treatment with a BCR-ABL1 tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) rather than initial HCT (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=1\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1A</a>). For most patients, we suggest treatment with a second generation TKI (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nilotinib-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">nilotinib</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dasatinib-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">dasatinib</a>) rather than <a href=\"topic.htm?path=imatinib-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">imatinib</a> (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). However, for patients who choose initial therapy with imatinib, we recommend imatinib 600 mg by mouth daily rather than 400 mg daily (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=2\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1B</a>). (See <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Initial treatment'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>There are no good data comparing HCT versus continued TKI in patients who demonstrate a deep initial response to TKI therapy. For patients with CML in accelerated phase who are eligible for HCT, we suggest referral for HCT during their treatment with a TKI, including those who achieve a complete cytogenetic response (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). A search for a donor should begin at the time that accelerated phase is diagnosed. We believe proceeding to HCT maximizes the chance of cure. However, patients who wish to minimize short-term morbidity and mortality might choose to defer HCT until after evidence of progression or intolerance to a TKI. Such a relapse would likely require treatment with another TKI prior to HCT. (See <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Patients eligible for HCT'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For responding patients without donors, those who are not suitable for transplantation, and those who refuse transplantation, we recommend continuing a TKI indefinitely in the hope that the responses will be durable (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=1\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1A</a>).
