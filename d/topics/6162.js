More than 50 percent of cases are due to underlying chronic hepatitis B and C virus infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-and-etiologic-associations-of-hepatocellular-carcinoma/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3917879072\"><span class=\"h2\">Time trends</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Liver cancer incidence rates and death rates are increasing in many parts of the world, including North America, Latin America, and central Europe [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-and-etiologic-associations-of-hepatocellular-carcinoma/abstract/1,6-8\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,6-8</a>]. In an analysis of data reported to the National Cancer Institute Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results (SEER) Database of the National Cancer Institute in the US, liver cancer incidence rates increased by 3.1 percent per year from 2008 to 2012 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-and-etiologic-associations-of-hepatocellular-carcinoma/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. The incidence was threefold higher in men compared with women (11.5 versus 3.9 per 100,000). Liver cancer incidence rates increased during this time period among non-Hispanic whites, non-Hispanic blacks, and American <span class=\"nowrap\">Indian/Alaska</span> Natives, but they decreased among non-Hispanic Asians and Pacific Islanders (a trend possibly related to the increasingly widespread vaccination of children against hepatitis B viral infection, the dominant HCC-related virus among <span class=\"nowrap\">Asian/Pacific</span> Islanders). In contrast to the declining death rates seen for all other common cancers (such as lung, breast, and prostate cancers), death rates from liver cancer in men increased by 2.8 percent per year and for women it increased by 3.4 percent per year.</p><p><strong>Year of birth</strong> &mdash; In the United States, a critical risk factor for HCC is hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection (see <a href=\"#H11\" class=\"local\">'Hepatitis C'</a> below). The prevalence of HCV infection is particularly high among individuals born between 1945 and 1965 (approximately 2.5 percent or &gt;2 million individuals, five times the rate among those born in other years). An analysis of multiple causes of death data from the National Center for Health Statistics provides evidence of an increased burden of HCV and liver cancer-associated mortality among this birth cohort [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-and-etiologic-associations-of-hepatocellular-carcinoma/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. Among persons dying between 1999 through 2013, for whom both HCV and liver cancer were listed as causes of death, those born from 1945 through 1965 had the largest increase in mortality from liver cancer and HCV, relative to individuals born before 1945 or after 1965. Based on data, it is expected that HCC rates in this birth cohort will continue to rise, whereas rates among those born after 1965 will begin to decrease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-and-etiologic-associations-of-hepatocellular-carcinoma/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2435467739\"><span class=\"h2\">Geographic variation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The incidence of HCC varies widely according to geographic location (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F50081\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef50081 \">table 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-and-etiologic-associations-of-hepatocellular-carcinoma/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].

These extreme differences in distribution of HCC are probably due to regional variations in exposure to hepatitis viruses and environmental pathogens. As an example, the frequency of hepatitis B virus carriers is relatively high in the high-incidence regions and low in the low-incidence regions. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epidemiology-transmission-and-prevention-of-hepatitis-b-virus-infection\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Epidemiology, transmission, and prevention of hepatitis B virus infection&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>High-incidence regions (more than 15 cases per 100,000 population per year) include sub-Saharan Africa, the People's Republic of China, Hong Kong, and Taiwan [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-and-etiologic-associations-of-hepatocellular-carcinoma/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. The incidence is 24.2 per 100,000 in parts of Africa, and 35.5 per 100,000 in eastern Asia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-and-etiologic-associations-of-hepatocellular-carcinoma/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. Over 40 percent of all cases of HCC occur in the People's Republic of China, which has an annual incidence of 137,000 cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-and-etiologic-associations-of-hepatocellular-carcinoma/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. Japan has had one of the highest incidence rates of HCC associated with chronic HCV infection; however, the incidence appears to be decreasing [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-and-etiologic-associations-of-hepatocellular-carcinoma/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Intermediate-incidence areas include several countries in eastern and Western Europe, Thailand, Indonesia, Jamaica, Haiti, New Zealand (Maoris), and Alaska (Eskimos) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-and-etiologic-associations-of-hepatocellular-carcinoma/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>North and South America, most of Europe, Australia, and parts of the Middle East are low-incidence areas with fewer than three cases reported per 100,000 population per year. However, the incidence in the US has increased during the past two decades, possibly due to a large pool of people with longstanding chronic hepatitis C [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-and-etiologic-associations-of-hepatocellular-carcinoma/abstract/14,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">14,15</a>]. The rate began to accelerate in the mid-1980s, most likely because of the increased incidence of cirrhosis due to chronic HCV infection and nonalcoholic fatty liver disease, combined with a large influx of immigrants from East Asia and other geographic areas with high endemic rates of hepatitis B viral infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-and-etiologic-associations-of-hepatocellular-carcinoma/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Sex and age distribution</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In all parts of the world, men are more likely than women to develop HCC [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-and-etiologic-associations-of-hepatocellular-carcinoma/abstract/1,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,5</a>]. The disparity is more pronounced in high-incidence regions, where men are affected 2.1 to 5.7 times more frequently than women (mean 3.7:1). The ratio decreases to a mean of 2.4:1 in intermediate-incidence areas, and is lower in low-incidence regions. In Northern America, the incidence rates for males and females were 6.8 and 2.2 per 100,000 persons, respectively, in 2008 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-and-etiologic-associations-of-hepatocellular-carcinoma/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. Although not fully understood, the differences in sex distribution are thought to be due to variations in hepatitis carrier states, exposure to environmental toxins, the trophic effect of androgens [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-and-etiologic-associations-of-hepatocellular-carcinoma/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>], <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> potentially protective effects of estrogen mediated through inhibition of interleukin 6 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-and-etiologic-associations-of-hepatocellular-carcinoma/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>].</p><p>The majority of HCCs occur in patients with chronic liver disease or cirrhosis (see <a href=\"#H12\" class=\"local\">'Chronic hepatitis and cirrhosis'</a> below). Thus, older patients with longstanding liver disease are more likely to develop HCC. Several large prospective studies conducted in both Asia and Western Europe have noted a mean age at presentation between 50 and 60 years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-and-etiologic-associations-of-hepatocellular-carcinoma/abstract/19-21\" class=\"abstract_t\">19-21</a>]. In sub-Saharan Africa, however, the mean age of presentation of HCC is decreasing, with a mean age of 33 years at presentation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-and-etiologic-associations-of-hepatocellular-carcinoma/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>].</p><p><strong>Racial and ethnic variations</strong> &mdash; A population-based study in the US identified racial and ethnic variations in the incidence of HCC [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-and-etiologic-associations-of-hepatocellular-carcinoma/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. The incidence was highest among Asians, nearly double that of white Hispanics (11 versus 6.8 per <span class=\"nowrap\">100,000/year)</span> and four times higher than Caucasians (2.6 per <span class=\"nowrap\">100,000/year)</span>. In another database analysis from the US, the incidence rates among <span class=\"nowrap\">Asians/Pacific</span> Islanders (APIs), blacks, Native <span class=\"nowrap\">Americans/Alaska</span> Natives, and whites were 7.8, 4.2, 3.2, and 2.6 per 100,000 persons, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-and-etiologic-associations-of-hepatocellular-carcinoma/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. </p><p>These data support the concept that, compared with other ethnic groups, APIs historically have had the highest HCC rates. However, data from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) program of the National Cancer Institute suggest that HCC incidence rates have begun to decline in this group, and that APIs are projected to have lower rates of HCC compared with Hispanics and blacks over the next 15 years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-and-etiologic-associations-of-hepatocellular-carcinoma/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. Although HCC rates in these groups are expected to remain the highest, HCC rates among whites are expected to increase. Because of this increase, by 2030, HCC rates in white men are projected to exceed those in APIs.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h1\">RISK FACTORS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A variety of important risk factors for the development of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) have been identified. These include hepatitis B viral (HBV) infection, chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection, hereditary hemochromatosis, and cirrhosis of almost any cause [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-and-etiologic-associations-of-hepatocellular-carcinoma/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. Surveillance for HCC is indicated for many patients with disorders that put them at increased risk. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prevention-of-hepatocellular-carcinoma-and-recommendations-for-surveillance-in-adults-with-chronic-liver-disease#H61643912\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Prevention of hepatocellular carcinoma and recommendations for surveillance in adults with chronic liver disease&quot;, section on 'Patients who require surveillance'</a>.)</p><p>At one major referral center in the United States, the most commonly seen risk factors for HCC were HCV infection, alcohol use, and nonalcoholic fatty liver disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-and-etiologic-associations-of-hepatocellular-carcinoma/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. However, HCC can also occur in patients without known risk factors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-and-etiologic-associations-of-hepatocellular-carcinoma/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. The role of HCC surveillance in these disorders is discussed separately.

HCC can develop in patients with chronic HBV, even in the absence of cirrhosis. However, 70 to 90 percent of patients with HBV who develop HCC will have cirrhosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-and-etiologic-associations-of-hepatocellular-carcinoma/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]. Because of the association of HBV with HCC, screening for HCC is recommended for many patients with hepatitis B. (See <a href=\"#H12\" class=\"local\">'Chronic hepatitis and cirrhosis'</a> below and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prevention-of-hepatocellular-carcinoma-and-recommendations-for-surveillance-in-adults-with-chronic-liver-disease#H61643920\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Prevention of hepatocellular carcinoma and recommendations for surveillance in adults with chronic liver disease&quot;, section on 'Hepatitis B carriers'</a>.)</p><p>In addition to cirrhosis, a number of other factors have been associated with the risk of developing HCC among patients with chronic HBV, including the viral load, the presence of hepatitis B e antigen (HBeAg), and the presence of hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H159004431\"><span class=\"h3\">Viral load</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The risk of HCC is much greater in patients with high serum levels of HBV DNA compared with those who have low levels (&lt;10,000 <span class=\"nowrap\">copies/mL)</span> (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F83282\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef83282 \">figure 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-and-etiologic-associations-of-hepatocellular-carcinoma/abstract/32-36\" class=\"abstract_t\">32-36</a>]. One of the largest studies to demonstrate this relationship was a community-based study in Taiwan that included a cohort of 3653 patients enrolled between 1991 and 1992 who were HBsAg positive and anti-HCV negative [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-and-etiologic-associations-of-hepatocellular-carcinoma/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>]. HCC developed in 164 patients (4.5 percent) during a mean follow-up of 11 years. At enrollment, the median age of the HBsAg carriers was 45 years; 85 percent were HBeAg negative, 94 percent had normal alanine aminotransferase (ALT) levels, and 2 percent had cirrhosis. A higher incidence of HCC was associated with HBV DNA level at study entry. For patients with an HBV DNA level &lt;300 copies per mL, there were 108 cases per 100,000 person-years (cumulative incidence 1.3 percent), while for those with an HBV DNA level &gt;1 million <span class=\"nowrap\">copies/mL,</span> there were 1152 cases per 100,000 person-years (cumulative incidence 14.9 percent). The HBV DNA level remained an independent predictor of HCC even after adjusting for covariates known to be associated with HCC, such as sex, age, cigarette smoking, alcohol consumption, HBeAg status, serum ALT level, and the presence of cirrhosis at baseline.</p><p>Most of the subjects in this study likely acquired HBV infection perinatally, and the median age at enrollment was 45 years, suggesting that prolonged high levels of HBV replication might be associated with an increased risk of HCC. However, due to the fluctuating nature of chronic HBV infection, the prognostic value of a single high HBV DNA level is limited. As an example, the risk of HCC in a 20-year-old woman who has a single serum HBV DNA measurement of 1 million <span class=\"nowrap\">copies/mL</span> is likely very different from that of a 50-year-old man with an HBV DNA level of 1 million <span class=\"nowrap\">copies/mL</span> persisting for five decades. Finally, the applicability of these data to HBsAg carriers who acquired HBV as adults is not clear. Currently, it is recommended that patients with high HBV DNA levels and signs of active inflammation (elevated ALT) for several years undergo surveillance for HCC.

One of the largest prospective studies to address this issue included 11,893 Taiwanese men who were tested for HBsAg and HBeAg at enrollment and then followed for approximately 10 years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-and-etiologic-associations-of-hepatocellular-carcinoma/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>]. During follow-up, 111 cases of HCC were detected. The incidence of HCC was significantly higher in patients who were HBsAg and HBeAg positive (1169 per 100,000 patient-years) compared with patients who were only HBsAg positive (324 per 100,000 patient-years) or who were negative for both HBsAg and HBeAg (39 per 100,000 patient-years).

These patients were then compared with patients who had similar characteristics, but were HBsAg negative.

The increased risk of HCC among patients with serologically resolved infection was demonstrated in a study that followed 1271 Alaskan natives with chronic HBV for an average of 20 years. Among patients who cleared their HBV (ie, became HBsAg negative), the incidence of HCC was lower than that of those who remained HBsAg positive (37 versus 196 per 100,000 person-years), but still higher than among the general population [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-and-etiologic-associations-of-hepatocellular-carcinoma/abstract/46\" class=\"abstract_t\">46</a>].

However, in up to 10 percent of patients with HCV infection who undergo resection for HCC, only mild degrees of fibrosis are found [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-and-etiologic-associations-of-hepatocellular-carcinoma/abstract/74\" class=\"abstract_t\">74</a>].</p><p>In a prospective cohort study that followed 23,820 residents of Taiwan between the ages of 30 and 65, the cumulative lifetime incidence of HCC for patients with HCV alone was 24 percent for men and 17 percent for women [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-and-etiologic-associations-of-hepatocellular-carcinoma/abstract/52\" class=\"abstract_t\">52</a>]. Patients who were also positive for hepatitis B surface antigen had a cumulative incidence of 38 percent for men and 27 percent for women. Among patients with HCV, the differences in HCC rates between men and women were not significantly different. In addition, higher viral loads were associated with an increased risk of HCC. A 186-gene signature on gene expression profile analysis has also been associated with an increased risk of HCC among patients with HCV and Child-Pugh class A cirrhosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-and-etiologic-associations-of-hepatocellular-carcinoma/abstract/75\" class=\"abstract_t\">75</a>].</p><p>It is generally believed that HCC arises in the setting of rapid cellular turnover and the chronic inflammatory state induced by the hepatitis C virus. One theory is that there is an imbalance in the microenvironments and cytokines of livers infected with the hepatitis C virus, leading to increased inflammation and cell turnover, which ultimately causes cirrhosis. Poorly differentiated hepatocytes likely proliferate and develop into dysplastic nodules and HCC [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-and-etiologic-associations-of-hepatocellular-carcinoma/abstract/76\" class=\"abstract_t\">76</a>]. In support of this hypothesis is the observation that HCV-induced HCC correlates well with the degree of inflammation and necrosis, and seems to be caused by inflammation rather than specific oncogene activation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-and-etiologic-associations-of-hepatocellular-carcinoma/abstract/77,78\" class=\"abstract_t\">77,78</a>]. By contrast, hepatitis B-related HCC, does not correlate as well with inflammation, and there appear to be specific oncogenes induced by the virus that result in an increased risk of HCC.</p><p>The degree of inflammation in the liver of patients with HCV also correlates with prognosis once HCC is diagnosed. Several oxidative stress and inflammation markers, including CD68+ cells, 8-hydroxydeoxyguanosine (8-OHdG) DNA adducts, and 4-hydroxynonenal (HNE) protein adducts, have been examined in noncancerous liver tissue in patients who had both HCV and HCC [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-and-etiologic-associations-of-hepatocellular-carcinoma/abstract/79\" class=\"abstract_t\">79</a>].

As an example, in an Italian case control study that included 464 subjects with HCC and 824 controls, there was a linear increase in the odds ratio of HCC for increasing alcohol intake over 60 grams daily, which was further increased by a factor of two in patients infected with either HBV or HCV [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-and-etiologic-associations-of-hepatocellular-carcinoma/abstract/122\" class=\"abstract_t\">122</a>].</p><p>Excessive alcohol consumption is an established, potentially modifiable risk factor for several other malignancies in addition to HCC, and it also complicates treatment and treatment outcomes by contributing to longer hospitalizations, prolonged recovery, higher health care costs, and greater overall and cancer-related mortality. The American Society of Clinical Oncology has issued a statement on the association of alcohol consumption with multiple cancers, that outlines proposals for: promoting awareness of the association between alcohol abuse and certain types of cancer; supporting policy efforts to reduce the risk of cancer through evidence-based strategies that prevent excessive use of alcohol; and providing education to oncology providers about the influence of excessive alcohol use on cancer risk and treatment complications [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-and-etiologic-associations-of-hepatocellular-carcinoma/abstract/131\" class=\"abstract_t\">131</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14\"><span class=\"h2\">Diabetes mellitus</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Epidemiologic studies suggest a possible link between diabetes mellitus and HCC [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-and-etiologic-associations-of-hepatocellular-carcinoma/abstract/132-140\" class=\"abstract_t\">132-140</a>], and multiple systemic reviews and meta-analyses have also found an association [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-and-etiologic-associations-of-hepatocellular-carcinoma/abstract/141-143\" class=\"abstract_t\">141-143</a>]. A systematic review that included a total of 49 case-control and cohort studies estimated that the risk was increased by approximately 2.2-fold (risk ratio 2.2; 95% CI 1.7-3.0), although few studies adjusted for diet and obesity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-and-etiologic-associations-of-hepatocellular-carcinoma/abstract/141\" class=\"abstract_t\">141</a>]. A meta-analysis of 14 prospective epidemiologic studies also found an increased risk of HCC among patients with diabetes (relative risk 1.9; 95% CI 1.2-2.3) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-and-etiologic-associations-of-hepatocellular-carcinoma/abstract/142\" class=\"abstract_t\">142</a>]. In addition, a study found that the presence of the metabolic syndrome (defined by the presence of three of the following: elevated waist <span class=\"nowrap\">circumference/central</span> obesity, dyslipidemia, hypertension, and impaired fasting glucose) was a risk factor for HCC (adjusted odds ratio 2.1) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-and-etiologic-associations-of-hepatocellular-carcinoma/abstract/144\" class=\"abstract_t\">144</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H4036354322\" class=\"local\">'Obesity'</a> below.)</p><p>A large population-based cohort study confirmed the findings of the systematic review and meta-analysis.

The incidence of HCC was significantly higher among patients with diabetes compared with those without diabetes (21.0 versus 10.4 per 10,000 person-years), with an adjusted hazard ratio [HR] of 1.7 (95% CI 1.5-2.0). The use of a thiazolidinedione or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=metformin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">metformin</a> was associated with a decreased risk of HCC among patients with diabetes (adjusted HR 0.56 and 0.49, respectively). </p><p>However, associations between diabetes and HCC should be interpreted with caution. In many cases, the onset of glucose intolerance results from the development of cirrhosis, so &quot;diabetes&quot; in this context may be a surrogate for cirrhosis, which increases the risk of HCC. In addition, many patients with diabetes also have nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), which has also been associated with an increased risk of HCC.</p><p>Whether the use of antidiabetic medications alters the risk of HCC has been evaluated in a meta-analysis of 10 studies with 334,307 patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-and-etiologic-associations-of-hepatocellular-carcinoma/abstract/145\" class=\"abstract_t\">145</a>].

Thiazolidinedione (four studies) use was not associated with the risk of HCC, whereas sulfonylurea (eight studies) or insulin (seven studies) use was associated with an increased risk of HCC (OR 1.62 and 2.61, respectively). However, these results should be viewed with caution because there was considerable heterogeneity among the studies included in the analysis. In addition, a post-hoc analysis of randomized trials that was included with the meta-analysis failed to show an association of antidiabetic medication use and the risk of HCC. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9507724\"><span class=\"h2\">Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There is growing evidence that NAFLD represents an increasingly frequent underlying liver disease in patients with HCC [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-and-etiologic-associations-of-hepatocellular-carcinoma/abstract/146-150\" class=\"abstract_t\">146-150</a>].
