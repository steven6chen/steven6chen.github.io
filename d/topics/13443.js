Muscle pain that gets worse with activity and better with rest is called &quot;claudication.&quot; PAD affects the blood vessels (called arteries) that bring blood to the legs. PAD can also cause wounds to heal more slowly than usual. This article is only about the leg pain related to PAD.</p><p>Normally, blood flows easily through arteries to all parts of the body. But sometimes, fatty clumps called &quot;plaques&quot; build up inside the walls of arteries (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F60105\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef60105 \">figure 1</a>). Plaques can cause arteries to become narrow or blocked. This prevents blood from flowing normally. When muscles do not get enough blood, symptoms can occur.</p><p>Some people have a greater chance of getting PAD, such as those who:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Smoke</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Have diabetes</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Have high cholesterol</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Have high blood pressure</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1481812166\"><span class=\"h1\">What are the symptoms of PAD?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>PAD often causes pain in the back of the lower leg. The pain usually gets worse with walking or other exercise, and gets better with rest. PAD can also cause pain in the buttocks, thighs, or sometimes in the feet. People who have leg pain can have other symptoms, too, such as:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Trouble walking up stairs</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Trouble getting an erection (in men) or trouble with sexual arousal (in women)</p><p/><p>Symptoms of claudication can be mild or severe, depending on:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Which arteries are affected</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>How narrow the arteries are</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>How much activity a person does</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1481812173\"><span class=\"h1\">Is there a test for PAD?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Yes. Your doctor or nurse can do different tests to find out if you have PAD, and to check how severe it is. He or she might:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Take the blood pressure in your arm and lower leg (just above the ankle) at rest and right after exercise, and compare them</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Take the blood pressure in other places in your leg (like the thigh) </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Order a blood vessel imaging test such as an ultrasound, which can show pictures of your leg arteries</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1481812180\"><span class=\"h1\">How can I help treat my PAD?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>To help treat your PAD and prevent it from getting worse, you can:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Stop smoking</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Get your diabetes, high blood pressure, and high cholesterol under control (if you have these conditions)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Walking &ndash; Doctors recommend that most people with PAD walk every day. Ask your doctor or nurse how best to begin a walking program.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1481812187\"><span class=\"h1\">What other treatments might I have?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Along with a walking program and getting medical conditions under control, some people are also treated with medicines. The medicines used to treat PAD can reduce symptoms, increase blood flow to the legs, and help people walk farther without pain. Most doctors ask their patients to try a medicine called <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cilostazol-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">cilostazol</a> (brand name: Pletal). But people who have certain heart problems cannot take cilostazol and must take a different medicine.</p><p>If you still have severe symptoms after trying medicines, your doctor will talk with you about the possibility of having surgery or a procedure to increase blood flow to your legs and feet. Your treatment options might include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Angioplasty or stenting &ndash; During angioplasty or stenting, the doctor sends a thin tube with a balloon at the end of it to the part of the artery that is blocked. Then the doctor inflates the balloon to open the blockage. Often the doctor props open the artery using a tiny mesh tube called a stent, which stays in the body. Some special balloons and stents also release medicine to help the artery stay open longer.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Bypass surgery &ndash; During bypass surgery, the doctor removes a piece of blood vessel (vein) from another part of the body. Then he or she reattaches that piece of blood vessel (called a vein graft) above and below the area that is clogged. This re-routes blood around the clog, and allows it to get to the part of the leg that was not getting enough blood. Sometimes instead of taking a graft from another part of the body, the doctor can use a man-made graft.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1481812194\"><span class=\"h1\">What should I know about the different procedures?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Angioplasty and stenting are used to treat 1 or 2 blocked areas that are short. Surgery works best to treat many or longer blocked areas. People who have the fewest long-term problems after bypass surgery include those who are younger than 70, do not have diabetes, and do not have PAD below the knee.</p><p>Your doctor might recommend a procedure for you, depending on your symptoms, age, and medical problems. But many people can choose which procedure to have. If your doctor offers you a choice, ask:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>What are the benefits of each procedure for me?</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>What are the downsides of each procedure for me?</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>What happens if I do not have any procedure?</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1481812201\"><span class=\"h1\">More on this topic</span></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=type-2-diabetes-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Type 2 diabetes (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=quitting-smoking-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Quitting smoking (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=high-blood-pressure-in-adults-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: High blood pressure in adults (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=high-cholesterol-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: High cholesterol (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=doppler-ultrasound-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Doppler ultrasound (The Basics)</a></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=peripheral-artery-disease-and-claudication-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Peripheral artery disease and claudication (Beyond the Basics)</a></p></div><div id=\"reviewProcess\"><span>All topics are updated as new evidence becomes available and our <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/home/editorial-policy\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"policy policy_editorialpolicy\">peer review process</a> is complete.</span></div><div id=\"topicRetrievedDate\"><span class=\"emphasis\">This topic retrieved from UpToDate on: </span>Apr 03, 2018.</div><div id=\"disclaimer\">The content on the UpToDate website is not intended nor recommended as a substitute for medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.
