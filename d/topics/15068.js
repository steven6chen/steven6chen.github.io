Patients with diabetes mellitus and end-organ damage had a 36 percent increased risk over patients without diabetes. No increased risk was found for patients with diabetes and no end-organ damage.</p><p>Based on data from one clinic, alcohol consumption and higher levels of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol were protective factors for BRVO [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/retinal-vein-occlusion-epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. Alcohol consumption and increased physical activity were protective factors for CRVO [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/retinal-vein-occlusion-epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7614363\"><span class=\"h1\">PATHOPHYSIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Many features of the pathophysiology of retinal vein occlusion (RVO) have been elucidated through autopsy and enucleation specimens [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/retinal-vein-occlusion-epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/9-13\" class=\"abstract_t\">9-13</a>]. Whereas branch retinal vein occlusion (BRVO) appears to be related to compression of the branch vein by retinal arterioles at the arteriovenous crossing points, central retinal vein occlusion (CRVO) is usually associated with primary thrombus formation.</p><p>Autopsy specimens of eyes with BRVO demonstrate a relative blockage of retinal veins at arteriovenous crossings and associated sclerotic retinal arterioles [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/retinal-vein-occlusion-epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. It has been hypothesized that an inflexible, sclerotic arteriole deforms the relatively distensible veins that are contained in an inelastic arteriovenous sheath. Several studies have suggested that BRVO is correlated with the relative anteroposterior position of the retinal artery and vein [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/retinal-vein-occlusion-epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/10-12\" class=\"abstract_t\">10-12</a>]. In one series of 106 eyes with BRVO, for example, all cases showed the site of the retinal vein obstruction was at an arteriovenous crossing, and in 99 percent of eyes the artery was anterior to the vein [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/retinal-vein-occlusion-epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. By contrast, the artery was anterior to the vein only 60 percent of the time in subjects without BRVO [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/retinal-vein-occlusion-epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>].</p><p>In a histopathologic study of eyes in patients with CRVO, thrombus consisting of fibrin and platelets in the central retinal vein was observed in those with recent onset of CRVO [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/retinal-vein-occlusion-epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. Recanalization of the thrombus was noted in eyes examined after CRVO had been present for more than two weeks.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7614371\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL MANIFESTATIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Some patients with branch retinal vein occlusion (BRVO) are asymptomatic and are diagnosed on routine ophthalmologic examination. Alternatively, patients may describe a scotoma or visual field deficit with blurred or gray vision corresponding to the area of retinal vein occlusion (RVO). Patients with BRVO involving the macula typically complain of blurred central vision.</p><p>Patients with central retinal vein occlusion (CRVO) usually complain of the acute onset of painless blurred vision in one eye. CRVO is seldom asymptomatic.

Neovascularization of the iris <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> neovascularization of the anterior chamber angle can lead to the development of neovascular glaucoma. In addition to decreased vision, these patients may complain of a red, painful eye secondary to elevated intraocular pressure.

Patients with macular edema from BRVO may experience spontaneous vision improvement in the first three months after onset of symptoms. After three months, the likelihood of spontaneous improvement in visual acuity diminishes. Three-year visual acuity outcomes in untreated eyes with BRVO-associated macular edema and visual acuity of <span class=\"nowrap\">20/40</span> or worse at three months is as follows: 34 percent with visual acuity of <span class=\"nowrap\">20/40</span> or better, 23 percent with visual acuity of <span class=\"nowrap\">20/200</span> or worse, and an average visual acuity of <span class=\"nowrap\">20/70</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/retinal-vein-occlusion-epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>].</p><p>Patients with central retinal vein occlusion (CRVO) have worse outcomes, with final visual acuity dependent upon visual acuity at presentation. The Central Retinal Vein Occlusion Study followed 725 patients with CRVO over three years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/retinal-vein-occlusion-epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. Two-thirds of patients who presented with visual acuity <span class=\"nowrap\">&ge;20/40</span> maintained visual acuity in the same range, and only 10 percent had worsening of visual acuity to <span class=\"nowrap\">&lt;20/200</span>. Among patients who presented with visual acuity <span class=\"nowrap\">20/50</span> to <span class=\"nowrap\">20/200,</span> nearly half maintained visual acuity in the same range and one-third progressed to a visual acuity <span class=\"nowrap\">&lt;20/200</span>. Only 20 percent of patients with initial visual acuity <span class=\"nowrap\">&lt;20/200</span> had some improvement in vision. Patients with ischemic CRVO are at high risk for poor visual acuity at initial presentation and over the long-term, compared with those with non-ischemic CRVO [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/retinal-vein-occlusion-epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7614396\"><span class=\"h2\">Ocular neovascularization</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Neovascularization of the iris (NVI), neovascularization of the anterior chamber angle (NVA), and retina are common complications of both CRVO and BRVO, although <span class=\"nowrap\">NVI/NVA</span> occur more commonly in CRVO. In the Central Retinal Vein Occlusion Study, <span class=\"nowrap\">NVI/NVA</span> developed in 16 percent of patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/retinal-vein-occlusion-epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>].

Vitreous hemorrhage may produce visual disturbances such as severe floaters and intermittent visual obscurations. Development of neovascular glaucoma may result in significant ocular morbidity, such as pain, chronic ocular redness, unremitting intraocular pressure elevation, and profound visual loss that is often unresponsive to anti-glaucoma drops or surgery. <span class=\"nowrap\">NVI/NVI</span> are considered harbingers of neovascular glaucoma and are most likely to occur in eyes with ischemic CRVO.

A retrospective cohort study of 4500 patients with RVO and 13500 control patients suggested no increased risk of myocardial infarction in patients with RVO but a higher risk of stroke (relative risk [RR] 1.7, 95% CI 1.3-2.3) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/retinal-vein-occlusion-epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. In one large population-based study (age 43 to 86 years), RVO was not associated with cardiovascular-related mortality or cerebrovascular-related mortality [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/retinal-vein-occlusion-epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. However, in persons 70 years or younger, baseline RVO was associated with higher cardiovascular mortality after adjusting for known risk factors and comorbidities (hazard ratio [HR] 2.5, 95% CI 1.2-5.2) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/retinal-vein-occlusion-epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7614411\"><span class=\"h1\">DIAGNOSTIC EVALUATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The evaluation of retinal vein occlusion (RVO), like other retinal diseases, begins with the history and a complete ophthalmologic examination. Other testing such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fluorescein-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">fluorescein</a> angiography and coherence tomography may be performed to confirm the diagnosis, assess retinal capillary nonperfusion, and follow disease progression or response to treatment.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7614419\"><span class=\"h2\">History</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Although the diagnosis is based primarily on eye examination and other diagnostic studies, a history is important for documenting the patient's symptomatic visual loss and presence of other comorbid conditions.</p><p>The history should include the timing and severity of visual loss. Patients with branch retinal vein occlusion (BRVO) may have no complaints but may complain of blurred vision if the macula is involved. Patients with central retinal vein occlusion (CRVO) often report sudden, unilateral loss of vision.</p><p>Associated symptoms including pain or systemic symptoms are unusual in RVO. A history of other comorbid conditions should be documented, particularly cardiovascular risk factors that may predispose to RVO.

This also includes confrontational visual fields, slit-lamp examination, testing for visual acuity, and a dilated fundoscopic examination.</p><p>Findings in patients with BRVO are largely normal, except for the fundoscopic examination and testing of visual acuity.</p><p>In patients with CRVO, pupillary examination can be normal but typically demonstrates ipsilateral relative afferent pupillary defect in cases of nonperfused CRVO. Confrontational visual field deficits are variable. Anterior slit lamp examination is usually normal in the acute phase. The fundoscopic examination shows typical findings. Intraocular pressure is unaffected in the acute phase, prior to development of neovascularization of the angle (NVA).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7614433\"><span class=\"h3\">Visual acuity</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Visual acuity should be documented at each visit to assess RVO progression <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> response to treatment. Assessment of visual acuity is discussed in detail elsewhere.

Variable amounts of retinal edema are present within this region. The distribution corresponds to the area that is served by the affected retinal vein. There may also be venous dilatation radiating from the arteriovenous crossing (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F53326\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef53326 \">image 1</a>).</p><p>In patients with CRVO, the retinal hemorrhage is scattered and diffuse, with optic disc edema in some patients. The classic appearance of CRVO has been termed &quot;blood and thunder&quot; fundus. Dilated and tortuous veins are visualized. All four quadrants have intraretinal hemorrhages (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F66675\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef66675 \">picture 2</a>).

In the acute phase, the fluorescein angiogram may reveal delayed venous filling, staining of affected retinal veins, and angiographic macular leakage. In patients in whom the diagnosis of RVO is clear on the basis of ophthalmoscopic findings alone and the area of fundus involvement is small (eg, less than 10 disk areas), the impact of performing fluorescein angiography on visual outcome is unclear.</p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=fluorescein-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Fluorescein</a> angiography may be useful if photocoagulation therapy is being considered.

A disk area represents the surface area of the optic nerve head. In this scheme, cases with &lt;10 disk areas of capillary nonperfusion are classified as &quot;perfused CRVO,&quot; and cases with &ge;10 disk areas of capillary nonperfusion are classified as &quot;nonperfused CRVO.&quot; Cases of CRVO where the extent of capillary nonperfusion cannot be determined due to extensive intraretinal hemorrhage are classified as &quot;indeterminant&quot; [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/retinal-vein-occlusion-epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].

It helps document the presence of collateral vessels, which divert blood from the retinal circulation to the choroidal circulation. These vessels are larger caliber than neovascularization and do not leak in late frames of the angiogram.

They found a modest association with factor V Leiden (odds ratio [OR] 1.7, 95% CI 1.2-2.3) and no association with activated protein C resistance.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>In another meta-analysis evaluating several other thrombophilic factors, hyperhomocysteinemia (OR 8.9, 95% CI 5.7-13.7) and anticardiolipin antibody (OR 3.9, 95% CI 2.3-6.7) were the only factors associated with an increased risk of RVO [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/retinal-vein-occlusion-epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A subsequent prospective case-control study also found that patients with RVO were more likely than controls to have hyperhomocysteinemia (OR 5.2, 95% CI 2.7-10.1) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/retinal-vein-occlusion-epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>].

In patients determined to have a high-risk hypercoagulable state, anticoagulation guided by a hematologist should be considered although evidence to support this practice is lacking.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7614470\"><span class=\"h1\">SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Retinal vein occlusion (RVO) is an important cause of visual loss worldwide. (See <a href=\"#H7614493\" class=\"local\">'Epidemiology'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The classification of RVO is based on the site of retinal vein involvement. Branch retinal vein occlusion (BRVO) occurs when a vein in the distal retinal venous system is occluded, leading to blockage of a relatively small portion of the retina. Central retinal vein occlusion (CRVO) occurs due to thrombus within the central retinal vein, leading to involvement of the entire retina. (See <a href=\"#H7614340\" class=\"local\">'Classification'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients with BRVO may be asymptomatic and detected on routine eye examination. Occasionally, patients with BRVO will describe a visual field deficit with blurred or gray vision corresponding to the area of RVO. If the macula is affected, patients with BRVO may complain of blurred vision. Patients with CRVO usually complain of the acute onset of painless blurred vision. (See <a href=\"#H7614371\" class=\"local\">'Clinical manifestations'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The evaluation of RVO includes a history and a complete ophthalmic examination. Important components of the ophthalmic examination include visual acuity and dilated fundus examination looking for hemorrhage, edema, and dilatation of the retinal veins. Other testing such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fluorescein-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">fluorescein</a> angiogram and coherence tomography may be performed to confirm the diagnosis and follow disease progression or response to treatment. (See <a href=\"#H7614411\" class=\"local\">'Diagnostic evaluation'</a> above.)</p></div><div id=\"topicAgreement\">Use of UpToDate is subject to the <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/legal/license\" class=\"licenseLink\" id=\"sla_in_page\">Subscription and License Agreement</a>.</div><div id=\"references\" class=\"headingAnchor\"><h1>REFERENCES</h1><ol id=\"reference\"><li><a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/retinal-vein-occlusion-epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/1\" class=\"nounderline abstract_t\">Rogers S, McIntosh RL, Cheung N, et al.
