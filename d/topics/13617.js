This is attributed to longer life expectancies, decreasing fertility rates, and aging of the baby boomer population.

Numbers of adults over age 85 will also reach unprecedented levels.

These changes can have considerable impact on the ability to perform daily activities. By age alone, a healthy 80-year-old woman might be very close to the strength threshold necessary to rise from an armless chair or toilet [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/physical-activity-and-exercise-in-older-adults/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].</p><p>Aerobic capacity declines at about 1 percent per year from mid-life forward and at one-half that rate among habitually active persons [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/physical-activity-and-exercise-in-older-adults/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. Loss of muscle mass and strength are also thought to accelerate after mid-life. In a study of 1880 older men and women, both men and women lost knee strength over a three-year period [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/physical-activity-and-exercise-in-older-adults/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].

Lean-mass loss was about 1 percent per year but was accompanied by losses in strength ranging from 2.6 percent among white women to 4.1 percent among African-American men.</p><p>Thus, there is an imperative to encourage physical activity in the older population and to place emphasis on incorporating muscle-strengthening activities into an activity plan.

All older adults can benefit from physical activity; in the presence of chronic conditions, some physical activity is better than none, and participation in any amount of physical activity will result in some health benefit [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/physical-activity-and-exercise-in-older-adults/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>].

It is suggested that inquiry about physical activity be part of routine assessment (a &ldquo;vital sign&rdquo;) at each medical visit, to endorse the importance of activity as a preventive health measure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/physical-activity-and-exercise-in-older-adults/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>].</p><p>Specific recommendations for exercise fall into four categories:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Aerobic exercise</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Muscle strengthening</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Flexibility</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Balance</p><p/><p>In the United States, there is some public awareness of the physical activity guidelines recommending 30 minutes of aerobic exercise on five or more days of the week. However, it is not widely recognized by either the public or clinicians that this guideline is considered a minimum recommendation. Additional health benefits are gained by engaging in physical activity beyond the suggested 30 minutes and by avoiding inactivity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/physical-activity-and-exercise-in-older-adults/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>].</p><p>Even fewer older adults are knowledgeable about the other recommended components of the physical activity plan, and the prevalence of older adults performing activities to address muscle strengthening, flexibility, and balance is low. Although the prevalence of strength training has increased the most among older adults, older adults still perform strength training far below desired levels, with only 11 percent of women and 14 percent of men over age 65 reporting any strength training [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/physical-activity-and-exercise-in-older-adults/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4894184\"><span class=\"h2\">Aerobic exercise</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>By definition, aerobic exercise involves the use of large muscle groups and must be sustained for a minimum of 10 minutes. Examples of aerobic activities include brisk walking, jogging, swimming, water aerobics, tennis, golf without use of a cart, aerobic exercise classes, dancing, bicycle riding, and use of &quot;cardio&quot; equipment (eg, elliptical machines, stair climbing machines, stationary bicycles, and treadmills).</p><p>Guidelines from the AHA and the ACSM suggest a minimum of 30 minutes of moderate-intensity aerobic activity on five days each week, or a minimum of 20 minutes of vigorous-intensity activity on three days each week, or some combination of the two [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/physical-activity-and-exercise-in-older-adults/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. Exceeding the recommended minimum amount of physical activity will lead to greater health benefits. The recommended guidelines for aerobic activities are considered to be in addition to self-care activities normally conducted throughout the day such as cleaning, bathing, walking to the car, or doing errands.</p><p>Definitions for moderate and vigorous activity depend on the person's baseline conditioning and are based on a perceived relative exertion of effort. (See <a href=\"#H4894192\" class=\"local\">'Assessing intensity of effort'</a> below.)</p><p>Some tips for implementing aerobic activity for older adults are as follows:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Activities do not have to be done at one time but can be spread throughout the day in shorter time allotments. For example, an individual can take three brisk, 10-minute walks per day.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The minimal 150 minutes of moderate-intensity physical activity per week may be insufficient for weight loss for overweight or obese individuals. Older adults who are overweight may need the equivalent of 300 minutes per week of moderate-intensity physical activity to adequately manage weight control, in conjunction with an appropriate diet [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/physical-activity-and-exercise-in-older-adults/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Individuals with chronic disabling conditions may not be able to achieve the minimal recommended amount of physical activity but should be as physically active as can be achieved without harm. Many months at levels below the recommended minimum guidelines may be appropriate for certain individuals. An emphasis on reducing sedentary behavior (to sit less, move more) and adding light activity, such as short walks, may be more reasonable goals for many older adults, who are unable or unlikely to adopt more intensive exercise prescriptions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/physical-activity-and-exercise-in-older-adults/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4894192\"><span class=\"h3\">Assessing intensity of effort</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A major difference in the physical activity guidelines for aerobic activities between younger and older adults is in how intensity of effort is assessed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/physical-activity-and-exercise-in-older-adults/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. For younger adults, intensity of effort is assessed in absolute terms by estimating the actual metabolic cost of a given activity and assigning intensity accordingly [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/physical-activity-and-exercise-in-older-adults/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>]. A metabolic equivalent (MET) is an estimate of oxygen consumed at rest. A three-MET activity would be an activity that utilizes roughly three times the amount of resting energy expenditure. Activities between three to six METs are considered moderate, and activities greater than six METs are considered vigorous. Typically, METs are determined by measurement of oxygen consumption during a given activity; METs levels for a wide range of physical and occupational activities are published, but these have largely been derived from measurement among younger adults [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/physical-activity-and-exercise-in-older-adults/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>]. By contrast, older adults have a reduced range of functional capacity and tremendous heterogeneity of fitness levels. Thus, the use of absolute MET values for estimating intensity of effort is inappropriate because an activity that requires four METS of energy expenditure may be low for one older adult but near maximum capacity for another. Thus, for older adults, intensity of effort is best based on a relative scale.</p><p>Estimates of exercise intensity for older adults may best be based upon a relative scale of required effort. Using a scale of 0 to 10, with 0 considered the amount of effort used while sitting and 10 considered the greatest effort possible, moderate-intensity activity would be defined between 5 and 6 and should produce a noticeable increase in breathing and heart rate, while 7 and 8 would indicate vigorous intensity and should produce a large increase in breathing and heart rate. A good rule of thumb for moderate to vigorous aerobic activity is that the individual should be able to carry on a conversation during activity; if the person cannot sustain a conversation, the effort is too high. In communicating to a patient the intensity of exercise they should aim to achieve, intensity effort should be scaled linearly to a physiologic response. Sensory input reflecting effort may be useful (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F65051\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef65051 \">figure 1</a>).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H96786693\"><span class=\"h2\">Muscle strengthening</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Activities to maintain and increase muscle strength include weight training, weightbearing calisthenics, or resistance training. Development of muscle strength and muscle endurance is progressive and requires gradual increases in strengthening activities over time.</p><p>Muscle-strengthening activities should be done a minimum of two non-consecutive days of the week and should target 8 to 10 major muscle groups (abdomen, bilateral arms, legs, shoulders, and hips). There is no recommended time for muscle-strengthening activities; individuals should strive to perform 10 to 15 repetitions of each exercise at a moderate to high level of intensity and gradually increase resistance over time.

This plan should be individualized, with recommended levels of physical activity and specific instructions for how the individual will meet each recommended type of activity. The plan should specify what, how, when, where, and how often each activity will be done. For adults who are not active at recommended levels, the plan should include a progressive and stepwise approach to increase physical activity. While recommendations for older adults with no limiting chronic conditions target a minimum of 150 minutes a week of moderate-intensity aerobic physical activity, or 75 minutes weekly of vigorous-intensity aerobic physical activity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/physical-activity-and-exercise-in-older-adults/abstract/48\" class=\"abstract_t\">48</a>], even less-vigorous exercise has a mortality benefit in older adults [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/physical-activity-and-exercise-in-older-adults/abstract/49\" class=\"abstract_t\">49</a>].</p><p>A single activity plan should integrate therapeutic and prevention activities for specific conditions. Developing an activity plan, particularly for older adults with chronic conditions, may warrant input from physical <span class=\"nowrap\">therapists/exercise</span> physiologists or referral to specialty programs (eg, cardiac or pulmonary rehabilitation) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F82111\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef82111 \">table 2</a>). In particular, individuals who have difficulty performing basic self-care tasks would likely benefit from a physical <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> occupational therapy intervention prior to transitioning to a physical activity program. Very deconditioned persons might benefit from working with an exercise professional as they begin a new exercise program.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4894206\"><span class=\"h2\">Initiating exercise</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The American Heart Association <span class=\"nowrap\">(AHA)/American</span> College of Sports Medicine (ACSM) guidelines emphasize a graduated or stepwise introduction of physical activity to improve safety and adherence. Routine testing by either electrocardiogram (ECG) or cardiac exercise testing is not indicated for asymptomatic adults who are preparing to undergo a physical activity program. While both the AHA and ACSM endorse the statement that &quot;exercise testing may be considered for previously sedentary older individuals who are planning to begin a vigorous exercise program,&quot; this is rarely relevant because sedentary older adults should not begin a vigorous exercise program. Sedentary adults should begin moderate exercise programs and gradually progress to vigorous activity if desired and as tolerated. Thus, exercise testing should not be a barrier to initiating an exercise program for most patients, but it is indicated for individuals who have active symptoms, known coronary artery disease, or are at high risk for coronary disease based on multiple risk factors, such as in patients with diabetes mellitus who also have macrovascular disease (eg, peripheral or carotid artery disease).

Given the prevalence of chronic conditions that increase with age, it is likely 50 percent of patients with diabetes will also have arthritis and 30 percent will have coronary disease. The ACSM's initiative, Exercise is Medicine, has prepared a library of patient handouts with specific exercise prescriptions for a wide variety of specific health problems (eg, Alzheimer disease, atrial fibrillation, peripheral arterial disease). These handouts are available at <a href=\"http://www.exerciseismedicine.org/assets/page_documents/YPH_All.pdf&amp;token=Yjz7eOReGpFqWG1YnupQFkno43yc+vWd9kUsBa16pnfbKyWg7N6PfItunCc/HILv57EOFxaTmAq7kwOtjxlmiPBmbLZtjYwyvBoHdDABsE4=&amp;TOPIC_ID=16524\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">www.exerciseismedicine.org/assets/page_documents/YPH_All.pdf</a>.</p><p>Careful consideration should be given to symptoms that may become aggravated with initiation of physical activity. Thus, while it is easiest to recommend that a diabetic patient initiate a walking program, adherence is unlikely if walking exacerbates knee pain due to arthritis. Alternative activities, such as non-weightbearing activities (stationary cycling) or water walking, should thus be considered and discussed with the patient. Progression should be gradual over time.</p><p>The most challenging comorbidity is cognitive impairment when it is concurrent with a disease requiring substantial self-management, such as diabetes.

Strengthening activities should start at a relatively low intensity and gradually progress as pain tolerates. Maintaining flexibility and full range of motion in affected joints should be encouraged. Additional exercise recommendations for patients with osteoarthritis are presented separately.</p><p>Physical activity should be avoided during periods of acute flares. Patients should be advised that although they may experience discomfort during or following physical activity, further damage to the joint should not occur. Icing the affected area for 10 minutes following physical activity will provide symptom relief and can prevent inflammation.</p><p>Activity should be moderated if pain persists.

The primary care setting would appear to be a good venue for health promotion because most older adults visit their primary care provider more than once a year. Primary care clinicians should emphasize the importance of physical activity for health maintenance, ask patients if they are physically active, and advise patients to become physically active. However, most observational studies and randomized trials have found conflicting results on whether usual counseling in a primary care setting is sufficient to effect behavioral change [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/physical-activity-and-exercise-in-older-adults/abstract/58,59\" class=\"abstract_t\">58,59</a>].</p><p>The US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) has no specific recommendation for behavioral counseling for physical activity for older adults. An updated systematic review for the USPSTF found that moderate to intensive counseling by a trained health educator was associated with small improvements in secondary outcomes (weight, blood pressure, lipids) and self-reported physical activity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/physical-activity-and-exercise-in-older-adults/abstract/60\" class=\"abstract_t\">60</a>]. The USPSTF recommends that clinicians may choose to selectively counsel patients based on other considerations such as risk factors, readiness for change, social support, and other health care priorities [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/physical-activity-and-exercise-in-older-adults/abstract/61\" class=\"abstract_t\">61</a>].

Minimal recommendations advise moderate intensity aerobic activity for 30 minutes on five days each week or vigorous activity on three days each week. Moderate or vigorous intensity is based upon a person's baseline conditioning and is determined by an individual's perceived relative exertion of effort. (See <a href=\"#H4894184\" class=\"local\">'Aerobic exercise'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Activities to maintain and increase muscle strength include weight training, weightbearing calisthenics, or resistance training. Muscle-strengthening activities should be done a minimum of two non-consecutive days of the week and should target 8 to 10 major muscle groups. The initial weight should be one that an individual can lift about eight times, and repetitions and weight load are gradually increased over time. (See <a href=\"#H96786693\" class=\"local\">'Muscle strengthening'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Flexibility is necessary to perform daily life activities, and exercises to increase or maintain flexibility should be performed twice a week for at least 10 minutes. Stretching is best performed after aerobic or strengthening activities when the body is warmed up. (See <a href=\"#H96786700\" class=\"local\">'Flexibility'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Balance exercise, such as tai chi, improves stability and may prevent falls and reduce injuries related to falls. (See <a href=\"#H96786707\" class=\"local\">'Balance training'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>An individualized activity plan is recommended for all older adults to include specific physical activity instructions and advice for progression of activity, and should integrate both prevention and therapeutic activities. Routine testing by electrocardiogram or cardiac exercise testing is not indicated for most asymptomatic adults prior to initiating moderate physical activity, unless they are at high risk for coronary disease on the basis of multiple risk factors. (See <a href=\"#H4894199\" class=\"local\">'Activity plan'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Independent of recommendations regarding physical activity, reducing prolonged sedentary behaviors is beneficial to health.
