It is generally considered to be irreversible in its advanced stages, at which point the only treatment option may be liver transplantation. However, reversal of cirrhosis (in its earlier stages) has been documented in several forms of liver disease following treatment of the underlying cause. Patients with cirrhosis are susceptible to a variety of complications, and their life expectancy is markedly reduced. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cirrhosis-in-adults-overview-of-complications-general-management-and-prognosis#H13\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Cirrhosis in adults: Overview of complications, general management, and prognosis&quot;, section on 'Prognosis'</a>.)</p><p>This topic will review the etiologies, clinical manifestations, and diagnosis of cirrhosis.

The most common causes of cirrhosis in the United States are hepatitis C, alcoholic liver disease, and nonalcoholic liver disease, which together accounted for approximately 80 percent of patients on the liver transplantation waitlist between 2004 and 2013 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cirrhosis-in-adults-etiologies-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. </p><p>In developed countries, common causes of cirrhosis include [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cirrhosis-in-adults-etiologies-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Chronic viral hepatitis (hepatitis B, C)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Alcoholic liver disease</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Hemochromatosis</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease</p><p/><p>Less common causes include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Autoimmune hepatitis</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Primary and secondary biliary cirrhosis</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Primary sclerosing cholangitis</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Medications (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methotrexate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">methotrexate</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=isoniazid-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">isoniazid</a>)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Wilson disease</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Celiac disease</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Idiopathic adulthood ductopenia</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Granulomatous liver disease</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Idiopathic portal fibrosis</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Polycystic liver disease</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Infection (eg, brucellosis, syphilis, echinococcosis)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Right-sided heart failure</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Veno-occlusive disease</p><p/><p>Cirrhosis was historically classified morphologically as micronodular, macronodular, or mixed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cirrhosis-in-adults-etiologies-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Micronodular cirrhosis, characterized by nodules less than 3 mm in diameter, was believed to be caused by alcohol, hemochromatosis, cholestatic causes of cirrhosis, and hepatic venous outflow obstruction. Macronodular cirrhosis, characterized by various sized nodules larger than 3 mm, was believed to be secondary to chronic viral hepatitis.</p><p>Although important from a historic perspective, the morphological classification system has a number of limitations and has thus largely been abandoned. First, it is relatively nonspecific with regard to etiology. Second, the morphologic appearance of the liver may change as the liver disease progresses; micronodular cirrhosis usually progresses to macronodular cirrhosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cirrhosis-in-adults-etiologies-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. Third, serological markers available today are more specific than morphological appearance of the liver for determining the etiology of cirrhosis. As an example, antimitochondrial antibodies have a specificity of 98 percent for primary biliary cirrhosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cirrhosis-in-adults-etiologies-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. Finally, accurate assessment of liver morphology can only be achieved at surgery, laparoscopy, or autopsy, while in today's clinical practice there are less invasive means to make an etiologic diagnosis.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL MANIFESTATIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The clinical manifestations of cirrhosis may include nonspecific symptoms (eg, anorexia, weight loss, weakness, fatigue) or signs and symptoms of hepatic decompensation (jaundice, pruritus, signs of upper gastrointestinal bleeding, abdominal distension from ascites, confusion due to hepatic encephalopathy) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F90943\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef90943 \">table 1</a>). Physical examination findings may include jaundice, spider angiomata, gynecomastia, ascites, splenomegaly, palmar erythema, digital clubbing, and asterixis. Laboratory abnormalities may include elevated serum bilirubin, abnormal aminotransferases, elevated alkaline <span class=\"nowrap\">phosphatase/gamma-glutamyl</span> transpeptidase, a prolonged prothrombin <span class=\"nowrap\">time/elevated</span> international normalized ratio (INR), hyponatremia, hypoalbuminemia, and thrombocytopenia.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H71302968\"><span class=\"h2\">Symptoms</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients with compensated cirrhosis may be asymptomatic or they may report nonspecific symptoms, such as anorexia, weight loss, weakness, and fatigue. Patients with decompensated cirrhosis may present with jaundice, pruritus, signs of upper gastrointestinal bleeding (hematemesis, melena, hematochezia), abdominal distension from ascites, or confusion due to hepatic encephalopathy. Patients with cirrhosis may experience muscle cramps, which can be severe [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cirrhosis-in-adults-etiologies-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/6-9\" class=\"abstract_t\">6-9</a>]. The cause is incompletely understood, although they may be related to a reduction in effective circulating plasma volume. </p><p>Patients should be asked about fatigue, easy bruisability, lower extremity edema, fever, weight loss, diarrhea, pruritus, increasing abdominal girth, confusion, or sleep disturbances (possibly indicating encephalopathy).</p><p>In women, chronic anovulation is common, which may manifest as amenorrhea or irregular menstrual bleeding [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cirrhosis-in-adults-etiologies-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. Some of the abnormalities may be due to variations in testosterone, estradiol, prolactin, and luteinizing hormone levels in patients with cirrhosis compared with normal controls [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cirrhosis-in-adults-etiologies-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. </p><p>Men with cirrhosis may develop hypogonadism. It is manifested by impotence, infertility, loss of sexual drive, and testicular atrophy. It is a feature seen predominantly in patients with alcoholic cirrhosis and hemochromatosis. More than one mechanism appears to be involved. In some cases, primary gonadal injury appears to be more prominent, as suggested by increased serum follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) and luteinizing hormone (LH) concentrations, whereas in others, suppression of hypothalamic or pituitary function appears to have a primary role, as suggested by serum LH concentrations that are not elevated. The toxic effects of alcohol or iron may also contribute to its development [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cirrhosis-in-adults-etiologies-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=causes-of-primary-hypogonadism-in-males\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Causes of primary hypogonadism in males&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Patients with cirrhosis may also present with a diverse range of signs and symptoms that reflect the pivotal role that the liver has in the homeostasis of many different bodily functions. In addition, they may have features related to the underlying cause of cirrhosis such as cryoglobulinemia from hepatitis C, diabetes mellitus and arthropathy in patients with hemochromatosis, or extrahepatic autoimmune diseases (such as hemolytic anemia or thyroiditis) in patients with autoimmune hepatitis. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Physical examination</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A number of physical findings have been described in patients with cirrhosis, including jaundice, spider angiomata, gynecomastia, ascites, splenomegaly, palmar erythema, digital clubbing, and asterixis.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H16026595\"><span class=\"h3\">Decreasing blood pressure</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>As cirrhosis progresses, patients often have a decrease in mean arterial pressure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cirrhosis-in-adults-etiologies-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. Patients who were previously hypertensive may become normotensive or hypotensive. The decrease in mean arterial pressure contributes to the development of hepatorenal syndrome and is an important predictor of survival. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hepatorenal-syndrome#H2\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Hepatorenal syndrome&quot;, section on 'Pathogenesis'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cirrhosis-in-adults-overview-of-complications-general-management-and-prognosis#H145979036\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Cirrhosis in adults: Overview of complications, general management, and prognosis&quot;, section on 'Decompensated cirrhosis'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H71303443\"><span class=\"h3\">Skin findings</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients with cirrhosis frequently develop jaundice and spider angiomata. Jaundice is a yellow coloring of the skin and mucous membranes that results from increased serum bilirubin. It is usually not detectable until the bilirubin is greater than 2 to 3 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span>. Hyperbilirubinemia may also cause the urine to appear dark or &quot;cola&quot; colored. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diagnostic-approach-to-the-adult-with-jaundice-or-asymptomatic-hyperbilirubinemia\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Diagnostic approach to the adult with jaundice or asymptomatic hyperbilirubinemia&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Yellow discoloration to the skin can also be caused by excessive consumption of carotene (such as in patients who consume large quantities of carrots). Yellowing of the skin in carotenemia can be distinguished from jaundice by the absence of yellow discoloration in the sclera in the former. </p><p>Spider angiomata (also referred to as spider telangiectasias) are vascular lesions consisting of a central arteriole surrounded by many smaller vessels. They are most frequently found on the trunk, face, and upper limbs. The body of the lesion (the central arteriole) can be seen pulsating when compressed with a glass slide. Blood fills the central arteriole first before traveling to the peripheral tips of each &quot;leg&quot; after blanching. There are usually multiple radiating legs and surrounding erythema that may encompass the entire lesion or only its central portion.</p><p>The pathogenesis of spider angiomata is incompletely understood, but they are believed to result from alterations in sex hormone metabolism. One study suggested that the presence of spider angiomata in men was associated with an increase in the estradiol to free testosterone ratio [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cirrhosis-in-adults-etiologies-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. Acquired spider angiomata are not specific for cirrhosis since they may also be seen during pregnancy (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F74047\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef74047 \">picture 1</a>) and in patients with severe malnutrition. They can also be seen in otherwise healthy people, who usually have fewer than three small lesions. As a general rule, the number and size of spider angiomata correlate with the severity of liver disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cirrhosis-in-adults-etiologies-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/15,16\" class=\"abstract_t\">15,16</a>]. Patients with numerous, large spider angiomata may be at increased risk for variceal hemorrhage.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H78804781\"><span class=\"h3\">Head and neck findings</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Head and neck findings in patients with cirrhosis may include parotid gland enlargement and fetor hepaticus. Parotid gland enlargement is typically seen in patients with alcoholic liver disease and is probably due to alcohol, not cirrhosis per se. Enlargement is usually secondary to fatty infiltration, fibrosis, and edema rather than a hyperfunctioning gland [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cirrhosis-in-adults-etiologies-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>].</p><p>Fetor hepaticus refers to a sweet, pungent smell to the breath of a patient with cirrhosis. It is caused by increased concentrations of dimethyl sulfide, the presence of which suggests underlying severe portal-systemic shunting [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cirrhosis-in-adults-etiologies-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H71303477\"><span class=\"h3\">Chest findings</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Gynecomastia is seen in up to two-thirds of patients with cirrhosis. It is possibly caused by increased production of androstenedione from the adrenals, enhanced aromatization of androstenedione to <a href=\"topic.htm?path=estrone-united-states-not-available-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">estrone</a>, and increased conversion of estrone to estradiol [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cirrhosis-in-adults-etiologies-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. Men may also develop other features reflecting feminization, such as loss of chest or axillary hair and inversion of the normal male pubic hair pattern. Gynecomastia can be seen in a variety of conditions other than cirrhosis. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epidemiology-pathophysiology-and-causes-of-gynecomastia\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Epidemiology, pathophysiology, and causes of gynecomastia&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-features-diagnosis-and-evaluation-of-gynecomastia-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical features, diagnosis, and evaluation of gynecomastia in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Gynecomastia is defined histologically as a benign proliferation of the glandular tissue of the male breast and clinically by the presence of a rubbery or firm mass extending concentrically from the nipple(s). Fat deposition without glandular proliferation is termed pseudogynecomastia (often seen in obese men). These two entities can be distinguished by having the patient lie on his back with his hands behind his head. The examiner then places his or her thumb and forefinger on each side of the breast, and slowly brings them together.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H71303457\"><span class=\"h3\">Abdominal findings</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Findings on abdominal examination include hepatomegaly, splenomegaly, ascites, caput medusae, and a Cruveilhier-Baumgarten murmur.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H16026372\"><span class=\"h4\">Ascites</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Ascites is the accumulation of fluid in the peritoneal cavity. Physical findings in patients with ascites include abdominal distension, a fluid wave, and flank dullness to percussion. The accuracy of physical findings is variable, depending in part on the amount of fluid present, the technique used to examine the patient, and the clinical setting (eg, detection may be more difficult in patients who are obese). In one study, the absence of flank dullness was the most accurate predictor against the presence of ascites; the probability of ascites being present was less than 10 percent in such patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cirrhosis-in-adults-etiologies-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. However, approximately 1500 mL of fluid had to be present for flank dullness to be detected. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-of-adults-with-ascites\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation of adults with ascites&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H78804870\"><span class=\"h4\">Hepatomegaly</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The cirrhotic liver may be enlarged, normal sized, or small. While the presence of a palpable liver may indicate liver disease, a non-palpable liver does not exclude it. When palpable, the cirrhotic liver has a firm and nodular consistency. The liver is the largest internal organ in humans and typically spans 21 to 23 cm horizontally and 14 to 17 cm vertically. The size of the normal liver varies depending on sex, height, and body habitus. </p><p>Physical examination of the liver can be helpful for assessing its shape, its consistency, and whether there is tenderness of the liver edge. It is less useful for assessing its size since assessment of liver size by physical examination correlates poorly with radiologic assessment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cirrhosis-in-adults-etiologies-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. Nevertheless, the liver span can be estimated using percussion techniques or the scratch test. The scratch test uses auscultation while lightly scratching the skin. The intensity of the scratching sound increases when the liver is encountered with the scratching finger. A normal liver span in the mid-clavicular line by physical examination is 7 to 10 cm.</p><p>In healthy people, the liver is generally not palpable because it lies posterior to the rib cage. By contrast, an enlarged liver can often be palpated below the costal margin. However, there are exceptions in which a normal-sized liver can be palpated below the costal margin including patients with emphysema, a thin-body habitus, the presence of a hypertrophied caudate lobe (such as seen in patients with Budd-Chiari syndrome), or Riedel's lobe (an anatomical variant in which there is an extension of the right-lobe downward and lateral toward the gallbladder). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hepatomegaly-differential-diagnosis-and-evaluation\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Hepatomegaly: Differential diagnosis and evaluation&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H78804897\"><span class=\"h4\">Splenomegaly</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Splenomegaly is common, especially in patients with cirrhosis from nonalcoholic etiologies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cirrhosis-in-adults-etiologies-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. It is believed to be caused primarily by congestion of the red pulp resulting from portal hypertension. However, splenic size does not correlate well with portal pressures, suggesting that other factors may be contributing [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cirrhosis-in-adults-etiologies-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. The differential diagnosis of splenomegaly includes several other disorders. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=approach-to-the-adult-with-splenomegaly-and-other-splenic-disorders\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Approach to the adult with splenomegaly and other splenic disorders&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H78804910\"><span class=\"h4\">Caput medusae</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The veins of the lower abdominal wall normally drain inferiorly into the iliofemoral system, while the veins of the upper abdominal wall drain superiorly into the veins of the thoracic wall and axilla. When portal hypertension occurs as the result of cirrhosis, the umbilical vein, normally obliterated in early life, may open. Blood from the portal venous system may be shunted through the periumbilical veins into the umbilical vein and ultimately to the abdominal wall veins, causing them to become prominent. This appearance has been said to resemble the head (caput) of the mythical Gorgon Medusa.</p><p>Dilated abdominal veins can also be seen in the inferior vena cava syndrome [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cirrhosis-in-adults-etiologies-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>] and the superior vena cava syndrome (if obstruction includes the azygous system) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cirrhosis-in-adults-etiologies-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. In these conditions, collateral veins tend to be more prominent in the lateral aspect of the abdominal wall. One maneuver that has been proposed to distinguish vena caval obstruction from portal hypertension is to pass a finger along dilated veins located <strong>below</strong> the umbilicus to strip them of blood and determine the direction of blood flow during refilling. In portal-systemic collateral veins, the blood flow should be directed inferiorly, away from the umbilicus, whereas vena caval collateral vein flow should be cephalad. However, the actual ability of this maneuver to discriminate between the two is poor, since in both conditions the dilated veins may lack valves and thus have bidirectional blood flow [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cirrhosis-in-adults-etiologies-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H78804916\"><span class=\"h4\">Cruveilhier-Baumgarten murmur</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The Cruveilhier-Baumgarten murmur is a venous hum that may be auscultated in patients with portal hypertension. It results from collateral connections between the portal system and the remnant of the umbilical vein. It is best appreciated when the stethoscope is placed over the epigastrium. The murmur is augmented by maneuvers that increase intraabdominal pressure, such as the Valsalva maneuver, and diminished by applying pressure on the skin above the umbilicus [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cirrhosis-in-adults-etiologies-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H71303470\"><span class=\"h3\">Genitourinary findings</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Men with cirrhosis may have testicular atrophy due to the development of hypogonadism.

It is most frequently found on the thenar and hypothenar eminences, while sparing the central portions of the palm. Palmar erythema is not specific for liver disease and can be seen in association with pregnancy, rheumatoid arthritis, hyperthyroidism, and hematological malignancies.</p><p>Nail changes include Muehrcke nails and Terry nails. Muehrcke nails are paired horizontal white bands separated by normal color. The exact pathogenesis is unknown, but it is believed to be caused by hypoalbuminemia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cirrhosis-in-adults-etiologies-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. They are not specific for cirrhosis since they may also be seen in other conditions associated with a low serum albumin, such as the nephrotic syndrome. In patients with Terry nails, the proximal two-thirds of the nail plate appears white, whereas the distal one-third is red (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F91261\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef91261 \">picture 2</a>). This finding is also believed to be secondary to a low serum albumin [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cirrhosis-in-adults-etiologies-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>].</p><p>Clubbing and hypertrophic osteoarthropathy are two additional findings in patients with cirrhosis. Clubbing is present when the angle between the nail plate and proximal nail fold is greater than 180 degrees (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F52839\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef52839 \">figure 1</a>). When severe, the distal finger has a &quot;drum stick&quot; appearance. Hypertrophic osteoarthropathy (HOA) is a chronic proliferative periostitis of the long bones that can cause considerable pain. Clubbing is more common in biliary causes of cirrhosis (particularly primary biliary cirrhosis), while hypertrophic osteoarthropathy can be seen with various causes of liver disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cirrhosis-in-adults-etiologies-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/29,30\" class=\"abstract_t\">29,30</a>]. Neither feature is specific for liver disease. The pathogenesis of clubbing and hypertrophic osteoarthropathy is not well understood. The most frequent cause of hypertrophic osteoarthropathy is lung cancer, which should be sought in the appropriate setting.

In addition to evaluating the liver, abdominal imaging may reveal hepatocellular carcinoma or extrahepatic findings suggestive of cirrhosis, such as ascites, varices, splenomegaly, and hepatic or portal vein thrombosis.

In patients with cirrhosis, there may be heterogeneity in the uptake of 99mTc sulfur colloid by the liver and increased uptake by the spleen and bone marrow. The exact sensitivity and specificity of these findings in making the diagnosis of cirrhosis is unknown. Given the widespread use of other imaging modalities, this test is seldom performed in clinical practice.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h2\">Liver biopsy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The gold standard for diagnosing cirrhosis is examination of an explanted liver, either at autopsy or following liver transplantation, because the architecture of the entire liver can be appreciated. In clinical practice, cirrhosis is diagnosed with a liver biopsy (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F76262\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef76262 \">picture 4</a>), during which a sample of the liver is obtained by either a percutaneous, transjugular, laparoscopic, or radiographically-guided fine-needle approach. The method for obtaining the biopsy will depend on the clinical setting [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cirrhosis-in-adults-etiologies-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/64\" class=\"abstract_t\">64</a>]. The sensitivity of a liver biopsy for cirrhosis is in the range of 80 to 100 percent, depending on the method used, and the size and number of specimens obtained. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=approach-to-liver-biopsy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Approach to liver biopsy&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=transjugular-liver-biopsy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Transjugular liver biopsy&quot;</a>.)</p><p>However, liver biopsy is not necessary if the clinical, laboratory, and radiologic data strongly suggest the presence of cirrhosis and if the results would not alter the patient's management. An example would be a patient with a history of heavy alcohol use who has ascites, severe coagulopathy, and a shrunken, nodular-appearing liver on ultrasonography.</p><p>In addition to demonstrating that cirrhosis is present, a liver biopsy can sometimes suggest the cause. This is especially true for metabolic causes of cirrhosis such as hereditary hemochromatosis (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F50096\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef50096 \">picture 5</a>), nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F51497\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef51497 \">picture 6</a>), Wilson disease (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F64346\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef64346 \">picture 7</a>), and alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency.

The two most common causes of cirrhosis in the United States are alcoholic liver disease and hepatitis C, which together accounted for approximately one-half of patients on the liver transplantation waitlist in 2011.

The findings must be viewed in light of other signs of cirrhosis such as physical examination or laboratory test findings.
