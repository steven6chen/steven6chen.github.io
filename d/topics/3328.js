It typically presents with neurologic deficits, often a stroke-like event, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> psychiatric symptoms. The diagnostic evaluation focuses on ruling out other forms of inflammatory brain disease and noninflammatory vasculopathies in addition to performing confirmatory studies, such as brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and angiography. Treatment includes anticoagulation <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> anti-inflammatory therapy to prevent disease progression and complications.</p><p>A general overview of childhood vasculitis is discussed in detail separately, as is PACNS in adults.

The term &quot;childhood primary angiitis of the central nervous system&quot; (cPACNS) or &quot;central nervous system&quot; (CNS) vasculitis is used if the target of inflammation is the cerebral vasculature [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/childhood-primary-angiitis-of-the-central-nervous-system/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Exact prevalence and incidence are not available for PACNS in adults or children. Large- and medium-vessel disease affects boys more commonly than girls [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/childhood-primary-angiitis-of-the-central-nervous-system/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>], while small-vessel cPACNS shows a female predominance [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/childhood-primary-angiitis-of-the-central-nervous-system/abstract/2,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,6</a>].</p><p>All cases described in the literature before 2000 were based upon autopsy reports, demonstrating the high mortality of the disease if not recognized and treated. Although rare, the incidence appears to be rising, probably due to recognition of nonfatal cases of the disease. At some tertiary care centers, cPACNS is the most frequently diagnosed inflammatory brain disease.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H193330623\"><span class=\"h1\">PATHOGENESIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>cPACNS is thought to be an inflammatory disease, based upon imaging, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis, and biopsy findings, although the exact pathogenesis is not completely explained.</p><p>In general, biopsies are performed only in angiography-negative patients with small-vessel involvement because brain biopsy is necessary to establish the diagnosis in this subtype and to exclude other inflammatory brain diseases (IBrainD) or mimics [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/childhood-primary-angiitis-of-the-central-nervous-system/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. In disease involving larger vessels, imaging is often sufficient to confirm the diagnosis. When available, histologic characteristics of central nervous system (CNS) vasculitis include perivascular and intramural lymphocytic infiltrates with reactive endothelial changes and an absence of marked parenchymal inflammation. In cPACNS, granulomas, necrosis, or beta-amyloid depositions are not present, in contrast to the histopathology in adult PACNS (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F93462\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef93462 \">picture 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/childhood-primary-angiitis-of-the-central-nervous-system/abstract/7-9\" class=\"abstract_t\">7-9</a>]. Associated findings include proliferation of reactive astrocytes, microglia, and oligodendrocytes (gliosis) and perivascular demyelination [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/childhood-primary-angiitis-of-the-central-nervous-system/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H193330631\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL FEATURES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Subtypes of cPACNS may be delineated based upon the size of the cerebral vessel involved and the disease course [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/childhood-primary-angiitis-of-the-central-nervous-system/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. In addition, three major subtypes, nonprogressive large-medium-vessel cPACNS (NP-cPACNS), progressive large-medium-vessel cPACNS (P-cPACNS), and small-vessel cPACNS (SV-cPACNS), are distinguished on the basis of characteristic presentations and laboratory and imaging features [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/childhood-primary-angiitis-of-the-central-nervous-system/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>]. Patients with large-medium vessel disease often present with a stroke-like event due to inflammation rather than actual ischemia. Both types of large-medium vessel disease can have recurrent, stroke-like events, but a circumscribed area is affected in NP-cPACNS, whereas the involvement can extend to other vascular territories in P-cPACNS. These subtypes are helpful for guiding treatment plans and explaining disease course to families, though they are not absolute, and features of the different subtypes may overlap in individual patients. (See <a href=\"#H193330695\" class=\"local\">'Diagnosis'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H193330639\"><span class=\"h2\">Angiography-positive, nonprogressive cPACNS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>NP-cPACNS is a monophasic condition characterized by unilateral inflammation that typically causes stenosis of the distal internal carotid artery (ICA) or proximal middle cerebral artery (MCA) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/childhood-primary-angiitis-of-the-central-nervous-system/abstract/10-12\" class=\"abstract_t\">10-12</a>]. Other terms used to describe what is probably the same condition are transient cerebral arteriopathy (TCA), focal cerebral arteriopathy, and postvaricella arteriopathy (PVA) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/childhood-primary-angiitis-of-the-central-nervous-system/abstract/5,13,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,13,14</a>]. PVA is associated with a reactivation of varicella-zoster virus in the trigeminal ganglia, leading to local inflammation of the cerebral arteries [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/childhood-primary-angiitis-of-the-central-nervous-system/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>].</p><p>Children with NP-cPACNS present with sudden-onset focal neurologic deficits that are frequently misdiagnosed as arterial ischemic stroke [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/childhood-primary-angiitis-of-the-central-nervous-system/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Presenting signs may include motor deficits, such as hemiparesis, hemifacial weakness, and loss of fine motor skills, as well as unilateral sensory loss [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/childhood-primary-angiitis-of-the-central-nervous-system/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Only 10 percent of children present with additional diffuse neurologic deficits, such as decreased cognition or change in behavior. Headaches are present in 40 percent of children with NP-cPACNS [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/childhood-primary-angiitis-of-the-central-nervous-system/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p>Inflammatory markers such as erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) and C-reactive protein (CRP) are frequently normal [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/childhood-primary-angiitis-of-the-central-nervous-system/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Less than 50 percent of children have a mildly raised protein level or pleocytosis on cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis. Opening pressure is sometimes elevated, but the clinical relevance of this finding remains uncertain.</p><p>Brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) studies in children with NP-cPACNS show unilateral ischemic lesions in large-vessel distributions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/childhood-primary-angiitis-of-the-central-nervous-system/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. The basal ganglia are most commonly involved. Vasculitis is best confirmed by conventional or magnetic resonance angiography (MRA), which typically demonstrates irregular unilateral stenosis <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> dilatation of the proximal segments of the anterior <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> middle cerebral arteries (beading) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F93818\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef93818 \">image 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/childhood-primary-angiitis-of-the-central-nervous-system/abstract/1,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,11</a>]. Gadolinium-enhanced vessel wall studies in adults show vessel wall thickening and wall enhancement due to inflammation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/childhood-primary-angiitis-of-the-central-nervous-system/abstract/15,16\" class=\"abstract_t\">15,16</a>], although reports of this imaging technique in pediatrics are still limited.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H193330647\"><span class=\"h2\">Angiography-positive, progressive cPACNS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>P-cPACNS tends to be more extensive than NP-cPACNS, and both ischemic and inflammatory processes are involved [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/childhood-primary-angiitis-of-the-central-nervous-system/abstract/1,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,10</a>].</p><p>Headaches are the leading clinical feature in P-cPACNS, and they have been reported in up to 95 percent of affected children [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/childhood-primary-angiitis-of-the-central-nervous-system/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. In addition, children with progressive large-vessel disease most commonly have both focal and diffuse neurologic deficits on presentation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/childhood-primary-angiitis-of-the-central-nervous-system/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>], although it is often the focal deficits such as hemisensory loss or fine motor skill deficits that are first noted and lead to the diagnosis. The diffuse deficits that are also present in these patients include difficulty in concentration, cognitive dysfunction, and mood and personality changes. Development of diffuse deficits is often insidious and can occur days to weeks before the diagnosis is made.</p><p>Inflammatory markers may be mildly to moderately raised in children with progressive disease, although normal CSF <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> acute-phase reactants do not exclude a progressive central nervous system (CNS) vasculitis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/childhood-primary-angiitis-of-the-central-nervous-system/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p>The parenchymal lesions seen on MRI are commonly present in more than one vascular territory [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/childhood-primary-angiitis-of-the-central-nervous-system/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. One in five children has bilateral lesions that are typically asymmetric and often involve both proximal and distal segments of the cerebral arteries (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F93817\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef93817 \">image 2</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/childhood-primary-angiitis-of-the-central-nervous-system/abstract/1,10-12\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,10-12</a>]. The anterior circulation is more commonly affected than the posterior circulation.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H193330655\"><span class=\"h2\">Angiography-negative, brain biopsy-positive, small-vessel cPACNS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Children with SV-cPACNS frequently present with severe encephalopathy, extensive focal deficits, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> status epilepticus. The potential for rapid progression necessitates an expeditious and extensive evaluation, with a brain biopsy often required to confirm the diagnosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/childhood-primary-angiitis-of-the-central-nervous-system/abstract/2,6,17\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,6,17</a>]. Systemic features, such as fever and fatigue, are frequently present in SV-cPACNS [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/childhood-primary-angiitis-of-the-central-nervous-system/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. The majority of children with SV-cPACNS have seizures, and all seizure types are seen [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/childhood-primary-angiitis-of-the-central-nervous-system/abstract/2,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,6</a>].</p><p>The mode of onset differs significantly from child to child. Some children present with a meningitis-like illness and have rapidly progressive disease course. In contrast, other children develop cognitive deficits over weeks to months, complain of headaches, or are diagnosed with focal seizures [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/childhood-primary-angiitis-of-the-central-nervous-system/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. The diagnosis can be delayed in children with an underlying learning disability or autism because inflammation-associated cognitive decline can be more difficult to detect in these children.</p><p>Inflammatory markers are frequently abnormal in SV-cPACNS, although the degree of abnormality can range widely. One study reported at least one abnormal inflammatory serum marker at diagnosis in three out of four children with SV-cPACNS [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/childhood-primary-angiitis-of-the-central-nervous-system/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. Over 90 percent of children in this study had an abnormal CSF analysis including increased CSF protein <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> cell count.</p><p>MRI abnormalities are present in the majority of patients with SV-cPACNS [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/childhood-primary-angiitis-of-the-central-nervous-system/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. However, a normal MRI does not exclude the diagnosis. Ischemic lesions are uncommon in SV-cPACNS. Gadolinium enhancement of lesions and meninges are seen in almost 50 percent of children with active disease. Although the MRI findings in SV-cPACNS may be quite diverse, inflammatory lesions are most commonly seen in the subcortical white matter and cortical gray matter (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F93463\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef93463 \">image 3</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/childhood-primary-angiitis-of-the-central-nervous-system/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. Autopsies have established the generalized character of SV-cPACNS, in contrast to the sometimes focal appearance on MRI. Nonetheless, the small caliber of vessels involved means that, by definition, all children with SV-cPACNS will have a normal MRA and conventional angiogram. Thus, brain biopsy is often necessary in order to make a definitive diagnosis.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H193330695\"><span class=\"h1\">DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The diagnostic evaluation for suspected cPACNS is a stepwise process that includes assessment for other forms of childhood inflammatory brain disease and disorders that mimic these diseases in addition to studies to confirm the presence of central nervous system (CNS) vasculitis (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F94548\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef94548 \">algorithm 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/childhood-primary-angiitis-of-the-central-nervous-system/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. Patients should also be evaluated for potential prothrombotic abnormalities that may contribute to the disease process. (See <a href=\"#H193330703\" class=\"local\">'Differential diagnosis'</a> below.)</p><p>The first steps in the diagnostic evaluation in children with clinical features suggestive of cPACNS include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A general assessment for underlying disease processes (eg, infections, malignancies, other underlying systemic diseases). (See <a href=\"#H193330703\" class=\"local\">'Differential diagnosis'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Neuropsychiatric testing as indicated by the clinical presentation (this testing may not be available urgently or in the inpatient setting).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Laboratory studies to evaluate for inflammatory disease. Initial studies typically include an erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> C-reactive protein (CRP), complete blood count (CBC) with differential, and testing for autoantibodies including antinuclear antibody (ANA), antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (ANCA), extractable nuclear antigens (ENA), anti-double-stranded deoxyribonucleic acid (anti-dsDNA), complement components 3 and 4 (C3, C4), and von Willebrand factor (vWF) antigen.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Lumbar puncture for analysis of cerebral spinal fluid (CSF), including oligoclonal bands, neuronal antibodies, antibody synthesis, and tests for infections (culture and polymerase chain reaction [PCR]) and malignancies (cytologic analysis).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and magnetic resonance angiography (MRA). The MRI should include the following sequences: T1, T2, fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR), diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI), and apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) for parenchymal lesions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/childhood-primary-angiitis-of-the-central-nervous-system/abstract/10,19\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,19</a>]. Serial studies may be necessary to diagnose small-vessel cPACNS (SV-cPACNS) and are best viewed on <span class=\"nowrap\">T2/FLAIR</span> sequences [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/childhood-primary-angiitis-of-the-central-nervous-system/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. Notably, meningeal enhancement is not present in other primary inflammatory brain diseases (IBrainD), such as demyelinating diseases, and can help to distinguish SV-cPACNS [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/childhood-primary-angiitis-of-the-central-nervous-system/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. The brain MRA should be performed with post-gadolinium induced vessel wall enhancement, if possible. Conventional angiography (CA) is more sensitive but is also more invasive. Thus, it is usually only performed when the MRA is negative (particularly in small children or if posterior circulation involvement is suspected), when there is a question of vascular dissection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/childhood-primary-angiitis-of-the-central-nervous-system/abstract/1,10,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,10,11</a>], or when precise delineation of involved vessels is needed in children with large-medium-vessel cPACNS [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/childhood-primary-angiitis-of-the-central-nervous-system/abstract/1,10,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,10,11</a>].

Ideally, the biopsy should be performed before treatment or within seven days of starting treatment. If biopsy is not possible, the clinician needs to decide if treatment should be started without having a definitive diagnosis.</p><p/><p>The following studies illustrate the utility of brain biopsy and factors that may influence the diagnostic yield:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a study evaluating the diagnostic yield of elective brain biopsy performed between 1988 and 2003 in children with progressive neurologic decline, the overall diagnostic yield was 48.5 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/childhood-primary-angiitis-of-the-central-nervous-system/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. The diagnostic yield improved over time, increasing to 68.8 percent when only the biopsies performed in the last eight years of the study were included. The most frequent diagnosis made was SV-cPACNS.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The diagnostic yield is dependent upon the quality of the brain biopsy, and the best results are obtained if all three layers are available for evaluation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/childhood-primary-angiitis-of-the-central-nervous-system/abstract/7,21\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,21</a>]. Lesional biopsies are preferred to nonlesional biopsies, although the diagnostic yield of nonlesional biopsies was identical to lesional biopsies in one small series [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/childhood-primary-angiitis-of-the-central-nervous-system/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. The inflammation in cPACNS is influenced by immunosuppressive treatment. Depending on the therapy being used, there are up to seven days to perform a biopsy after immunosuppressive therapy is initiated. The inflammation might have decreased significantly and the intramural infiltrate might have resolved if a biopsy is performed after this time, leading to an inconclusive biopsy report.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H193330703\"><span class=\"h1\">DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The differential diagnosis in a child that presents with neurologic deficits, particularly a stroke-like event, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> psychiatric symptoms is broad and includes more common conditions, such as infections, strokes, metabolic disorders, and malignancies (eg, central nervous system [CNS] lymphoma). A broad array of infections should be considered in the differential diagnosis, including infection with viruses (eg, cytomegalovirus [CMV], Epstein-Barr virus [EBV], and human immunodeficiency virus [HIV]), bacteria (eg, <em>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</em>, <em>Mycoplasma</em> pneumonia, streptococcal pneumonia), fungi (eg, <em>Candida albicans</em>, <em>Aspergillus</em>, or <em>Actinomyces</em>), or other micro-organisms (eg, spirochete, such as <em>Borrelia burgdorferi </em>[Lyme disease]).

Clinically, the presentation is usually a stroke-like event for both large-medium-vessel cPACNS and for these other entities. However, additional characteristics of a possible underling cause of noninflammatory vasculopathies or genetic or syndromic disorder may be apparent on clinical examination (eg, caf&eacute;-au-lait lesions in neurofibromatosis 1) and help lead to the correct diagnosis. It is possible to differentiate between noninflammatory vasculopathies and inflammatory large-vessel cPACNS with gadolinium vessel wall enhancement [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/childhood-primary-angiitis-of-the-central-nervous-system/abstract/15,16\" class=\"abstract_t\">15,16</a>].</p><p>The differential diagnosis for SV-cPACNS includes demyelinating diseases, neuronal antibody-mediated diseases, and other, less common conditions, such as Rasmussen encephalitis and neurosarcoidosis. Infection should also be excluded in children with meningeal enhancement on brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F93464\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef93464 \">table 3</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/childhood-primary-angiitis-of-the-central-nervous-system/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. Although the nonvasculitic inflammatory brain diseases (IBrainD) have specific characteristics, these characteristics overlap [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/childhood-primary-angiitis-of-the-central-nervous-system/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. Thus, an elective brain biopsy is mandatory to establish a diagnosis and initiate the appropriate therapy if an IBrainD is suspected, but no conclusive diagnosis can be established with clinical, laboratory, and neuroimaging features (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F93465\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef93465 \">table 4</a>).</p><p>The differential diagnosis of cPACNS also includes secondary CNS vasculitis, which can affect both or either large or small cerebral vessels. The causes of secondary CNS vasculitis include infections, systemic rheumatic diseases, other systemic inflammatory diseases, and other systemic processes (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F93465\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef93465 \">table 4</a>). The neurologic clinical and radiographic patterns of large-vessel CNS vasculitis are similar to angiography-positive, secondary CNS vasculitis (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F93466\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef93466 \">table 5</a>). Causes of secondary CNS vasculitis are differentiated from cPACNS by the presence of additional abnormalities and identification of an underlying disease process.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H193330711\"><span class=\"h1\">TREATMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Treatment protocols for the three different types of cPACNS have been developed and are available through the international <a href=\"http://www.sickkids.ca/Research/Brainworks/&amp;token=krZ6aXAuYXZGX3UdWGr1kGRjz9J5G9oLCWPRPKeWxtdXy1XODit6HSgiQwfS8teB/Cf7/+LZx7Jiidy0rl/Z/Q==&amp;TOPIC_ID=16367\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">BrainWorks</a> website.

Thus, treatment of large-medium-vessel disease mainly focuses on diminishing the stroke recurrence risk by initiation of anticoagulation treatment with heparin and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aspirin-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">aspirin</a>. Patients with small-vessel disease are usually diagnosed later in the course of the disease and often have had antibiotics and are on anticonvulsive therapy if they have seizures.

(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ischemic-stroke-in-children-secondary-prevention\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Ischemic stroke in children: Secondary prevention&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Typically, anti-inflammatory treatment (primarily glucocorticoids, pulse or high dose followed by a slow taper) is started when the diagnosis is confirmed radiographically in medium-large-vessel disease (eg, evidence of active vessel wall inflammation is seen) or in suspected small-vessel disease pending biopsy results if suspicion is high. Other diagnoses for which treatment is contraindicated (eg, glucocorticoids in the setting of infection or malignancy) should be excluded prior to starting anti-inflammatory therapies (see <a href=\"#H193330703\" class=\"local\">'Differential diagnosis'</a> above).

The pediatric stroke outcome measure (PSOM) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/childhood-primary-angiitis-of-the-central-nervous-system/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>] can be used to assess a patient's neurologic function during serial visits, combined with an overall disease activity score such as a clinician visual activity score.

(See <a href=\"#H6067618\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above and <a href=\"#H6067686\" class=\"local\">'Definition'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The different subtypes of cPACNS are classified based upon the size of the cerebral vessel involved and the disease course. The three recognized subtypes of cPACNS are nonprogressive large-medium-vessel cPACNS (NP-cPACNS), progressive large-medium-vessel cPACNS (P-cPACNS), and small-vessel cPACNS (SV-cPACNS). Each subtype is associated with distinct presenting symptoms and laboratory and neuroimaging findings.

A brain biopsy is required to confirm the diagnosis of SV-cPACNS. Patients should also be evaluated for potential prothrombotic abnormalities that may contribute to the disease process.

The differential diagnosis of large-medium-vessel disease includes noninflammatory vasculopathies, cerebral vasospastic conditions, and several syndromes associated with cerebral vasculopathies and, for SV-cPACNS, includes demyelinating diseases, neuronal antibody-mediated diseases, and infection. The differential diagnosis of cPACNS also includes secondary CNS vasculitis, which can affect both or either large or small cerebral vessels.
