AUFI refers to infertility that is completely attributable to uterine absence (congenital or surgical) or an abnormality (anatomic or functional) that prevents embryo implantation or completion of pregnancy to term. This topic will review the surgeries for the donor and recipient, immunosuppression, and obstetric issues involved in uterus transplantation. The intent of this topic is to provide an overview of the critical issues for clinicians and patients; the topic is based on the experience of the authors and should not be used for treatment decisions.</p><p>Related discussions on the ethical issues, patient selection, and consent involved in uterus transplantation, as well as topics on solid organ transplantation, are presented separately.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=uterus-transplantation-for-absolute-uterine-factor-infertility-ethics-patient-selection-and-consent\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Uterus transplantation for absolute uterine factor infertility: Ethics, patient selection, and consent&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-care-of-the-adult-kidney-transplant-recipient\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of care of the adult kidney transplant recipient&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=transplantation-immunobiology\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Transplantation immunobiology&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2912184350\"><span class=\"h1\">INDICATIONS, ETHICS, AND PATIENT SELECTION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The indications, ethics, and patient selection for uterus transplantation are reviewed separately.

The uterus recipient is also the genetic mother, as embryos are created using her eggs and the genetic father's sperm prior to the transplantation procedure. Surgical removal of the donor uterus requires a radical-type hysterectomy (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F111227\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef111227 \">figure 2</a>). Uterus transplantation involves extensive vascular surgery.

We perform a vertical midline incision, starting above the umbilicus and extending to the pubic symphysis, to ensure adequate exposure of pelvic structures up to the level of the bifurcation of the internal and external iliac arteries. Of note, at least one group has reported use of robot-assisted laparoscopy for procurement of the donor uterus, although it is not known if the shorter operating time and less-invasive approach outweigh the potential risks (both known and unknown) of using a less established surgical approach for an experimental procedure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/uterus-transplantation-for-absolute-uterine-factor-infertility-surgery-immunosuppression-and-obstetric-management/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. The procedure for uterus removal is similar to a radical-type hysterectomy in that the ligaments and vessels are ligated as far laterally as possible to ensure long vascular pedicles for transplantation (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F111227\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef111227 \">figure 2</a>). However, additional dissection is required to preserve critical structures for the donor while obtaining the best possible graft for transplantation. To date, uterus procurement surgery has required 10 to 13 hours [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/uterus-transplantation-for-absolute-uterine-factor-infertility-surgery-immunosuppression-and-obstetric-management/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].

All small branches from the uterine vessels at this location should be ligated or sutured to avoid leakage after reperfusion of the organ in the recipient.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Dissection of the fallopian tubes from their vascular supply &ndash; The authors tie the freed tubes together in a knot to create a functional handle that allows them to manipulate the uterus without directly touching it.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Dissection of the upper uterine or ovarian vein &ndash; In our approach, the branch from the uterine cornua that merges with the ovarian vein and forms a true utero-ovarian vein is dissected free and flushed with heparinized saline. This branch may be used for end-to-side anastomosis (during back-table preparation) to the uterine vein or to one end on the internal iliac vein segment in order to increase blood flow from the uterus after anastomosis. Alternately, some authors have suggested using only the ovarian veins to provide venous outflow [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/uterus-transplantation-for-absolute-uterine-factor-infertility-surgery-immunosuppression-and-obstetric-management/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Dissection of the arterial supply to the uterus &ndash; The arterial vasculature of the uterus is dissected proximally to the bifurcation between the major anterior branch of the iliac artery and the posterior portion (gluteal artery). Then all branches from the anterior portion, including the umbilical artery, are divided to gain one major trunk of the arterial supply through the interior iliacs. The arterial segment between the bifurcation of the posterior branch of the iliac artery and cervix is kept in the graft, while all the other branches (iliolumbar artery, lateral sacral artery, gluteal [superior and inferior] arteries, pudendal artery, middle rectal artery, vaginal artery, obturator artery, and umbilical artery) are ligated and remain in the donor.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Dissection of the ureter &ndash; The uterine artery, which is over-riding the ureter, is then dissected free from its attachment to the ureter. Several small arterial branches going from the uterine artery to the ureter (one in an anterior direction and one posterior) and upper bladder are ligated.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Dissection of the veins &ndash; Dissection of the veins begins on the pelvic sidewall, in order to identify the internal iliac vein, and progresses toward the uterus. The goal of venous dissection is to create an outflow conduit on each side of the uterus. The sizes and the positions of the veins determine whether one large and dominating uterine vein is chosen or whether several smaller uterine veins will be used for venous drainage. The venous vascular pedicle should, at its end, contain a segment or a patch of the internal iliac vein, in order to get a vein with well-defined walls that will make anastomosis surgery in the recipient easier. If the outflow through the uterine vein(s) on one side is anticipated to be low because of the small size of the vessels, the uterine branch of the utero-ovarian vein is dissected and later anastomosed to the internal iliac venous segment to increase venous drainage. All veins must be dissected off the ureter.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Dissection of the rectovaginal space &ndash; The rectovaginal space is then opened and the uterosacral ligaments are divided, preferably 10 to 15 mm from the uterine cervix, to facilitate subsequent uterine fixation in the recipient. The extensive dissection of the vagina increases its mobility which allows it to be moved backward towards the proximal edge of the uterosacral ligaments (that remain in the donor) to perform a McCall culdoplasty. Thus, the posterior vaginal apex is drawn up to the supporting uterosacral structures and thereby elevated to a normal position.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Dissection of the vaginal vascular supply &ndash; The vaginal arteries and veins that are firmly attached to the lateral portions of the upper vagina are divided. The vagina is then transected and a 15 to 20 mm vaginal rim is left on the uterine side.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Uterus removal &ndash; After the dissections are completed, the uterus is only attached by the bilateral arterial and venous vascular pedicles. Vascular clamps are then placed, first on the internal iliac arteries just distal to the branching of the gluteal arteries, and on the internal iliac veins to obtain segments or patches of this on each side. The vessels are divided just distal to the clamps, and the uterus is quickly taken to the back-table, where it is cooled down by flushing cold preservation solution through the arteries. Any vascular leakage is repaired on the back-table, and vascular reconstructions, such as anastomosis of the upper uterine vein, are performed. The donor surgery is completed by closure of the open vascular pedicles and the vaginal vault.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H905190472\"><span class=\"h4\">Complications</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Surgical complications can be intra- or postoperative. The most serious intraoperative complications, in order of descending importance, are lacerations of a vein, artery, ureter, or bladder wall.</p><p>More common postoperative complications include wound infection, venous thromboembolism, bleeding, vaginal cuff infection or dehiscence, or <span class=\"nowrap\">ureteric/bladder</span> injury with fistula formation. In the clinical trial of nine uterus transplantations, one donor was diagnosed with a ureterovaginal fistula on postoperative day (POD) 16, which was treated with a pyelostomy catheter and subsequent ureteral reimplantation on POD 134 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/uterus-transplantation-for-absolute-uterine-factor-infertility-surgery-immunosuppression-and-obstetric-management/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].

To that end, the uterus is typically removed with the uterine vessels intact and attached to portions of the internal iliac vessels, and potentially to the common iliac vessels (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F111067\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef111067 \">figure 3</a>). Having long vascular pedicles facilitates transplantation of the organ into the recipient. One advantage of organ procurement from a deceased donor compared with a living donor is that the ureters can be transected because they are no longer needed for function. The ureters are transected both caudally and cranially from the point where they cross the uterine vessels and thus the need to dissect the vessels off of the ureters is eliminated. The branches from the vascular pedicles on the graft side can be ligated at the time of transection or after the entire organ has been removed (ie, back-table preparation).</p><p>One challenge of deceased-donor surgery is that, in the setting of a multi-organ donor, the uterus is typically not the first organ removed (life-saving organs are usually removed first). The uterus is flushed with heparinized preservation solution while the vital organs are removed. In contrast to the traditional flushing technique in solid organ transplantation, which is done from the lower aorta in a cranial direction, one research group has reported flushing of the uterus through cannulation of the femoral arteries [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/uterus-transplantation-for-absolute-uterine-factor-infertility-surgery-immunosuppression-and-obstetric-management/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. Total time for graft procurement (flushing, removal, and back-table preparation) has been reported to range between 30 and 120 minutes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/uterus-transplantation-for-absolute-uterine-factor-infertility-surgery-immunosuppression-and-obstetric-management/abstract/5,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,6</a>]. Different groups have reported performing the hysterectomy first, prior to procurement of other organs and before the cross-clamping of the aorta [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/uterus-transplantation-for-absolute-uterine-factor-infertility-surgery-immunosuppression-and-obstetric-management/abstract/6,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,7</a>]. When the hysterectomy is performed first, the surgery becomes a clean-contaminated case, which should be discussed with all surgical teams involved in organ procurement.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1505856088\"><span class=\"h2\">Uterus transplantation</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4188382595\"><span class=\"h3\">Procedure</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The surgery on the organ recipient is not begun until approximately 30 minutes before the predicted time for organ removal from the donor and once the surgeons have confirmed that the graft is well perfused by the remaining isolated vascular pedicles. In the authors' trial, when the graft donor was a postmenopausal woman, the authors delayed the recipient surgery until the graft organ had been removed from the donor and was clearly well perfused with preservative solution because of the smaller size of the uterine arteries after menopause. This approach may prolong the cold ischemic time of the graft. Of note, the recipient receives her first dose of immunosuppressive medication at the onset of surgery.</p><p>Surgery is begun by making an infraumbilical midline incision. The next steps are determined by the recipient woman's pelvic anatomy:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For women without a uterus (the majority of recipient women), the initial surgery involves separation of the bladder and the rectum from the vaginal vault. The dissection is aided by use of a vaginal sacropexy probe to displace the vagina upward.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For women who have a uterus in place (eg, women with Asherman syndrome), a traditional total hysterectomy is performed with removal of the fallopian tubes.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For women with rudimentary uterus or similar structure above the vaginal vault (eg, women with Mayer-Rokitansky-K&uuml;ster-Hauser [MRKH] syndrome), the rudimentary uterus is cleaved.</p><p/><p>The external iliac arteries and veins are then dissected and cleared over a distance of about 3 to 4 cm to give space for later anastomosis. The authors place non-resorbable fixation sutures (1-0) bilaterally in the uterosacral ligaments, the round ligaments, and in the tissue that will be lateral to the cervix (cardinal ligaments or, in the case of MRKH, the cleaved uterine rudiment above the vaginal vault).</p><p>The cooled and flushed uterus is then placed in the pelvis and traditional end-to-side anastomosis surgery is performed (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F111227\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef111227 \">figure 2</a>). On each side, the vein is attached first and then the artery. Each anastomosis requires approximately 15 to 30 minutes. Once all anastomoses have been completed, the vascular clamps are removed and the organ is perfused. Any anastomotic leaks are repaired. The vagina of the recipient is then opened with a vertical incision to avoid injury to the ureters. The vertical incision length is extended to correspond to the diameter of the vaginal ring of the graft. The vaginal rim of the grafted uterus is then anastomosed end-to-side to the opened vaginal vault with a continuous absorbable suture. The uterus is then fixed bilaterally to the sutures of the sacrouterine ligaments, round ligaments and paracervical tissues. As a last point of fixation, the bladder peritoneum is sutured on the top of the bladder fundus. The abdomen is then closed. To date, uterus transplantation has required approximately four to five hours [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/uterus-transplantation-for-absolute-uterine-factor-infertility-surgery-immunosuppression-and-obstetric-management/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2633441968\"><span class=\"h3\">Complications</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The major intraoperative risk for the uterus recipient is anastomotic leakage. Leakage is typically immediately visible and is repaired with polypropylene suture. Prior to closing, the authors place a passive drain in the pelvis, posterior to the uterus, to help identify intra-abdominal bleeding during the immediate postoperative period. In the trial of nine uterus transplantations, one woman developed a retroperitoneal hematoma and required a blood transfusion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/uterus-transplantation-for-absolute-uterine-factor-infertility-surgery-immunosuppression-and-obstetric-management/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p>The routine surgical complications for the recipient are similar to those of the donor and include wound infection and bleeding. A complication that is unique to the graft recipient is the thrombosis of any uterine vessel anastomoses. The authors monitor uterine blood flow frequently by Doppler ultrasound to detect any signs of impaired blood flow. The authors routinely measure the blood flow with an intraoperative probe during surgery. A drop-in Doppler probe is then left in place around the uterine artery of the graft to allow for direct measurements during the postoperative period. Once the connection to the drop-in device is removed (after three to four days), the graft uterine arteries are monitored with external Doppler measurements using an abdominal probe. The authors assessed the uterine artery flow every third day during the first 14 days, once a week until the end of the first month, and then every third week. If there is concern for vessel thrombosis, the authors may repeat the laparotomy to assess the patency of the blood vessels and to clear any thrombosis with possible reconstruction of the graft vessels or anastomosis sites.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2163041753\"><span class=\"h1\">GRAFT COMPLICATIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The most serious complications that affect the grafted uterus are rejection, thrombosis, and infection. Complications that may result from the transplantation of vessels with atherosclerotic disease are not yet known.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2335636909\"><span class=\"h2\">Rejection</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>When detected early, organ rejection can often be reversed with a temporary increase in maintenance immunosuppression or a short course of corticosteroids. The authors monitor transplant recipients with cervical biopsies to detect rejection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/uterus-transplantation-for-absolute-uterine-factor-infertility-surgery-immunosuppression-and-obstetric-management/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. In their research protocol, the predetermined time points for cervical biopsy were one, two, and four weeks post-transplantation and monthly thereafter [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/uterus-transplantation-for-absolute-uterine-factor-infertility-surgery-immunosuppression-and-obstetric-management/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Additional biopsies were performed for clinical symptoms that could represent organ rejection such as vaginal discharge, fever, or abdominal pain. Physical examination findings suggestive of graft rejection can include cervical discoloration, focal epithelial erosions, ulcerations, or areas of necrosis. The authors have developed a preliminary grading system for assessing allograft rejection of the human uterus based on studies of cervical biopsies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/uterus-transplantation-for-absolute-uterine-factor-infertility-surgery-immunosuppression-and-obstetric-management/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. This grading system is in its initial phase; the means to detect and grade rejection will likely develop further in the future.</p><p>If rejection is detected in the biopsy specimen, the authors perform follow-up biopsies on a weekly basis until the histology normalizes. In their research trial of seven women, rejection was seen in five patients. Less than 10 percent of all protocol biopsies met the criteria for organ rejection. All rejection events were subclinical; no pathological findings were identified on ultrasound or gynecological examination. The histologic findings of the mild rejection episodes consisted of a mixed inflammatory cell infiltrate (continuous or patchy), dominated by lymphocytes, at the interface of the superficial stroma and basal epidermal layer. In the few cases of severe rejection, histologic evaluation revealed a major diffuse, mixed inflammatory cell infiltrate [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/uterus-transplantation-for-absolute-uterine-factor-infertility-surgery-immunosuppression-and-obstetric-management/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1146710089\"><span class=\"h2\">Thrombosis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Arterial and venous thrombosis have been described after other types of abdominal organ transplantation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/uterus-transplantation-for-absolute-uterine-factor-infertility-surgery-immunosuppression-and-obstetric-management/abstract/9-12\" class=\"abstract_t\">9-12</a>]. While the data are limited, thrombosis of the uterine arteries and veins occurred in one of nine cases in the authors' trial. Ultrasound and cross-sectional imaging techniques are effective at detecting clots in the graft's vessels [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/uterus-transplantation-for-absolute-uterine-factor-infertility-surgery-immunosuppression-and-obstetric-management/abstract/10,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,11</a>]. Possible explanations include thrombus formation secondary to low initial arterial blood flow, venous outflow problems, or constrictions of the anastomosis lines. Despite the presence of thrombus in the vasculature, the available literature does not report a high risk of graft failure from thrombosis. Although the first reported transplanted human uterus was removed 99 days after transplantation because of necrosis and uterine vessel thrombosis, the thrombosis was believed to be the result of kinked vascular supply caused by uterine prolapse into the upper vagina [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/uterus-transplantation-for-absolute-uterine-factor-infertility-surgery-immunosuppression-and-obstetric-management/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1738827791\"><span class=\"h2\">Infection</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A transplanted uterus may be more susceptible to intrauterine infection because of the immunosuppressed state of the recipient.

In the trial of nine women undergoing transplantation, one transplanted uterus required removal on postoperative day 105 because of persistent infection with <em>Enterococcus faecalis</em> that did not respond to intravenous antibiotic therapy or surgical drainage [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/uterus-transplantation-for-absolute-uterine-factor-infertility-surgery-immunosuppression-and-obstetric-management/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>].

A different clinical team that attempted a deceased-donor uterus transplant reported removal of the graft on postoperative day 12 because of <em>Candida</em> infection that disrupted one of the vascular anastomoses of the graft and led to bleeding [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/uterus-transplantation-for-absolute-uterine-factor-infertility-surgery-immunosuppression-and-obstetric-management/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>].

Cessation of blood flow through the uterine arteries is confirmed with intraoperative Doppler ultrasound and manual palpation of the uterine arteries before hysterectomy is started. The fixation points of the uterus and the vaginal-vaginal anastomosis line are easily identified. These suture lines are opened first to make it easier to dissect the uterine vessels up to the anastomosis points on the external iliac vessels. It is important to remove the entirety of the grafted vessels in order to avoid weakening, and possibly rupture, at these spots when immunosuppression is stopped and rejection of any retained foreign tissue will occur.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1920976999\"><span class=\"h1\">IMMUNOSUPPRESSION</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H867721411\"><span class=\"h2\">Our approach</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In their clinical trial, the authors used a combined immunosuppressive protocol similar to that used for other type of composite tissues such as the face or the arm [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/uterus-transplantation-for-absolute-uterine-factor-infertility-surgery-immunosuppression-and-obstetric-management/abstract/1,16\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,16</a>].

Although azathioprine is likely mildly teratogenic, it is believed that, at low doses, the benefits outweigh risks. As of 2006, more than 14,000 births had been reported from women with transplanted organs who were receiving immunosuppressive therapy without a noticeable increase in structural malformations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/uterus-transplantation-for-absolute-uterine-factor-infertility-surgery-immunosuppression-and-obstetric-management/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3544777059\"><span class=\"h2\">Obstetric complications</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Among potential obstetric complications, the authors particularly monitor women with uterus transplants for evidence of preeclampsia, intrauterine growth restriction, and gestational diabetes (for women receiving glucocorticoids or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tacrolimus-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">tacrolimus</a>). For women with renal transplants, volunteer patient registries have reported increased rates of adverse perinatal outcomes, particularly hypertension and preeclampsia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/uterus-transplantation-for-absolute-uterine-factor-infertility-surgery-immunosuppression-and-obstetric-management/abstract/26,27\" class=\"abstract_t\">26,27</a>]. In a population-based study comparing pregnancy outcome before and after organ transplantation (multiple types), women with organ transplants experienced increased risk of preeclampsia, preterm birth, low birth weight, and small for gestational age infants [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/uterus-transplantation-for-absolute-uterine-factor-infertility-surgery-immunosuppression-and-obstetric-management/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. However, when births just before and after transplantation were compared, the perinatal outcomes were found to be similar. This study suggests that the major cause for these pregnancy complications in transplanted patients was the organ disease that led to the transplantation procedure and not the immunosuppressant medication or the transplantation procedure itself. Until more data are available, the obstetric and fetal risks for uterus transplantation patients are extrapolated from the solid organ transplantation data. Women with other types of solid organ transplants undergo surveillance for preeclampsia, serial ultrasounds for fetal growth assessment beginning by 24 weeks of gestation, antenatal testing beginning by 32 weeks of gestation, and early and standard screening for diabetes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/uterus-transplantation-for-absolute-uterine-factor-infertility-surgery-immunosuppression-and-obstetric-management/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>].</p><p>In the first pregnancy after uterus transplantation, the patient was followed every third week, including fetal and maternal assessment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/uterus-transplantation-for-absolute-uterine-factor-infertility-surgery-immunosuppression-and-obstetric-management/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].

The uterus is removed when childbearing is deemed complete to limit the amount and duration of immunosuppressive medication and thereby reduce the risk for immunosuppressive side effects such as nephrotoxicity and increased risk of certain malignancies.</p><p>Major challenges anticipated at the time of the graft removal surgery are adhesions that have formed around the graft's vessels and the non-anatomic location of the vessels. In addition, the ureters may be positioned close to the graft vessels on the pelvic sidewalls and difficult to separate. Preoperative insertion of ureteric double J stents can be helpful to aid in palpating the ureters. Identification of the native and graft vaginal edges can also be challenging. Lastly, the dissection and suturing of the anastomosis sites in the external iliac vessels must be meticulous in order to prevent subsequent vessel rupture due to fibrosis after the immunosuppressants are withdrawn.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1292324843\"><span class=\"h1\">SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Uterus transplantation is a complex, multi-step process that involves a uterus donor, uterus recipient, and genetic father (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F110961\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef110961 \">figure 1</a>). (See <a href=\"#H1338124891\" class=\"local\">'Surgery'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The uterus can be removed from either a living or deceased donor. The procedure for uterus removal from a living donor is similar to a radical-type hysterectomy in that the ligaments and vessels are ligated as far laterally as possible to ensure long vascular pedicles for transplantation (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F111227\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef111227 \">figure 2</a>). In removing the uterus from a deceased donor, the organ can be removed with longer vascular pedicles than in living uterus donation. Transection of the ureters simplifies the surgery in a deceased donor. The uterus is typically removed with the uterine vessels intact and attached to the internal iliac vessels, and potentially to the common iliac vessels (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F111067\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef111067 \">figure 3</a>). (See <a href=\"#H2094209072\" class=\"local\">'Uterus removal'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The surgery on the organ recipient is not begun until approximately 30 minutes before the predicted time for organ removal from the donor and once the surgeons have confirmed that the graft is well perfused by the remaining isolated vascular pedicles. For women without a uterus (the majority of recipient women), the initial surgery involves separation of the bladder and the rectum from the vaginal vault. For women who have a uterus in place (eg, women with Asherman syndrome), a traditional total hysterectomy is performed with removal of the fallopian tubes. For women with rudimentary uterus or similar structure above the vaginal vault (eg, women with Mayer-Rokitansky-K&uuml;ster-Hauser syndrome), the rudimentary uterus is cleaved. (See <a href=\"#H4188382595\" class=\"local\">'Procedure'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The major intraoperative risk for the uterus recipient is anastomotic leakage. Leakage is typically immediately visible and is repaired with polypropylene suture. The routine surgical risks for the recipient are similar to those of the donor and include wound infection and bleeding. A complication that is unique to the graft recipient is the thrombosis of any uterine vessel anastomoses. (See <a href=\"#H2633441968\" class=\"local\">'Complications'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The most serious postoperative complications of the grafted uterus are rejection, thrombosis, and infection. When detected early, organ rejection can often be reversed with a temporary increase in maintenance immunosuppression or a short course of corticosteroids. While the data are limited, thrombosis of the uterine arteries and veins appears to occur occasionally in this early phase after uterus transplantation. Ultrasound and cross-sectional imaging techniques are effective at detecting clots in the graft's vessels. A transplanted uterus may be more susceptible to intrauterine infection because of the immunosuppressed state of the recipient. Antibiotic prophylaxis is given prior to the start of the surgery, which may be expanded to include antifungal agents in the future.
