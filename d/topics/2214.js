Passage of legislation in multiple states in the United States regarding mammogram reporting of breast density and follow-up for women with dense breasts has led to renewed discussion about the optimal screening protocol for early detection of breast cancer in women who have dense breast tissue on mammography [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/breast-density-and-screening-for-breast-cancer/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>].</p><p>This topic will discuss the classification of breast density and indications for supplemental testing. Screening for breast cancer and breast imaging are discussed elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=screening-for-breast-cancer-strategies-and-recommendations\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Screening for breast cancer: Strategies and recommendations&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=screening-for-breast-cancer-evidence-for-effectiveness-and-harms\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Screening for breast cancer: Evidence for effectiveness and harms&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=breast-imaging-for-cancer-screening-mammography-and-ultrasonography\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Breast imaging for cancer screening: Mammography and ultrasonography&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1339759230\"><span class=\"h1\">DEFINITION AND CLASSIFICATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Breast tissue comprises skin, blood vessels, ductal and stromal elements of the glands (which appear radio-opaque or white on mammography), and fat (which appears radiolucent or black on mammography). Mammographic breast density is defined as the relative amount of radio-opaque (white) elements to radiolucent (black) fat on the image. Increase in the proportion of radio-opaque elements leads to greater mammographic breast density.</p><p>Increased breast density may obscure the detection of a benign mass or, more importantly, a breast cancer. Reduced sensitivity of mammography in younger women in part is related to increased mammographic density due to a higher proportion of breast epithelial and stromal elements in younger breasts [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/breast-density-and-screening-for-breast-cancer/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].</p><p>Breast density does not correlate with physical exam findings [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/breast-density-and-screening-for-breast-cancer/abstract/4,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,5</a>]. Breast density is a radiologic finding and cannot be predicted without obtaining a mammogram [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/breast-density-and-screening-for-breast-cancer/abstract/6,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,7</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2815442972\"><span class=\"h2\">Factors affecting breast density measurement</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There is much variation in the physical composition of the breast. Differing proportions of fat, connective tissue, and ductal and lobular elements contribute to differences in mammographic breast density. Mammographic density is not related to the size or firmness of the breast [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/breast-density-and-screening-for-breast-cancer/abstract/4,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,5</a>]. Breast density is greater in younger women and also varies with menopausal status, genetic factors, parity, use of estrogen, use of chemoprevention (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=tamoxifen-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">tamoxifen</a>), and body habitus [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/breast-density-and-screening-for-breast-cancer/abstract/8,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,9</a>]. There is also operator dependence in interpreting breast density on mammography [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/breast-density-and-screening-for-breast-cancer/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>].</p><p>Breast density can vary during different phases of the menstrual cycle, with slightly increased density in the luteal as compared with the follicular phase [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/breast-density-and-screening-for-breast-cancer/abstract/11,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,12</a>]. This suggests that mammographic sensitivity may be slightly improved in menstruating women by obtaining mammograms during the follicular phase (ie, first and second weeks after menses), particularly for women who have ever used oral contraceptives [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/breast-density-and-screening-for-breast-cancer/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>].</p><p>Use of menopausal hormone therapy slows the age-related change from dense to fatty breast tissue. In a longitudinal study, this was more pronounced for women taking combination estrogen and progestin than for those taking estrogen alone [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/breast-density-and-screening-for-breast-cancer/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. Short-term (one to two months) cessation of hormone therapy prior to mammography, although advised by some clinicians, had no effect on mammographic recall rates in a randomized trial [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/breast-density-and-screening-for-breast-cancer/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>].</p><p>Breast density is inversely related to patient age, and dense breasts are most commonly associated with women under age 50 or who are premenopausal. An international cross-sectional study showed that breast density declines are greatest during transition to menopause [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/breast-density-and-screening-for-breast-cancer/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. However, many older women still have dense breasts (up to 44 percent of women in their 60s and 36 percent of women in their 70s) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/breast-density-and-screening-for-breast-cancer/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>].</p><p>Finally, there is evidence that interpreting breast density may be somewhat subjective, with variation across different radiologists. In a retrospective study of approximately 217,000 mammograms interpreted by 83 radiologists, 37 percent of mammograms overall were rated as showing dense breasts [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/breast-density-and-screening-for-breast-cancer/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. Across radiologists, this percentage ranged from 6 to 85 percent. Among patients with consecutive mammograms read by different radiologists, 17 percent had discordant results in regards to dense versus nondense state.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H748000470\"><span class=\"h2\">Classifying breast density</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There are several ways to report mammographic breast density. The most commonly used method is the Breast Imaging Reporting and Data System (BI-RADS), fifth edition, in which the determination of breast density is made by the radiologist using visual assessment that is subject to inter-rater variability.</p><p>Computerized quantification programs are available, but are used largely as research tools. As these objective computer-based methods are not widely adopted, most state laws requiring breast density notification to patients are based on the less reproducible method of visual assessment.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3792719\"><span class=\"h3\">BI-RADS classification</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>BI-RADS is based on a scale that identifies breast tissue density as being in one of four categories [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/breast-density-and-screening-for-breast-cancer/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A &ndash; Almost entirely fatty</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>B &ndash; Scattered areas of fibroglandular density</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>C &ndash; Heterogeneously dense (may obscure small masses)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>D &ndash; Extremely dense (lowers the sensitivity of mammography)</p><p/><p>Mammographic examples of each of these categories of breast density are shown in the radiograph (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F107388\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef107388 \">image 1</a>). For most purposes, the term &quot;dense breasts&quot; refers to either heterogeneously dense or extremely dense breasts (categories c or d), accounting for approximately 47 to 50 percent of women in the general United States screening population [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/breast-density-and-screening-for-breast-cancer/abstract/18,19\" class=\"abstract_t\">18,19</a>].</p><p>Earlier editions of BI-RADS used percentages of dense tissue relative to fat to report a quartile (&lt;25 percent, 25 to 50 percent, 50 to 75 percent, and &gt;75 percent dense). The 2012 fifth edition BI-RADS lexicon assigns breast density based on the presence of any patch of dense tissue [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/breast-density-and-screening-for-breast-cancer/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>].</p><p>There is moderate interobserver and intraobserver variability in reporting breast density on mammography, especially between the categories of heterogeneously dense and scattered areas of fibroglandular density [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/breast-density-and-screening-for-breast-cancer/abstract/17,20-22\" class=\"abstract_t\">17,20-22</a>]. In addition to issues related to subjective assessment of mammographic dense tissue, breast density can vary over time, especially with changes in weight or hormonal status (phase of menstrual cycle, postmenopausal versus premenopausal, or exogenous hormone use) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/breast-density-and-screening-for-breast-cancer/abstract/11,23-26\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,23-26</a>]. In one study, in which &quot;dense&quot; was considered category c or d and &quot;nondense&quot; was considered category a or b, 13 to 19 percent of women were reclassified as dense or not dense on their subsequent mammogram [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/breast-density-and-screening-for-breast-cancer/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1339759328\"><span class=\"h3\">Computer-based breast density assessment</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Several computer quantification software programs are available to assess breast density objectively, but these are primarily used for research purposes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/breast-density-and-screening-for-breast-cancer/abstract/18,28,29\" class=\"abstract_t\">18,28,29</a>]. Although early quantification systems derived the calculation from two-dimensional mammographic images, newer methods calculate volumetric breast density, taking into account factors such as breast compression thickness [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/breast-density-and-screening-for-breast-cancer/abstract/30-33\" class=\"abstract_t\">30-33</a>]. Volumetric measurements are more reproducible than visual assessment methods, thus minimizing inter-reader and intra-reader agreement. Both measurements rely on positioning of the breast, which can vary between examinations related to patient and technologist factors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/breast-density-and-screening-for-breast-cancer/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>]. Three-dimensional methods of density assessment using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or other imaging tools are also being developed.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1339759335\"><span class=\"h1\">BREAST DENSITY AND BREAST CANCER RISK</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The presence of dense breast tissue on mammography affects breast cancer risk in two ways: dense tissue can obscure an underlying cancer, decreasing the sensitivity of mammography to detect small lesions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/breast-density-and-screening-for-breast-cancer/abstract/35-38\" class=\"abstract_t\">35-38</a>]; and increased density is an independent risk factor for breast cancer [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/breast-density-and-screening-for-breast-cancer/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>], as most cancers develop in the glandular parenchyma. However, increased breast density is not associated with increased mortality from breast cancer [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/breast-density-and-screening-for-breast-cancer/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>].</p><p>While increased breast density is an independent risk factor for breast cancer, the extent to which breast density affects risk for breast cancer is not absolutely established. The best estimates are that, compared with the general population, the relative risk of developing breast cancer is 1.2 for women with heterogeneously dense breasts and 2.1 for women with extremely dense breasts [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/breast-density-and-screening-for-breast-cancer/abstract/41,42\" class=\"abstract_t\">41,42</a>]. Reports indicating a relative risk of four- to sixfold are based on a comparison of women in the 90<sup>th</sup> percentile to women in the 10<sup>th</sup> percentile for breast density [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/breast-density-and-screening-for-breast-cancer/abstract/37,43,44\" class=\"abstract_t\">37,43,44</a>], which inflates the risk and does not represent the average population [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/breast-density-and-screening-for-breast-cancer/abstract/45\" class=\"abstract_t\">45</a>]. Absolute risk, rather than relative risk, is a more meaningful reflection of the impact of breast density. In terms of absolute risk, a 45-year-old woman with average breast density, no family history of breast cancer, and no prior breast biopsy has a 0.7 percent five-year breast cancer risk compared with a woman with similar characteristics, except for extremely dense breast tissue, whose five-year breast cancer risk is 1.3 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/breast-density-and-screening-for-breast-cancer/abstract/46\" class=\"abstract_t\">46</a>].</p><p>The relative risk conferred by breast density in part depends on a woman's other risk factors for breast cancer.

The sensitivity of mammography is inversely correlated with breast density, especially with older film-screen analog techniques [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/breast-density-and-screening-for-breast-cancer/abstract/53\" class=\"abstract_t\">53</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1037635246\"><span class=\"h2\">Digital mammography</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Digital mammography is more sensitive than film mammography for dense breasts [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/breast-density-and-screening-for-breast-cancer/abstract/54,55\" class=\"abstract_t\">54,55</a>] and is preferred (when available) for women with increased breast density [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/breast-density-and-screening-for-breast-cancer/abstract/56\" class=\"abstract_t\">56</a>]. In the United States, digital mammography has largely replaced film mammography [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/breast-density-and-screening-for-breast-cancer/abstract/57\" class=\"abstract_t\">57</a>]. Data from the Breast Cancer Screening Consortium (BCSC), a database of multiple screening programs in the United States, showed that in women with fatty or scattered fibroglandular breasts, the sensitivity of film-screen mammography is 85 to 86 percent but decreases to 79 percent in women with heterogeneously dense breasts and further decreases to 68.1 percent in women with extremely dense breasts [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/breast-density-and-screening-for-breast-cancer/abstract/58\" class=\"abstract_t\">58</a>]. Using digital mammography, the sensitivity of mammography was similar for women without dense breasts (78.3 to 86.6 percent) and for women with heterogeneously and extremely dense breasts (82.1 to 83.6 percent).

For average-risk women, there is no need for additional supplemental screening with other modalities when DBT is performed as the initial screening examination.</p><p>If women who have dense breasts have access to tomosynthesis screening, some experts suggest tomosynthesis may be preferred over standard mammography, although this is not the standard of care, as only 22 percent of United States facilities have this technology and it is not universally covered by insurance providers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/breast-density-and-screening-for-breast-cancer/abstract/60\" class=\"abstract_t\">60</a>].

(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=breast-imaging-for-cancer-screening-mammography-and-ultrasonography\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Breast imaging for cancer screening: Mammography and ultrasonography&quot;</a>.)</p><p>DBT takes a series of low-dose mammograms at various angles over the breast that are then reconstructed to represent multiple thin (usually 1 mm) slices in the same plane as the mammogram [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/breast-density-and-screening-for-breast-cancer/abstract/61,62\" class=\"abstract_t\">61,62</a>]. Tomosynthesis systems in use in 2016 often acquire both a digital mammogram and a three-dimensional image, resulting in double the patient radiation exposure compared with mammography alone. This &quot;double-radiation exposure,&quot; however, still falls below the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) radiation dose limits for standard mammography. Software has been developed to reconstruct the digital mammogram from the three-dimensional dataset, thereby lowering radiation dose to levels comparable with a conventional mammogram, but this software is vendor-dependent and not always used in the United States. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=breast-imaging-for-cancer-screening-mammography-and-ultrasonography\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Breast imaging for cancer screening: Mammography and ultrasonography&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Although no randomized controlled trials comparing DBT and digital mammography in women with dense breasts have been performed, clinical studies suggest that, compared with digital mammography, screening DBT has equal or greater sensitivity for cancer detection while decreasing the recall rate from screening mammography [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/breast-density-and-screening-for-breast-cancer/abstract/63-70\" class=\"abstract_t\">63-70</a>]. In one prospective observational study including approximately 2600 women with dense breasts, three-dimensional (3D) mammography detected an additional 5.4 to 6.2 cases of cancer per 1000 screens performed in women with dense breasts [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/breast-density-and-screening-for-breast-cancer/abstract/71\" class=\"abstract_t\">71</a>].</p><p>Emerging studies suggest that DBT may have the greatest effect at reducing false-positives in women with dense breasts and may have the greatest impact on improving cancer detection in women with heterogeneously dense breasts [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/breast-density-and-screening-for-breast-cancer/abstract/66,68,72,73\" class=\"abstract_t\">66,68,72,73</a>].

While breast ultrasound detected even more occult cancers (7.1 per 1000 screens, 95% CI 4.2-10.0), more than half of additional breast cancers in women with dense breasts could be detected by DBT.

Automated breast ultrasound uses an automated transducer to standardize image acquisition; however, these automated systems are not widely available. In either approach, the breast is systematically scanned in orthogonal planes, and selected images are recorded. Although the majority of studies assessing the use of ultrasound for supplemental screening in women with dense breasts have been performed with handheld ultrasound, limited initial data of automated ultrasound suggest that the two types of ultrasound are comparable for supplemental screening [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/breast-density-and-screening-for-breast-cancer/abstract/75\" class=\"abstract_t\">75</a>].</p><p>Whole-breast ultrasound screening can detect early-stage breast cancers that are mammographically occult in women with dense breast tissue, but the additional screening test carries a substantial risk for false-positive results.

Multiple factors contribute to breast density in women, including age, genetics, body habitus, parity, use of estrogen, and phase of the menstrual cycle. Dense breasts are found in approximately 50 percent of women undergoing mammography, including up to 44 percent of women in their 60s. (See <a href=\"#H2815442972\" class=\"local\">'Factors affecting breast density measurement'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For most purposes, the term &quot;dense breasts&quot; refers to either heterogeneously dense or extremely dense breasts (categories c or d of the Breast Imaging Reporting and Data System [BI-RADS], fifth edition). There is variability in classification of breast density, however, with 13 to 19 percent of women recategorized between &quot;dense&quot; and &quot;nondense&quot; breasts on sequential screenings. Methodology to allow more objective breast density assessment is not widely implemented. (See <a href=\"#H3792719\" class=\"local\">'BI-RADS classification'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The presence of dense breast tissue on mammography both decreases the sensitivity of mammography and increases the risk of breast cancer, as most cancers develop in the glandular parenchyma. However, increased breast density has not been associated with increased mortality from breast cancer. (See <a href=\"#H1339759335\" class=\"local\">'Breast density and breast cancer risk'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Digital mammography is more sensitive than film mammography for dense breasts and is preferred, when available, for women with increased breast density. Digital breast tomosynthesis (DBT) compared with digital mammography may decrease the recall rate for women with dense breasts but may somewhat increase the radiation exposure rate, depending on the type of tomography available. (See <a href=\"#H1037635246\" class=\"local\">'Digital mammography'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>If women who have dense breasts have access to tomosynthesis screening, there are limited data to suggest tomosynthesis may be preferred over standard mammography, especially in women with heterogeneously dense breasts, although this is not yet the standard of care (see <a href=\"#H2565592038\" class=\"local\">'Digital breast tomosynthesis'</a> above). Women should be counseled, however, regarding insurance coverage of this screening exam. If a woman does not have access to tomosynthesis, screening mammography remains the standard of care.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>There are no large prospective studies to support whole-breast ultrasound screening of average-risk women with dense breast tissue on mammography. Nonetheless, in the United States, many states have adopted dense breast legislation requiring that patients be informed of their breast density, that dense breast tissue may be a risk factor for breast cancer, and that dense tissue may interfere with cancer detection. Some laws specifically recommend supplemental screening with ultrasound, but only some of those states mandate insurance coverage for this additional screening.

The addition of ultrasonography to mammography increases sensitivity for small cancers but greatly decreases specificity. In studies of supplemental screening with ultrasound, greater than 90 percent of positive test results were false-positive. Supplemental screening with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is also limited by high false-positives and additionally by higher cost, lack of wide availability, and potential adverse reactions to contrast medium. (See <a href=\"#H2852895389\" class=\"local\">'Modalities for supplemental screening'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We suggest that most women with dense breasts and no additional risk factors for breast cancer <strong>not</strong> undergo supplemental screening (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). After discussion of the potential risks and benefits associated with such screening, some women may reasonably opt to have supplemental screening. For low-risk women who choose to undergo supplemental screening, given its lower cost and availability of more data in this population, ultrasound is preferred to MRI.
