Unfortunately, because of the late presentation of the disease, only 15 to 20 percent of patients are candidates for pancreatectomy. The prognosis of pancreatic cancer is poor even in those with potentially resectable disease, and despite progress in surgical techniques and adjuvant therapy, the evidence that outcomes are improving over time is equivocal. (See <a href=\"#H8\" class=\"local\">'Outcomes of pancreaticoduodenectomy'</a> below and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-for-potentially-resectable-exocrine-pancreatic-cancer\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment for potentially resectable exocrine pancreatic cancer&quot;</a>.)</p><p>However, in a study of the National Cancer Database, among those who were candidates for resection of pancreatic cancer, 38 percent were not offered surgery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-surgery-in-the-treatment-of-exocrine-pancreatic-cancer-and-prognosis/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Underutilization of surgery for early-stage pancreatic cancer may be related to socioeconomic factors as well as physician pessimism regarding the prognosis of the disease. </p><p>Preoperative imaging evaluation determines candidacy for resection. Radiographic staging and the role of endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) are discussed in detail elsewhere.

Tumors with limited involvement of the major peripancreatic vessels such as the superior mesenteric vein, portal vein, superior mesenteric artery, or hepatic artery may be technically resectable. However, the impact of more aggressive resections (particularly arterial resection) on long-term prognosis is controversial. (See <a href=\"#H163631811\" class=\"local\">'Vascular resection'</a> below and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=surgical-resection-of-lesions-of-the-head-of-the-pancreas#H176949526\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Surgical resection of lesions of the head of the pancreas&quot;, section on 'Vascular evaluation'</a>.)</p><p>Some cases are considered &quot;borderline&quot; resectable, although the definition is variable. Some reserve the term &quot;borderline resectable&quot; for cases where there is focal (less than one-half of the circumference) tumor abutment of the visceral arteries or short-segment occlusion of the superior mesenteric vein (SMV) or <span class=\"nowrap\">SMV/portal</span> vein confluence. Others suggest that venous narrowing without occlusion should be included in the definition of borderline resectable disease. Encasement (more than one-half of the vein circumference) or occlusion of the SMV or the SMV-portal vein confluence was previously considered unresectable. However, many centers have demonstrated the feasibility of SMV reconstruction, and provided venous reconstruction is possible, this is now considered by many to represent borderline resectable disease. Although vein resection adds a measure of complexity to pancreaticoduodenectomy, an experienced surgical team in a high-volume center can safely perform such a resection when it is required. Several groups have issued guidelines to define borderline resectable disease based upon imaging studies. This subject is discussed in detail elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-staging-of-exocrine-pancreatic-cancer#H1472388\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and staging of exocrine pancreatic cancer&quot;, section on 'Definitions of unresectable and borderline resectable disease'</a> and <a href=\"#H163631811\" class=\"local\">'Vascular resection'</a> below.)</p><p>Patients who have borderline resectable or locally advanced unresectable pancreatic cancer, but no metastatic disease, are potential candidates for downstaging with neoadjuvant therapy and should be referred for medical oncology and radiation therapy consultation.

However, the management of patients with isolated positive peritoneal washings at the time of staging laparoscopy is controversial. The presence of these cells is associated with a worse prognosis in patients with otherwise resectable disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-surgery-in-the-treatment-of-exocrine-pancreatic-cancer-and-prognosis/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>], and the American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) tumor, node, metastasis (TNM) staging system considers positive peritoneal washings to represent distant metastatic disease (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F111135\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef111135 \">table 1</a>). In general, most patients who have cytologically positive washings have other findings that suggest advanced disease and unresectability such as extensive ascites <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> the presence of metastases in the liver, pelvis, or omentum. However, if these are absent, most pancreatic surgeons would not rely solely upon the results of peritoneal washings obtained at the time of laparoscopy to guide decision making regarding resectability.

Radiographically occult metastases (&lt;1 cm in diameter) on the surface of the liver or peritoneum, which are rarely visible by computed tomography (CT), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), or transabdominal ultrasound, may be visualized laparoscopically. This also includes patients with a tumor of the body or tail of the pancreas who appear to have potentially resectable disease by CT scan (one-half of whom will have occult peritoneal metastases), large (&gt;3 cm) primary tumors, any patient for whom high-quality imaging is in any way suggestive of occult metastatic disease, and those with a high initial CA 19-9 level (&gt;100 <span class=\"nowrap\">units/mL)</span>.</p><p>A selective approach to staging laparoscopy maximizes yield by limiting the procedure to those with the highest likelihood of occult metastatic disease.

In practice, jaundiced patients may have already undergone biliary stenting before resectability or the time frame for resection have been determined, given that they are frequently initially seen by a gastroenterologist.

Conventional pancreaticoduodenectomy (ie, Whipple procedure) involves removal of the pancreatic head, duodenum, first 15 cm of the jejunum, common bile duct, and gallbladder, and a partial gastrectomy (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F82519\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef82519 \">figure 2</a>). Modifications of the conventional pancreaticoduodenectomy procedure have been developed in an attempt to improve outcomes or minimize the morbidity associated with the operation. These include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pylorus-preserving pancreaticoduodenectomy &ndash; Pylorus-preserving pancreaticoduodenectomy preserves the gastric antrum, pylorus, and the proximal 3 to 6 cm of the duodenum, which is anastomosed to the jejunum to restore gastrointestinal continuity (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F60689\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef60689 \">figure 3</a>). The procedure may decrease the incidence of postoperative dumping, marginal ulceration, and bile reflux gastritis that can occur in some patients undergoing partial gastrectomy. The available data suggest that, for suitable cases, perioperative morbidity and mortality and long-term survival are not adversely affected using a pylorus-preserving technique.

However, even with the available technology, minimally invasive pancreaticoduodenectomy is a complex operation that is only suited for selected patients. Robotic-assisted pancreaticoduodenectomy has not reduced rates of perioperative morbidity (eg, pancreatic fistula) or mortality [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-surgery-in-the-treatment-of-exocrine-pancreatic-cancer-and-prognosis/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].

(See <a href=\"#H284616662\" class=\"local\">'Candidates for resection'</a> above.)</p><p>Because of these issues and the inability to consistently determine the presence or absence of tumor adherence or invasion preoperatively, practice guidelines have suggested making decisions about vascular resection at the time of surgery after the pancreatic neck has been divided [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-surgery-in-the-treatment-of-exocrine-pancreatic-cancer-and-prognosis/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. Although this is a controversial area, our position is that pancreaticoduodenectomy with portal vein (PV) or superior mesenteric vein (SMV) resection and reconstruction should be considered a standard approach for pancreatic adenocarcinomas that focally involve the PV or SMV, provided that adequate inflow and outflow veins are present, the tumor does not involve the superior mesenteric artery or hepatic artery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-surgery-in-the-treatment-of-exocrine-pancreatic-cancer-and-prognosis/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>], and an <span class=\"nowrap\">R0/R1</span> resection can be accomplished [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-surgery-in-the-treatment-of-exocrine-pancreatic-cancer-and-prognosis/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. By contrast, we do not advocate arterial resection and reconstruction. These resections (mostly the superior mesenteric and hepatic arteries) are performed infrequently, and few data are available to support the practice [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-surgery-in-the-treatment-of-exocrine-pancreatic-cancer-and-prognosis/abstract/11-13\" class=\"abstract_t\">11-13</a>]. Morbidity and mortality increases markedly when arterial resection and reconstruction is performed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-surgery-in-the-treatment-of-exocrine-pancreatic-cancer-and-prognosis/abstract/14,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">14,15</a>]. </p><p>The available data suggest that patients with tumors involving the PV appear to be no more likely to have positive lymph nodes or poor prognostic histologic parameters (eg, aneuploidy) than those without portal vein involvement, suggesting that vein invasion is a function of tumor location rather than an indicator of aggressive tumor biology [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-surgery-in-the-treatment-of-exocrine-pancreatic-cancer-and-prognosis/abstract/16-18\" class=\"abstract_t\">16-18</a>]. Whether perioperative mortality rates are different is unclear:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Single-center reports that largely reflect highly selected patients treated at high-volume institutions report similar morbidity and perioperative mortality rates and comparable survival durations of patients who undergo venous resection and reconstruction versus those who do not, as long as a macroscopically complete (R0 or R1) resection has been accomplished [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-surgery-in-the-treatment-of-exocrine-pancreatic-cancer-and-prognosis/abstract/19-21\" class=\"abstract_t\">19-21</a>]. A systematic review of 12 such reports concluded that portal <span class=\"nowrap\">vein/superior</span> mesenteric vein resection combined with pancreatectomy is a safe and feasible procedure that increases the number of patients who undergo curative resection and therefore provides important survival benefits to selected groups of patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-surgery-in-the-treatment-of-exocrine-pancreatic-cancer-and-prognosis/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>However, in contrast to these data from single-center analyses, analysis of data on 3582 patients undergoing pancreatectomy for pancreatic cancer and derived from the American College of Surgeons National Surgical Quality Improvement Program database suggests significantly higher rates of postoperative morbidity (39.9 versus 33.3 percent) and mortality (5.7 versus 2.9 percent) in patients who undergo pancreaticoduodenectomy with, as compared to without, vascular resection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-surgery-in-the-treatment-of-exocrine-pancreatic-cancer-and-prognosis/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. This database includes patients treated at institutions with different levels of expertise, and it is likely that in many, if not most, cases the vascular resection was unplanned.

The analysis was limited by differences in the ranges of lymphadenectomy from several studies, differences in the proportion of patients with different adjuvant therapies, and differences in the diagnostic criteria used for complications and overall mortality.

This typically occurs when a tumor of the pancreatic head extends into the body or tail of the pancreas. Total pancreatectomy also plays a role in the treatment of some main-duct intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms (IPMNs), which may involve the entire length of the pancreatic duct, either continuously or in a multifocal fashion. When both types of pancreatic resection would provide a tumor-free margin, total pancreatectomy provides no additional benefit.

The most important prognostic factor for completely resected patients is nodal status. Five-year survival after pancreaticoduodenectomy is only approximately 10 percent for node-positive disease (even if only one node is positive [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-surgery-in-the-treatment-of-exocrine-pancreatic-cancer-and-prognosis/abstract/72\" class=\"abstract_t\">72</a>]), while it is approximately 30 percent for node-negative disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-surgery-in-the-treatment-of-exocrine-pancreatic-cancer-and-prognosis/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. </p><p>Tumor stage is the most important prognostic factor.

This was illustrated in a retrospective analysis of 1822 patients undergoing curative-intent surgery for pancreatic cancer at Johns Hopkins between 1970 and 2008 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-surgery-in-the-treatment-of-exocrine-pancreatic-cancer-and-prognosis/abstract/74\" class=\"abstract_t\">74</a>].

Patients with high lymph node ratios (the number of metastatic divided by the total number of resected nodes) or positive margins saw the greatest increases in two-year conditional survival as more time elapsed since treatment. </p><p>In addition to stage, other factors that influence prognosis after resection are the status of the surgical margins (involved or uninvolved), possibly the width of the surgical margin, tumor differentiation and the presence or absence of lymphatic invasion within the tumor, both preoperative and postoperative serum CA 19-9 levels, and cigarette smoking [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-surgery-in-the-treatment-of-exocrine-pancreatic-cancer-and-prognosis/abstract/20,36-39,75-83\" class=\"abstract_t\">20,36-39,75-83</a>].
