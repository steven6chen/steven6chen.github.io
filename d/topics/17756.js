The anterior tonsillar pillars and glossotonsillar folds serve as the lateral boundaries between the oral cavity and oropharynx.</p><p>Sites of origin of oral cavity cancer include the lip, floor of the mouth, oral tongue (anterior two-thirds of the tongue), lower alveolar ridge, upper alveolar ridge, retromolar trigone (retromolar gingiva), hard palate, and buccal mucosa (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F54845\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef54845 \">figure 1</a>). Rarely, an oral cavity cancer can originate within the mandible (eg, osteosarcoma). Most odontogenic lesions, including the vast majority of ameloblastoma, do not metastasize or involve lymph nodes, although they may be locally destructive.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H88481214\"><span class=\"h1\">EPIDEMIOLOGY AND RISK FACTORS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There are an estimated 200,000 cases of oral cavity cancer worldwide each year, which cause an estimated 100,000 deaths [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-stage-i-and-ii-early-head-and-neck-cancer-the-oral-cavity/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Oral cavity tumors often present with local invasion, tissue destruction, and lymph node metastases, but do not often have distant metastases at presentation. </p><p>Tobacco smoking and alcohol use are the principal risk factors for developing oral cavity squamous cell carcinoma in the western world. The chewing of betel nut quid is a significant factor throughout Asia and India. Oral tobacco use, periodontal disease, radiation, and immune deficiency have also been implicated [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-stage-i-and-ii-early-head-and-neck-cancer-the-oral-cavity/abstract/2-4\" class=\"abstract_t\">2-4</a>]. Sun exposure (ultraviolet radiation) is an important etiologic factor for squamous cell cancer involving the lip, and oral tobacco and betel nut quid chewing are important risk factors for buccal mucosa cancers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-stage-i-and-ii-early-head-and-neck-cancer-the-oral-cavity/abstract/4,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,5</a>].

However, the percentage of oral cavity cancers associated with HPV infection is significantly less, and the majority of p16 positive tumors in this location will be negative for HPV unless they originate near the circumvallate papillae [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-stage-i-and-ii-early-head-and-neck-cancer-the-oral-cavity/abstract/6,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,7</a>]. A possible etiologic relationship is unclear, as are the prognostic implications of HPV infection in patients with oral cavity squamous cell carcinoma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-stage-i-and-ii-early-head-and-neck-cancer-the-oral-cavity/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. Routine HPV testing of oral cavity cancer is not recommend. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=human-papillomavirus-associated-head-and-neck-cancer#H3735797819\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Human papillomavirus associated head and neck cancer&quot;, section on 'Non-oropharyngeal carcinoma'</a>.) </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">OVERVIEW OF APPROACH TO ORAL CAVITY CANCERS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The diagnosis of oral cavity cancer requires a tissue diagnosis from a biopsy or needle aspiration specimen. A biopsy is not a definitive procedure and should not obliterate the site of the lesion but, rather, simply obtain tissue adequate for a diagnosis. Once the diagnosis is made, careful evaluation is required prior to treatment to assess the extent of locoregional disease, as well as possible regional or distant metastasis.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1872876309\"><span class=\"h2\">Staging</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The tumor, node, metastases (TNM) staging system of the American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) and the Union for International Cancer Control (UICC) is used to classify lip and oral cavity carcinoma (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F110767\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef110767 \">table 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-stage-i-and-ii-early-head-and-neck-cancer-the-oral-cavity/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. By definition, patients with early (stage I and II) disease have tumors &lt;4 cm in greatest dimension without deep invasion into surrounding structures and have no evidence of lymph node involvement. Patients with more extensive local disease, regional lymph node involvement, or distant metastasis have stage III or IV disease. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-the-diagnosis-and-staging-of-head-and-neck-cancer\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of the diagnosis and staging of head and neck cancer&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H854309770\"><span class=\"h2\">Pretreatment evaluation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Tumor size, the extent or depth of invasion, and the presence or absence of regional lymph node metastases are critical for planning treatment. The depth of invasion of early stage squamous cell carcinoma involving the oral tongue is particularly difficult to assess preoperatively. Oral cavity cancers tend to invade soft tissue early in their natural history; involvement of bone is usually limited to larger tumors, except for those that originate in gingival mucosa. Therefore, pretreatment imaging is required in addition to a thorough inspection and palpation of the oral cavity.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Computed tomography (CT) with intravenous contrast is widely used to detect bone invasion; CT has largely replaced older techniques, such as plain radiography and panoramic radiography of the maxilla and mandible.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) may complement or replace CT scanning by providing better visualization of soft tissue involvement and gross perineural spread while also having good accuracy in detecting bone invasion. Whereas CT scanning may be limited by metallic dental restorations and cortical defects, MRI is limited by motion artifact and inflammatory reactions.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Combined positron emission tomography <span class=\"nowrap\">(PET)/CT</span> scans may add accuracy in evaluating the extent of the primary tumor and aid in target delineation if definitive radiation therapy (RT) is being considered. PET scanning may help to identify pathologically involved lymph nodes or to clarify the status of suspicious nodes on CT or MRI that do not meet traditional size-based criteria for classification as being abnormal [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-stage-i-and-ii-early-head-and-neck-cancer-the-oral-cavity/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Sentinel lymph node biopsy is an emerging technique that may provide an additional option for the assessment of regional lymph node nodes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-stage-i-and-ii-early-head-and-neck-cancer-the-oral-cavity/abstract/11-13\" class=\"abstract_t\">11-13</a>].</p><p/><p>If these initial pretreatment evaluation studies identify lymph node involvement or invasion of deeper structures, this constitutes stage III or IV disease. </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients with stage I or II disease, surgery is generally preferred over RT because of the decreased morbidity associated with this approach, although well-designed controlled clinical trials are lacking in this area, and this recommendation, therefore, has largely been based upon clinical experience. Treatment choice also needs to consider the specific site of the primary tumor, as well as the potential need for treatment of the neck. (See <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Management of primary tumor'</a> below and <a href=\"#H14\" class=\"local\">'Management of the neck'</a> below and <a href=\"#H88481623\" class=\"local\">'Specific tumor sites'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients with stage III or IV oral cavity cancer, treatment needs to be directed against both the primary tumor and neck. The management of these patients is discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-locoregionally-advanced-stage-iii-and-iv-head-and-neck-cancer-the-oral-cavity\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of locoregionally advanced (stage III and IV) head and neck cancer: The oral cavity&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h1\">MANAGEMENT OF PRIMARY TUMOR</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Primary surgery and definitive radiation therapy (RT) are both options for patients with early stage oral cavity cancer. Outcomes with primary surgery and definitive RT appear to be similar based upon retrospective studies, but the two modalities have not been compared in randomized trials.</p><p>Surgery is generally preferred because it is typically associated with less long-term morbidity than RT. Definitive RT is reserved for patients who cannot tolerate surgery or for whom surgical resection would result in particularly severe functional impairment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-stage-i-and-ii-early-head-and-neck-cancer-the-oral-cavity/abstract/14,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">14,15</a>]. The latter circumstance is uncommon in stage I and II oral tongue and floor of mouth primaries but is sometimes applicable to early tumors of the retromolar trigone and lip since external RT can achieve similar outcomes to surgery with acceptable morbidity.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Surgery</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Traditional surgical approaches are generally used for patients with early stage oral cavity cancer. Although minimally invasive surgery, such as transoral laser resection or robotic surgery, has been used, the relative advantages of one surgical technique versus another have not been well established [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-stage-i-and-ii-early-head-and-neck-cancer-the-oral-cavity/abstract/16,17\" class=\"abstract_t\">16,17</a>]. The primary benefit of minimally invasive technology is its ability to access structures such as the oropharynx and larynx, which are not easily approached with standard instruments. However, early stage oral cavity tumors are usually accessible via traditional transoral approaches.</p><p>Most early stage oral cavity cancers can be excised without major, long-term, functional or cosmetic deformity. Swallowing function is generally excellent with appropriate reconstruction and postoperative rehabilitation. Likewise, short-term perturbations in speech (eg, difficulty pronouncing the letter &quot;t&quot; after tongue surgery) can be corrected to normal or near-normal function. As an example, an oral cavity cancer patient employed in telephone sales would generally be expected to be able to return to full-time work within three months of surgery.</p><p>Every attempt should be made to ensure negative resection margins since positive margins are associated with a worse prognosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-stage-i-and-ii-early-head-and-neck-cancer-the-oral-cavity/abstract/18,19\" class=\"abstract_t\">18,19</a>]. If feasible, reresection of any positive margin is preferred. Otherwise, postoperative RT, with or without chemotherapy, is indicated. Close margins, typically defined as less than 5 mm, may also portend a worse prognosis. (See <a href=\"#H15\" class=\"local\">'Adjuvant therapy'</a> below.)</p><p>Acute surgical complications can include infection, bleeding, aspiration, wound breakdown, flap loss, and fistula [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-stage-i-and-ii-early-head-and-neck-cancer-the-oral-cavity/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. Surgical procedures such as hemiglossectomy, maxillectomy, and mandibulotomy can cause functional defects in speech and swallowing, although these may be reduced by optimal reconstruction. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=mandibular-and-palatal-reconstruction-in-patients-with-head-and-neck-cancer\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Mandibular and palatal reconstruction in patients with head and neck cancer&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-acquired-maxillary-and-hard-palate-defects\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of acquired maxillary and hard palate defects&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=speech-and-swallowing-rehabilitation-of-the-patient-with-head-and-neck-cancer\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Speech and swallowing rehabilitation of the patient with head and neck cancer&quot;</a>.) </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Radiation therapy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Both external beam RT using contemporary conformal techniques and brachytherapy can have a role in the management of early stage oral cavity cancer. The general principles of RT, and the role of radiation dose and schedule are discussed elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=general-principles-of-radiation-therapy-for-head-and-neck-cancer\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;General principles of radiation therapy for head and neck cancer&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=definitive-radiation-therapy-for-head-and-neck-cancer-dose-and-fractionation-considerations\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Definitive radiation therapy for head and neck cancer: Dose and fractionation considerations&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Small tumors in most oral cavity sites can be managed with intraoral cone or interstitial brachytherapy in order to minimize exposure of normal tissue. These techniques do not treat regional lymph node basins, however, and therefore, are only appropriate to use as a single modality in selected stage I patients where the risk of occult nodal involvement is very low. Factors associated with high-risk disease or lymph node involvement include deep invasion and lymphovascular invasion.</p><p>External beam RT to the draining lymph node regions is used as the primary mode of irradiation when regional lymph nodes are at significant risk for subclinical involvement, and intraoral cone-beam radiation or interstitial brachytherapy may be added as a boost to the primary tumor. </p><p>Significant acute RT toxicities include mucositis, skin reaction, loss of taste, and dysphagia. Late complications may include skin and soft tissue atrophy and fibrosis, osteoradionecrosis (particularly with brachytherapy), lymphedema, and trismus. Xerostomia commonly occurs during the course of RT and persists after treatment. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-and-prevention-of-complications-during-initial-treatment-of-head-and-neck-cancer\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management and prevention of complications during initial treatment of head and neck cancer&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-late-complications-of-head-and-neck-cancer-and-its-treatment\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of late complications of head and neck cancer and its treatment&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Xerostomia may recover after treatment with modern RT techniques, such as 3D conformal or intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT). However, recovery of xerostomia in patients with oral cavity tumors may be more limited than with other head and neck sites because of higher doses of radiation to the submandibular glands and larger volumes of oral mucosa and minor salivary glands in the treatment fields. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-and-prevention-of-complications-during-initial-treatment-of-head-and-neck-cancer#H722454159\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management and prevention of complications during initial treatment of head and neck cancer&quot;, section on 'Highly conformal RT technique'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H88481623\"><span class=\"h1\">SPECIFIC TUMOR SITES</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Lip</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Both squamous cell and basal cell carcinomas can arise in the lip. Together, these account for approximately one-fourth of oral cavity cancers. Cancers of the lip are grouped with oral cavity cancers even though they are often the result of sun exposure and share characteristics with many skin cancers. Surgical excision is generally preferred for management. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-and-prognosis-of-cutaneous-squamous-cell-carcinoma\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment and prognosis of cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H202278880\"><span class=\"h3\">Squamous cell carcinoma</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The natural history and hence prognosis of squamous cell carcinoma of the lip varies depending upon whether the lower or upper lip is involved, and this has implications for management:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Lower lip</strong> &ndash; Squamous cell carcinoma is more common than basal cell carcinoma in the lower lip. Lymph node metastasis usually is not seen, except in the presence of a large lesion or multiple recurrent primary tumors.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Maximum tumor thickness is a predictor for metastatic spread to regional lymph nodes for squamous cell carcinoma of the lip and, therefore, may be important for treatment planning and assessment of prognosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-stage-i-and-ii-early-head-and-neck-cancer-the-oral-cavity/abstract/20,21\" class=\"abstract_t\">20,21</a>]. In one report of 27 patients with squamous cell carcinoma of the lower lip, there was a significant difference in mean tumor thickness between patients with or without cervical lymph node metastases (5.6 versus 3.8 mm, respectively) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-stage-i-and-ii-early-head-and-neck-cancer-the-oral-cavity/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. Whether tumor thickness is independent of tumor stage as a prognostic factor is uncertain. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Upper lip</strong> &ndash; Squamous cell carcinomas that arise in the upper lip and oral commissure have a worse prognosis than those originating in the lower lip. These tumors grow more rapidly, ulcerate sooner, and metastasize earlier (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F68180\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef68180 \">picture 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F73991\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef73991 \">picture 2</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-stage-i-and-ii-early-head-and-neck-cancer-the-oral-cavity/abstract/22-24\" class=\"abstract_t\">22-24</a>]. Upper lip cancers also have the potential for invasion into the premaxilla and nasal cavity, which can add considerable complexity to the treatment planning and ultimate functional outcome. Therefore, a more aggressive treatment strategy including prophylactic treatment of the neck is generally advocated for even early stage upper lip squamous cell carcinomas.</p><p/><p>Cosmetic and functional outcomes are important in planning treatment because of the role of the lips in speech, facial expression, and eating. The extent of surgical excision depends entirely upon the size of the lesion. The optimal margin for resection has not been defined [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-stage-i-and-ii-early-head-and-neck-cancer-the-oral-cavity/abstract/25,26\" class=\"abstract_t\">25,26</a>], but a margin &ge;5 mm on final pathology is generally recommended.</p><p>There are numerous reconstructive options to restore function after surgery. Defects that involve less than two-thirds of the lip can be closed primarily, while defects involving up to three-quarters of the lip can be reconstructed with full thickness pedicled flaps from the uninvolved lip (Abbe-Estlander flaps) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-stage-i-and-ii-early-head-and-neck-cancer-the-oral-cavity/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. More complicated reconstructive options are available for larger defects, including the Karapandzic flap [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-stage-i-and-ii-early-head-and-neck-cancer-the-oral-cavity/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>].</p><p>Mohs micrographic surgery, which is effective for treating early stage skin cancer, has been used to treat early lip cancers but has not been directly compared with standard surgical excision [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-stage-i-and-ii-early-head-and-neck-cancer-the-oral-cavity/abstract/29,30\" class=\"abstract_t\">29,30</a>]. Therefore, we advise caution when treating lip cancer with Mohs surgery, particularly for tumors &gt;2 cm, since narrow margins may be less effective for these tumors. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=mohs-surgery\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Mohs surgery&quot;</a>.)</p><p>In general, the prognosis for early stage squamous cell carcinoma of the lip is very good, with 10-year recurrence-free survival rates of 94 and 78 percent for stage I and II disease, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-stage-i-and-ii-early-head-and-neck-cancer-the-oral-cavity/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H202278901\"><span class=\"h3\">Basal cell carcinoma</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Basal cell carcinoma is more common on the upper lip and rarely metastasizes.

These tumors tend to be locally invasive. There is a high risk of neck lymph node metastases, with occult node metastases reported in 21 and 62 percent of patients with stage I and II disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-stage-i-and-ii-early-head-and-neck-cancer-the-oral-cavity/abstract/31,32\" class=\"abstract_t\">31,32</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H14\" class=\"local\">'Management of the neck'</a> below.) </p><p>Surgery has been the preferred approach due to the concern of risk of radiation-induced bone necrosis and other long-term complications in patients treated with definitive radiation therapy (RT).

Care should be taken to avoid the lingual nerve, if oncologically feasible, as this nerve is relatively superficial in the floor of mouth and easily injured. </p><p>Small to medium defects can be closed primarily, left to close by secondary intention, or reconstructed with a skin graft. Large defects are best repaired with a vascularized graft, such as a radial forearm free tissue transfer or submental island skin flap, to avoid contracture of the tongue and difficulty with speech.</p><p>Results with definitive RT are similar to those attained with surgery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-stage-i-and-ii-early-head-and-neck-cancer-the-oral-cavity/abstract/33,34\" class=\"abstract_t\">33,34</a>]. Small (&lt;1 cm) or superficial lesions (&lt;4 mm thick) can be treated with either an intraoral cone or interstitial brachytherapy alone. An intraoral cone is more suitable for lesions located centrally or in the anterior part of the mouth. For lesions extending close to or into the tongue, an intraoral stent or bite block helps position the tongue.

Deep tongue muscle margins are not found in a single plane, in contrast to the radial mucosal margins. In addition, striated tongue muscle fibers shred or fragment with tissue handling during and after surgery, leaving a less reliable surface to assess margin status. Therefore, close deep surgical margins should be interpreted with caution, and more aggressive treatment may be indicated compared to close radial mucosal margins or close margins in other disease sites.</p><p>Definitive RT of oral tongue cancer typically utilizes external beam RT. Small (less than or equal to 10 mm) and superficial lesions can be treated with either an intraoral cone or interstitial brachytherapy alone.

Tongue cancer is often believed to have a more aggressive course in younger patients (ie, &lt;40 years), but most reports have not found a difference in survival between younger and older patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-stage-i-and-ii-early-head-and-neck-cancer-the-oral-cavity/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>]. However, patients are at significant risk for the development of a second primary head and neck cancer. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=second-primary-malignancies-in-patients-with-head-and-neck-cancers\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Second primary malignancies in patients with head and neck cancers&quot;</a>.) </p><p>Historically, the management of the neck in patients with early stage cancers of the tongue was controversial. The risk of lymph node metastasis is proportional to depth of invasion. However, preoperative determination of depth of invasion is difficult without a full thickness biopsy, which is rarely done. Distinguishing between patients at low and high risk of lymph node metastasis is variable between surgeons. The decision regarding neck dissection requires a comprehensive assessment of the potential risks and benefits for each early stage oral tongue cancer patient; however, it is now recommended for most patients with tumors &ge;3 mm thickness (see <a href=\"#H14\" class=\"local\">'Management of the neck'</a> below). Patients may have &quot;skip metastases&quot; with involvement of level III or IV, without involvement of levels I and II (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F54099\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef54099 \">figure 2</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-stage-i-and-ii-early-head-and-neck-cancer-the-oral-cavity/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>]. Thus, a selective neck dissection of levels I to IV may be more appropriate than a supraomohyoid dissection of levels I to III.

It is continuous with the buccal mucosa, upper and lower gingiva, maxillary tuberosity, anterior tonsillar pillar, soft palate, and mouth floor. </p><p>Even early cancers of the retromolar trigone have a high local recurrence rate due to microscopic extension into the mandible and a high probability of occult regional lymph node metastases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-stage-i-and-ii-early-head-and-neck-cancer-the-oral-cavity/abstract/39-41\" class=\"abstract_t\">39-41</a>]. The five-year disease-free survival rate for early stage retromolar trigone cancer is approximately 70 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-stage-i-and-ii-early-head-and-neck-cancer-the-oral-cavity/abstract/42-44\" class=\"abstract_t\">42-44</a>].</p><p>Surgical therapy involves wide local excision, but resection can be technically challenging. Although small tumors may be managed with a transoral approach, many will require a lip-splitting cheek flap for exposure. Marginal mandibulectomy may be required in order to achieve tumor-free margins.</p><p>The degree of tumor invasion must be assessed before surgery as well as possible since this will determine the deep surgical margin [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-stage-i-and-ii-early-head-and-neck-cancer-the-oral-cavity/abstract/45\" class=\"abstract_t\">45</a>]. A planned intraoperative mucosal resection margin of 1 cm is recommended to achieve a final pathologic margin &gt;5 mm since there can be substantial shrinkage of the tumor specimen in formalin [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-stage-i-and-ii-early-head-and-neck-cancer-the-oral-cavity/abstract/46\" class=\"abstract_t\">46</a>]. In contrast, a deep bone margin of 1 cm is unnecessarily morbid, and instead, a margin of one tissue layer deeper than the greatest depth of invasion is suggested. Preoperative assessment of bone invasion is notoriously difficult.</p><p>Treatment of cancers of the lower alveolar ridge is similar to that for lesions arising in the retromolar trigone. These lesions often have mandibular involvement at presentation.</p><p>The status of the teeth plays a critical role in treatment of cancers involving the upper and lower alveolar ridge. Many patients with oral cavity cancer are edentulous or have very poor dentition. In these patients, porous cortical bone serves as a poor barrier to invasion, and the risk of mandibular invasion is increased, even for early stage cancers. Therefore, edentulous patients with even minimal cortical bone invasion should be treated with a segmental resection of bone rather than a marginal resection. In contrast, healthy teeth are a better barrier to direct tumor invasion into the medullary space of the bone, and patients with healthy teeth with an intact dental ligament, and with early stage cancers rarely have mandibular invasion.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h2\">Upper alveolar ridge and hard palate</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Both surgery and RT offer excellent control for early stage squamous cell cancers of the upper alveolar ridge and hard palate. However, surgery is generally preferred because of the late effects of radiation, including osteoradionecrosis of the maxilla. Except for the most superficial cancers, surgery usually involves resection of bone including alveolectomy, palatectomy, or infrastructure maxillectomy (ie, resection of the palatine process of the maxillary bone) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-stage-i-and-ii-early-head-and-neck-cancer-the-oral-cavity/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>]. The resulting surgical defects may be closed with local mucosal rotation flaps or free tissue transfer reconstruction for larger defects. However, some surgeons prefer prosthetic rehabilitation with a removable palatal obturator, which permits better inspection of the defect for disease recurrence. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-acquired-maxillary-and-hard-palate-defects\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of acquired maxillary and hard palate defects&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h2\">Buccal mucosa</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Buccal mucosa cancers are often neglected or misdiagnosed as an infection or consequence of trauma, and thus, rarely present as T1 lesions. For patients who are diagnosed with early stage buccal mucosa tumors, three-year disease-free-survival rates of 75 to 85 percent for stage I and 65 percent for stage II cancers have been reported [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-stage-i-and-ii-early-head-and-neck-cancer-the-oral-cavity/abstract/47-50\" class=\"abstract_t\">47-50</a>].</p><p>Surgery is typically preferred for buccal mucosa cancers, despite high local recurrence rates and technical challenges [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-stage-i-and-ii-early-head-and-neck-cancer-the-oral-cavity/abstract/51\" class=\"abstract_t\">51</a>]. Early stage buccal mucosa cancers may appear easy to treat (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F69202\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef69202 \">picture 6</a>). However, exposure of the cancer can be difficult via a transoral approach, which makes it difficult to obtain clear radial margins in an en bloc fashion. Furthermore, the short distance between the buccal mucosa and the buccal space permits early invasion to deep structures or to the skin of the anterior cheek. The surgeon must choose between taking a thin deep margin and risking recurrence versus removing skin and reconstructing both the inner and outer cheek surfaces. Although more aggressive surgery including exenteration of the buccal space and parotidectomy may improve oncologic results, the disfigurement and morbidity associated with these procedures are considerable (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F69202\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef69202 \">picture 6</a>).</p><p>The buccal mucosal surface must be reconstructed regardless of the depth of resection; inadequate soft tissue coverage will result in severe, irreversible trismus. Thus, free tissue transfer reconstruction (eg, radial forearm flap) is recommended for all but the smallest buccal cancers. In these cases, skin graft reconstruction will suffice. Even with adequate reconstruction, trismus is a significant clinical problem, and jaw exercises are required for the best functional outcome. </p><p>Postoperative radiation or chemoradiation is often necessary to maximize the likelihood of locoregional control. If RT is used, the initial treatment volume includes the primary tumor, with at least 2 cm margins. An intraoral stent may be used to displace the tongue medially to reduce the dose delivered to this organ.

Although the definition and measurement of tumor thickness or depth of invasion have varied between studies, most reports have found that increasing tumor thickness is associated with an increased risk of occult metastases and reduced recurrence-free and overall survival [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-stage-i-and-ii-early-head-and-neck-cancer-the-oral-cavity/abstract/54,55\" class=\"abstract_t\">54,55</a>].</p><p>Improved imaging techniques, including functional or molecular-based studies prior to surgery, may eventually prove useful in selecting patients for neck dissection. Sentinel lymph node biopsy is an emerging technique that may eventually be an important &quot;middle of the road&quot; option between observation and neck dissection in patients with intermediate-thickness tumors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-stage-i-and-ii-early-head-and-neck-cancer-the-oral-cavity/abstract/11,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,12</a>].</p><p>Noninvasive techniques to assess tumor thickness (clinical palpation, computed tomography [CT], positron emission tomography [PET], magnetic resonance imaging [MRI], intraoral ultrasonography) and representative biopsy or frozen section analysis each have limitations. Thus, the thickness of the primary tumor is often unknown prior to surgery. As a consequence, many head and neck surgeons either decide empirically before surgery based on clinical features or defer elective neck dissection pending final histopathologic examination.</p><p>Although retrospective studies led many to recommend a tumor thickness cutoff of 4 mm as a threshold for elective neck dissection, we now recommend ipsilateral selective neck dissection (levels I to <span class=\"nowrap\">III/IV)</span> to reduce the chance of regional recurrences for cancers with more than 3 mm of invasion in patients with an oral tongue primary. This recommendation is based upon the results of a large, prospective randomized trial in which 596 patients were randomly assigned to elective node dissection or observation followed by therapeutic node dissection for recurrence [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-stage-i-and-ii-early-head-and-neck-cancer-the-oral-cavity/abstract/53\" class=\"abstract_t\">53</a>]. Patients were secondarily randomized to be followed by physical examination only or by ultrasound (but not CT or PET). </p><p>The initial analysis of this trial was based upon the first 500 patients enrolled, as prespecified by the data and safety monitoring committee. There were 427 primary tongue tumors, 68 arising in the buccal mucosa and 5 in the floor of the mouth; the trial included 221 patients with T1 tumors and 279 T2 tumors.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Following excision of the primary tumor, patients assigned to an elective lymph node dissection underwent an ipsilateral selective neck dissection that included clearance of level I, II, and III lymph nodes. If disease was detected during the elective node dissection, surgery was extended to include level IV and V nodes. Patients assigned to a therapeutic neck dissection underwent a modified neck dissection (levels I to V) if a nodal relapse was detected.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>At a median follow-up of 39 months, there were 146 recurrences and 79 deaths in patients assigned to initial observation followed by therapeutic node dissection, and there were 81 recurrences and 50 deaths in the group assigned to elective node dissection. The benefit was present in all subgroups, except for those with a primary tumor depth &le;3 mm.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Overall survival, the primary endpoint of the trial, was significantly improved in those assigned to elective node dissection (three-year overall survival rate 80 versus 67.5 percent, hazard ratio [HR] 0.64, 95% CI 0.45-0.92). Similarly, the disease-free survival rate was also significantly improved (three-year rate 69.5 versus 45.9 percent, HR 0.44, 95% CI 0.34-0.58). On subset analysis, the benefit was limited to patients with tumor depth &gt;3 mm, although the number of such patients was limited.</p><p/><p>The primary site was the tongue in 85 percent of patients, and it is not clear whether neck dissection would have a similar benefit in patients with tumors arising elsewhere in the oral cavity. In addition, whether results might differ if eligibility was limited to patients with a negative neck on baseline CT or PET, or with more intensive follow-up imaging (CT or PET) for patients treated without a neck dissection is unclear.</p><p>The optimal extent of neck dissection remains uncertain. Of course, limiting the extent of dissection reduces the potential for morbidity. A supraomohyoid neck dissection (levels I to III plus IV, although for subsites other than oral tongue, levels I to III) is typically sufficient for clinically N0 oral cavity cancer since level IV and V lymph nodes are rarely involved without clinical disease at other levels (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F54099\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef54099 \">figure 2</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-stage-i-and-ii-early-head-and-neck-cancer-the-oral-cavity/abstract/38,56-58\" class=\"abstract_t\">38,56-58</a>]. This approach includes removal of the submandibular gland but preserves the spinal accessory nerve, the internal jugular vein, and the sternocleidomastoid muscle. Sublevel IIB may also be preserved in patients with early stage oral cavity cancer, thus minimizing the risk of shoulder dysfunction from damage to the spinal accessory nerve, which runs through sublevel IIB.</p><p>For patients with oral cavity cancer, we generally recommend an ipsilateral selective neck dissection, levels I to <span class=\"nowrap\">III/IV,</span> for stage I cancers with greater than 3 mm of invasion and for most stage II disease, except minimally invasive primary tumors. Levels IIB and IV are dissected at the discretion of the surgeon. Level V dissection is usually unnecessary. Patients with primary tumors close to or involving the midline should be managed with bilateral neck dissection.</p><p>Sentinel lymph node biopsy may be a viable alternative to neck dissection for select patients with early stage oral cavity cancer. Sentinel lymph node biopsy has been demonstrated to be safe and feasible in a multi-institutional setting [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-stage-i-and-ii-early-head-and-neck-cancer-the-oral-cavity/abstract/59,60\" class=\"abstract_t\">59,60</a>]. Specialized training is required for the procedure, and there is a fairly steep learning curve. Sentinel lymph node biopsy has been more widely adopted in Europe than in the United States for early stage oral cavity cancer. The largest multi-institutional series from Europe included 415 patients and found a negative predictive value of 95 percent with the procedure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-stage-i-and-ii-early-head-and-neck-cancer-the-oral-cavity/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. </p><p>To date, there remains no level 1 evidence comparing sentinel lymph node biopsy to elective neck dissection for early stage oral cavity cancer. Thus, the technique may be most applicable to patients with primary tumors less than 3 mm in depth that have an intermediate risk of lymph node metastasis, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> larger primary tumors that approach the midline. When performed, a negative sentinel node biopsy may replace planned neck dissection.</p><p>More specific recommendations incorporating the primary tumor site include the following:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Elective neck treatment is usually not performed for T1 lower lip cancers. For T2 and larger cancers, elective dissection can be limited to levels IA and 1B (suprahyoid dissection) since lower lip cancers usually do not metastasize to lower cervical nodes without first invading facial, submental, and submandibular lymph nodes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-stage-i-and-ii-early-head-and-neck-cancer-the-oral-cavity/abstract/61\" class=\"abstract_t\">61</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For all T1 and T2 oral tongue cancers with &gt;3 mm depth of invasion, we suggest an elective unilateral lymph node dissection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-stage-i-and-ii-early-head-and-neck-cancer-the-oral-cavity/abstract/62-65\" class=\"abstract_t\">62-65</a>], including levels I to IV.

Postoperative radiation therapy (PORT) should be considered for depth of invasion and for tumor thickness &gt;4 mm, even in the setting of a negative unilateral neck dissection. In a retrospective study of 164 &quot;low-risk&quot; early stage oral tongue cancer patients treated with surgery alone and then observed, the regional recurrence rate was 24 percent for tumors &ge;4 mm [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-stage-i-and-ii-early-head-and-neck-cancer-the-oral-cavity/abstract/66\" class=\"abstract_t\">66</a>]. Of the patients with regional recurrence, 39 percent occurred in the contralateral neck, suggesting the need for careful consideration of bilateral neck irradiation if used, particularly for primary tumors that approach or involve the midline.
