The important thing to know is that for most but not all women, most breast-related problems are <strong>not</strong> caused by breast cancer. Even so, if you develop any problem with your breasts, see a doctor or nurse to have it checked out.</p><p>Some common breast problems include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Breast lumpiness</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Single breast lump (which doctors call a &quot;mass&quot;)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Breast pain</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Breast tenderness</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Nipple discharge (meaning fluid is leaks from the nipples, such as clear, white, yellow, green, or red fluid)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Nipple inversion (meaning the nipples point inward instead of outward) and that is new and has occurred in just one breast</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Changes in the skin of the breast, such as redness or puckering</p><p/><p>These problems can happen in women of all ages. If you develop any of these problems, see your doctor or nurse. Breast problems are not usually an emergency, but you should get checked out as soon as possible. If there is something serious going on, it's important to find out quickly. Your doctor or nurse might be able to tell what's happening just by doing an exam. If not, he or she can order some tests, or send you to a specialist.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13005187\"><span class=\"h1\">Which tests might I need?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Your doctor or nurse will decide which tests you need based on your individual situation. Common tests used to evaluate breast problems are listed below:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Breast ultrasound &ndash; This is an imaging test that uses sound waves to create pictures of the inside of your breast. Among other things, it can show if a lump is solid or filled with fluid.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Breast biopsy &ndash; During a biopsy, a doctor takes one or more tiny samples of suspicious breast tissue using a needle. The samples then go to the lab to be checked for cancer or other problems.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Mammogram &ndash; Mammograms are special X-rays of the breast. They can help doctors find breast cancer.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H26939911\"><span class=\"h1\">What could be causing the problem?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The breast symptoms listed above could be caused by a number of problems, most of which are not serious. For example, normal hormone changes in a woman's monthly cycle can sometimes cause breast pain or even lumps that turn out to be nothing. Still, new breast symptoms can be a sign of cancer, so it's important to see a doctor if you develop any symptom.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13005259\"><span class=\"h1\">More on this topic</span></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=breast-cancer-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Breast cancer (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=breast-cancer-screening-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Breast cancer screening (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=cancer-screening-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Cancer screening (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=breast-biopsy-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Breast biopsy (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=sentinel-lymph-node-biopsy-for-breast-cancer-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Sentinel lymph node biopsy for breast cancer (The Basics)</a></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=common-breast-problems-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Common breast problems (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=breast-cancer-screening-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Breast cancer screening (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=breast-cancer-guide-to-diagnosis-and-treatment-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Breast cancer guide to diagnosis and treatment (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=factors-that-modify-breast-cancer-risk-in-women-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Factors that modify breast cancer risk in women (Beyond the Basics)</a></p></div><div id=\"reviewProcess\"><span>All topics are updated as new evidence becomes available and our <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/home/editorial-policy\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"policy policy_editorialpolicy\">peer review process</a> is complete.</span></div><div id=\"topicRetrievedDate\"><span class=\"emphasis\">This topic retrieved from UpToDate on: </span>Apr 02, 2018.</div><div id=\"disclaimer\">The content on the UpToDate website is not intended nor recommended as a substitute for medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.
