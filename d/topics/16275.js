Phobic fears include animals, insects, heights, water, enclosed places, driving, flying, seeing blood, getting an injection, and choking or vomiting.</p><p>The phobic anxiety may be triggered by anticipation of the stimulus, actual exposure to the stimulus, and even hearing the stimulus name spoken aloud (eg, hearing the word spider for an individual with spider phobia). The focus of fear may include disgust, danger of harm, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> the experience of physical symptoms in the phobic situation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/specific-phobia-in-adults-epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-course-and-diagnosis/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. </p><p>This topic describes the epidemiology, pathogenesis, clinical manifestations, course, and diagnosis of specific phobia in adults. Specific phobias relating to clinical procedures (eg, blood-injection-injury phobia) and other manifestations of acute procedural anxiety, are discussed separately. Specific phobia, other anxiety disorders, and fears in children are also discussed separately. Pharmacotherapy and psychotherapy for specific phobia in adults are also discussed separately.

However, the particular phobia that is transmitted is typically different although often it is from the same type.

It is unclear whether cognitive biases play a role in the development of the fear; however, it is generally accepted that they play an important role in maintaining the disorder. These cognitive biases likely reflect variation in neurobiology described above. As an example, expectancy bias (the exaggerated likelihood of encountering the phobic stimuli) has been associated with increased negative modulation of activity in the lateral prefrontal cortex, precuneus, and visual cortex in response to the encounter expectancy of a spider (versus a snake or a bird) in a group of 18 individuals with spider phobia. This pattern was not seen in 18 control participants [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/specific-phobia-in-adults-epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-course-and-diagnosis/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H19509068\"><span class=\"h2\">Social and environmental factors</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A host of social and environmental factors may play a role in the development of specific phobias including the context of a traumatic event, stress at the time of the event (that may lead to an increased fear response), previous and subsequent exposure to a phobic stimulus, and level of support [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/specific-phobia-in-adults-epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-course-and-diagnosis/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>].

As an example, a retrospective study comparing 30 individuals with flying phobia with 30 matched health controls found that frightening flying experiences were common in both groups (50 versus 53 percent) and both groups were similarly influenced by vicarious learning (37 versus 23 percent); however, the presence of stressful life events during the frightening flying experiences (60 versus 19 percent) and the influence of informational learning through the media following these experience (70 versus 37 percent) were significantly greater for those in the flying phobia group [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/specific-phobia-in-adults-epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-course-and-diagnosis/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>].

This pathway may account for the substantial proportion of individuals who indicate they have had their phobia for as long as they can remember. Innate fears may be considered adaptive from an evolutionary perspective. This pathway is along the lines of Seligman&rsquo;s preparedness theory, which states that some individuals are prepared to develop some associations that lead to fear (eg, being afraid of dogs after being bitten by a dog) and not others (being afraid of flowers after being pricked by a thorn) to facilitate survival.

As an example, an individual who has of phobia of enclosed places will have great difficulty undergoing a needed MRI and this will come to the attention of the ordering physician. </p><p>It is important for the evaluating clinician to recognize that the assessment procedure itself may be anxiety-provoking. Just the patient saying the phobic word aloud or reading it on paper may provoke an anxiety reaction. Thus, it is important to convey the need for assessing the problem, as well as the therapeutic benefit of addressing the fear directly. </p><p>A thorough assessment approach should include detailed information on the following:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Focus of anxiety in the phobic situation and reasons for avoidance &ndash; This may include fear of anticipated harm or danger (ie, plane crashing in flying phobia), physiological symptoms of anxiety (ie, fainting in blood-injection-injury phobia), and concerns about emotional control (having a panic attack and losing control in a driving phobia). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acute-procedure-anxiety-in-adults-epidemiology-and-clinical-presentation#H12823250\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Acute procedure anxiety in adults: Epidemiology and clinical presentation&quot;, section on 'Clinical Manifestations'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Fear predictability &ndash; The fear response associated with specific phobia is typically invariably experienced upon exposure to the phobic stimulus.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Range of situations feared and variables that influence fear intensity &ndash; Phobias may be associated with a single situation (eg, travelling by airplane in the case of flying phobia) or a wide range of situations related to the specific phobic fear. As an example of a fear manifested in many situations, an individual with a fear of snakes may avoid saying the word &ldquo;snake&rdquo;, watching certain nature programs on television, walking in forests, and toy stores. A host of variables may influence fear intensity and are specific to each individual&rsquo;s presentation. As an example, an individual with a driving phobia may report that the fear is influenced by time of day, degree of traffic, type of road, speed limit, weather conditions, and the presence of others in the car. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Safety behaviors used to reduce anxiety<strong> &ndash; </strong>Safety behaviors are actions an individual takes to prevent a feared outcome from occurring or cope with a perceived threat [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/specific-phobia-in-adults-epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-course-and-diagnosis/abstract/53,54\" class=\"abstract_t\">53,54</a>]. It is common for individuals with specific phobia to engage in safety behaviors to manage their fear. Overt safety behaviors include escape and avoidance. Subtle safety behaviors are more difficult to detect and may include cognitive distraction and thought suppression as well as carrying an item that is perceived to provide comfort or protection. As examples: </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>An individual with dog phobia may cross the street to avoid walking past a dog and may carry pepper spray for protection.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>An individual with a fear of flying may consume significant amounts of alcohol to reduce the experience of anxiety on a flight. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>An individual with a height phobia may avoid visiting people who live in apartment buildings and may also avoid looking out the window. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>An individual with a fear of thunderstorms may stay in the basement during a storm.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Skills deficits that may play a role in the specific phobia<strong> &ndash;</strong> This is particularly relevant for a specific phobia of driving.

To distinguish a specific phobia from other Axis I disorders, it is helpful to consider the focus of the fear, the circumscribed nature of the fear and avoidance, and whether the fear is captured by another Axis I disorder.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H561244921\"><span class=\"h3\">Agoraphobia</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Multiple specific phobias may resemble agoraphobia. To distinguish these disorders, consider the focus of fear in the situation. In specific phobia, the focus of fear is on aspects of a particular situation, so multiple specific phobias will be associated with multiple fears (eg, driving is avoided for fear of an accident; elevators are avoided for fear of being stuck; outdoor places are avoided for fear of spiders). In agoraphobia, avoidance is typically across a range of situations, yet the focus of fear is the same across situations (eg, driving, elevators, and outdoor places are avoided for fear of panic symptoms or the unavailability of help if needed). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=agoraphobia-in-adults-epidemiology-pathogenesis-clinical-manifestations-course-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Agoraphobia in adults: Epidemiology, pathogenesis, clinical manifestations, course, and diagnosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H561244928\"><span class=\"h3\">Panic disorder</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Panic attacks may occur in both panic disorder and specific phobia. To differentiate these disorders it is helpful to consider the context of the panic attack. Panic disorder is characterized by uncued or unexpected panic attacks, whereas panic attacks within the context of specific phobia are typically cued by encountering the feared situation or stimulus. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=panic-disorder-in-adults-epidemiology-pathogenesis-clinical-manifestations-course-assessment-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Panic disorder in adults: Epidemiology, pathogenesis, clinical manifestations, course, assessment, and diagnosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H561244935\"><span class=\"h3\">Social anxiety disorder</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Social anxiety disorder related to discrete performance situations may be mistaken for a specific phobia (eg, public speaking or performing on stage). In this case it is important to discern the reasons for the fear and avoidance. Fears specific to being publically scrutinized, embarrassed, or negatively judged by others are subsumed under the diagnosis of social anxiety disorder. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=social-anxiety-disorder-in-adults-epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Social anxiety disorder in adults: Epidemiology, clinical manifestations, and diagnosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H561244942\"><span class=\"h3\">Posttraumatic stress disorder</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Individuals with posttraumatic stress disorder may avoid situations associated with the trauma, and a specific phobia may develop after experiencing a traumatic event in the phobic situation. To distinguish between these disorders, it is important to consider the constellation of symptoms reported and the range of situations avoided. For example, a person who experienced a traumatic motor vehicle accident and now avoids driving may receive a diagnosis of specific phobia of driving if the fear and avoidance are confined specifically to driving situations. However, if the person also reports reexperiencing symptoms, persistent avoidance of trauma cues, numbing of general responsiveness, and increased arousal, a diagnosis of posttraumatic stress disorder may be warranted.

Consideration of the focus of fear is helpful in distinguishing these two disorders. In separation anxiety disorder, situations are avoided for fear of being separated from an attachment figure or for fear of harm befalling an attachment figure. In specific phobia, fear and avoidance are related to a circumscribed situation or object and is unrelated to the <span class=\"nowrap\">presence/absence</span> of an attachment figure.

In this case, it is helpful to determine the focus of fear and reasons for avoidance. If certain foods are feared and avoided due to concerns of weight gain, then a diagnosis of eating disorder may be warranted. If certain foods are feared and avoided due to concerns of choking, then a diagnosis of specific phobia, other type (fear of choking) may be warranted. In both cases, consequent weight loss may be substantial.

The fear or anxiety is out of proportion to the actual danger posed by the specific object or situation and to the sociocultural context.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>E. The fear, anxiety, or avoidance is persistent, typically lasting for six months or more.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>F.

The disturbance is not better explained by the symptoms of another mental disorder, including fear, anxiety, and avoidance of situations associated with panic-like symptoms or other incapacitating symptoms (as in agoraphobia); objects or situations related to obsessions (as in obsessive-compulsive disorder); reminders of traumatic events (as in posttraumatic stress disorder); separation from home or attachment figures (as in separation anxiety disorder); or social situations (as in social anxiety disorder).</p><p/><p>Specifiers based on the phobic stimulus:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Animal (eg, spiders, insects, dogs).</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Natural environment (eg, heights, storms, water).</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Blood-injection-injury (eg, needles, invasive medical procedures).</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Situational (eg, airplanes, elevators, enclosed places).</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Other (eg, situations that may lead to choking or vomiting; in children, eg, loud sounds or costumed characters).</p><p/><p>If a person has a significant fear but does not encounter the phobic situation and is not distressed by the fear, then a diagnosis of specific phobia would not be warranted. For example, a person who has a fear of fish, but does not live by a body of water, does not encounter fish in the course of daily living, and is not bothered by having the fear would not receive a specific phobia diagnosis.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H561245094\"><span class=\"h2\">Other diagnostic considerations</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Specific phobia needs to be distinguished from normative states of fear. Unlike normative fear, phobic fear [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/specific-phobia-in-adults-epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-course-and-diagnosis/abstract/56,57\" class=\"abstract_t\">56,57</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Is excessive and out of proportion to situational demands</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Cannot be alleviated with rational explanation</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Is out of voluntary control</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Leads to situational avoidance</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Is maladaptive and persistent over time</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Is not age or stage-specific </p><p/><p>Cultural beliefs, values, and traditions may play a role in fear expression, with research showing that fears may differ in both their nature and intensity across different ethnic groups residing within the same country [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/specific-phobia-in-adults-epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-course-and-diagnosis/abstract/58\" class=\"abstract_t\">58</a>]. Thus, it is important to consider the cultural context when conducting an assessment of fears. As an example, if an individual reports fear of a particular animal, but is raised within a cultural context where that fear is normative, one should not consider the fear to be excessive or unreasonable unless it is over and above the cultural norm. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H19509103\"><span class=\"h2\">Specific phobia in children</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The clinical manifestations and diagnosis of specific phobia differ in some respects in children.

This instrument is extremely useful for thoroughly assessing the presence of specific phobia. Although an individual may have a specific phobia, they are unlikely to report it unless they are asked. The downside of this measure is that it is time consuming and thus is best used with an individual presenting with significant anxiety as the primary problem.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>There are self-report measures specific to types of specific phobia (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PSYCH%2F65262\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef65262 \">table 1</a>). These measures are useful for determining the range of symptoms, establishing initial symptom severity, and for measuring treatment progress and outcome. A more general measure that assesses a range of phobic fears is the Fear Survey Schedule third version (FSS-III) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/specific-phobia-in-adults-epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-course-and-diagnosis/abstract/61\" class=\"abstract_t\">61</a>].
