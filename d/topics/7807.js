G6PD is a protein in the red blood cells that helps them work normally. People with G6PD deficiency have too little G6PD in their red blood cells.</p><p>This can be a problem because red blood cells with too little G6PD are more sensitive to certain foods, medicines, and chemicals. If red blood cells are exposed to these foods, medicines, or chemicals, they can be destroyed. This is called &quot;hemolysis.&quot; It can lead to a condition called anemia, which is when the body has too few red blood cells.</p><p>G6PD deficiency is a condition people are born with. It is caused by an abnormal gene. G6PD deficiency is more common in some groups of people than others. It is more common in people whose ancestors came from Africa, the Mediterranean area, or parts of Asia, South America, or the Middle East.</p><p>In most people with G6PD deficiency, hemolysis doesn't happen all the time. Episodes of hemolysis happen only when they are triggered by something. Common triggers include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Certain infections</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Certain medicines, such as &quot;sulfa&quot; antibiotics and medicines to treat malaria</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Specific foods, such as fava beans</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Breathing in or touching certain chemicals, such as those in moth balls</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H62884529\"><span class=\"h1\">What are the symptoms of G6PD deficiency?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Symptoms depend on the person.</p><p>Most people have no symptoms until an episode of hemolysis is triggered by one of the things listed above. Then symptoms can include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Jaundice, which is when your skin or the whites of your eyes turn yellow</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pale skin, or paleness of the lips, tongue, or inside of the eyelid</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Dark-colored urine</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Back or belly pain</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Tiredness, fatigue, or headache caused by anemia</p><p/><p>Sometimes, newborn babies can have jaundice. And some people can have hemolysis all the time, no matter what they eat or what medicines they take.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H62884544\"><span class=\"h1\">Is there a test for G6PD deficiency?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Yes. To check for this condition, your doctor or nurse will order different blood tests to check for anemia, hemolysis, and the G6PD level.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H62884559\"><span class=\"h1\">How is G6PD deficiency treated?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Treatment depends on your symptoms and how severe your anemia is. Most people just need to know which foods, medicines, and chemicals they should avoid. Lists of medicines to avoid can be found on various websites such as <a href=\"http://www.g6pd.org/&amp;token=+Or/jS+StqFm4G6eiCMPkcv2OlD6ldgYv2Au1AcMfzY=&amp;TOPIC_ID=86967\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">www.g6pd.org</a> or from your doctor or nurse. Fava beans are a food that triggers hemolysis in many people.</p><p>If you have symptoms caused by a medicine you take or a food you eat, your doctor or nurse will have you stop taking that medicine or eating that food. In general, you should avoid foods, medicines, and chemicals that commonly trigger symptoms.</p><p>People with severe anemia are sometimes treated with a blood transfusion. This involves getting blood that has been donated by someone else. The donated blood goes into your vein through a thin tube called an &quot;IV.&quot; People with severe hemolysis may also need to get fluids through a vein.</p><p>Babies with jaundice are often treated with &quot;light therapy,&quot; also called &quot;bili lights.&quot; During light therapy, a doctor or nurse puts a baby under a special blue light or wraps a &quot;light blanket&quot; around the baby (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F55964\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef55964 \">picture 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F73723\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef73723 \">picture 2</a>). This helps the baby's system get rid of the harmful parts of the destroyed red blood cells.</p><p>People with long-term anemia might be treated with a vitamin called <a href=\"topic.htm?path=folic-acid-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">folic acid</a> (also called folate), but this is not common.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H62884624\"><span class=\"h1\">What if I want to get pregnant?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>If you want to get pregnant, talk with your doctor or nurse before you start trying. There might be special things you should do, and you might need to take extra of a vitamin called &quot;<a href=\"topic.htm?path=folic-acid-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">folic acid</a>.&quot; Also, there is a chance you will pass the gene that causes the condition to your baby. You might want to talk with a genetic counselor, a person who specializes in genetic conditions.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H62884639\"><span class=\"h1\">More on this topic</span></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=complete-blood-count-cbc-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Complete blood count (CBC) (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=jaundice-in-babies-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Jaundice in babies (The Basics)</a></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=jaundice-in-newborn-infants-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Jaundice in newborn infants (Beyond the Basics)</a></p></div><div id=\"reviewProcess\"><span>All topics are updated as new evidence becomes available and our <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/home/editorial-policy\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"policy policy_editorialpolicy\">peer review process</a> is complete.</span></div><div id=\"topicRetrievedDate\"><span class=\"emphasis\">This topic retrieved from UpToDate on: </span>Apr 03, 2018.</div><div id=\"disclaimer\">The content on the UpToDate website is not intended nor recommended as a substitute for medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.
