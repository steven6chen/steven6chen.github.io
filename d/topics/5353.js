It is uncertain whether treatment of symptoms alone is sufficient or if complete resolution of eosinophilic inflammation is also required.</p><p>This topic reviews the clinical evidence for the role of food allergies in EoE and elimination and elemental diets for the treatment of EoE. The various types of allergy testing used in the diagnostic evaluation of EoE are reviewed separately. Other aspects of disease pathogenesis, clinical manifestations, general diagnostic evaluation, additional treatment options, and prognosis are also discussed elsewhere.

The mechanism of food allergy can vary from immediate immunoglobulin E (IgE)-mediated hypersensitivity to chronic autoimmune reactions driven by antigen-specific T cells. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pathogenesis-of-food-allergy#H3\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pathogenesis of food allergy&quot;, section on 'Types of reactions'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-of-food-allergy-an-overview\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations of food allergy: An overview&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The pathogenesis of EoE appears to depend largely upon delayed, cell-mediated hypersensitivity. Evidence for this is based both upon clinical reactions in human subjects and on animal models that rely on the presence of T cells for disease induction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dietary-management-of-eosinophilic-esophagitis/abstract/2,3\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,3</a>]. Disease induction <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> propagation have not been shown to rely on IgE-mediated mechanisms, even though IgE sensitization to foods is common in EoE and the prevalence of food-induced anaphylaxis is higher in children with EoE [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dietary-management-of-eosinophilic-esophagitis/abstract/4-8\" class=\"abstract_t\">4-8</a>]. In addition, EoE triggered by a specific food has developed after resolution of IgE-mediated allergy to the same food [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dietary-management-of-eosinophilic-esophagitis/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].</p><p>The relationship between gastric <span class=\"nowrap\">acid/gastroesophageal</span> reflux disease (GERD), esophageal eosinophilia, and food allergies still requires clarification. As an example, whether acid can induce epithelial barrier damage that predisposes to food sensitization or whether acid suppression allows for increased IgE sensitization remains to be systematically studied. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pathogenesis-of-food-allergy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pathogenesis of food allergy&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Clinical evidence for the role of food in EoE is reviewed below. The immunopathogenesis and murine models of EoE are reviewed in greater detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=eosinophilic-esophagitis-eoe-genetics-and-immunopathogenesis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE): Genetics and immunopathogenesis&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=allergy-testing-in-eosinophilic-esophagitis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Allergy testing in eosinophilic esophagitis&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The evidence for the role of food allergies in the pathogenesis of EoE is based upon the clinical response when patients are placed on various elimination diets, with resolution of symptoms and normalization of esophageal biopsies. The use of elimination diets with serial endoscopies after food reintroduction has helped identify the most common food triggers. (See <a href=\"#H9241763\" class=\"local\">'Dietary treatment options'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H455290\"><span class=\"h1\">TREATMENT OPTIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The three main modes of treatment for EoE are dietary therapy, pharmacologic therapy (ie, topical glucocorticoids, proton pump inhibitor [PPI]), and dilatation of esophageal strictures (dilatation is often combined with topical glucocorticoids or a PPI). Dietary avoidance is a common primary approach, particularly in children. It is also a good treatment option in motivated adults. Dietary elimination has been shown to result in resolution of symptoms, esophageal eosinophilia, and, in some cases, esophageal subepithelial fibrosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dietary-management-of-eosinophilic-esophagitis/abstract/1,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,10</a>]. Three of 17 children (18 percent) treated with elimination diet had decreased fibrosis following therapy in one series [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dietary-management-of-eosinophilic-esophagitis/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. Whether the rates of remodeling resolution are greater with elemental formula than an elimination diet remains to be assessed. However, from the limited available data, it appears that topical glucocorticoids are more efficient at altering fibrosis in children and adults than dietary therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dietary-management-of-eosinophilic-esophagitis/abstract/10,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,11</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-eosinophilic-esophagitis#H209980\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of eosinophilic esophagitis&quot;, section on 'Pharmacologic therapy'</a>.)</p><p>The appeal of the dietary approach is that it potentially offers an effective nonpharmacologic treatment, with continued food avoidance functioning as a long-term disease control option. On the other hand, allergen avoidance with elimination and elemental diets poses a risk of nutritional deprivation, can be difficult for patients and families (particularly if nasogastric feedings are required), can lead to psychological problems, and may lead to unnecessary food aversion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dietary-management-of-eosinophilic-esophagitis/abstract/12,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,13</a>]. In addition, relapse upon discontinuation of the diet is common [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dietary-management-of-eosinophilic-esophagitis/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>], and long-term EoE recurrence rates, while on the same diet, remain to be clearly elucidated. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-eosinophilic-esophagitis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of eosinophilic esophagitis&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The general approach to choosing which therapies to use in the treatment of EoE is discussed in greater detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-eosinophilic-esophagitis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of eosinophilic esophagitis&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9241763\"><span class=\"h1\">DIETARY TREATMENT OPTIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The three primary choices for initial dietary avoidance of potential food allergen triggers in patients with EoE are (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=allergy-testing-in-eosinophilic-esophagitis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Allergy testing in eosinophilic esophagitis&quot;</a>):</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Testing-directed elimination diet</strong> &ndash; This diet is also called the directed elimination diet or testing-based elimination diet. Skin prick testing (SPT) and atopy patch testing (APT) are performed to test for food allergies, with subsequent elimination of foods with positive test results (plus cow's milk because of its poor negative predictive value on testing). This approach has met with success in two pediatric trials [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dietary-management-of-eosinophilic-esophagitis/abstract/8,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,14</a>] at two pediatric centers. However, testing-based diets in adults and at other centers have not been as successful [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dietary-management-of-eosinophilic-esophagitis/abstract/15,16\" class=\"abstract_t\">15,16</a>]. Limited data suggest that in vitro specific immunoglobulin E (IgE) testing may be useful for identification of EoE food triggers, although further study is needed. (See <a href=\"#H9242303\" class=\"local\">'Elimination diets'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Empiric elimination diet</strong> &ndash; The empiric elimination diet is based upon the concept that the empiric avoidance of those foods that most commonly cause immediate hypersensitivity in a population, such as the United States, would also resolve EoE. As such, this diet empirically eliminates foods that account for the majority of IgE-mediated food reactions (ie, milk, egg, soy, wheat, <span class=\"nowrap\">peanuts/tree</span> nuts, <span class=\"nowrap\">fish/shellfish)</span>. This is called the six-food elimination diet (SFED). However, accumulating data show that <span class=\"nowrap\">fish/shellfish</span> and <span class=\"nowrap\">peanuts/tree</span> nuts are rare triggers for EoE, and foods such as grains and meats are more common triggers. Studies from Spain demonstrate success of four-food group elimination (milk, egg, legumes, wheat) in adults, and a US study in children found similar results with elimination of milk, egg, soy, and wheat. Limited prospective data in children show that isolated milk elimination can decrease eosinophilia and improve symptoms, but not necessarily quality of life. (See <a href=\"#H9242303\" class=\"local\">'Elimination diets'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Elemental diet</strong> &ndash; The patient is placed on an elemental formula, which eliminates all potential food allergens. (See <a href=\"#H9242276\" class=\"local\">'Elemental diets'</a> below.)</p><p/><p>These diets are used both as therapy and as a diagnostic tool to identify specific food triggers. As such, the initial diets are not permanent, but rather a starting point. Typically, the initial diet is followed for four to eight weeks. Symptoms are assessed, and a repeat upper endoscopy with esophageal biopsies is performed at the end of the initial avoidance period.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9242276\"><span class=\"h2\">Elemental diets</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The first evidence for food as an EoE trigger came from studies demonstrating resolution of esophageal eosinophilia following treatment with amino acid-based (elemental) formulas (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F79377\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef79377 \">table 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F63667\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef63667 \">table 2</a>) in children with gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD)-like symptoms and significant eosinophilia who did not respond histologically or symptomatically to acid blockade [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dietary-management-of-eosinophilic-esophagitis/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. Since that time, a number of pediatric studies have documented that amino acid formula, which results in removal of all allergenic food peptides, is one of the most effective EoE treatments [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dietary-management-of-eosinophilic-esophagitis/abstract/1,6,14,17-22\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,6,14,17-22</a>]. Elemental formula has not been extensively studied in adults with EoE, primarily because it is a difficult approach for adults to follow.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9242303\"><span class=\"h2\">Elimination diets</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The evidence for the role of food allergies in EoE from studies of elemental diets led to the examination of elimination of specific foods from the diet [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dietary-management-of-eosinophilic-esophagitis/abstract/1,3,5,14,22-24\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,3,5,14,22-24</a>]. Individual food triggers in EoE were evaluated by multiple food eliminations followed by an assessment of histologic, symptom, and endoscopic findings to determine if the disease had resolved. Single foods were then reintroduced. Each food reintroduction was assessed histologically with esophageal biopsies since there are no surrogate disease markers or validated symptoms tools that have been shown to function as reliable indicators of EoE disease activity. Most dietary eliminations were performed for six to eight weeks, with reintroduction of &quot;everyday&quot; amounts of each potential antigenic trigger for another six to eight weeks prior to repeat endoscopic evaluation.</p><p>The exact timeframe for foods to induce EoE and for the disease findings to resolve upon food trigger removal is not clear. However, data in adult patients show that EoE can recrudesce endoscopically and histologically in as little as 7 to 14 days, while symptoms and esophageal eosinophilia can recur in approximately three days after food reintroduction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dietary-management-of-eosinophilic-esophagitis/abstract/3,25\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,25</a>]. In addition, there is evidence that food elimination coupled with other EoE-directed therapies can reverse the fibrotic complications of EoE in children [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dietary-management-of-eosinophilic-esophagitis/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. In addition, data also suggest that the combination of food avoidance and topical glucocorticoids (used continuously for two months followed by intermittent symptom-based use for a total of 12 months) can be effective treatment in children [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dietary-management-of-eosinophilic-esophagitis/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>].</p><p>Eliminated foods can be chosen empirically through the avoidance of multiple common food allergens (empiric diet) or via testing that uses food SPT and APT as the basis for antigen eliminations (testing-directed diet). SPT examines immediate hypersensitivity to food antigens, and APT attempts to elucidate delayed-type, cell-mediated reactions to foods. SPT has been standardized and validated for immediate food hypersensitivity. However, APT has not been standardized or validated for EoE and largely remains a research tool. Studies in adults and children have shown that directed diets based upon serum IgE in isolation or in addition to skin <span class=\"nowrap\">prick/patch</span> testing can be successful to varying extents, although this needs further study [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dietary-management-of-eosinophilic-esophagitis/abstract/16,27-29\" class=\"abstract_t\">16,27-29</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=allergy-testing-in-eosinophilic-esophagitis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Allergy testing in eosinophilic esophagitis&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Adherence to dietary therapy that involves elimination of multiple foods is difficult, which has raised the question of whether less restrictive diets are an option as the initial approach. In one series of children with EoE who underwent testing-directed elimination diets, a 30 percent success rate was seen with milk elimination alone, and a 47 percent success rate was seen with elimination of milk, egg, and wheat [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dietary-management-of-eosinophilic-esophagitis/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. A higher remission rate is seen with empiric elimination of milk alone, with 65 percent (11 of 17) of children in a retrospective series [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dietary-management-of-eosinophilic-esophagitis/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>] and 64 percent (9 of 14) of children in a prospective series attaining remission after empirically eliminating only milk [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dietary-management-of-eosinophilic-esophagitis/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]. However, in children with EoE and concomitant celiac disease, gluten elimination alone does not appear to resolve EoE in most cases, with resolution seen in only one of seven patients in one retrospective series [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dietary-management-of-eosinophilic-esophagitis/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>]. In a larger, prospective study of four-food elimination (milk, soy, egg, wheat) in 78 children with EoE, histologic remission was achieved in 64 percent, and 91 percent of these patients had decreased symptoms (36 percent had complete resolution of symptoms) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dietary-management-of-eosinophilic-esophagitis/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>]. In a prospective Spanish study of adults with EoE, 28 of 52 (54 percent) achieved clinical and histopathologic remission on a diet that eliminated milk, eggs, wheat, and legumes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dietary-management-of-eosinophilic-esophagitis/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>]. Additional prospective studies of more limited empiric elimination diets (eg, milk only or milk, soy, egg, and wheat) are underway.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H676935639\"><span class=\"h1\">EFFICACY OF DIFFERENT DIETARY APPROACHES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The percent of patients who improve with these dietary elimination approaches (testing directed and empiric) is lower than with the elemental diet, but a significant number of patients still improve, supporting the role of immunologic reactions to food in the pathogenesis of EoE [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dietary-management-of-eosinophilic-esophagitis/abstract/3,8,14,16,28,35\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,8,14,16,28,35</a>]. A systematic review and meta-analysis that included 1317 children and 189 adults with EoE found that the efficacy rate for elemental formulas exceeded 90 percent, and esophageal eosinophil resolution was more complete following this intervention compared with elimination diets [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dietary-management-of-eosinophilic-esophagitis/abstract/36,37\" class=\"abstract_t\">36,37</a>]. This same review found that the empiric six-food elimination diet (SFED) was effective in reducing esophageal eosinophilia to &lt;15 <span class=\"nowrap\">eosinophils/hpf</span> in 72 percent of patients who used that approach to treatment, whereas the testing-directed diet was effective in 45 percent.</p><p>The following studies, some of which examined both histologic and symptomatic improvement, are illustrative:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The effectiveness of the three main dietary therapies was examined in a retrospective cohort [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dietary-management-of-eosinophilic-esophagitis/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. Histologic remission occurred in 98 (48 of 49), 81 (21 of 26), and 65 (15 of 23) percent of patients on the elemental, SFED, and testing-directed elimination diets, respectively. The elemental diet was superior to the other two dietary therapies, which were not significantly different from each other.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Between 53 to 72 percent of patients in pediatric series had resolution of symptoms and histologic findings when foods found on testing (skin prick testing [SPT] and atopy patch testing [APT]) were removed from the diet [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dietary-management-of-eosinophilic-esophagitis/abstract/5,24\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,24</a>]. This approach was less successful when attempted in adults, with 5 out of 15 patients responding to a testing-directed elimination diet in one series [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dietary-management-of-eosinophilic-esophagitis/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>] and 5 of 9 demonstrating histologic improvement in another study [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dietary-management-of-eosinophilic-esophagitis/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The rates of success with the SFED are similar to that seen with testing-directed diets in children, as noted in the study above [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dietary-management-of-eosinophilic-esophagitis/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. As another example, resolution of symptoms and normalization of biopsies were seen in 74 percent (26 of 35) pediatric patients in one series [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dietary-management-of-eosinophilic-esophagitis/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. In an adult series of 50 patients, 64 percent had normalization of histology, 78 percent had their peak eosinophil density decrease by at least half, and 94 percent had a decrease in dysphagia symptom scores [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dietary-management-of-eosinophilic-esophagitis/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The limited available data suggest that an elemental diet is effective in adults also, but adherence is difficult. One study of adult patients treated with elemental formula demonstrated good histologic resolution in 72 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dietary-management-of-eosinophilic-esophagitis/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. However, only 62 percent were able to adhere to the diet, and neither symptoms nor fixed obstructions improved.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1101692030\"><span class=\"h1\">IMPLICATED FOODS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Both empiric and directed methods for antigen elimination show that milk is the most common food trigger for EoE in children, and it is also a common trigger in adults [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dietary-management-of-eosinophilic-esophagitis/abstract/8,23,28,35,38,39\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,23,28,35,38,39</a>]. However, some patients with EoE triggered by milk are able to tolerate more processed forms of dairy, such as baked milk or extensively hydrolyzed cow's milk-based formula [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dietary-management-of-eosinophilic-esophagitis/abstract/40,41\" class=\"abstract_t\">40,41</a>]. While peanuts, tree nuts, fish, and shellfish are common triggers in food-induced anaphylaxis, they do not commonly trigger EoE in either children or adults [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dietary-management-of-eosinophilic-esophagitis/abstract/3,8,16,23\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,8,16,23</a>].</p><p>Empiric diet followed by single-food antigen reintroduction implicates wheat as the second most common trigger in children (26 percent), while directed diets demonstrate egg as the second most common food trigger in children [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dietary-management-of-eosinophilic-esophagitis/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. In another pediatric study of 78 children with EoE who underwent empiric four-food elimination and single-food antigen reintroduction, histologic inflammation was triggered by milk in 85 percent, egg in 35 percent, wheat in 33 percent, and soy in 19 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dietary-management-of-eosinophilic-esophagitis/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>]. In adults in the United States, wheat was the most common antigenic trigger identified (60 percent), followed by milk (50 percent), in a study of prospective empiric elimination and single-food reintroduction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dietary-management-of-eosinophilic-esophagitis/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. In another United States study that included nine patients who underwent food reintroduction after an empiric or directed elimination diet, milk was identified as a trigger in four, egg in four, wheat in two, shellfish in one, legumes in one, and tree nuts in one [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dietary-management-of-eosinophilic-esophagitis/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>].

Other important factors that may influence the decision include costs (often not borne by insurance providers), convenience, ease of adherence, and <span class=\"nowrap\">patient/family</span> preferences. When choosing a diet for any given individual with EoE, it is important to have a discussion with the patient and <span class=\"nowrap\">his/her</span> family regarding the advantages and disadvantages of dietary manipulation, as well as the importance of adherence to the chosen food restrictions. Approximately one-third of pediatric patients with EoE who go on an elimination diet are nonadherent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dietary-management-of-eosinophilic-esophagitis/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>]. It is also important to consider the resources of the treating center (eg, atopy patch testing [APT], nutritional counseling). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=allergy-testing-in-eosinophilic-esophagitis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Allergy testing in eosinophilic esophagitis&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-food-allergy-nutritional-issues\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of food allergy: Nutritional issues&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The empiric elimination diet is the preferred approach at the author's center. The most commonly used empiric elimination diet is the six-food elimination diet (SFED) that removes milk, egg, soy, wheat, <span class=\"nowrap\">peanuts/tree</span> nuts, and <span class=\"nowrap\">fish/shellfish</span>. Less restrictive diets are under investigation, and those such as the four-food group elimination diet (milk, egg, wheat, and legume elimination instead of isolated soy elimination) may be as, or close to as, successful as the SFED [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dietary-management-of-eosinophilic-esophagitis/abstract/31,34\" class=\"abstract_t\">31,34</a>]. Success rates for the empiric diet are similar to that seen for the testing-based diet (see <a href=\"#H9242303\" class=\"local\">'Elimination diets'</a> above). The empiric diet does not require APT, although skin prick testing (SPT) to the common food allergens should still be performed because of the risk of unmasking an immunoglobulin E (IgE)-mediated allergy after elimination and reintroduction of a food in the diet (see <a href=\"#H4145159\" class=\"local\">'Reintroduction of foods'</a> below). This approach is particularly useful in the patient who is negative to all foods on testing and in adults who tend to have fewer &quot;positive&quot; tests to foods that are often not clinically relevant. The primary issue with this diet is compliance and potential nutritional deficiencies because it requires removal of many of the staples in the diet. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=allergy-testing-in-eosinophilic-esophagitis#H21497005\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Allergy testing in eosinophilic esophagitis&quot;, section on 'Food allergy testing in EoE'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-food-allergy-nutritional-issues\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of food allergy: Nutritional issues&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The use of the empiric elimination diet has brought up a number of issues regarding avoidance of specific foods versus food groups. Initial studies did wheat elimination only, a practice follow by most US practitioners who were polled (17 of 21). In contrast, international practitioners were more likely to eliminate all gluten-containing grains (wheat, rye, barley) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dietary-management-of-eosinophilic-esophagitis/abstract/43\" class=\"abstract_t\">43</a>]. These clinical practices may reflect the required allergen labeling that is different in the US and Europe. In addition, while most US clinicians recommend avoidance of only soy, Spanish investigators tend to recommend avoidance of all legumes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dietary-management-of-eosinophilic-esophagitis/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>].</p><p>Others prefer a testing-directed elimination diet that includes the elimination of milk regardless of the testing results because of the poor negative predictive values for milk (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=allergy-testing-in-eosinophilic-esophagitis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Allergy testing in eosinophilic esophagitis&quot;</a>). One potential advantage of a testing-based diet is the avoidance of fewer foods. This can lower the cost of the elimination diet and also make the diet easier to follow. In addition, less common food triggers may be identified and removed from the diet with this approach that would have been missed and continued in the diet with the empiric elimination approach. However, these advantages must be weighed against the ability of the clinical practice to do patch testing, a process that is time consuming for both the practice and the patient. In addition, there may be greater issues with compliance in patients who fail this dietary approach and then attempt an even more restrictive diet if they become discouraged or overwhelmed by the effort (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F88643\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef88643 \">table 3</a>). It is possible that serum IgE testing to the foods avoided in the SFED could be of utility in minimizing the number of foods eliminated [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dietary-management-of-eosinophilic-esophagitis/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. However, additional studies are needed before this approach can be implemented. (See <a href=\"#H9242303\" class=\"local\">'Elimination diets'</a> above.)</p><p>The highest success rates in symptomatic and histologic improvement in children are seen with the elemental diet. However, even in children, this diet is the most difficult to follow. Thus, we typically reserve the elemental diet for patients who fail other therapies, break through a therapy that initially appeared effective, or prefer this method as the initial approach.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5800399\"><span class=\"h1\">INSTITUTING AN ELIMINATION DIET</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Generally, an approach that involves <span class=\"nowrap\">allergy/immunology,</span> gastroenterology, and a dietitian may be the most successful. However, this model may be difficult in the private practice or community healthcare setting. When available, a dietitian who is familiar with food allergies is a valuable part of the patient's care team when instituting an elimination diet. The role of the dietitian can include help with information on the use of antigen-free foods, particularly ideas for substitutes of favorite foods and ways to ensure a nutritionally adequate diet, recipe suggestions, and review of allergen avoidance. A single, retrospective study has assessed the effect of diet on the weight for height score in children with EoE treated with elimination diet or elemental formula. Ten percent of the EoE population had a Z-score of -2 (moderate malnutrition) at baseline. Following therapy, there was no substantial change in nutritional status assessed by weight per height [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dietary-management-of-eosinophilic-esophagitis/abstract/44\" class=\"abstract_t\">44</a>]. However, vitamin supplements may be necessary in certain contexts, such as in subjects who must avoid foods containing calcium and vitamin D. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-food-allergy-avoidance\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of food allergy: Avoidance&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Patients can start the diet as soon as they are ready. Some advance preparation may be required as far as grocery shopping for specialty items and exploring meal options with the foods available to increase the chances of adherence to the diet. Additionally, some patients without significant symptoms may prefer to wait until after a major holiday to start the diet. Patients also need to be honest about any cheating or accidental exposures while on the diet so that they do not undergo an endoscopy unnecessarily. Depending upon the size of the exposure, the proximity to the scheduled follow-up endoscopy, and the particular food, the endoscopy may be delayed.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4145159\"><span class=\"h1\">REINTRODUCTION OF FOODS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>If symptoms and histology have improved, foods are then reintroduced one at a time. If symptoms and histology have not improved after the initial dietary eliminations, pharmacologic therapy may be started or a more stringent elimination or elemental diet (if not the initial approach) may be undertaken.</p><p>There are several possible reasons for failure of the initial diet that should be explored before the therapy is adjusted. The initial diet may not have eliminated any of the food triggers for the patient; the initial diet may have eliminated some, but not all, of the food triggers; adherence to the diet may have been poor; allergies to inhalant allergens may be contributing to the disease process in addition to food allergies; or there may be an unidentified trigger. Pharmacologic therapy is probably the best option if adherence to the initial dietary elimination approach was an issue or if a patient fails elemental therapy despite good adherence. If a more stringent diet is chosen, foods to consider removing include corn, beef, chicken, pork, potato, and rice [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dietary-management-of-eosinophilic-esophagitis/abstract/8,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,14</a>]. If additional foods are removed, lower-risk foods, such as <span class=\"nowrap\">peanut/tree</span> nuts and <span class=\"nowrap\">fish/shellfish,</span> could be reintroduced first to decrease the numbers of foods removed. Further skin prick <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> atopy patch testing <span class=\"nowrap\">(SPT/APT)</span> may be performed at this point if not done previously. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-eosinophilic-esophagitis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of eosinophilic esophagitis&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=allergy-testing-in-eosinophilic-esophagitis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Allergy testing in eosinophilic esophagitis&quot;</a>.)</p><p>In patients who have had histologic and symptomatic improvement, our usual approach to food reintroduction is as follows:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We typically have patients consume the reintroduced <span class=\"nowrap\">food/food</span> group in normal amounts for 8 to 12 weeks and then repeat the endoscopy if they are asymptomatic or symptoms are still significantly decreased from baseline. If the patient's endoscopy is normal, we then reintroduce another food and repeat the process. Adult data show that recurrence of esophageal eosinophilia can occur within a relatively rapid timeframe of three to seven days after food reintroduction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dietary-management-of-eosinophilic-esophagitis/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. Thus, a shorter timeframe of food reintroduction before endoscopy (eg, two to four weeks) is a reasonable alternative clinical approach.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>If a patient becomes symptomatic with a food reintroduction, the food is removed from the diet again, and an endoscopy is not performed. We proceed with reintroduction of the next food after symptoms have subsided (approximately two to four weeks). However, if the patient becomes symptomatic with reintroduction of several foods, then we will do an endoscopy to determine if it is normal. In patients with normal endoscopies at this stage, we consider concomitant diagnoses, such as irritable bowel syndrome and gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>If an endoscopy is abnormal after a food reintroduction but the patient is asymptomatic, the course depends upon the severity of the findings. We usually remove the food if there are significant findings, such as esophageal narrowing, linear furrows, fibrosis, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> eosinophilia throughout the esophagus. In contrast, if the findings are minor, for example, mild eosinophilia in a single biopsy with a normal esophageal appearance, then we will leave the food in the diet and repeat the endoscopy after a few months. However, if it was one of the first foods added back, we would take it back out of the diet, even if histologic findings were minor, and try adding back in other foods first before retrying that food. In addition, other treatments are considered, for example, institution of a proton pump inhibitor (PPI) for isolated distal eosinophilia.</p><p/><p>An alternative to following each asymptomatic food reintroduction with an endoscopy is to have the patient reintroduce, one at a time, several of the foods that are lowest on the list of suspected triggers (usually nuts, seafood, and soy for the six-food elimination diet [SFED], but this depends upon individual patient test results) and then perform the endoscopy. One possible benefit to this second approach is fewer endoscopies if the reintroductions are successful. However, if the endoscopy is abnormal, the patient will have to backtrack on the diet and undergo additional endoscopies to determine which of the foods are triggers. The best order and timing of food reintroduction still requires systematic evaluation.</p><p>Patients can have immunoglobulin E (IgE) sensitization to food antigens without clinical reactivity to the foods. Loss of tolerance can occur upon removal of these foods, particularly milk and peanut, to which a person has IgE sensitization [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dietary-management-of-eosinophilic-esophagitis/abstract/45\" class=\"abstract_t\">45</a>]. As such, subjects who have been counseled to avoid foods based upon IgE sensitization have the potential for IgE-mediated reactions (eg, anaphylaxis) upon food reintroduction. For this reason, the EoE consensus recommendation suggests dispensing an injectable <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epinephrine-adrenaline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">epinephrine</a> to patients who have significant levels of food-specific IgE if that food will be avoided during the course of EoE treatment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dietary-management-of-eosinophilic-esophagitis/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p>We often prescribe autoinjectable <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epinephrine-adrenaline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">epinephrine</a> for patients who will be avoiding a food for which they demonstrated elevated serum IgE or that results in a large (&gt;8 mm wheal) positive on SPT, especially if the food is a nut (peanut or tree nut) or milk <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> if the patient has a history of asthma. In addition, we suggest that the practicing allergist perform a medically supervised oral food challenge if there is significant food-specific IgE to the antigen that will be reintroduced following dietary elimination, particularly if the patient has asthma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dietary-management-of-eosinophilic-esophagitis/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. The rates of loss of tolerance and subsequent IgE-mediated reactions with reintroduction in EoE patients treated with food avoidance have not been systematically evaluated. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diagnostic-evaluation-of-food-allergy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Diagnostic evaluation of food allergy&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=oral-food-challenges-for-diagnosis-and-management-of-food-allergies\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Oral food challenges for diagnosis and management of food allergies&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3283447803\"><span class=\"h1\">NATURAL HISTORY OF FOOD ALLERGIES IN EoE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The natural history of food allergy in children with EoE appears to be distinct from the pattern seen in classic immunoglobulin E (IgE)-mediated food hypersensitivity, in which allergies to milk, egg, wheat, and soy are usually outgrown by approximately six to eight years of age [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dietary-management-of-eosinophilic-esophagitis/abstract/46\" class=\"abstract_t\">46</a>]. In contrast, data in children with EoE suggest that food allergies associated with EoE usually persist [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dietary-management-of-eosinophilic-esophagitis/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].</p><p>Since adults can have new-onset EoE, this suggests that either food tolerance is not attained in childhood, is lost during adulthood, or that older <span class=\"nowrap\">children/adults</span> with EoE may have a proclivity to accumulate food reactions. As such, if reintroduction of a particular food fails, we suggest avoidance of that food for at least two years before attempting reintroduction again.</p><p>Although the mechanisms for the more persistent allergy are not clear, data invoke a potential role for immunoglobulin G4 (IgG4) in EoE. IgG4 can sometimes be found in immune complexes or as free granules in EoE esophageal biopsies. Whether this is pathogenic remains to be evaluated. However, the mounting data, including the failure of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=omalizumab-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">omalizumab</a> to alter EoE, suggest that IgE has a less prominent <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> ancillary role in EoE, which may explain the differences in the natural disease history [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dietary-management-of-eosinophilic-esophagitis/abstract/47,48\" class=\"abstract_t\">47,48</a>].

The evidence for the role of food allergies in the pathogenesis of EoE is in part based upon the clinical response when patients are placed on various elimination diets, with resolution of symptoms and normalization of esophageal biopsies.
