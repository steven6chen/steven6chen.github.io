In the Epidemiology of Diabetes Interventions and Complications (EDIC) follow-up study to the DCCT, intensive insulin therapy in patients with type 1 diabetes decreased fatal and nonfatal cardiovascular events. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=glycemic-control-and-vascular-complications-in-type-1-diabetes-mellitus\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Glycemic control and vascular complications in type 1 diabetes mellitus&quot;</a>.)</p><p>What was considered &quot;intensive therapy&quot; in the DCCT is now considered to be standard therapy for management of type 1 diabetes. However, intensive insulin therapy (three or more injections per day or continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion with an insulin pump) is successful only if the patient is fully committed to it, has good understanding of the regimen, and is supported by a health care team with sufficient enthusiasm and expertise to educate the patient and to continuously monitor his or her progress. For these reasons, alternative options for achieving near-normal glycemia in patients with type 1 diabetes are desirable. The goal of transplantation is to allow insulin independence, improve quality of life, and reduce secondary complications.</p><p>This topic will briefly review the history, techniques, and clinical results of pancreas and pancreatic islet transplantation in hyperglycemic patients with longstanding type 1 diabetes mellitus, with a focus upon transplantation of islet or pancreatic tissue alone. Combined pancreas-kidney transplantation is discussed separately.

Both pancreas and islet transplantation require lifelong immunosuppression to prevent rejection of the graft and recurrence of the autoimmune process. Conventional maintenance regimens consist of a combination of immunosuppressive agents that differ by mechanism of action. This strategy minimizes morbidity and mortality associated with each class of agent while maximizing overall effectiveness. However, the immunosuppressive agents used in transplantation often have side effects (eg, diarrhea, neutropenia, anemia, fatigue, hypertension) severe enough to adversely affect quality of life. Thus, transplantation is generally considered only in patients with serious progressive complications of diabetes in whom the quality of life is unacceptable.</p><p>The American Diabetes Association (ADA) criteria for transplantation are as follows [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pancreas-and-islet-transplantation-in-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients with end-stage renal disease who have had or plan to have a kidney transplant are candidates for pancreas transplantation. The successful transplantation of a pancreas will improve glycemia and may improve kidney survival. Most pancreatic transplants are performed in patients with diabetes and end-stage renal disease. The majority of these patients receive simultaneous pancreas-kidney transplantation rather than pancreas after kidney transplantation. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=patient-selection-for-and-immunologic-issues-relating-to-kidney-pancreas-transplantation-in-diabetes-mellitus\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Patient selection for and immunologic issues relating to kidney-pancreas transplantation in diabetes mellitus&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients without substantial renal disease are candidates for pancreas transplantation alone if they have a history of frequent, acute, severe metabolic complications (hypoglycemia, marked hyperglycemia, ketoacidosis); incapacitating clinical and emotional problems with exogenous insulin therapy; and consistent failure of insulin-based management to prevent acute complications.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Islet transplantation is an evolving technology. This procedure should be performed only within the context of a controlled research study.</p><p/><p>Once these indications are met, the pretransplant screening for cardiovascular disease is the same as for combined kidney-pancreas transplantation.

In addition, there are few observational studies comparing pancreas and islet transplantation procedures. In a report from a single center that performed 33 pancreas alone and 33 islet transplantation procedures, patients undergoing pancreas transplantation had a higher rate of insulin independence (75 versus 59 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pancreas-and-islet-transplantation-in-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. The rate of long-term adverse events (length and frequency of hospitalization, reintervention for acute surgical or immunological complications, infections) was higher in the patients who received pancreas transplantation.</p><p>Data from pancreas and islet transplantation registries support these observations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pancreas-and-islet-transplantation-in-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/3-5\" class=\"abstract_t\">3-5</a>]. Pancreas transplantation has a higher rate of insulin independence (graft survival 81, 55, and 51 percent at one, three, and five years, respectively), but it is associated with higher morbidity due to general surgery. The islet transplantation procedure is less invasive and, therefore, it is associated with lower morbidity. However, rates of long-term success (defined by insulin independence) are also lower. In 2009, data from the Collaborative Islet Transplant Registry (CITR) indicated that 70 percent of adults with type 1 diabetes who received islet transplantation were insulin independent at one year, 55 percent at two years, and 35 percent at three years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pancreas-and-islet-transplantation-in-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. Islet cell transplantation is still under development, and many experts believe that the current clinical benefit of islet transplantation does not outweigh the substantial risk of chronic immunosuppressive therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pancreas-and-islet-transplantation-in-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. Others are optimistic that the current limitations of islet transplantation will be resolved [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pancreas-and-islet-transplantation-in-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">PANCREAS TRANSPLANTATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Pancreas transplantation was first used for the treatment of diabetes in humans in 1966 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pancreas-and-islet-transplantation-in-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. The rates of graft and patient survival were low; as a result, very few procedures were performed in the early to mid-1970s.</p><p>The subsequent introduction of better immunosuppressive regimens (particularly <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cyclosporine-ciclosporin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cyclosporine</a> and anti-T-cell antibodies), new surgical techniques, and the selection of healthier recipients resulted in markedly improved outcomes. As a result, the number of pancreatic transplantations steadily increased each year in the United States, peaking at 1484 in 2004 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pancreas-and-islet-transplantation-in-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/3,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,9</a>]. In 2012, 630 procedures were recorded, approximately 25 percent of which involved the pancreas alone (without a kidney transplanted before or at the same time as the pancreas) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pancreas-and-islet-transplantation-in-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Outcomes</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4340511\"><span class=\"h3\">Patient and graft survival</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The mortality, morbidity, and results of transplantation vary with operative experience and patient selection. The following overall outcomes are based upon 2007 to 2010 data [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pancreas-and-islet-transplantation-in-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/11-13\" class=\"abstract_t\">11-13</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patient survival rates ranged from 95 to 98 percent at one year, 91 to 92 percent at three years, and 78 to 88 percent at five years postoperatively. The majority of deaths were due to cardiovascular disease and usually occurred more than three months after discharge from hospital.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pancreas graft survival (defined as total freedom from insulin therapy, normal fasting blood glucose concentrations, and normal or only slightly high glycated hemoglobin [A1C] values) rates for simultaneous kidney-pancreas procedures were 86 and 54 percent at 1 and 10 years, respectively. For pancreas alone, the rates were 78 to 88 and 27 percent at 1 and 10 years, respectively.</p><p/><p>Pancreas graft survival is inversely related to several donor variables, including age, body mass index, and cardiovascular death. Recipients of pancreas transplantation alone whose organs came from donors with poor donor risk indices had a lower rate of graft survival compared with recipients of simultaneous kidney-pancreas recipients (77 versus 88 percent at one year) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pancreas-and-islet-transplantation-in-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>].</p><p>Among pancreas recipients, those who receive combined kidney-pancreas transplantation have better graft survival than pancreas transplantation alone, in part because of the lack of a marker for pancreas rejection that is as sensitive as serum creatinine as a marker for kidney transplant rejection. Thus, rejection is more difficult to detect with pancreas transplantation alone and antirejection therapy is initiated relatively later. (See <a href=\"#H8\" class=\"local\">'Rejection'</a> below.)</p><p>It has been reported that in patients with preserved renal function, survival after pancreas transplant may be worse than for patients on the waiting list receiving conventional therapy for diabetes. This was reported in a retrospective study of 11,572 patients with diabetes on a waiting list for pancreas transplantation (pancreas-only, pancreas-after-kidney, or simultaneous pancreas-kidney) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pancreas-and-islet-transplantation-in-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>].</p><p>However, these data should be interpreted with caution as there could be important differences between the group transplanted with a pancreas alone and those on the waiting list (who may turn down a pancreas if feeling well) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pancreas-and-islet-transplantation-in-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. In addition, some patients from the waiting list group were counted more than once because they were registered on more than one list, and 8 percent of patients on the pancreas transplant waiting lists were removed from the waiting lists and underwent a kidney transplant first because of deteriorating kidney function. These differences could have biased the outcome of the study in favor of those on the waiting list. In a subsequent analysis that eliminated these multiple listings, there were no significant differences in mortality rates between patients on the waiting list and those receiving pancreas-after-kidney or pancreas-alone transplants [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pancreas-and-islet-transplantation-in-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4339832\"><span class=\"h3\">Metabolic effects</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Both cross-sectional and prospective studies have shown that successful pancreatic transplantation results in independence from exogenous insulin therapy, improvement in glucose metabolism, A1C values, acute insulin responses to intravenous glucose, and counterregulatory responses of serum glucagon and glucose to insulin-induced hypoglycemia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pancreas-and-islet-transplantation-in-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/11,18,19\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,18,19</a>]. These beneficial effects on glucose regulation, the result of restoring pancreatic islet function, are maintained for many years. Persistent improvement for 15 years is common in some centers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pancreas-and-islet-transplantation-in-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>].</p><p>Patients with well-functioning grafts have normal insulin responses to oral and intravenous glucose stimulation as well as to intravenous <a href=\"topic.htm?path=arginine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">arginine</a> and intravenous <a href=\"topic.htm?path=secretin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">secretin</a> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pancreas-and-islet-transplantation-in-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/18,21-27\" class=\"abstract_t\">18,21-27</a>]. However, basal and stimulated peripheral insulin concentrations are two to three times higher than normal. This hyperinsulinemia is due mostly to the systemic (rather than portal) venous drainage of the allograft [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pancreas-and-islet-transplantation-in-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/23,28\" class=\"abstract_t\">23,28</a>]. Thus, the hepatic first-pass uptake and metabolism of insulin secreted into the portal vein are bypassed; in normal subjects, 50 to 90 percent of the insulin in portal venous blood undergoes first-pass hepatic degradation.</p><p>It is unlikely that posttransplantation hyperinsulinemia has adverse effects on cardiovascular risk. The increase in insulin does not have unfavorable effects on serum lipids; serum triglyceride and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol concentrations tend to fall and serum high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol concentrations tend to rise in recipients of pancreatic transplants [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pancreas-and-islet-transplantation-in-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/29-31\" class=\"abstract_t\">29-31</a>].</p><p>Glucose counterregulation after hypoglycemia is improved by pancreas transplantation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pancreas-and-islet-transplantation-in-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/32-34\" class=\"abstract_t\">32-34</a>]. This is an important benefit because patients who have had diabetes for many years before transplantation typically have abnormal glucose counterregulation due to decreased serum glucagon and epinephrine responses to hypoglycemia (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=physiologic-response-to-hypoglycemia-in-normal-subjects-and-patients-with-diabetes-mellitus\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Physiologic response to hypoglycemia in normal subjects and patients with diabetes mellitus&quot;</a>). The improvement in glucose counterregulation in recipients of pancreatic transplants is due to normalization of the glucagon counterregulatory response and improvement in the epinephrine counterregulatory response [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pancreas-and-islet-transplantation-in-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>]. Recognition of symptoms of hypoglycemia also improves [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pancreas-and-islet-transplantation-in-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>]. Hypoglycemia as a complication of pancreas transplantation has been reported [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pancreas-and-islet-transplantation-in-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>], but it is usually mild [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pancreas-and-islet-transplantation-in-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4339839\"><span class=\"h3\">Effects on the chronic complications of diabetes</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The impact of successful pancreas transplantation and normalization of glycemia on the secondary complications of diabetes is reviewed in detail elsewhere (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=benefits-and-complications-associated-with-kidney-pancreas-transplantation-in-diabetes-mellitus\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Benefits and complications associated with kidney-pancreas transplantation in diabetes mellitus&quot;</a>).

Combined pancreas-kidney transplantation improves serum lipid profiles and blood pressure without changing body weight in most patients, which might be expected to improve atherosclerotic vascular risk [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pancreas-and-islet-transplantation-in-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/30,53\" class=\"abstract_t\">30,53</a>]. Atherosclerotic risk profile was significantly better after kidney-pancreas compared with kidney-alone transplantation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pancreas-and-islet-transplantation-in-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/54\" class=\"abstract_t\">54</a>]. Other studies reported a significant decrease in carotid intima-media thickness after pancreas transplantation that was independent of changes in lipids, body mass index, or blood pressure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pancreas-and-islet-transplantation-in-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/55,56\" class=\"abstract_t\">55,56</a>].</p><p>These findings on the efficacy of pancreas transplantation on diabetic microvascular disease must be interpreted in light of the fact that most patients undergoing pancreas transplantation have already had diabetes for over two decades. Data are not available from prospective trials of patients undergoing pancreatic transplantation, compared with matched, stage-appropriate control populations.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Technique</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The technique used for pancreas transplantation is the same whether or not a kidney is transplanted into the pelvic area at the same time. In the most common procedure, a whole pancreas, still attached to a small portion of the duodenum containing the ampulla of Vater, is taken from a cadaveric donor. The pancreas is placed laterally in the pelvis, with arterial anastomosis to a branch of the iliac artery and venous anastomosis to a branch of the iliac vein, which results in secreted insulin appearing first in the systemic (rather than the hepatic portal) circulation. A modification to this approach includes portal rather than systemic drainage of the endocrine pancreas.</p><p>The duodenal segment is connected to the urinary bladder or to a loop of bowel, which receives the pancreatic exocrine secretion. Bladder drainage has the advantage of providing a means to monitor urine amylase concentration to help detect allograft rejection. The native pancreas is left intact.</p><p>Although most patients receive a pancreas from a cadaver donor, occasional patients receive a segment of pancreas donated by a living-related donor who is willing to undergo a hemipancreatectomy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pancreas-and-islet-transplantation-in-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/57\" class=\"abstract_t\">57</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Immunosuppression</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Despite a diversity of protocols, most recipients of pancreatic transplants receive monoclonal or polyclonal anti-T-cell antibodies at the time of surgery and chronic immunosuppression therapy consisting of a calcineurin inhibitor (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=cyclosporine-ciclosporin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cyclosporine</a> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tacrolimus-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">tacrolimus</a>) and an antimetabolite (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=mycophenolate-mofetil-cellcept-and-enteric-coated-mycophenolate-sodium-myfortic-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">mycophenolate</a> mofetil or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=azathioprine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">azathioprine</a>). With the availability of new immunosuppressive drugs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pancreas-and-islet-transplantation-in-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/58-61\" class=\"abstract_t\">58-61</a>], some centers are currently performing pancreas transplants without antibody treatment, and avoidance of glucocorticoids is increasingly common [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pancreas-and-islet-transplantation-in-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/62-66\" class=\"abstract_t\">62-66</a>]. Details concerning immunosuppressive regimens are discussed elsewhere.

Early graft loss, defined as loss occurring within hours or days after surgery, usually results from thrombosis, leaks, bleeding, infection, and pancreatitis (collectively referred to as technical failures). In one report of 211 patients undergoing pancreas transplant, technical graft failure occurred in 23 (11 percent), most commonly due to thrombosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pancreas-and-islet-transplantation-in-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/67\" class=\"abstract_t\">67</a>]. Risk factors for technical failure included donor and recipient obesity and increased preservation time of the donor organ. Later graft loss is more common and is most often caused by immunologic rejection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pancreas-and-islet-transplantation-in-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/68,69\" class=\"abstract_t\">68,69</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Rejection</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A transplanted pancreas can be rejected within days or after years of successful transplantation. Acute rejection of the pancreas is common, occurring in 60 to 80 percent of pancreas allografts [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pancreas-and-islet-transplantation-in-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/69,70\" class=\"abstract_t\">69,70</a>]. Treatment involves hospitalization and intensive immunosuppressive therapy. The methods used to treat acute rejection of a pancreas transplanted alone are similar to those used to treat rejection of kidney-pancreas transplants. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=patient-selection-for-and-immunologic-issues-relating-to-kidney-pancreas-transplantation-in-diabetes-mellitus\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Patient selection for and immunologic issues relating to kidney-pancreas transplantation in diabetes mellitus&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h3\">Detection</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Detection of pancreas rejection is made easier when a kidney has also been transplanted. An important clinical observation in kidney-pancreas transplantation recipients is that rejection of the pancreas graft is uncommon in the absence of concurrent kidney graft rejection (&le;15 percent), and it tends to lag in severity behind the kidney [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pancreas-and-islet-transplantation-in-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/71\" class=\"abstract_t\">71</a>]. As a result, measurements of serum creatinine are used to monitor for possible acute rejection of both grafts in patients with a functioning renal allograft. A relatively small increment in the serum creatinine is typically the first clinical sign of renal allograft rejection, although nonimmunologic causes must be excluded. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-acute-renal-allograft-rejection\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical features and diagnosis of acute renal allograft rejection&quot;</a>.)</p><p>As mentioned above, detection of rejection is more difficult with a pancreas transplant alone.

Progressive inflammation of acinar tissue may affect endocrine tissue function, thereby progressively damaging the islets of Langerhans, resulting in diabetes. The course of the disease is often punctuated by repeated pancreatic duct stenting <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> partial pancreatectomy. Some patients undergo total pancreatectomy for pain relief, which leads to immediate and total insulin deficiency diabetes. In the 1980s, surgeons at the University of Minnesota reasoned that the resected pancreas could be used for islet isolation and infusion of the islets into the patients' liver to effect auto-islet transplantation that would prevent onset of diabetes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pancreas-and-islet-transplantation-in-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/83\" class=\"abstract_t\">83</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H71084697\"><span class=\"h3\">Metabolic outcomes</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In contrast to most early studies of transplantation of islet allografts in patients with diabetes, islet autograft transplantation has been successful in nondiabetic adults and children with chronic painful pancreatitis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pancreas-and-islet-transplantation-in-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/83,84\" class=\"abstract_t\">83,84</a>].

On average, two separate procedures were required with infusion of islets one month apart.</p><p>As the trial was not randomized or controlled, it is unclear whether this impressive outcome was due to the harvesting of islets of high quality, the use of a modified immunosuppressive regimen, or some combination of these measures [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pancreas-and-islet-transplantation-in-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/94\" class=\"abstract_t\">94</a>]. In a five-year follow-up from the Edmonton program of 65 type 1 diabetic patients who received islet transplants, 47 achieved insulin independence [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pancreas-and-islet-transplantation-in-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/95\" class=\"abstract_t\">95</a>]. The median duration of insulin independence was 15 months, and only 10 percent of patients remained insulin independent at five years.

However, these patients retain some persistent islet function, require a lower daily dose of insulin, and show less glucose lability than prior to transplant [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pancreas-and-islet-transplantation-in-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/95,96\" class=\"abstract_t\">95,96</a>]. Even small, residual islet function can markedly decrease hypoglycemic events.

Because islets are obtained from multiple donors, islet transplant recipients are exposed to multiple human leukocyte antigen (HLA) mismatches. Multiple mismatches result in antibody formation, which may preclude the ability to undergo future transplantation (islet, kidney, pancreas) due to a decreased likelihood of finding a compatible graft.</p><p>In one series, 31 percent of islet transplant recipients developed new donor-specific HLA antibodies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pancreas-and-islet-transplantation-in-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/100\" class=\"abstract_t\">100</a>]. Discontinuation of immunosuppressants was associated with an abrupt rise in the appearance of HLA antibodies.

In one report of eight patients, the improved success with fewer islets was attributed to an induction immunosuppression regimen that included antithymocyte globulin and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=etanercept-including-biosimilars-of-etanercept-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">etanercept</a> (a tumor necrosis factor-alpha [TNFa] inhibitor), in addition to <a href=\"topic.htm?path=daclizumab-withdrawn-from-market-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">daclizumab</a> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pancreas-and-islet-transplantation-in-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/103\" class=\"abstract_t\">103</a>]. However, only obese donors (who have more islets than thin donors) were chosen in this study, and 10 of 18 of the donor pancreases still had to be discarded due to inadequate islet yield.
