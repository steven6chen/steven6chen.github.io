However, the IPS is largely used for patients with advanced stage HL, not patients with stage I to II disease. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=staging-and-prognosis-of-hodgkin-lymphoma#H9398231\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Staging and prognosis of Hodgkin lymphoma&quot;, section on 'International Prognostic Score'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5438145\"><span class=\"h1\">INITIAL THERAPY</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h2\">Choice of therapy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The treatment of early stage, favorable prognosis HL requires a careful balance between providing enough therapy to eradicate the tumor and avoiding unnecessary treatment that could result in excessive long-term treatment-related side effects. For patients with early stage, favorable prognosis HL, combination chemotherapy plus involved-field radiation therapy (IFRT) results in higher-disease free survival compared with chemotherapy alone. Overall survival, however, is similar with both approaches [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-favorable-prognosis-early-stage-i-ii-classical-hodgkin-lymphoma/abstract/3,4\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,4</a>].</p><p>Clinical trials have primarily addressed the question of treatment with combined modality therapy versus chemotherapy alone [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-favorable-prognosis-early-stage-i-ii-classical-hodgkin-lymphoma/abstract/5-10\" class=\"abstract_t\">5-10</a>]. What follows is a general discussion of the impact of these trials on patient care.</p><p>A choice regarding the use of combined modality therapy versus chemotherapy alone must take into consideration individual factors such as patient age, gender, and the location of the tumor. As examples:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For many patients with favorable prognosis stage I to II HL, treatment with combined modality therapy using abbreviated chemotherapy and limited radiation (involved-field or involved-site) is appropriate. As examples: older adults with cervical and axillary presentations or minimal mediastinal disease where the addition of radiation permits a reduction in the number of cycles of chemotherapy. This choice places a higher value on the avoidance of disease recurrence (and possible need for autologous hematopoietic cell transplantation) and reduction of potential chemotherapy-related complications than on the potential for long-term radiation-associated toxicities (including secondary malignancies). (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Combined modality therapy'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For other patients, treatment with chemotherapy alone is appropriate. As an example: young (age &lt;30) females with disease requiring irradiation of the breast tissue. This preference places a lower value on the slightly increased risk of relapse and a high value on the avoidance of potential radiation-associated complications. (See <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Chemotherapy alone'</a> below.)</p><p/><p>Combined modality therapy is associated with higher disease-free survival, but overall survival is similar with both approaches. Modern radiation therapy with lower dose and smaller field size will likely be associated with less long-term toxicity than treatment with higher doses and larger field size, without compromised efficacy, but this can only be confirmed with longer follow-up.</p><p>Despite the increasing availability of guidelines for the treatment of HL, there must remain room for individualization of treatment. In particular, patient preference must be considered with different treatment options, some of which result in a higher recurrence risk at the gain of less toxic initial treatment (without any difference in long-term survival). Treatment should also be individualized when a particular approach might result in a higher risk of a serious late complication (eg, the use of lung irradiation and the risk of late breast cancer in young females and of lung cancer in smokers). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=second-malignancies-after-treatment-of-classical-hodgkin-lymphoma\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Second malignancies after treatment of classical Hodgkin lymphoma&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Studies are in progress to determine whether mid-treatment imaging (eg, PET) can be used to determine whether adjuvant radiation is needed in individual patients with early stage disease, or to modify the treatment approach in patients who continue to have PET-positive disease after one or more courses of chemotherapy. This is discussed in more detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=monitoring-of-the-patient-with-classical-hodgkin-lymphoma-during-and-after-treatment#H6\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Monitoring of the patient with classical Hodgkin lymphoma during and after treatment&quot;, section on 'Radiologic studies'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Combined modality therapy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Combined modality therapy consisting of combination chemotherapy plus involved-field or involved-site radiation therapy (ISRT) yields the highest rates of initial disease control in patients with favorable prognosis stage I to II HL. While the RT acts to control known sites of tumor, the chemotherapy is aimed at occult disease outside the radiation field. The combination of the two modalities allows for a decrease in the number of chemotherapy cycles given.</p><p>In most of the modern trials, when compared with chemotherapy alone, combined modality treatment has resulted in higher rates of freedom from recurrence but no difference in overall survival [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-favorable-prognosis-early-stage-i-ii-classical-hodgkin-lymphoma/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. This lack of an overall survival benefit in most trials may be related to the effectiveness of salvage therapy after failure of treatment with chemotherapy alone.</p><p>Given these effective salvage therapies, trials in HL historically have required exceedingly long follow-up to see a difference in overall survival with initial therapy. As an example, a survival benefit to combined modality therapy compared with radiation alone was demonstrated only after 10-year follow-up of the large EORTC H8F trial [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-favorable-prognosis-early-stage-i-ii-classical-hodgkin-lymphoma/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h3\">Chemotherapy regimen</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>ABVD (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=doxorubicin-conventional-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">doxorubicin</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=bleomycin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">bleomycin</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=vinblastine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">vinblastine</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dacarbazine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">dacarbazine</a>) is the preferred combination chemotherapy regimen for the treatment of favorable prognosis stage I-II HL [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-favorable-prognosis-early-stage-i-ii-classical-hodgkin-lymphoma/abstract/12-15\" class=\"abstract_t\">12-15</a>].

Patients treated with combined modality therapy usually receive between two and four cycles of ABVD. As such, the total time of chemotherapy ranges from 8 to 16 weeks. Involved-field or involved-site radiation therapy, which requires two to four weeks, usually begins three to four weeks after the completion of chemotherapy. The main severe (grade <span class=\"nowrap\">3/4)</span> acute toxicities are neutropenia, <span class=\"nowrap\">nausea/vomiting,</span> and alopecia. Long term toxicities include cardiopulmonary toxicity, which is more frequently seen in children and in combination with mediastinal irradiation.

Many of the early randomized trials that examined combined modality therapy used regimens that contained an alkylating agent, usually MOPP (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=mechlorethamine-systemic-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">mechlorethamine</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=vincristine-conventional-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">vincristine</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=procarbazine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">procarbazine</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prednisone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">prednisone</a>) or an equivalent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-favorable-prognosis-early-stage-i-ii-classical-hodgkin-lymphoma/abstract/3,17\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,17</a>]. </p><p>Our preference for ABVD rather than alkylating-agent containing chemotherapy regimens for early stage favorable prognosis disease is largely based upon the extrapolation of trials that compared ABVD with other regimens in patients with more advanced HL. ABVD has demonstrated superior efficacy (ie, freedom from progression) and less toxicity when compared with MOPP in patients with unfavorable prognosis, early stage and advanced stage HL [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-favorable-prognosis-early-stage-i-ii-classical-hodgkin-lymphoma/abstract/18,19\" class=\"abstract_t\">18,19</a>]. Additional studies suggest that ABVD plus involved-field irradiation may be more effective and less toxic than alkylating agent regimens plus RT in stage I to II HL [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-favorable-prognosis-early-stage-i-ii-classical-hodgkin-lymphoma/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>].

This was best illustrated in the German Hodgkin Study Group (GHSG) HD13 trial of 1502 patients with favorable prognosis stage I to II HL treated with two cycles of combination chemotherapy followed by 30 Gy involved-field radiation therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-favorable-prognosis-early-stage-i-ii-classical-hodgkin-lymphoma/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. Patients were randomly assigned to receive one of four regimens: standard ABVD or the same schedule and doses without bleomycin (AVD), without dacarbazine (ABV), or without both bleomycin and dacarbazine (AV). The ABV and AV arms were closed early due to high rates of progression during initial therapy (3 to 5 versus &lt;1 percent with ABVD). Freedom from treatment failure (FFTF) at five years was 93 percent following ABVD and inferior following AVD (89 percent, hazard ratio [HR] 1.50), ABV (81 percent, HR 2.06), and AV (77 percent, HR 2.57). Overall survival at five years was not significantly different (98, 98, 94, and 98 percent, respectively). Given these results, neither bleomycin nor dacarbazine should be omitted from ABVD routinely. In contrast, bleomycin is omitted from subsequent cycles in patients who develop symptomatic or asymptomatic bleomycin-induced pulmonary toxicity during treatment. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=bleomycin-induced-lung-injury\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Bleomycin-induced lung injury&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5438104\"><span class=\"h3\">Number of cycles</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>ABVD (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=doxorubicin-conventional-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">doxorubicin</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=bleomycin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">bleomycin</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=vinblastine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">vinblastine</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dacarbazine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">dacarbazine</a>) is the preferred chemotherapy for most patients with favorable prognosis stage I to II HL. While most of the trials that have evaluated this approach used four or more cycles of ABVD, attempts have been made to decrease the number of chemotherapy cycles in an attempt to lessen toxicity without compromising efficacy. </p><p>The German Hodgkin Study Group (GHSG) HD10 Trial randomly assigned 1370 patients with favorable prognosis early stage HL to receive one of the following four treatments [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-favorable-prognosis-early-stage-i-ii-classical-hodgkin-lymphoma/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]: </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Four cycles of ABVD followed by 30 Gy IFRT </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Four cycles of ABVD followed by 20 Gy IFRT </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Two cycles of ABVD followed by 30 Gy IFRT </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Two cycles of ABVD followed by 20 Gy IFRT </p><p/><p>Eligibility criteria for this trial included patients with no more than two sites of disease, no extranodal extension, no mediastinal mass greater than or equal to one-third the maximum thoracic diameter, and ESR less than 50 (less than 30 if B symptoms present). At a median follow-up of 7.5 years, there was no significant difference between four and two cycles of ABVD chemotherapy in five-year overall survival (97.1 versus 96.6 percent), freedom from treatment failure (93.0 versus 91.1 percent), and progression-free survival (93.5 versus 91.2 percent). Estimated eight-year survival rates were also similar (95 versus 94 percent). However, there were significant differences in major toxicity (WHO grade <span class=\"nowrap\">III/IV)</span> between four and two cycles of ABVD in the overall number of events (52 versus 33 percent) including leukopenia (24 versus 15 percent), infections (5.1 versus 1.7 percent), and hair loss (28 versus 15 percent).</p><p>The results of this trial suggest that two cycles of ABVD followed by 20 Gy involved-field (or perhaps involved-site) radiation therapy, a treatment program that can be completed in three months, may be sufficient treatment for patients with favorable presentations of stage I to II HL, as defined by the GHSG. Three to four cycles of ABVD followed by 30 Gy ISRT can be used for patients with favorable risk early stage disease that would not fit the enrollment criteria for the GHSG study (eg, those with three sites of disease).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H20474631\"><span class=\"h3\">Radiation field size</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Over time there has been a movement to decrease the field of radiation in order to limit acute and long-term toxicities while maintaining survival rates.

For most patients, ISRT is preferred over larger radiation fields (eg, IFRT or EFRT). INRT can be considered a form of ISRT with more stringent requirements for pre-chemotherapy imaging studies. With ISRT and INRT, the radiation field is reduced in consideration of disease regression after chemotherapy to limit radiation to uninvolved normal organs. Intensity modulated RT, breath-hold techniques, and proton therapy can be used to limit damage to normal tissues further in select cases. In most cases, ISRT and INRT treatment fields are significantly smaller than those used with IFRT [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-favorable-prognosis-early-stage-i-ii-classical-hodgkin-lymphoma/abstract/25,26\" class=\"abstract_t\">25,26</a>]. &#160;</p><p>Multiple trials have demonstrated decreased toxicity and similar survival rates when IFRT is used in combination with chemotherapy instead of EFRT in patients with early stage HL [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-favorable-prognosis-early-stage-i-ii-classical-hodgkin-lymphoma/abstract/12,27\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,27</a>]. Most of these trials have been in patients with unfavorable prognosis early stage disease and are described separately. Initial studies also suggest that INRT decreases the radiation field without compromising disease control [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-favorable-prognosis-early-stage-i-ii-classical-hodgkin-lymphoma/abstract/22-25,28\" class=\"abstract_t\">22-25,28</a>]. However, INRT is technically challenging in that it requires pre-chemotherapy imaging studies obtained with the patient in the planned RT position and stored in a format that can be fused with post-chemotherapy imaging. ISRT uses a more conservative measure of disease by adjusting for uncertainties due to suboptimal imaging and other factors. Disease control following ISRT is expected to be at least as good as that obtained with INRT.

There were three relapses, two within the radiation field and one in a previously uninvolved region. There were eight deaths, none due to HL.

Short- and long-term toxicities increase as the dose of radiation increases. As such, attempts have been made to decrease the dose of RT administered to patients with early stage disease. While additional follow-up is necessary to investigate for long-term outcomes, lower RT doses appear to be associated with less short-term toxicity and similar efficacy.</p><p>This was best illustrated in the German Hodgkin Study Group (GHSG) HD10 Trial that randomly assigned 1370 patients with favorable prognosis early stage HL to receive one of the following four treatments [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-favorable-prognosis-early-stage-i-ii-classical-hodgkin-lymphoma/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Four cycles of ABVD followed by 30 Gy IFRT </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Four cycles of ABVD followed by 20 Gy IFRT </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Two cycles of ABVD followed by 30 Gy IFRT </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Two cycles of ABVD followed by 20 Gy IFRT </p><p/><p>Eligibility criteria for this trial included patients with no more than two sites of disease, no extranodal extension, no mediastinal mass greater than or equal to one-third the maximum thoracic diameter, and ESR less than 50 (less than 30 if B symptoms present). At median follow-up of 7.5 years, there was no significant difference between 30 and 20 Gy IFRT in five-year overall survival (OS, 97.7 versus 97.5 percent), freedom from treatment failure (FFTF, 93.4 versus 92.9 percent), and progression-free survival (PFS, 93.7 versus 93.2 percent). However, there were significant differences in major toxicity (WHO grade <span class=\"nowrap\">III/IV)</span> between 30 and 20 Gy IFRT (all events, 8.7 versus 2.9 percent), dysphagia (3 versus 2 percent), and mucositis (3.4 versus 0.7 percent).</p><p>The results of this trial suggest that two cycles of ABVD followed by 20 Gy involved-field (or perhaps involved-site) radiation therapy may be sufficient treatment for patients with favorable prognosis early stage HL, as defined by the GHSG. Three to four cycles of ABVD followed by 30 Gy involved-site radiation therapy can be used for patients with favorable risk early stage disease that would not fit the enrollment criteria for the GHSG study (eg, those with three sites of disease). Higher radiation doses and a minimum of four cycles of ABVD are used for patients with unfavorable risk early stage disease.

Unfortunately, many of these trials have utilized suboptimal chemotherapy or larger field, higher dose irradiation than is currently recommended [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-favorable-prognosis-early-stage-i-ii-classical-hodgkin-lymphoma/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. Nearly all of the trials evaluating chemotherapy with or without RT have been conducted in favorable prognosis patients. Although these trials have had a number of problems with design and patient accrual, as well as variations in the type of chemotherapy and field size of RT utilized, the overall survival of these approaches is comparable. Disease control with combined therapy is superior compared with chemotherapy alone, but this must be weighed against the risks of radiotherapy including cardiac disease and secondary malignancies, particularly in young women who are at high risk for the development of breast cancer after chest irradiation.</p><p>In the <span class=\"nowrap\">NCIC/ECOG</span> HD.6 randomized trial, 405 patients with previously untreated stage IA or IIA non-bulky HL were randomly assigned treatment with four to six cycles of ABVD alone, or to treatment that included 35 Gy RT [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-favorable-prognosis-early-stage-i-ii-classical-hodgkin-lymphoma/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. The RT arm consisted of sub-total nodal RT (treatment above and below the diaphragm, including the spleen) without chemotherapy for patients with a favorable prognosis (n = 123) and was two cycles of ABVD followed by sub-total nodal RT for patients with an unfavorable prognosis (n = 276). Patients in the chemotherapy only arm who achieved a complete remission on CT scan after two cycles received a total of four cycles and all others received six cycles. At a median follow-up of 11.3 years, chemotherapy alone was associated with a lower rate of freedom from disease progression (FFDP, 87 versus 92 percent) but a higher rate of overall survival (OS, 94 versus 87 percent) at 12 years in the entire population. This improvement in survival was attributed to an increased rate of non-relapse mortality among patients treated with sub-total nodal RT. However, this result is confounded by the fact that a number of the deaths in the radiation-containing arms were not treatment-related. On a subset analysis of patients with a favorable prognosis, there was no significant difference in FFDP (98 percent in both groups) or OS (89 versus 87 percent). The radiotherapy used in this study, sub-total nodal RT, is likely associated with higher rates of late toxicity compared with modern techniques using lower doses and smaller fields.</p><p>The following two randomized trials evaluated whether radiation therapy could be avoided in patients with non-bulky early stage HL and a negative mid-treatment PET scan: </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The EORTC H10 trial using PET to determine the need for radiation after chemotherapy demonstrated higher recurrence rates in patients who were PET negative after two cycles of ABVD and went on to receive another two cycles without radiation compared with the addition of RT [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-favorable-prognosis-early-stage-i-ii-classical-hodgkin-lymphoma/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. The trial closed the chemotherapy alone arm due to stopping rules.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In the UK RAPID trial, 420 patients with early stage non-bulky HL determined by pre-treatment CT scan who achieved a negative PET scan after three cycles of ABVD chemotherapy were randomly assigned to receive 30 Gy involved-field RT or no further therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-favorable-prognosis-early-stage-i-ii-classical-hodgkin-lymphoma/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]. Approximately 65 to 70 percent had favorable features by EORTC and GHSG criteria. After a median follow-up of 36 months, those assigned to RT had a lower rate of disease progression (3.8 versus 9.5 percent; three-year PFS 94.6 versus 90.8 percent) and a higher rate of death without disease progression (2.4 versus 0.9 percent). Further follow-up is needed to evaluate for long-term toxicities and for more mature survival data. &#160;</p><p/><p>For patients with favorable prognosis stage I to II HL, a choice between combined modality therapy and chemotherapy alone must take into account patient preferences and risk of complications. We suggest treatment with chemotherapy alone for young (age &lt;30) females with disease requiring irradiation that includes the breasts. This preference places a lower value on an increased risk of relapse and a higher value on the avoidance of radiation-associated complications. Modern RT with lower dose and smaller field size is likely associated with less long-term toxicity than higher dose larger field size treatment, without compromised efficacy, but this must be confirmed with longer follow-up of patients treated using these techniques.

A comprehensive geriatric assessment can assess comorbidity and functional status, thus permitting the formulation of an appropriate, individualized treatment plan. Special considerations for the use of chemotherapy in the elderly population are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=comprehensive-geriatric-assessment-for-patients-with-cancer\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Comprehensive geriatric assessment for patients with cancer&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=systemic-chemotherapy-for-cancer-in-elderly-persons\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Systemic chemotherapy for cancer in elderly persons&quot;</a>.)</p><p>We believe that older adults should be initially treated with the same dosing and schedule as younger adults with adjustments made to future cycles according to tolerance. This is principally because the amount of chemotherapy administered in the initial treatment of HL may affect overall survival. In a potentially curable disease such as HL, it is especially important to treat all patients aggressively, even older individuals.</p><p>There is increasing data that older patients are particularly vulnerable to the toxicity of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=bleomycin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">bleomycin</a>, which can be severe. Some have advocated omitting bleomycin in older patients to minimize pulmonary toxicity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-favorable-prognosis-early-stage-i-ii-classical-hodgkin-lymphoma/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>]; however, this might compromise cure rates without lessening toxicity. Studies in early stage disease have demonstrated slightly higher rates of treatment failure when bleomycin is omitted from ABVD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-favorable-prognosis-early-stage-i-ii-classical-hodgkin-lymphoma/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. Also, in a subset analysis of older adults in the randomized German Hodgkin Study Group (GHSG) HD10 and HD13 trials, two cycles of ABVD was no more toxic than two cycles AVD in this population [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-favorable-prognosis-early-stage-i-ii-classical-hodgkin-lymphoma/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>].

We occasionally omit bleomycin on an individual basis in the extreme elderly (ie, those greater than age 80 years), the very frail, those unlikely to be cured, and those with high-risk comorbidities (eg, underlying pulmonary disease, active smokers) in whom the risks and ability to tolerate even early detected bleomycin toxicity may outweigh the benefit.

(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=staging-and-prognosis-of-hodgkin-lymphoma\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Staging and prognosis of Hodgkin lymphoma&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In this discussion, early stage HL is defined as those patients with stage I or II disease (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F66651\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef66651 \">table 1</a>):</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Stage I &ndash; Involvement of a single lymph node region (I) or of a single extralymphatic organ or site (IE).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Stage II &ndash; Involvement of two or more lymph node regions on the same side of the diaphragm alone (II) or with involvement of limited, contiguous extralymphatic organ or tissue (IIE). </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Among patients with early disease, there is subsequent stratification into favorable and unfavorable prognosis disease based upon the presence or absence of certain clinical features, such as age, B symptoms, and large mediastinal adenopathy. Cooperative research groups have used varying definitions of favorable and unfavorable prognosis disease. In the United States, patients who have B symptoms, large mediastinal adenopathy, or more than three regions of involvement are considered unfavorable. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=staging-and-prognosis-of-hodgkin-lymphoma#H9398983\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Staging and prognosis of Hodgkin lymphoma&quot;, section on 'Favorable or unfavorable risk early stage disease'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients with early stage favorable prognosis HL, chemotherapy plus involved-site radiation therapy (ISRT) and chemotherapy alone are acceptable options. The choice between these must be individualized, weighing an improvement in disease-free survival with the inclusion of radiotherapy against potential late toxicities which are impacted by patient age, gender, and the location of the tumor. As examples (see <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Choice of therapy'</a> above):</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>For many patients with favorable prognosis stage I to II HL, combined modality therapy with abbreviated chemotherapy and low dose ISRT will be the treatment of choice. This preference places a higher value on the avoidance of disease recurrence (and possible need for autologous hematopoietic cell transplantation) than on the potential for long-term radiation-associated toxicities (including secondary malignancies). </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>In contrast, chemotherapy alone may be preferred for young (age &lt;30) females with disease requiring irradiation of the breast tissue. This preference places a lower value on an increased risk of relapse and a high value on the avoidance of radiation-associated complications. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients receiving combined modality treatment for early stage disease, we suggest the combination of ABVD (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=doxorubicin-conventional-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">doxorubicin</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=bleomycin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">bleomycin</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=vinblastine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">vinblastine</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dacarbazine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">dacarbazine</a>) chemotherapy in combination with ISRT rather than larger radiation fields (eg, involved-field) (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). With this technique, the radiation field is reduced in consideration of the node regression after chemotherapy to limit radiation to uninvolved normal organs. (See <a href=\"#H20474631\" class=\"local\">'Radiation field size'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Two cycles of ABVD followed by 20 Gy involved-field radiation therapy (or perhaps ISRT) may be sufficient treatment for a subgroup of patients with favorable presentations of stage I to II HL, as defined by the German Hodgkin Study Group (GHSG). Three to four cycles of ABVD followed by 30 Gy ISRT can be used for patients with favorable risk early stage disease that would not fit the enrollment criteria for the GHSG study (eg, those with three sites of disease or extranodal extension). (See <a href=\"#H5438104\" class=\"local\">'Number of cycles'</a> above and <a href=\"#H20474638\" class=\"local\">'Radiation dose'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients receiving chemotherapy without RT, we administer six cycles of ABVD. If a complete response is achieved on CT imaging after two cycles, a total of four cycles is sufficient. (See <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Chemotherapy alone'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The general treatment principles for favorable prognosis stage I-II HL apply to most disease presentations and patient populations. However, certain patient populations, such as pregnant women and older adults, require special consideration. (See <a href=\"#H20475773\" class=\"local\">'Pregnant women'</a> above and <a href=\"#H22722315\" class=\"local\">'Older adults'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>After completion of the initially planned treatment of HL, patients should be evaluated to determine the disease response to treatment and should be followed longitudinally for relapse or potential complications of therapy.
