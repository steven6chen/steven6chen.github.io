It must be differentiated from the more common complaints of frequency or nocturia, which are not associated with an increase in the total urine output.</p><p>The following is an overview of the diagnosis of polyuria and diabetes insipidus (DI).

This disorder is most often seen in middle-aged women and in patients with psychiatric illnesses, including those taking a phenothiazine, which can lead to the sensation of a dry mouth. Primary polydipsia can also be induced by hypothalamic lesions that directly affect the thirst center, as may occur with an infiltrative disease such as sarcoidosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-of-polyuria-and-diabetes-insipidus/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=causes-of-hyponatremia-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Causes of hyponatremia in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Central DI</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Central DI (also called neurohypophyseal or neurogenic DI) is associated with deficient secretion of antidiuretic hormone (ADH). This condition is most often idiopathic (possibly due to autoimmune injury to the ADH-producing cells) or can be induced by trauma, pituitary surgery, or hypoxic or ischemic encephalopathy. Rare familial cases have been described [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-of-polyuria-and-diabetes-insipidus/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-causes-of-central-diabetes-insipidus\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and causes of central diabetes insipidus&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Nephrogenic DI</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Nephrogenic DI is characterized by normal ADH secretion but varying degrees of renal resistance to its water-retaining effect. This problem, in its mild form, is relatively common since most patients who are older adults or who have underlying renal disease have a reduction in maximum concentrating ability. This defect, however, is not severe enough to produce a symptomatic increase in urine output.</p><p>Symptomatic polyuria due to ADH resistance is seen primarily in four settings, all of which are discussed in detail elsewhere (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-causes-of-nephrogenic-diabetes-insipidus\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and causes of nephrogenic diabetes insipidus&quot;</a>):</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Nephrogenic DI presenting in childhood is almost always due to inherited defects. The most common are X-linked hereditary nephrogenic DI due to mutations in the <em>AVPR2</em> gene encoding the ADH receptor V2 and autosomal recessive and dominant nephrogenic DI due to mutations in the aquaporin-2 (water channel) gene.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Nephrogenic DI presenting in adults is almost always acquired with chronic <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lithium-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">lithium</a> use and hypercalcemia being the most common causes of a defect severe enough to produce polyuria.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h1\">DIAGNOSIS AND DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In addition to nephrogenic and central DI, a variety of conditions may result in the complaint of polyuria, including psychogenic polydipsia, prostatic hypertrophy, or osmotic diuresis (including postobstructive diuresis). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-urinary-tract-obstruction-and-hydronephrosis#H1323380487\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of urinary tract obstruction and hydronephrosis&quot;, section on 'Prognosis and recovery of renal function'</a>.)</p><p>The cause of polyuria is often suggested from the history (eg, age of onset and eliciting the possible presence of the different causes of DI) and, rarely, by the plasma sodium concentration. Specific testing is then performed to establish the diagnosis.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Onset of polyuria</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The patient (or their parent) should be questioned about the rate of onset of the polyuria. In the majority of cases of hereditary nephrogenic DI, severe polyuria (with risk of dehydration and hypernatremia) manifests during the first week of life. In familial central DI (usually an autosomal dominant disease), polyuria may present after the first year of life, sometimes in young adulthood, due to preservation of function of the normal allele [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-of-polyuria-and-diabetes-insipidus/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-causes-of-nephrogenic-diabetes-insipidus\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and causes of nephrogenic diabetes insipidus&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-causes-of-central-diabetes-insipidus\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and causes of central diabetes insipidus&quot;</a>.)</p><p>In adults, the onset is usually abrupt in central DI (&quot;I suddenly began urinating too much a few days ago&quot;) and almost always gradual in acquired nephrogenic DI or primary polydipsia.</p><p>The new onset of nocturia in the absence of other causes of nocturia (eg, prostatic enlargement in men over 50 years of age or urinary tract infection in children) is often a first clue to DI. The urine is normally most concentrated in the morning due to lack of fluid ingestion overnight; as a result, the first manifestation of a loss of concentrating ability is often nocturia.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Family history</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There are familial forms of both central and nephrogenic DI. The defects in these disorders are due to mutations that impair antidiuretic hormone (ADH) synthesis or the renal response to ADH; the latter defect is most often due to mutations in the <em>AVPR2</em> gene encoding the V2 receptor but can also result from mutations in the aquaporin-2 (water channel) gene [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-of-polyuria-and-diabetes-insipidus/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. A family history of polyuria is helpful both for diagnosis and to identify asymptomatic members of affected families who harbor the suspect allele. Thus, all families with hereditary DI should have their molecular defect identified. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-causes-of-nephrogenic-diabetes-insipidus\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and causes of nephrogenic diabetes insipidus&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-causes-of-central-diabetes-insipidus\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and causes of central diabetes insipidus&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h2\">Plasma sodium and urine osmolality</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Each of the three causes of polyuria, primary polydipsia, central DI, and nephrogenic DI, is associated with an increase in water output and the excretion of a relatively dilute urine. With primary polydipsia, the polyuria is an appropriate response to enhanced water intake; by comparison, the water loss is inappropriate with either form of DI. Measurement of the plasma sodium concentration and the urine osmolality may be helpful in distinguishing between these disorders:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A low plasma sodium concentration (less than 137 <span class=\"nowrap\">mEq/L)</span> with a low urine osmolality (eg, less than one-half the plasma osmolality) is usually indicative of water overload due to primary polydipsia.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A high-normal plasma sodium concentration (greater than 142 <span class=\"nowrap\">mEq/L,</span> due to water loss) points toward DI, particularly if the urine osmolality is less than the plasma osmolality [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-of-polyuria-and-diabetes-insipidus/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A normal plasma sodium concentration is not helpful in diagnosis but, if associated with a urine osmolality more than 600 <span class=\"nowrap\">mosmol/kg,</span> excludes a diagnosis of DI.</p><p/><p>In adults with DI and no cognitive impairment, true hypernatremia (plasma sodium concentration greater than 150 <span class=\"nowrap\">mEq/L)</span> should not occur, because the initial loss of water stimulates thirst, resulting in an increase in intake to match the urinary losses (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEPH%2F65195\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef65195 \">figure 1</a>).</p><p>An exception to this general rule occurs in adipsic DI. Adipsic DI is usually due to a central lesion that also impairs thirst, thereby causing hypodipsia or adipsia; in this setting, the plasma sodium concentration can exceed 160 <span class=\"nowrap\">mEq/L</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-of-polyuria-and-diabetes-insipidus/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. Adipsic DI is associated with significant morbidity including obesity, sleep apnea, venous thrombosis during episodes of hypernatremia, thermoregulatory dysfunction, seizures, and significant mortality [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-of-polyuria-and-diabetes-insipidus/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].</p><p>Adipsic DI accompanied by autoantibodies to the subfornical organ was described in a small case series of young patients with hypernatremia, no thirst, and low vasopressin response to hypertonicity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-of-polyuria-and-diabetes-insipidus/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. In contrast to classical cases of adipsic DI, in which structural abnormalities of the hypothalamic area are easily seen with magnetic resonance imaging, no such lesions were identified in these cases. Sera from all four patients contained circulating antibodies that reacted to the subfornical organ in mice, and injection of immunoglobulin from one of the patients produced similar clinical abnormalities in mice.</p><p>Withholding water (eg, for diagnostic or surgical procedures) in adults with DI can result in severe dehydration. Thus, if oral intake has to be withheld, the patient should be hospitalized and hydrated intravenously and the plasma sodium concentration closely monitored while intake is restricted.</p><p>Hypernatremia during the first year of life is a common feature in children with hereditary nephrogenic DI. The intense and constant thirst of these young children is often not understood by adults, particularly if this is the first affected family member due to a de novo mutation or if an X-linked mutation has passed unrecognized through asymptomatic females [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-of-polyuria-and-diabetes-insipidus/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1100220\"><span class=\"h2\">Measurement of urine output</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The value of obtaining a timed urine collection to confirm the presence of polyuria is uncertain. Potential problems include an incomplete collection and the necessity for multiple containers if the patient has severe polyuria, which can be minimized by obtaining an 8-hour rather than a 24-hour collection. Measurement of urinary creatinine excretion can help determine if the collection is complete. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=assessment-of-kidney-function#H20663247\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Assessment of kidney function&quot;, section on 'Limitations of using creatinine clearance'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h2\">Water restriction test</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Even if the history <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> plasma sodium concentration and urine osmolality appear to be helpful, the diagnosis should be confirmed by raising the plasma osmolality either by water restriction or, less commonly in adults, by the administration of hypertonic saline (0.05 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/kg</span> per min for no more than two hours). The administration of hypertonic saline is typically reserved for use if the water restriction test is inconclusive or cannot be performed. A water restriction test to exclude primary polydipsia is not necessary if the plasma sodium concentration is greater than 145 <span class=\"nowrap\">mEq/L</span> and the urine osmolality is less than the plasma osmolality [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-of-polyuria-and-diabetes-insipidus/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].</p><p>Water restriction is important to differentiate central DI from primary polydipsia; simply giving exogenous ADH (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=desmopressin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">desmopressin</a> is generally preferred to aqueous vasopressin) without water restriction will not distinguish between these two conditions, since both have submaximal plasma ADH levels and both will respond to desmopressin therapy. However, a water restriction test may not be necessary prior to desmopressin administration.</p><p>Exceptions to this general rule are patients with a dilute urine (ie, urine osmolality well below that of the plasma) who are strongly suspected of having nephrogenic DI (eg, long-term <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lithium-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">lithium</a> use) and newborns and young infants who are thought to have hereditary nephrogenic DI. In these patients who are resistant to ADH, the response to <a href=\"topic.htm?path=desmopressin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">desmopressin</a> can be evaluated without prior water restriction. (See <a href=\"#H12\" class=\"local\">'Infants and children'</a> below.)</p><p>The diagnostic approach is also different in patients with DI and a defect in thirst who present with overt hypernatremia. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=etiology-and-evaluation-of-hypernatremia-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Etiology and evaluation of hypernatremia in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The normal physiologic response to the water restriction test (or the administration of hypertonic saline) is based upon the following observations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-of-polyuria-and-diabetes-insipidus/abstract/1,10,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,10,11</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Raising the plasma osmolality leads to a progressive elevation in ADH release and an increase in urine osmolality in normal individuals (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEPH%2F65195\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef65195 \">figure 1</a>).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Once the plasma osmolality reaches 295 to 300 <span class=\"nowrap\">mosmol/kg</span> (normal 275 to 290 <span class=\"nowrap\">mosmol/kg)</span> or the plasma sodium is 145 <span class=\"nowrap\">mEq/L</span> or higher, the effect of endogenous ADH on the kidney is maximal. At this point, administering <a href=\"topic.htm?path=desmopressin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">desmopressin</a> will not further elevate the urine osmolality unless endogenous ADH release is impaired (ie, unless the patient has central DI).</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h3\">Adults</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The water restriction test for the evaluation of polyuria involves measurement of the urine volume and osmolality every hour and the plasma sodium concentration and osmolality every two hours. We generally recommend that the patient stop drinking two to three hours before coming to the office or clinic; overnight fluid restriction should be <strong>avoided</strong> since potentially severe volume depletion and hypernatremia can be induced in patients with marked polyuria. As an example, we saw a patient with undiagnosed DI who was scheduled for surgery in the morning and was told to stop drinking and eating after going to sleep the night before. Surgery was cancelled when routine preoperative laboratory testing revealed a plasma sodium of 162 <span class=\"nowrap\">mEq/L</span>.</p><p>The water restriction test in adults is continued until one of the following end points is reached:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The urine osmolality reaches a clearly normal value (above 600 <span class=\"nowrap\">mosmol/kg),</span> indicating that both ADH release and effect are intact.

The urine osmolality and volume should be measured every 30 minutes over the next two hours. The two-hour monitoring period is particularly important if there is dilatation of the urinary bladder by previous high urine volumes. In this setting, any concentrated new urine might be diluted with post-micturitional residual urine (which could be as much as 200 to 400 mL).</p><p>Plasma and urine ADH levels should be measured if the response to the water restriction test is equivocal. (See <a href=\"#H15\" class=\"local\">'Plasma and urine ADH measurement'</a> below.)</p><p>Copeptin, the C-terminal glycoprotein moiety of pro-arginine vasopressin (AVP), is a stable surrogate marker of vasopressin secretion.

This acquired defect appears to be due to two effects of chronic polydipsia and polyuria: partial wash out the medullary interstitial gradient and downregulation of ADH release [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-of-polyuria-and-diabetes-insipidus/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>].</p><p/><p>A properly performed test in which ADH is not given until the plasma osmolality exceeds 295 <span class=\"nowrap\">mosmol/kg</span> will usually establish the correct diagnosis.

The polyuria and polydipsia will rapidly reverse with central DI.

First, patients with partial central DI may be hyperresponsive to the submaximal rise in ADH induced by water restriction, perhaps due to receptor upregulation. As a result, they may be polyuric at the normal plasma osmolality of 285 to 290 <span class=\"nowrap\">mosmol/kg</span> when ADH levels are very low but have a maximally concentrated urine at a plasma osmolality above 295 <span class=\"nowrap\">mosmol/kg</span> when ADH levels are somewhat higher.

As noted above, the history may provide important clues in this setting, with abrupt onset favoring central DI and gradual onset, particularly with a history of psychiatric illness, favoring primary polydipsia.</p><p>Second, polyuria developing during pregnancy may result from the release of vasopressinases from the placenta (a disorder that has been called gestational DI).
