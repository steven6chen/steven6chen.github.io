(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=palliative-care-end-stage-renal-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Palliative care: End-stage renal disease&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=withdrawal-from-and-withholding-of-dialysis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Withdrawal from and withholding of dialysis&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H188893581\"><span class=\"h1\">DEFINITION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Conservative ESRD care is the care of patients with ESRD without renal replacement therapy such as dialysis or transplantation. Active supportive care, maximal conservative management, and nondialytic management are also terms commonly used to describe such treatment. Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) defines comprehensive conservative care as planned, holistic, patient-centered care for patients with stage 5 chronic kidney disease (CKD; ie, estimated glomerular filtration rate [eGFR] &lt;15 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/min/1</span>.73 m<sup>2</sup>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/conservative-care-of-end-stage-renal-disease/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=definition-and-staging-of-chronic-kidney-disease-in-adults#H27258970\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Definition and staging of chronic kidney disease in adults&quot;, section on 'Staging of CKD'</a>.)</p><p>Conservative ESRD care is appropriate for patients who choose not to initiate dialysis or undergo kidney transplantation. Such patients generally include those with coexisting, advanced comorbidities who may not gain meaningful benefit from renal replacement therapy or whose care preferences are to avoid intensive medical therapies and receive care that focuses on quality of life. The goals of conservative care are to optimize quality of life, treat the symptoms of ESRD without dialysis or transplant, and, when appropriate, preserve residual renal function.</p><p>Conservative care is best delivered through a collaborative, interdisciplinary team consisting of a nephrologist, primary care clinician, nurse, dietician, social worker, and, when appropriate, palliative care team.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H21563214\"><span class=\"h1\">WHO SHOULD BE OFFERED CONSERVATIVE CARE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Conservative care should be offered to all patients who may not meaningfully benefit from dialysis or whose goals focus on quality over quantity of life. Conservative care is a reasonable treatment option alongside renal replacement options for those who are less likely to benefit from dialysis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/conservative-care-of-end-stage-renal-disease/abstract/2,3\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,3</a>]. In particular, older patients are candidates for conservative care since they tend to incur more of the burdens of dialysis rather than intended benefits [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/conservative-care-of-end-stage-renal-disease/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Older patients, especially those with underlying comorbidities, are at risk for loss of independence, diminished quality of life, and poor health in general. Dialysis may not improve and may even worsen these problems.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Symptoms of uremia (which are common indications for dialysis initiation) often overlap with common geriatric syndromes; if due to geriatric syndromes, these symptoms are not improved by dialysis. Not only will dialysis not improve the underlying condition, but it may lead to increased hospitalizations and functional debility [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/conservative-care-of-end-stage-renal-disease/abstract/5,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,6</a>].</p><p/><p>Conservative care without dialysis can both avoid the potential setbacks accompanying dialysis and provide meaningful quality of life for older patients with advanced comorbidities. Older patients who choose conservative care are more likely to spend their remaining survival outside of the hospital, with greater opportunity for symptom management and end-of-life care with palliative care and hospice services [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/conservative-care-of-end-stage-renal-disease/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].</p><p>In addition, older patients can survive a significant amount of time without dialysis if there is a slow rate of renal disease progression and glomerular filtration rate (GFR) loss [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/conservative-care-of-end-stage-renal-disease/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. Hemodialysis may hasten the loss of residual renal function. The ability to maintain even small amounts of residual renal function has been shown to be associated with improved survival and quality of life [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/conservative-care-of-end-stage-renal-disease/abstract/9,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,10</a>].</p><p>The Renal Physician Association guideline for shared decision making recommends that conservative care be offered to patients with advanced chronic kidney disease (CKD) over 75 years of age who have two of the following poor prognostic factors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/conservative-care-of-end-stage-renal-disease/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Impaired functional status</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Severe malnutrition (serum albumin &lt;2 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/dL)</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Multiple comorbidities</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Positive response to the surprise question: &quot;No, I would not be surprised if this patient died within the next year&quot;</p><p/><p>The discussion regarding conservative care should occur at the time of dialysis options education. For most patients, this is when the estimated GFR (eGFR) is &lt;30 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/min/1</span>.73 m<sup>2</sup>.

Patients experiencing a decline in clinical health or rapid renal function loss may benefit from earlier discussions.</p><p>The conversation should involve the patient, caregiver, and essential members of the renal team, including nephrologist, nurse, and, when appropriate, social worker and palliative care expert. The decision to elect conservative care should incorporate the patient's values and priorities as well as clinical prognosis. Patient decision aids (PDAs) are tools to facilitate decision making and have been developed to address conservative care decisions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/conservative-care-of-end-stage-renal-disease/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. Once conservative care is elected, this treatment plan should be reassessed regularly, with increased frequency for patients experiencing clinical or functional setbacks.</p><p>It is helpful for patients who are deciding between dialysis versus conservative care for the clinician to describe survival and quality-of-life studies.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Survival -</strong> Survival of patients treated conservatively is variable, depending on comorbidities. In a systematic review of 13 studies, patients who chose conservative care experienced a median survival of six months, with a range of 6.3 to 23.4 months, with survival typically measured once the eGFR decreases below 15 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/min/m<sup>2</sup></span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/conservative-care-of-end-stage-renal-disease/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. Factors associated with longer survival include female gender [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/conservative-care-of-end-stage-renal-disease/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>], lower comorbidity score [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/conservative-care-of-end-stage-renal-disease/abstract/15,16\" class=\"abstract_t\">15,16</a>], albumin over 3.5 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL,</span> and referral to a nephrologist before reaching CKD stage 5 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/conservative-care-of-end-stage-renal-disease/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Survival in general is longer for patients who undergo renal replacement therapy compared with conservative care. However, in some studies, subgroup analyses of patients with advanced comorbidities showed no statistical difference in survival for patients who elect dialysis compared with conservative care [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/conservative-care-of-end-stage-renal-disease/abstract/7,18\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,18</a>]. The following studies have examined this issue:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>In a prospective cohort study of medically complex patients recommended for conservative care, survival among those patients who chose conservative care was not statistically different compared with those who chose dialysis (median of 6.3 versus 8.3 months, respectively) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/conservative-care-of-end-stage-renal-disease/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. In a retrospective study from the United Kingdom, the presence of ischemic heart disease alone reduced survival by half in older patients who elected dialysis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/conservative-care-of-end-stage-renal-disease/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. These outcomes suggest that dialysis may not add meaningful survival in older patients with advanced comorbidities.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>A meta-analysis that included 89 studies and 294,921 older ESRD patients (mean age 76.5 years) demonstrated roughly similar one-year survival between patients treated with dialysis (73 percent) versus conservative care (70.6 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/conservative-care-of-end-stage-renal-disease/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. However, there was marked heterogeneity between studies that could not be explained by study design, size, the definition of older adult, or the cohort era. In addition, survival data for patients undergoing conservative care were only available for 724 individuals, or 0.2 percent of the total cohort, and there were very few studies with head-to-head comparisons of dialysis versus conservative care. As a result, confidence in results is limited.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Perhaps the best data are from a subsequent, carefully performed, retrospective study of a single-center cohort from the Netherlands that compared survival outcomes among patients &gt;70 years who opted for conservative care (n = 107) versus dialysis (n = 204) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/conservative-care-of-end-stage-renal-disease/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. Among all patients, in-depth discussions regarding renal replacement therapies (including dialysis and transplantation) and conservative care were initiated when the eGFR fell to &lt;20 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/min/1</span>.73 m<sup>2</sup>. Patients who opted for conservative care continued to receive full medical treatment and multidisciplinary care, including specialist nurses, dieticians, and social workers.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\">Survival was calculated from different starting points including the time at which the treatment decision was first made and from times at which the eGFR was first &lt;20, &lt;15, and &lt;10 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/min/1</span>.73 m<sup>2</sup>.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\">The overall median survival was higher for those patients who opted for dialysis when measured from all times points. For dialysis versus conservative care, the median survival from the time of modality choice was 3.1 versus 1.5 years. Similarly, from the time of the first eGFR &lt;20, &lt;15, and &lt;10 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/min/1</span>.73 m<sup>2</sup>, the median survival was 4.5 versus 2.4 years, 3.1 versus 1.5 years, and 2.8 versus 0.5 years, respectively. The survival advantage conferred by dialysis was substantially reduced, though still statistically significant, among patients &gt;70 years who had cardiovascular or other severe comorbidity.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\">However, among patients older than 80 years, there was no difference between groups in survival measured from any starting point (2.1 versus 1.4 years overall).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Prognostic models have been developed to identify which patients may not do well after dialysis initiation and hence would benefit from the conservative care option [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/conservative-care-of-end-stage-renal-disease/abstract/22-24\" class=\"abstract_t\">22-24</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>French Registry data were used to develop and prospectively validate a method of estimating six-month survival in patients 75 years or older [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/conservative-care-of-end-stage-renal-disease/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. Patients in the lowest-risk group (0 points) had a mortality of 8 percent compared with 70 percent in the highest-risk group (&ge;9 points). Factors independently predictive of mortality at six months included low body mass index, diabetes, congestive heart failure, peripheral vascular disease, dysrhythmia, active malignancy, severe behavioral disorders, impaired mobility, and unplanned dialysis. Age, however, was not independently associated with early mortality [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/conservative-care-of-end-stage-renal-disease/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>United States Renal Data System (USRDS) data and Medicare claims were used to develop and validate mortality risk score [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/conservative-care-of-end-stage-renal-disease/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. A score derived from advanced age, low albumin, requirement for assistance with daily living, nursing home residence, cancer, and heart failure was able to estimate three- and six-month mortality risk with area under the receiver operating characteristics curve of 0.69.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Geriatric syndromes such as frailty and cognitive decline are also common in older patients and are associated with poor outcomes with dialysis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/conservative-care-of-end-stage-renal-disease/abstract/25-27\" class=\"abstract_t\">25-27</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Quality of life -</strong> Older patients with advanced or multiple comorbidities who are initiated on dialysis require more medical interventions (including dialysis) and are more commonly hospitalized compared with those treated conservatively. In a cohort of older patients, those who elected dialysis spent approximately half of their days survived (173 <span class=\"nowrap\">days/patient/year)</span> either receiving dialysis or in the hospital compared with less than 5 percent in those conservatively managed (16 <span class=\"nowrap\">days/patient/year)</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/conservative-care-of-end-stage-renal-disease/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Patients on dialysis experience symptom burdens similar to those with cancer; such symptoms are often under-recognized and undertreated [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/conservative-care-of-end-stage-renal-disease/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. Poorly treated symptoms can negatively impact patient experience and quality of life. In one prospective study of dialysis and conservatively managed patients, quality-of-life scores were similar between the two groups; however, patients who elected dialysis scored lower on measures of satisfaction with life. Almost half of these patients experienced a reduction in satisfaction with life scores after dialysis initiation, with scores remaining stable without improvement over time [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/conservative-care-of-end-stage-renal-disease/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H450487717\"><span class=\"h1\">COMPONENTS OF CONSERVATIVE CARE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The treatment plan is individualized for each patient. Specific interventions are chosen based on the overall prognosis and impact that the intervention will have on quality of life. A conceptual model that has been adapted for chronic kidney disease (CKD) patients describes how the predictability of a patient's prognosis and the assessment of the potential for an acceptable quality of life determines what kinds of treatments to offer (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEPH%2F102377\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef102377 \">figure 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/conservative-care-of-end-stage-renal-disease/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]. Determination of the prognosis and expected quality of life of a given patient guides which components of conservative care to focus on.</p><p>The components of conservative care include the following:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Medical management of kidney disease</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Symptom management including quality end-of-life care</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Advance care planning (ACP)</p><p/><p>Patients with predictable prognosis and acceptable quality of life are the most likely to benefit from both medical management focused on preservation of residual renal function (see <a href=\"#H442573925\" class=\"local\">'Medical management'</a> below) and symptom management (see <a href=\"#H442574209\" class=\"local\">'Symptom management focused on optimizing quality of life'</a> below). This treatment plan may also be reasonable for those patients whose goals are to live as long as possible with the hope of achieving acceptable quality of life. By contrast, patients with predictably poor prognosis <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> poor quality of life generally do not benefit from treatments to prolong longevity, and care should focus mainly on symptom management. For patients with a less predictable prognosis, the treatment plan may include aspects of both medical management of kidney disease and symptom management (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEPH%2F102377\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef102377 \">figure 1</a>).</p><p>A patient's prognosis and quality of life may change over time, warranting modifications to the treatment plan.</p><p>For ESRD patients, ACP begins with an informed decision whether or not to initiate dialysis.

Hence, medical management in this scenario is often the same as that of CKD patients who are awaiting the initiation of renal replacement therapies (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-the-management-of-chronic-kidney-disease-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of the management of chronic kidney disease in adults&quot;</a>).

We do not advocate restricting protein, given potentially adverse effect on quality of life and dubious short-term benefit.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Renin-angiotensin system inhibitors -</strong> The benefit of starting or continuing RAS inhibitors in patients who elect conservative care is unclear and depends on the patient's prognosis, degree of proteinuria, and renal function. The renoprotective benefits of RAS inhibitors have been demonstrated in numerous studies. However, the application of these studies to older patients and those with limited life expectancy is less clear. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=antihypertensive-therapy-and-progression-of-nondiabetic-chronic-kidney-disease-in-adults#H18\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Antihypertensive therapy and progression of nondiabetic chronic kidney disease in adults&quot;, section on 'Use in elderly patients'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">The patients who are most likely to benefit from these agents are those with milder disease and significant proteinuria (&gt;500 to 1000 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day)</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/conservative-care-of-end-stage-renal-disease/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>]. Older patients are less likely to have significant proteinuria, which may limit the antiproteinuric effects of RAS inhibitors.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">For most patients undergoing conservative care who have very advanced renal disease (ie, estimated glomerular filtration rate [eGFR] &lt;20 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/min/m<sup>2</sup>)</span> or are experiencing an accelerated rate of loss, we suggest not using RAS inhibitors to preserve renal function, even in the setting of significant proteinuria. Such patients are less likely to live long enough to experience the protective benefits and are more likely to experience worsening kidney function and hyperkalemia.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Limitation of dietary protein intake</strong> &ndash; For most CKD patients undergoing conservative care, we suggest daily protein intake of approximately 0.8 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/kg,</span> which is the same as for adults without kidney disease. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dietary-recommendations-for-patients-with-nondialysis-chronic-kidney-disease#H1193190287\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Dietary recommendations for patients with nondialysis chronic kidney disease&quot;, section on 'Non-nephrotic patients'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">We recommend not using very low protein diets (ie, 0.3 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/kg</span> of body weight), particularly among older patients, especially those with comorbidities. Although such diets may provide some benefits, the beneficial effects of are tempered by their potential negative impact on patient quality of life.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Potential benefits of very low protein diets were demonstrated in the Diet or Dialysis in the Elderly study, in which 112 patients over 70 years of age with an eGFR of 5 to 7 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/min/1</span>.73 m<sup>2</sup> were randomly assigned to either supplemented very low protein diet (sVLPD) or dialysis and followed for a median of 26.5 months [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/conservative-care-of-end-stage-renal-disease/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>]. Patients assigned to diet were given a vegan diet with a calorie intake of 35 <span class=\"nowrap\">kcal/kg</span> of body weight per day and a protein intake of 0.3 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/kg</span> of body weight, supplemented with amino acids and multivitamins. The one-year survival rates were similar between the two groups. Patients assigned to sVLPD postponed dialysis by a median of 10.7 months (range, 1 to 58 months). Patients in the diet group experienced significantly less time hospitalized compared with the dialysis group.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">However, this study excluded patients with life-limiting diseases, such as diabetes, and acute life-threatening diseases. Most patients who choose conservative care have goals focused on quality of life and often have additional life-limiting disease.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H442574097\"><span class=\"h3\">Blood pressure management</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The goal of management is to avoid the deleterious effects of excessively high blood pressures, including stroke and cardiovascular outcomes, and progression of renal disease. Blood pressure goals are the same for CKD patients who are awaiting dialysis.

These patients often have cognitive decline and longstanding vascular disease and are vulnerable to the unwanted side effects of low blood pressure, including falls, light headedness, and fatigue. For patients who are undergoing conservative care, blood pressure management should include close attention to the patient's comorbidities and cognition when considering initiating or titration of blood pressure medications. Blood pressure targets should be individualized for a given patient, taking into account fall risk, symptoms of lightheadedness and fatigue, and cognitive impairment.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H442574142\"><span class=\"h3\">Anemia and iron deficiency</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>For most conservatively managed patients, we administer erythropoiesis-stimulating agents (ESAs) and iron administration to treat anemia. ESAs and iron can improve symptoms of fatigue and weakness. The dose and frequency of these agents should reflect the hoped-for goals of the treatment and may not strictly adhere to standard guidelines. As an example, the Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) guidelines suggest that ESAs should generally not be used to maintain hemoglobin (Hb) concentrations &gt;11.5 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/dL</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/conservative-care-of-end-stage-renal-disease/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>]. However, for selected patients, we target higher levels if such doses are associated with clinically significant improvements in symptoms. For patients who are receiving conservative care, we do <strong>not</strong> target Hb levels &gt;13 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/dL</span>. Hb targets &gt;13 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/dL</span> are associated with adverse outcomes.

The KDIGO guidelines recommend that ESAs be used with great caution, if at all, in CKD patients with active malignancy, especially if cure is anticipated, or with a history of stroke or a history of malignancy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/conservative-care-of-end-stage-renal-disease/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>]. However, these guidelines do not address patients with limited life expectancy whose goals are focused on improving quality of life rather than longevity. An informed discussion of potential risks and benefits associated with ESAs should take place with patients and families of patients who have active malignancy.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H442574163\"><span class=\"h3\">Mineral and bone disease</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Phosphorous-binding agents and the use of vitamin D analogs can assist management of symptoms of pruritus (see <a href=\"#H188897765\" class=\"local\">'Pruritus'</a> below) and renal-related bone disease.</p><p>Hypovitaminosis D and secondary hyperparathyroidism have been associated with fracture risk in older patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/conservative-care-of-end-stage-renal-disease/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>]. For patients with a favorable prognosis and acceptable quality of life, our initial approach to the treatment of hyperphosphatemia and hyperparathyroidism is similar to that for CKD patients who are awaiting renal replacement therapy (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-hyperphosphatemia-in-chronic-kidney-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of hyperphosphatemia in chronic kidney disease&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-secondary-hyperparathyroidism-in-adult-nondialysis-patients-with-chronic-kidney-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of secondary hyperparathyroidism in adult nondialysis patients with chronic kidney disease&quot;</a>).

For such patients who have difficulty achieving PTH or phosphorus goals or whose goals are to avoid added pills, we suggest allowing higher PTH and phosphorus concentrations.</p><p>In patients with relatively limited prognosis, we suggest not treating hyperphosphatemia, unless very severe, or hyperparathyroidism.

The first step to management involves review of medications that increase potassium through inhibition of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system. These medications should be discontinued or decreased as the risk of hyperkalemia outweighs potential benefit of renal protection. If hyperkalemia persists despite discontinuing the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor or angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB), we treat with cation exchange resins such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sodium-polystyrene-sulfonate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">sodium polystyrene sulfonate</a> (Kayexalate) or initiation of diuretics, both which may lower serum potassium levels.

Examples include but are not limited to multivitamins, statins, and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aspirin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">aspirin</a>. This medication reconciliation allows opportunities to initiate medications that treat symptoms (see <a href=\"#H188897516\" class=\"local\">'Management of symptoms'</a> below).

Patients who elect conservative care experience a similar number and severity of symptoms as those on dialysis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/conservative-care-of-end-stage-renal-disease/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>]. These symptoms may result from complications of advanced kidney disease as well as coexisting conditions such as diabetes, heart failure, and cancer. How symptoms are evaluated depends on the resources and staffing of a given renal team. Surveys completed by the patient and, in some cases, with the help of a caregiver or support staff, may be used to assess symptoms. Ideally, symptoms are evaluated at each clinic visit and reviewed by the provider. For patients whose care is managed at home, surveys can be mailed and either returned by mail or reviewed over the phone.</p><p>Patient-completed symptom assessment tools have been validated in conservatively managed CKD patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/conservative-care-of-end-stage-renal-disease/abstract/40,41\" class=\"abstract_t\">40,41</a>]. We use a modification of the Patient Outcome Scale &ndash; Symptoms Renal (POS-S Renal) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/conservative-care-of-end-stage-renal-disease/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>].

These include the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) and the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI). We use the PHQ-9 since it is shorter and does not require adjustment for somatic symptoms. The PHQ9 is a nine-item screening tool to assess the presence of depressive thoughts or feelings over the past two weeks. A score of 10 or higher indicates a depressive disorder [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/conservative-care-of-end-stage-renal-disease/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>]. The PHQ-2 is a two-question tool comprised of the first two questions from the PHQ-9 that has demonstrated validity in CKD patients as a screening tool for depression [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/conservative-care-of-end-stage-renal-disease/abstract/43\" class=\"abstract_t\">43</a>]. The PHQ-2 is intended to be an initial screen, with those who screen positive undergoing confirmatory screening with PHQ-9.</p><p>The BDI may also be used to screen patients. The BDI is a 21-item screening tool that has also been validated in CKD and ESRD patients. The cut-off score (&ge;10) for a depressive disorder is higher in CKD (&ge;11) and ESRD (&ge;14 to 16) patients to account for a greater somatic symptom burden in these patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/conservative-care-of-end-stage-renal-disease/abstract/44\" class=\"abstract_t\">44</a>].</p><p>Patients who screen positive for depressive symptoms require a comprehensive assessment to determine whether these symptoms stem from depression itself or <span class=\"nowrap\">spiritual/existential</span> concerns that may accompany those living with advanced illness.

Pain may be due to progression of kidney disease, concurrent comorbidities (diabetic neuropathy, peripheral vascular disease), or a secondary complication of kidney disease (calciphylaxis, bone pain from renal osteodystrophy).

Conservatively managed patients face limited survival and are at risk for existential and spiritual concerns that accompany end of life.</p><p>Evidence is lacking for pharmacologic management of depression in patients with kidney disease. Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, however, have a better safety profile for patients with cardiovascular disease and may be a safe choice in kidney disease patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/conservative-care-of-end-stage-renal-disease/abstract/47\" class=\"abstract_t\">47</a>]. We use <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sertraline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">sertraline</a> as a first-line agent as it does not require dose adjustment in renal disease and assists with anxiety symptoms. Side effects with sertraline include hyponatremia, bleeding, and gastrointestinal symptoms. Treatment caveats include consideration of the pharmacokinetics and dose adjustments for renal dysfunction.</p><p>Patients may also benefit from nonpharmacologic treatments such as exercise, support groups, and therapy. Cognitive behavioral therapy, a structured form of psychotherapy that supports logical thinking and reorganizes negative thoughts and behaviors, has been effective in reducing depressive symptoms in dialysis patients; however, less is known in ESRD patients undergoing conservative care [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/conservative-care-of-end-stage-renal-disease/abstract/48\" class=\"abstract_t\">48</a>]. How treatment is delivered depends on the comfort of the provider and available resources. Referral to psychiatry for assistance with diagnosis and management is reasonable.

Bereaved families who have been part of ACP experience better adjustment, with fewer psychological symptoms.</p><p>The ACP conversation begins with the decision to elect conservative care. Providers must prepare patients for future setbacks and define how best to care for them as end of life nears. Many patients may be asymptomatic at the time conservative care is elected. When symptoms do arise, patients may respond with fear and reconsider dialysis as a &quot;fix.&quot; These sentiments were described in a qualitative study of older patients who had elected conservative care. A subset of these patients described dialysis as something they would reconsider if they &quot;had to have it&quot; or &quot;got really ill&quot; [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/conservative-care-of-end-stage-renal-disease/abstract/51\" class=\"abstract_t\">51</a>]. Without adequate preparation, patients may view conservative care as a temporary plan that may change over time, depending on their current health state and life circumstances.</p><p>Therefore, the discussion to elect conservative care is incomplete without a meaningful discussion addressing the end-of-life trajectory with conservative care and outlining the patient's care preferences.</p><p>Even with the uncertainty of knowing how long or how well a patient might live with conservative care, providers can provide necessary information about the expected course and help patients outline care preferences at different health states (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ethical-issues-in-the-care-of-the-patient-with-end-stage-renal-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Ethical issues in the care of the patient with end-stage renal disease&quot;</a>). More than one conversation is often necessary to define and modify a given treatment plan and also address discrepancies in understanding and expectations. We suggest letting the patient's experience guide the timing of future follow-up conversations. This can involve periodic check-in conversations using open-ended questions such as &quot;What thoughts do you have about your kidney management?&quot; This question allows the patient to express potential concerns, satisfaction, or questions about the current treatment plan. Patients may also initiate follow-up conversations as well. These conversations are particularly helpful in the setting of a clinical change, hospitalization, or worsening lab indices.</p><p>Patients may also change their mind and request dialysis. This is not unexpected, as patient preferences are shaped by their experience, values, and uncertainty of the future. Some of these requests may reflect emotion such as worries and fears of end of life. We recommend exploring these patients' concerns and readdressing goals of care. For seriously ill patients who are near the end of life, this approach may also require skills to manage conflict and consideration of palliative care consultation.

Within the United States, the Hospice Medicare Benefit includes interdisciplinary services to ensure that the patient's needs are met, caregivers are supported, and care occurs in the <span class=\"nowrap\">patient's/caregiver's</span> desired location. Patients who elect hospice would rather focus on their comfort and typically do not elect to return to the hospital for acute illnesses or setbacks. Patients who undergo hospice care are more likely to experience less symptom burden at end of life and receive care consistent with their care preferences. Location of death is more likely not to be in the hospital as well [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/conservative-care-of-end-stage-renal-disease/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>].</p><p>Some patients, especially those with predictable and favorable prognosis, may elect conservative care yet still desire acute hospitalization for acute illnesses.

Conservative care is appropriate for patients with coexisting, advanced comorbidities who may not gain meaningful benefit from renal replacement therapy or whose care preferences are to avoid intensive medical therapies and receive care that focuses on quality of life. (See <a href=\"#H188893581\" class=\"local\">'Definition'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We discuss the option for conservative care with all patients who may not meaningfully benefit from dialysis or whose goals focus on quality over quantity of life. Conservative care is a reasonable treatment option alongside renal replacement options for those who are less likely to benefit from dialysis. In particular, older patients are candidates for conservative care since they tend to incur more of the burdens of dialysis rather than intended benefits. Conservative care is offered when all options for renal replacement are discussed. Included in the discussion are the patient, caregiver, and essential members of the renal team, including nephrologist, nurse, and, when appropriate, social worker and palliative care expertise. Discussions of the treatment plan should be reassessed regularly. (See <a href=\"#H21563214\" class=\"local\">'Who should be offered conservative care'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The components of conservative care include medical management of kidney disease, symptom management, and advance care planning (ACP), including quality end-of-life care. All patients should have treatments designed to manage symptoms. The degree to which treatments to delay progression of kidney disease or prolong life are used is individualized for each patient and depends upon prognosis, quality of life, and patient desire to prolong life. (See <a href=\"#H450487717\" class=\"local\">'Components of conservative care'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The medical management is often the same as that of chronic kidney disease (CKD) patients who are awaiting the initiation of renal replacement therapies.

Dose may exceed standard guidelines to achieve improvement in symptoms, but we do not target hemoglobin (Hb) levels &gt;13 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/dL</span>.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>We use phosphorous-binding agents and vitamin D analogs to treat hyperphosphatemia and hyperparathyroidism in order to avoid accompanying symptoms such as pruritus and renal-related bone disease but often allow higher parathyroid hormone (PTH) and phosphorus concentrations than commonly recommended given the difficulty of achieving standard target PTH and phosphorus goals in advanced kidney disease in the absence of dialysis.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>We treat hyperkalemia that persists in the absence of RAS inhibitors with cation exchange resins such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sodium-polystyrene-sulfonate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">sodium polystyrene sulfonate</a> (Kayexalate) or diuretics.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Attention to symptoms is a critical component of conservative care. Symptoms should be evaluated at each clinic visit and reviewed by the provider. Symptom assessment tools or surveys may be used. Symptoms are often effectively managed by the nephrology team in conjunction with a palliative care team. (See <a href=\"#H188897516\" class=\"local\">'Management of symptoms'</a> above and <a href=\"#H450487765\" class=\"local\">'Palliative care expertise'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>ACP is the process by which patients, family members, and providers reflect upon the patient's goals and values to help inform current and future medical care plans and begins with the initial conversation of whether to elect conservative care. There should also be a meaningful discussion addressing the end-of-life trajectory with conservative care and outlining the patient's care preferences. (See <a href=\"#H21482865\" class=\"local\">'Advance care planning'</a> above.)</p><p/></div><div id=\"topicAgreement\">Use of UpToDate is subject to the <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/legal/license\" class=\"licenseLink\" id=\"sla_in_page\">Subscription and License Agreement</a>.</div><div id=\"references\" class=\"headingAnchor\"><h1>REFERENCES</h1><ol id=\"reference\"><li><a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/conservative-care-of-end-stage-renal-disease/abstract/1\" class=\"nounderline abstract_t\">Murtagh FE, Burns A, Moranne O, et al.
