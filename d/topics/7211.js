As such, these are often combined together and define epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC) in clinical trials and clinical practice. This topic will consider all histologies under the heading EOC. EOC is the most common cause of death among women with gynecologic malignancies and the fifth leading cause of cancer death in women in the United States. Approximately 75 percent of women have stage III (disease that has spread throughout the peritoneal cavity or that involves lymph nodes) or stage IV (disease spread to more distant sites) disease at diagnosis. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epithelial-carcinoma-of-the-ovary-fallopian-tube-and-peritoneum-clinical-features-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Epithelial carcinoma of the ovary, fallopian tube, and peritoneum: Clinical features and diagnosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Historically, the Gynecologic Oncology Group (GOG) has performed separate clinical trials for women with early (stages I and II disease) versus advanced (stages III and IV) disease. However, this separation of patient populations has not been consistent. Studies done in Canada, Europe, and elsewhere have defined patients with stage II disease or any patients requiring systemic therapy (regardless of stage) as having advanced EOC. More GOG trials included women with stage II disease as having advanced EOC. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-epithelial-carcinoma-of-the-ovary-fallopian-tube-and-peritoneum#H6099435\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of epithelial carcinoma of the ovary, fallopian tube, and peritoneum&quot;, section on 'Prognosis'</a>.)</p><p>Primary surgical cytoreduction followed by systemic chemotherapy is the preferred initial management for women with stage III or IV EOC. Patients who are not good candidates for surgery due to the location and volume of disease involvement or medical comorbidities at the time of diagnosis may be considered for neoadjuvant chemotherapy. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cancer-of-the-ovary-fallopian-tube-and-peritoneum-staging-and-initial-surgical-management\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Cancer of the ovary, fallopian tube, and peritoneum: Staging and initial surgical management&quot;</a> and <a href=\"#H250841373\" class=\"local\">'Neoadjuvant chemotherapy'</a> below.)</p><p>First-line systemic chemotherapy for women with advanced EOC involving the abdomen (stage III) or extra-abdominal sites (eg, parenchymal liver or lung, stage IV) and post-treatment surveillance of EOC will be reviewed here.

While there are no high-quality data to inform the optimal timing for the initiation of first-line chemotherapy, limited data suggest that a delay of greater than approximately one month in instituting chemotherapy may be associated with a poorer outcome [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/first-line-chemotherapy-for-advanced-stage-iii-or-iv-epithelial-ovarian-fallopian-tubal-and-peritoneal-cancer/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>]. However, it is not clear whether it is the delay itself, or the clinical factors that are frequently associated with delay (such as medical comorbidities, surgical complications, delayed healing, malnourishment) that are responsible for the worse outcome.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H88116954\"><span class=\"h1\">TREATMENT SELECTION AND METHOD OF ADMINISTRATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The standard approach to treatment for women requiring first-line chemotherapy for epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC) is to use a platinum agent with a taxane. For women with optimally reduced disease (&lt;1 cm of residual disease), there are two options: intravenous (IV) chemotherapy alone or a combination of IV and intraperitoneal (IP) chemotherapy <span class=\"nowrap\">(IV/IP</span> therapy). Women with suboptimally reduced disease (&ge;1 centimeter of residual disease) are not candidates for IP therapy due to limited penetration into larger tumors. These women should therefore receive IV treatment. Further details regarding the modalities of treatment and specific regimens are found in the relevant sections below. (See <a href=\"#H3454263675\" class=\"local\">'Women with suboptimally cytoreduced disease'</a> below and <a href=\"#H3010628095\" class=\"local\">'Choice of agents'</a> below.)</p><p>The importance of platinum salts and taxanes was highlighted in a 2006 multiple-treatment meta-analysis that included 60 trials in women (n = 15,609) with EOC, which showed that a platinum-taxane combination improved survival when compared with [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/first-line-chemotherapy-for-advanced-stage-iii-or-iv-epithelial-ovarian-fallopian-tubal-and-peritoneal-cancer/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Platinum monotherapy (hazard ratio [HR] for mortality 1.16 favoring the combination, 95% CI 0.86-1.58)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A platinum plus non-taxane combination (HR for mortality 1.28 favoring platinum plus taxane, 95% CI 1.07-1.53)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3454263675\"><span class=\"h2\">Women with suboptimally cytoreduced disease</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Women with suboptimally cytoreduced EOC are not appropriate candidates for IP treatment because IP administration of chemotherapy results in limited penetration into larger tumors and reduced effectiveness of treatment.

However, a consideration between these two taxanes can be individualized based on their differing toxicities [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/first-line-chemotherapy-for-advanced-stage-iii-or-iv-epithelial-ovarian-fallopian-tubal-and-peritoneal-cancer/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. For paclitaxel, these include a higher risk of neuropathy, myalgias, and weakness compared with docetaxel; for docetaxel, these include a higher risk of neutropenia, hypersensitivity reactions, and nausea and vomiting.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We prefer to treat for a maximum of six cycles rather than more because there are no data that treatment beyond six cycles improves outcomes, although further treatment increases the risk of treatment-related toxicities [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/first-line-chemotherapy-for-advanced-stage-iii-or-iv-epithelial-ovarian-fallopian-tubal-and-peritoneal-cancer/abstract/12-14\" class=\"abstract_t\">12-14</a>]. The administration of further treatment for patients who respond (or do not progress) after six cycles of first-line therapy (ie, maintenance therapy) is covered below. (See <a href=\"#H1171802\" class=\"local\">'Maintenance therapy'</a> below.)</p><p/><p>A 2013 meta-analysis suggested that <a href=\"topic.htm?path=carboplatin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">carboplatin</a> plus <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pegylated-liposomal-doxorubicin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">pegylated liposomal doxorubicin</a> (PLD) would be a reasonable alternative to carboplatin plus <a href=\"topic.htm?path=paclitaxel-conventional-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">paclitaxel</a> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/first-line-chemotherapy-for-advanced-stage-iii-or-iv-epithelial-ovarian-fallopian-tubal-and-peritoneal-cancer/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. However, the data consisted of two trials and only 820 women. Given the limited data available in this meta-analysis compared with the 2006 meta-analysis above, we advocate continued use of carboplatin plus paclitaxel in this setting unless paclitaxel is contraindicated. (See <a href=\"#H88116954\" class=\"local\">'Treatment selection and method of administration'</a> above.)</p><p>In addition, attempts to incorporate additional agents into first-line treatment of EOC have not been successful. Multiple phase III trials have not shown a survival benefit with the addition of a third agent (including <a href=\"topic.htm?path=doxorubicin-conventional-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">doxorubicin</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epirubicin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">epirubicin</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=topotecan-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">topotecan</a>, interferon gamma) to the <a href=\"topic.htm?path=carboplatin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">carboplatin</a> plus <a href=\"topic.htm?path=paclitaxel-conventional-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">paclitaxel</a> backbone [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/first-line-chemotherapy-for-advanced-stage-iii-or-iv-epithelial-ovarian-fallopian-tubal-and-peritoneal-cancer/abstract/16-22\" class=\"abstract_t\">16-22</a>]. Trials evaluating more intensive regimens, including high-dose chemotherapy and hematopoietic cell transplantation, have not shown a survival advantage in clinical trials. As an example, a phase III trial of 149 patients with untreated EOC randomly assigned treatment following surgery to standard combination therapy or high-dose treatment with two cycles of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cyclophosphamide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cyclophosphamide</a> and paclitaxel followed by three cycles of high-dose carboplatin and paclitaxel with autologous hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/first-line-chemotherapy-for-advanced-stage-iii-or-iv-epithelial-ovarian-fallopian-tubal-and-peritoneal-cancer/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. For example, although median progression-free survival (PFS) was prolonged with high-dose chemotherapy in one trial compared with standard therapy (30 versus 21 months, respectively), this did not translate into an improvement in overall survival (OS, median 54 versus 63 months).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3048008259\"><span class=\"h3\">Dose-dense IV therapy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>For women with suboptimally cytoreduced disease, we offer a dose-dense IV treatment schedule using <a href=\"topic.htm?path=carboplatin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">carboplatin</a> every three weeks with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=paclitaxel-conventional-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">paclitaxel</a> administered every week for a total of 15 weeks of treatment, particularly if the histologic subtype is not clear cell or mucinous. Data suggest that dose-dense administration of chemotherapy is associated with equivalent or improved outcomes relative to conventionally dosed regimens. However, for patients who refuse weekly treatment for whatever reason and those with a clear-cell or mucinous carcinoma, we administer conventional therapy every three weeks.

EOC is the most common cause of death among women with gynecologic malignancies and the fifth leading cause of cancer death in women in the United States. Approximately 75 percent of cases are stage III (spread throughout the peritoneal cavity or involving lymph nodes) or stage IV (spread to more distant sites). (See <a href=\"#H1\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Advanced-stage EOC is initially treated with surgical cytoreduction followed by first-line therapy. A choice among first-line treatments is made based upon the amount of disease remaining after surgery. Patients with &lt;1 cm of disease in any one location are considered to have optimally cytoreduced EOC. All other patients have suboptimally cytoreduced disease. (See <a href=\"#H1\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For all patients with advanced EOC, we recommend a platinum-plus-taxane combination rather than alternative regimens in the first-line setting (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=2\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1B</a>).

Although there are preliminary data suggesting similar outcomes between dose-dense IV treatment and <span class=\"nowrap\">IV/IP</span> therapy, <span class=\"nowrap\">IV/IP</span> therapy remains our preferred approach given data from multiple earlier trials suggesting superiority over IV treatment. However, a reasonable alternative is dose-dense IV therapy (ie, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=carboplatin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">carboplatin</a> every three weeks with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=paclitaxel-conventional-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">paclitaxel</a> administered weekly).
