You can get this infection if you are bitten by a tiny insect called a tick. When a certain type of tick bites you, it can transmit the germ that causes Rocky Mountain spotted fever from its body to yours.</p><p>The ticks that can carry the germ that causes Rocky Mountain spotted fever are called the American dog tick, the Rocky Mountain wood tick, and the common brown dog tick (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F87133\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef87133 \">picture 1</a>). These ticks normally feed on animals, including dogs.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H179306412\"><span class=\"h1\">What are the symptoms of Rocky Mountain spotted fever?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The symptoms can include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Fever (in almost all cases)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Headache (can be severe)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Flu-like illness </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Muscle and joint pain</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Nausea, with or without vomiting</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Belly pain (especially in children)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A skin rash (described in more detail below)</p><p/><p>The rash caused by Rocky Mountain spotted fever causes red blotches that turn white if you press on them (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F87132\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef87132 \">picture 2</a>). The rash usually starts on the ankles and wrists and spreads to the body. It takes a few days to show up, so it's not always obvious right away that Rocky Mountain spotted fever is to blame for the other symptoms. Over time, the red blotches form tiny bruises.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H179306444\"><span class=\"h1\">Should I see a doctor or nurse?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>See your doctor or nurse right away if you were bitten by a tick and develop a fever and any of the other symptoms above. Even if you were not bitten by a tick, see your doctor or nurse if you have a fever and a rash.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H179306459\"><span class=\"h1\">Is there a test for Rocky Mountain spotted fever?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Yes, there is a blood test that can show whether you have Rocky Mountain spotted fever. But the results of the test take a long time. Doctors usually must diagnose the infection based on symptoms and begin treatment as soon as possible. Doctors can also look for the germ that causes Rocky Mountain spotted fever in a sample of skin. But that test can only be done after the rash shows up.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H179306474\"><span class=\"h1\">How is Rocky Mountain spotted fever treated?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>It is treated with antibiotics to fight the infection. If there is a chance you have Rocky Mountain spotted fever, it is important to start these antibiotics as soon as possible. The infection can be deadly if it is not treated in time.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H179306489\"><span class=\"h1\">What can I do to try to avoid getting bitten by a tick?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>You can:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Wear shoes, long-sleeved shirts, and long pants when you go outside. Keep ticks away from your skin by tucking your pants into your socks.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Wear light colors so you can spot any ticks that get on your clothes.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Use bug spray to keep ticks away. On your skin, use bug sprays that have a chemical called &quot;DEET.&quot; On your clothes and gear, use bug repellants that have a chemical called &quot;<a href=\"topic.htm?path=permethrin-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">permethrin</a>.&quot;</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Check your body for ticks after being outdoors or with dogs. Be sure to check your scalp, waist, armpits, groin, and backs of your knees. Check your children, too.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>If you live in a place that has deer or mice nearby, take steps to keep those animals away. Deer and mice carry ticks.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H179306504\"><span class=\"h1\">What if I am pregnant?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>If you are pregnant, be sure to tell your doctor. Some of the antibiotics to treat Rocky Mountain spotted fever are safe to take if you are pregnant, but others are not.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H179306519\"><span class=\"h1\">More on this topic</span></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=insect-bites-and-stings-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Insect bites and stings (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=lyme-disease-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Lyme disease (The Basics)</a></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=what-to-do-after-a-tick-bite-to-prevent-lyme-disease-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: What to do after a tick bite to prevent Lyme disease (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=lyme-disease-prevention-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Lyme disease prevention (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=lyme-disease-symptoms-and-diagnosis-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Lyme disease symptoms and diagnosis (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=lyme-disease-treatment-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Lyme disease treatment (Beyond the Basics)</a></p></div><div id=\"reviewProcess\"><span>All topics are updated as new evidence becomes available and our <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/home/editorial-policy\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"policy policy_editorialpolicy\">peer review process</a> is complete.</span></div><div id=\"topicRetrievedDate\"><span class=\"emphasis\">This topic retrieved from UpToDate on: </span>Apr 03, 2018.</div><div id=\"disclaimer\">The content on the UpToDate website is not intended nor recommended as a substitute for medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.
