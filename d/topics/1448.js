Asthma symptoms can be mild or severe. And they can come and go. Sometimes asthma symptoms start all of a sudden. Asthma attacks happen when the airways in the lungs become narrow and inflamed (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F65956\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef65956 \">figure 1</a>). Asthma can run in families.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H44585046\"><span class=\"h1\">What are the symptoms of asthma?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Asthma symptoms can include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Wheezing or noisy breathing</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Coughing</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A tight feeling in the chest</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Shortness of breath</p><p/><p>Symptoms can happen each day, each week, or less often. Symptoms can range from mild to severe. Although it is rare, an episode of asthma can sometimes even lead to death.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H44585053\"><span class=\"h1\">Is there a test for asthma?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Yes. Your doctor will ask you about your symptoms and have you do a breathing test to see how your lungs are working.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H44585060\"><span class=\"h1\">How is asthma treated?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Asthma is treated with different types of medicines. The medicines can be inhalers, liquids, or pills. Your doctor will prescribe medicine based on how often you have symptoms and how serious your symptoms are. Asthma medicines work in 1 of 2 ways:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Quick-relief medicines</strong> stop symptoms quickly &ndash; in 5 to 15 minutes. Almost everyone with asthma has a quick-relief inhaler that they carry with them. People use these medicines whenever they have asthma symptoms. Most people need these medicines 1 or 2 times a week &ndash; or less often. But when asthma symptoms get worse, more doses might be needed. Some people can feel shaky after taking these medicines. A few people also need a machine called a &quot;nebulizer&quot; to breathe in their medicine.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Long-term controller medicines</strong> control asthma and prevent future symptoms. People who get asthma symptoms more than 2 times a week need to use a controller medicine 1 or 2 times each day.</p><p/><p>It is very important that you take all the medicines the doctor prescribes, exactly how you are supposed to take them. You might have to take medicines a few times a day. You might not feel a medicine working, but that does not mean it is not helping you.</p><p>Not taking your medicines correctly can cause symptoms to get worse. If your symptoms get much worse all of a sudden, you might even need to go to the hospital for treatment.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H44585067\"><span class=\"h1\">What is an asthma action plan?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>An asthma action plan is a list of instructions that tell you:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Which medicines to use each day at home</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Which medicines to take if your symptoms get worse</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>When to get help or <strong>call for an ambulance (in the US and Canada, dial 9-1-1)</strong></p><p/><p>If you have frequent or severe asthma symptoms, your doctor might suggest that you have an asthma action plan. If so, you and your doctor will work together to make one. As part of your action plan, you might need to use something called a &quot;peak flow meter.&quot; Breathing into this device will show how your lungs are working. Your doctor will show you the right way to use your inhaler and peak flow meter.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H44585074\"><span class=\"h1\">Should I see a doctor or nurse?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Yes. See your doctor or nurse if you have an asthma attack and the symptoms do not improve or get worse after using a quick-relief medicine. If the symptoms are severe, <strong>call for an ambulance (in the US and Canada, dial 9-1-1)</strong>.</p><p>If you need asthma medicine every day, you should see your doctor or nurse every 6 months or more often.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H44585081\"><span class=\"h1\">Can asthma symptoms be prevented?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Yes. You can help prevent your asthma symptoms. You can stay away from things that cause your symptoms or make them worse. Doctors call these &quot;triggers.&quot; If you know what your triggers are, avoid them as much as possible. Some common triggers include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Dust</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Mold</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Animals, such as dogs and cats</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pollen and plants</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Cigarette smoke</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Getting sick with a cold or flu (that's why it's important to get a flu shot)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Stress</p><p/><p>If you can't avoid certain triggers, talk with your doctor about what you can do. For example, exercise can be good for people with asthma even if it is an asthma trigger. But you might need to take an extra dose of your quick-relief inhaler medicine before you exercise.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H44585088\"><span class=\"h1\">What if I want to get pregnant?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>If you want to get pregnant, talk to your doctor about how to control your asthma. Keeping your asthma well-controlled is important for the health of your baby. Most asthma medicines are safe to take if you are pregnant.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H44585095\"><span class=\"h1\">More on this topic</span></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=asthma-in-children-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Asthma in children (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=cough-in-adults-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Cough in adults (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=breathing-tests-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Breathing tests (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=medicines-for-asthma-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Medicines for asthma (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=exercise-induced-asthma-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Exercise-induced asthma (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=inhaled-corticosteroid-medicines-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Inhaled corticosteroid medicines (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=how-to-use-your-soft-mist-inhaler-adults-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: How to use your soft mist inhaler (adults) (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=how-to-use-your-metered-dose-inhaler-adults-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: How to use your metered dose inhaler (adults) (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=how-to-use-your-dry-powder-inhaler-adults-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: How to use your dry powder inhaler (adults) (The Basics)</a></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=asthma-and-pregnancy-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Asthma and pregnancy (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=exercise-induced-asthma-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Exercise-induced asthma (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=trigger-avoidance-in-asthma-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Trigger avoidance in asthma (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=asthma-inhaler-techniques-in-adults-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Asthma inhaler techniques in adults (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=how-to-use-a-peak-flow-meter-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: How to use a peak flow meter (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=asthma-treatment-in-adolescents-and-adults-beyond-the-basics#H10\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Asthma treatment in adolescents and adults (Beyond the Basics), section on 'Asthma reliever medications'</a></p></div><div id=\"reviewProcess\"><span>All topics are updated as new evidence becomes available and our <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/home/editorial-policy\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"policy policy_editorialpolicy\">peer review process</a> is complete.</span></div><div id=\"topicRetrievedDate\"><span class=\"emphasis\">This topic retrieved from UpToDate on: </span>Apr 02, 2018.</div><div id=\"disclaimer\">The content on the UpToDate website is not intended nor recommended as a substitute for medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.
