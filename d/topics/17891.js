It can be associated with giant cell (temporal) arteritis (GCA); the two disorders may represent different manifestations of a shared disease process. Some patients have manifestations of both disorders occurring at different times. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-polymyalgia-rheumatica\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of polymyalgia rheumatica&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The treatment of PMR will be reviewed here. Additional issues pertaining to PMR, as well as the clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and treatment of GCA, are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-polymyalgia-rheumatica\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of polymyalgia rheumatica&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-of-giant-cell-temporal-arteritis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations of giant cell (temporal) arteritis&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diagnosis-of-giant-cell-arteritis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Diagnosis of giant cell arteritis&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-giant-cell-arteritis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of giant cell arteritis&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">OVERALL APPROACH</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Polymyalgia rheumatica (PMR) is characterized by a prompt response to glucocorticoids in low to moderate doses. The initial dose of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prednisone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">prednisone</a> needed to alleviate musculoskeletal symptoms in PMR is lower than that required to control the vascular inflammation associated with giant cell (temporal) arteritis (GCA). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-giant-cell-arteritis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of giant cell arteritis&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">General guidelines</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>We recommend treatment with glucocorticoids as initial therapy in patients diagnosed with PMR. The primary goal of therapy is the relief of symptoms. Therapy has not been shown to clearly improve prognosis or prevent progression to GCA.</p><p>The value of glucocorticoids in the treatment of PMR has been established by decades of clinical experience and observational studies. Though we are not aware of any controlled trials comparing <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prednisone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">prednisone</a> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prednisolone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">prednisolone</a> with placebo or other single agents, the brisk and dramatic therapeutic response to low-dose glucocorticoids remains a widely appreciated feature of PMR. Some patients with PMR may experience symptomatic improvement after only one or two doses of glucocorticoids, and the vast majority of such patients experience a marked improvement in symptoms within days of starting treatment, despite experiencing longstanding symptoms. Medications other than glucocorticoids, such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methotrexate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">methotrexate</a> (MTX) or tumor necrosis factor (TNF) inhibitors, have not conclusively been proven effective in PMR. Nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) have no role in the primary management of PMR.</p><p>Despite a general consensus around the approach to therapy, there is no universally accepted approach to initial glucocorticoid dosing, maintenance therapy, or dose reduction. Our approach to initial and maintenance therapy is generally consistent with published guidelines, such as those of the European League Against <span class=\"nowrap\">Rheumatism/American</span> College of Rheumatology [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-polymyalgia-rheumatica/abstract/1-4\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-4</a>].</p><p>The initial goal of therapy is to achieve rapid symptomatic control with the use of glucocorticoids in low doses. After a period of quiescence, the glucocorticoid dose is slowly tapered. The duration of treatment varies. Many patients can be tapered off glucocorticoids in one to two years, though the need for longer courses of treatment is not uncommon.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Baseline laboratory testing</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Baseline laboratory testing done at the time of diagnosis should include a complete blood count (CBC), erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), C-reactive protein (CRP), and other tests as warranted by the differential diagnosis. A blood glucose, urinalysis, blood urea nitrogen, creatinine, aminotransferases, alkaline phosphatase, and calcium should be obtained before initiating therapy. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-polymyalgia-rheumatica#H14\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of polymyalgia rheumatica&quot;, section on 'Differential diagnosis'</a>.)</p><p>Appropriate measures should be taken to prevent glucocorticoid-induced osteoporosis, which may include a baseline bone density measurement. Treatment should not be delayed while obtaining this study. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prevention-and-treatment-of-glucocorticoid-induced-osteoporosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Prevention and treatment of glucocorticoid-induced osteoporosis&quot;</a> and <a href=\"#H14\" class=\"local\">'Side effects of glucocorticoids'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h1\">INITIAL GLUCOCORTICOID THERAPY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The optimal glucocorticoid dosing regimen is not well-defined.</p><p>In most patients, we suggest a starting <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prednisone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">prednisone</a> dose of 15 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day</span> (or equivalent) given orally as a single daily dose. This starting dose may be modified depending upon the patient's weight, the severity of symptoms, and comorbidities such as diabetes mellitus, severe hypertension, or heart failure. This is generally consistent with the guidelines published by a collaboration of the American College of Rheumatology (ACR) and the European League Against Rheumatism (EULAR) which suggest use of the minimum effective dose with in a range of 12.5 to 25 mg of prednisone equivalent daily [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-polymyalgia-rheumatica/abstract/2,3\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,3</a>]. Lower doses of 7.5 to 10 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day</span> may suffice in smaller patients with mild symptoms <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> brittle diabetes. By comparison, an initial dose of 25 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day</span> may be appropriate in an otherwise healthy patient with severe manifestations of polymyalgia rheumatica (PMR) including constitutional symptoms.</p><p>Patients usually respond quickly and may note improvement after a single dose. Symptoms are generally substantially better (50 to 70 percent reduction in pain and stiffness) within three days in patients with PMR started on <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prednisone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">prednisone</a>.</p><p>If symptoms are not well-controlled within one week of initiating therapy, the <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prednisone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">prednisone</a> dose should be increased by 5 mg, to a dose of 20 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day</span>. Some patients find that a single daily dose of prednisone does not provide relief from evening or nighttime pain and morning stiffness, in which case use of a divided (twice daily) dose can be effective.</p><p>Practically all patients with PMR alone will respond to 12.5 to 25 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day</span> of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prednisone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">prednisone</a>. Persistent aching and stiffness despite the administration of prednisone at these doses mandate pursuit of an alternative diagnosis. If musculoskeletal symptoms are ameliorated, but fevers and other constitutional symptoms continue, underlying giant cell (temporal) arteritis (GCA) or another illness must be considered.</p><p>This approach is generally consistent with some of the conclusions drawn from systematic reviews [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-polymyalgia-rheumatica/abstract/5,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,6</a>]. A 2009 systematic review analyzed outcomes in association with varying initial <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prednisone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">prednisone</a> dose and found a high level of heterogeneity in diagnostic criteria, treatment protocols, and outcome measures among the 30 reports meeting inclusion criteria for the review (13 randomized trials and 17 observational studies) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-polymyalgia-rheumatica/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. Initial prednisone doses greater than 10 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day</span> were associated with fewer relapses and shorter duration of therapy than lower doses. Starting doses of 15 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day</span> or less were associated with lower cumulative doses of prednisone than higher starting doses, and starting doses greater than 15 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day</span> were associated with more glucocorticoid-related adverse effects (see <a href=\"#H14\" class=\"local\">'Side effects of glucocorticoids'</a> below) One study has suggested that the optimal initial dose may depend on body weight [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-polymyalgia-rheumatica/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Alternative initial therapies</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>No medication has been proven equivalent to glucocorticoids in the initial management of PMR or GCA, although several have been studied as glucocorticoid-sparing agents. We do not use these medications as substitutes for initial glucocorticoid therapy in patients with PMR. (See <a href=\"#H15\" class=\"local\">'Glucocorticoid-sparing therapies'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h1\">MAINTENANCE PHASE AND DOSE REDUCTION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>As is the case with the starting dose of glucocorticoids, there is no consensus concerning the optimal tapering regimen. &#160; </p><p>We suggest that the glucocorticoid dose that suppresses symptoms be maintained for two to four weeks after the aching and stiffness have resolved. We generally aim to reduce the dose in small decrements every two to four weeks thereafter as tolerated to the minimum amount needed to maintain suppression of symptoms. &#160; For example, in patients receiving over 10 mg of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prednisone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">prednisone</a><span class=\"nowrap\">/day,</span> we suggest lowering the dose by 2.5 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day</span> decrements every two to four weeks. Below 10 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day,</span> the use of 1 mg decrements is advised, because of the typical sensitivity of the symptoms of PMR to even minor changes in the glucocorticoid dose. We recommend dose reductions by 1 mg per month, provided there are no flares [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-polymyalgia-rheumatica/abstract/1,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,8</a>]. With this regimen, patients without a relapse in symptoms will have been treated for approximately one year. (See <a href=\"#H3182943\" class=\"local\">'Duration of treatment'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h1\">MONITORING RESPONSE TO THERAPY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>We closely monitor the clinical response to glucocorticoid therapy, which principally involves screening for the presence <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> recurrence of symptoms of polymyalgia rheumatica (PMR) or giant cell (temporal) arteritis (GCA). Patients should be encouraged to promptly contact their clinician if such symptoms occur.</p><p>Elevations in erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) and serum C-reactive protein (CRP) generally revert to normal with low doses of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prednisone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">prednisone</a> in association with symptomatic improvement. Continued <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> recurrent high levels in the asymptomatic patient may suggest alternative or additional diagnoses, such as GCA or malignancy. However, typical PMR characterized by prominent early morning stiffness is not per se a paraneoplastic disease. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-polymyalgia-rheumatica#H14\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of polymyalgia rheumatica&quot;, section on 'Differential diagnosis'</a>.)</p><p>Initial measurement of the ESR and CRP should be performed in all patients. Subsequently, we generally obtain a complete blood count (CBC), ESR, and CRP after two months of treatment. We then continue to measure the CBC, ESR, and CRP approximately every three to six months during glucocorticoid therapy. Once the patient has completed therapy with glucocorticoids and is asymptomatic, we generally do not continue checking acute phase reactants (ESR and CRP).</p><p>Results of ESR and CRP testing should be interpreted in the context of the patient's typical values prior to the onset of illness, when available, and the patient's age. Normal values for the ESR increase with age, and values for the CRP vary from laboratory to laboratory. Additionally, factors other than inflammation may result in (usually modest) increases above normal in both the ESR and, to a lesser degree, the CRP. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acute-phase-reactants\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Acute phase reactants&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Interleukin (IL)-6 has also been shown to correlate well with disease activity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-polymyalgia-rheumatica/abstract/9,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,10</a>]. However, as assays are not available in most laboratories, a role for IL-6 measurement in routine clinical care has not been established. Fibrinogen levels are also reported to be elevated in patients with PMR [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-polymyalgia-rheumatica/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h1\">RELAPSE</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h2\">Symptomatic patients</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Relapse can be viewed as an increase in aching and morning stiffness due to the disease, and may occur in over 50 percent of patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-polymyalgia-rheumatica/abstract/12,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,13</a>]. Symptoms can recrudesce during the maintenance phase or during dose reduction. Relapse has been associated with larger initial doses of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prednisone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">prednisone</a> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-polymyalgia-rheumatica/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>] and with faster rate of tapering in some studies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-polymyalgia-rheumatica/abstract/12,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,14</a>]. Other predictors of a relapsing course have included persistent elevations of C-reactive protein (CRP), interleukin (IL)-6 levels, and baseline soluble IL-6 receptor levels [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-polymyalgia-rheumatica/abstract/13,15,16\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,15,16</a>].</p><p>Our approach to the treatment of patients with relapsing or recurrent symptoms is as follows:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>If recurrent symptoms develop following discontinuation of glucocorticoids and are accompanied by an elevation in the erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> CRP, we suggest resumption of glucocorticoids at the original dose at which control was achieved. However, a lower dose of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prednisone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">prednisone</a> (eg, 7.5 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day)</span> may be tried in patients in whom the recurrent symptoms are not as severe as at the initial presentation.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In patients who relapse while on glucocorticoids (independent of laboratory values), we suggest an increase in glucocorticoids to the lowest dose that keeps symptoms in remission. An increase to the dose immediately prior to the dose from which the patient had been most recently tapered is often effective. In some patients an increase of but 1 or 2 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day</span> may be adequate. Once control of symptoms is regained, the recommendations regarding maintenance and dose reduction above should be followed, with a goal of eventually discontinuing glucocorticoid therapy.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In patients who relapse several times, the interval between dose reductions should be increased to every two or three months.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3182931\"><span class=\"h2\">The problematic glucocorticoid taper</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Difficulties with tapering glucocorticoids in a patient with polymyalgia rheumatica (PMR) may arise from a variety of causes.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>One cause of such difficulty has simply to do with the clinical course of PMR, which, as described above, is prone to relapse and recurrence.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A common cause of recurring achiness during the taper of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prednisone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">prednisone</a> is the symptomatic worsening of common noninflammatory musculoskeletal problems, eg, rotator cuff tendonitis or osteoarthritis. It is important to distinguish recrudescent symptoms due to these local conditions from a bona fide relapse of PMR.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Relapsing symptoms, especially if accompanied by distal synovitis, should direct attention to the possibility of a different diagnosis, ie, seronegative rheumatoid arthritis or &ldquo;late onset rheumatoid arthritis.&rdquo; However, peripheral arthritis (usually mild and responsive to glucocorticoids) also occurs in approximately 25 percent of patients with PMR [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-polymyalgia-rheumatica/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-polymyalgia-rheumatica\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of polymyalgia rheumatica&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Rarely, diffuse pain can ensue from a rapid taper of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prednisone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">prednisone</a> in a patient who has been on long-term glucocorticoid therapy. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=glucocorticoid-withdrawal#H16\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Glucocorticoid withdrawal&quot;, section on 'Recommended tapering regimen'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h2\">Abnormal testing without symptoms</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Elevations in the ESR <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> CRP may occur in the completely asymptomatic patient. Our approach to the management of such patients is as follows:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Slight increases in the ESR <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> CRP above the normal range may occur entirely due to imprecision in measurement.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients with a more significant elevation in ESR <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> CRP but no increase in symptoms should be evaluated for other possible causes of such laboratory changes, such as giant cell (temporal) arteritis (GCA). We generally do not obtain a temporal artery biopsy or increase the <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prednisone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">prednisone</a> dose in patients with evidence of PMR alone in the absence of recurrent symptoms, but do question and examine such patients carefully for any signs or symptoms of GCA. In the absence of any symptoms, elevated acute phase reactants by themselves do not warrant an increased glucocorticoid dose.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3182943\"><span class=\"h1\">DURATION OF TREATMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In most patients, polymyalgia rheumatica (PMR) runs a self-limited course, and glucocorticoid therapy can eventually be discontinued. Often, treatment can be discontinued after one to two years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-polymyalgia-rheumatica/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. Other patients require continuation of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prednisone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">prednisone</a> for longer periods of time, often at stable doses of 5 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day</span> or less. At one center, the median duration of some glucocorticoid therapy was 37 months [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-polymyalgia-rheumatica/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. Another study found that one-third of patients required management with glucocorticoids for more than six years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-polymyalgia-rheumatica/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. As would be expected, a relapsing course is associated with a longer duration of glucocorticoid treatment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-polymyalgia-rheumatica/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. Recurrences can also occur months or, in some cases, years after glucocorticoids have been discontinued [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-polymyalgia-rheumatica/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>].</p><p>Broadly speaking, there appear to be two subgroups of PMR. In one, glucocorticoids can be rather uneventfully tapered off over a year or two, while in another, a relapsing course requires several years of treatment. The reason that PMR is monophasic in some patients and polyphasic in others is unclear.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14\"><span class=\"h1\">SIDE EFFECTS OF GLUCOCORTICOIDS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Prevention of and monitoring for side effects, including osteoporosis, glucose intolerance, and hypertension, is an essential component of a comprehensive management program for polymyalgia rheumatica (PMR) (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=major-side-effects-of-systemic-glucocorticoids\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Major side effects of systemic glucocorticoids&quot;</a>) In one study, 65 percent of patients with PMR managed with glucocorticoids incurred at least one adverse event attributable to treatment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-polymyalgia-rheumatica/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>].</p><p>Because most patients with PMR require glucocorticoid treatment for more than several months, we recommend that standard guidelines for prevention of glucocorticoid-induced osteoporosis be followed, including an assessment of bone mineral density at or near the time <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prednisone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">prednisone</a> is begun, treatment with calcium and vitamin D supplementation, and, when indicated by treatment guidelines, prophylactic use of bisphosphonates. These issues are discussed in detail elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prevention-and-treatment-of-glucocorticoid-induced-osteoporosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Prevention and treatment of glucocorticoid-induced osteoporosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p>In addition to the complete blood count (CBC) and acute phase reactants used for monitoring of disease activity, blood glucose, and, when indicated, hemoglobin A1c levels should be obtained to monitor for the development of diabetes mellitus. Patients on glucocorticoids should also have their blood pressure monitored regularly, especially early in therapy when doses are higher and in patients with known hypertension. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=screening-for-type-2-diabetes-mellitus\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Screening for type 2 diabetes mellitus&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Even at low doses, other side effects from glucocorticoids may be particularly troubling for some patients, such as facial hirsutism, Cushingoid facies, weight gain, and capillary fragility. The latter can result in widespread ecchymoses and slowly healing lacerations, especially in patients on concurrent treatment with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aspirin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">aspirin</a> and anticoagulants.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15\"><span class=\"h1\">GLUCOCORTICOID-SPARING THERAPIES</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H128242181\"><span class=\"h2\">Overview</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The routine use of adjunctive therapy is not recommended because definitive symptomatic control of polymyalgia rheumatica (PMR) can usually be achieved with low doses of glucocorticoids and because adverse effects from treatment are often mild. No medication has been consistently proven effective as a glucocorticoid-sparing agent when administered in combination with glucocorticoids. Inconsistent results have been reported in clinical studies of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methotrexate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">methotrexate</a> (MTX) and tumor necrosis factor (TNF) inhibitors.</p><p>In the infrequent case when such therapies may be tried in combination with glucocorticoids, such as in decompensated diabetes mellitus, patients should be advised of the limitations of available data regarding efficacy. In this situation, our preference would be to use MTX, with the caveat that the use of the drug in contemporary doses (20 to 25 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/week)</span> has not been formally studied in PMR. The European League Against Rheumatism <span class=\"nowrap\">(EULAR)/American</span> College of Rheumatology (ACR) guidelines for management of PMR suggest that MTX could be considered as adjuvant treatment early in the treatment course, especially in patients with refractory disease or patients who are at high risk of glucocorticoid-related side effects [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-polymyalgia-rheumatica/abstract/2,3\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,3</a>].

We occasionally administer NSAIDs in patients on very low doses of glucocorticoids who also require analgesic or antiinflammatory therapy for other disorders, such as osteoarthritis or rotator cuff tendonitis. If NSAIDs are used concurrently with glucocorticoids, appropriate gastroprotective measures should be employed. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nsaids-including-aspirin-primary-prevention-of-gastroduodenal-toxicity\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;NSAIDs (including aspirin): Primary prevention of gastroduodenal toxicity&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H23\"><span class=\"h1\">PROGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There is no evidence of increased mortality associated with PMR [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-polymyalgia-rheumatica/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>]. PMR is not erosive and does not cause structural damage. Pain and functional limitations are eliminated with low doses of glucocorticoids. Morbidity in PMR most often relates to the longer-term impact of its treatment. Relapses of symptoms commonly respond to minor adjustments in the glucocorticoid dose, and treatment to prevent relapses must be weighed against the risks of glucocorticoid-related toxicities.</p><p>The heterogeneity of the clinical course commits the clinician to the care of an older patient on glucocorticoids for what may be an extended period of time. Guidelines for initial management with glucocorticoids and for subsequent tapering can be outlined, but ultimately treatment (the goal of which is the lowest glucocorticoid dose that keeps the given patient comfortable) must be flexible and individualized.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"PATIENT_INFORMATION\"><span class=\"h1\">INFORMATION FOR PATIENTS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>UpToDate offers two types of patient education materials, &ldquo;The Basics&rdquo; and &ldquo;Beyond the Basics.&rdquo; The Basics patient education pieces are written in plain language, at the 5<sup>th</sup> to 6<sup>th</sup> grade reading level, and they answer the four or five key questions a patient might have about a given condition.

Medications other than glucocorticoids, such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methotrexate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">methotrexate</a> (MTX) or tumor necrosis factor (TNF) inhibitors, and interleukin (IL)-6 receptor antagonists have not been conclusively proven effective in PMR. The primary goal of therapy is the relief of symptoms. Therapy has not been shown to clearly improve prognosis or prevent progression to giant cell (temporal) arteritis (GCA). (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Overall approach'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We recommend treatment with glucocorticoids as initial therapy in all patients with PMR (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=1\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1A</a>). We suggest a starting dose of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prednisone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">prednisone</a> 15 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day</span> (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). Patients usually respond quickly and may note improvement after a single dose. Symptoms are generally substantially better (50 to 70 percent reduction in pain and stiffness) within three days of starting prednisone.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">This starting dose of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prednisone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">prednisone</a> may be modified depending upon the patient's weight, the severity of symptoms, and comorbidities such as diabetes mellitus, severe hypertension, or heart failure. (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'General guidelines'</a> above and <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Initial glucocorticoid therapy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>If symptoms are not well controlled within one week of initiating therapy, the <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prednisone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">prednisone</a> dose should be increased by 5 mg, to a dose of 20 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day</span>. Practically all patients with PMR alone will respond to 15 to 20 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day</span> of prednisone. Persistent aching and stiffness despite the administration of prednisone at these doses mandate pursuit of an alternative diagnosis. (See <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Initial glucocorticoid therapy'</a> above and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-polymyalgia-rheumatica#H14\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of polymyalgia rheumatica&quot;, section on 'Differential diagnosis'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We suggest that the glucocorticoid dose that suppresses symptoms be maintained for two to four weeks after the aching and stiffness have resolved. The dose should then be gradually reduced every two to four weeks to find the minimum amount that is needed to maintain suppression of symptoms. (See <a href=\"#H8\" class=\"local\">'Maintenance phase and dose reduction'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>In patients receiving over 10 mg of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prednisone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">prednisone</a><span class=\"nowrap\">/day,</span> we suggest lowering the dose by 2.5 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day</span> decrements every two to four weeks.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Once the dose of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prednisone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">prednisone</a> is 10 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day,</span> we suggest lowering the dose by 1 mg per month, provided the patient does not flare.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We closely monitor the clinical response to glucocorticoid therapy, which principally involves screening for the presence <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> recurrence of symptoms of PMR or GCA. A measurement of the erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) and C-reactive protein (CRP) should be performed at baseline. We generally obtain a complete blood count (CBC), ESR, and CRP two months after initiating glucocorticoid therapy, and then repeat these laboratory tests every three to six months during glucocorticoid therapy. (See <a href=\"#H9\" class=\"local\">'Monitoring response to therapy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Relapse is common, particularly when the glucocorticoid dose is tapered too rapidly. In patients in whom recurrent symptoms develop following discontinuation of glucocorticoids and are accompanied by an elevation in the ESR <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> CRP, we suggest resuming glucocorticoids at the original dose at which control was achieved. In patients who relapse while on glucocorticoids, we suggest increasing glucocorticoids to the lowest dose that keeps symptoms in remission. An increase to the dose immediately prior to the dose from which the patient had been most recently tapered is often effective. (See <a href=\"#H10\" class=\"local\">'Relapse'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Elevations in the ESR <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> CRP may occur in the completely asymptomatic patient, and alone are not necessarily an indication for intensification of glucocorticoid therapy. However, patients with a more significant elevation in ESR <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> CRP without an increase in PMR symptoms should be evaluated for other possible causes of such laboratory changes, such as GCA. (See <a href=\"#H12\" class=\"local\">'Abnormal testing without symptoms'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In most patients, PMR runs a self-limited course, and glucocorticoid therapy can eventually be discontinued. Often, treatment can be stopped after one to two years, but the need for more protracted glucocorticoid therapy is not exceptional. (See <a href=\"#H3182943\" class=\"local\">'Duration of treatment'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients should also be monitored for adverse effects of glucocorticoids, including osteoporosis, glucose intolerance, and hypertension.
