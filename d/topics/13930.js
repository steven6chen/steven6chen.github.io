The resulting lack of estrogen is associated with rapid bone loss due to increased bone resorption and often consequent osteoporosis (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pathogenesis-of-osteoporosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pathogenesis of osteoporosis&quot;</a>). Many women also experience menopausal symptoms, including hot flashes, vaginal dryness, and urinary symptoms, all of which are relieved most effectively by estrogen therapy with or without a progestin.</p><p>For women with menopausal symptoms, estrogen is often given short term (six months to five years), with the goal of eventual tapering and discontinuation (unless there is a compelling reason to continue long term). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=menopausal-hot-flashes\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Menopausal hot flashes&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Prior to the publication of the Women's Health Initiative (WHI), long-term (more than five years) estrogen and combined estrogen-progestin therapy were routinely prescribed for osteoporosis and coronary heart disease (CHD) based upon observational data demonstrating a protective antiresorptive effect of estrogen on bone and a positive effect on the heart.</p><p>However, currently available data from clinical trials do not confirm that estrogen prevents or delays cardiovascular disease. To the contrary, the WHI and other trials suggest that combined estrogen-progestin is not cardioprotective and may slightly increase risk when used for either primary or secondary prevention of CHD. Moreover, combined therapy increases the risk of stroke, venous thromboembolism, and breast cancer [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/postmenopausal-hormone-therapy-in-the-prevention-and-treatment-of-osteoporosis/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>], while unopposed estrogen therapy may increase stroke and venous thromboembolism, but not CHD or breast cancer risk. Of note, follow-up analyses suggest that older, but not younger, postmenopausal women have excess CHD risk. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=menopausal-hormone-therapy-and-cardiovascular-risk\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Menopausal hormone therapy and cardiovascular risk&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=menopausal-hormone-therapy-and-the-risk-of-breast-cancer\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Menopausal hormone therapy and the risk of breast cancer&quot;</a>.)</p><p>In light of the WHI data and the efficacy of other antiresorptive drugs, including bisphosphonates and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=raloxifene-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">raloxifene</a>, estrogen-progestin therapy should no longer be used solely for the prevention or treatment of osteoporosis. Exceptions include women with persistent menopausal symptoms and those who cannot tolerate the other drugs. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-the-management-of-osteoporosis-in-postmenopausal-women\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of the management of osteoporosis in postmenopausal women&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Although not recommended, this topic will review the efficacy of estrogen therapy on the prevention and treatment of postmenopausal bone loss. The approach to osteoporosis management, the benefits and risks of estrogen therapy, and our current recommendations for estrogen use are discussed separately.

In one study, as an example, 43 postmenopausal women were randomly assigned to treatment with estrogen, calcium, or placebo for two years and followed with sequential measurements of bone density by dual photon absorptiometry [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/postmenopausal-hormone-therapy-in-the-prevention-and-treatment-of-osteoporosis/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Treatment with estrogen prevented bone loss in the forearm and whole body and increased bone density of the spine; it was significantly more effective than calcium or placebo.</p><p>The results were similar in a placebo-controlled study of 120 postmenopausal women with <strong>low bone density</strong> who were randomly assigned to treatment with exercise plus either placebo, calcium, or estrogen; these women were followed with sequential measurements of forearm bone density [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/postmenopausal-hormone-therapy-in-the-prevention-and-treatment-of-osteoporosis/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. Although calcium supplementation reduced bone loss at the distal forearm compared with placebo, treatment with estrogen was much more effective in preventing loss of bone density in the proximal, middle, and distal forearm than were the other treatments (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F62388\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef62388 \">figure 1</a>).

However, in the WHI trial, both unopposed estrogen and combined estrogen-progestin treatment reduced fracture risk. In this study, hip fracture was a secondary outcome, and women were not selected based upon osteoporosis history or risk factors. While bone mineral density was not measured, estrogen-progestin therapy was associated with significant reductions in [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/postmenopausal-hormone-therapy-in-the-prevention-and-treatment-of-osteoporosis/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Hip fracture (hazard ratio [HR] 0.7, unadjusted 95% CI 0.4-1.0; five fewer hip fractures per 10,000 person-years) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F55425\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef55425 \">figure 2</a>)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Vertebral and other osteoporotic fractures (HR 0.7, unadjusted 95% CI 0.4-1.0 and HR 0.8, 95% CI 0.7-0.9, respectively)</p><p/><p>Similar risk reductions were seen in the unopposed estrogen arm of the WHI trial for hip fracture (HR 0.61, 95% CI 0.41-0.91) and vertebral fracture (HR 0.62, 95% CI 0.42-0.93) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/postmenopausal-hormone-therapy-in-the-prevention-and-treatment-of-osteoporosis/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. Other results of the trial are reviewed elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=menopausal-hormone-therapy-benefits-and-risks\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Menopausal hormone therapy: Benefits and risks&quot;</a>.)</p><p>In the WHI, bone mineral density was not a criterion for randomization. Thus, the results are not conclusive, because the bone density in the two groups may have been different at baseline. However, most would agree that the WHI provides the best evidence to date that estrogen reduces fracture risk.</p><p>All types of postmenopausal hormone therapy appear to confer benefit. In a prospective, cohort study of over one million women (the Million Women Study), current users of postmenopausal hormone therapy had a significantly lower risk of any fracture than nonusers (relative risk [RR] 0.62, 95% CI 0.58-0.66) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/postmenopausal-hormone-therapy-in-the-prevention-and-treatment-of-osteoporosis/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. The protective effect was seen for all types of postmenopausal hormone therapy (unopposed estrogen, combined estrogen-progestin, different estrogen and progestin formulations, different routes of administration [oral versus transdermal], and different patterns of administration [cyclic versus continuous]).</p><p>Concomitant administration of a progestin to prevent endometrial hyperplasia does not interfere with the beneficial effect of estrogen on bone, whether given as cyclic or continuous therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/postmenopausal-hormone-therapy-in-the-prevention-and-treatment-of-osteoporosis/abstract/2,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,10</a>].

As an example, cross-sectional data from the Rancho Bernardo study found that women who had taken estrogen in the past and then discontinued it had slightly higher bone density than women who had never taken estrogen, but their bone density was substantially lower than women currently taking estrogen (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F51367\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef51367 \">figure 3</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/postmenopausal-hormone-therapy-in-the-prevention-and-treatment-of-osteoporosis/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. Among the latter women, the effect of estrogen was almost as good (and not statistically different) when estrogen was started at age 60 years, compared with beginning therapy at menopause. Other studies have noted similar findings: higher bone mass in women currently taking estrogen [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/postmenopausal-hormone-therapy-in-the-prevention-and-treatment-of-osteoporosis/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>] and in those treated long term [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/postmenopausal-hormone-therapy-in-the-prevention-and-treatment-of-osteoporosis/abstract/13-15\" class=\"abstract_t\">13-15</a>].</p><p>The limited efficacy of past estrogen therapy may reflect &quot;catch-up&quot; bone loss, although data have been conflicting [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/postmenopausal-hormone-therapy-in-the-prevention-and-treatment-of-osteoporosis/abstract/16-18\" class=\"abstract_t\">16-18</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>One study in 43 postmenopausal women found that those not treated with estrogen after oophorectomy initially lost bone at a rate of 2.6 percent per year, which later fell to 0.8 percent per year (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F51608\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef51608 \">figure 4</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/postmenopausal-hormone-therapy-in-the-prevention-and-treatment-of-osteoporosis/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. Those treated with estrogen for four years lost no bone, but after it was discontinued, they lost bone at a rate of 2.5 percent per year for the next four years. There was no significant difference in bone loss between the two groups at eight years.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In one study of postmenopausal women posthysterectomy, the women were randomly assigned to receive <a href=\"topic.htm?path=alendronate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">alendronate</a>, estrogen, combination therapy, or placebo for two years, followed by further randomization to continued drug therapy or placebo in year 3. Bone density decreased in year 3 after stopping estrogen (-4.5, 1.8, and 2.4 percent in the spine, total hip, and femoral neck, respectively) but not after stopping alendronate or combined alendronate-estrogen treatment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/postmenopausal-hormone-therapy-in-the-prevention-and-treatment-of-osteoporosis/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In contrast, in the much larger PEPI trial, postmenopausal women who discontinued estrogen did not lose bone at an unusually fast rate. In this study of 495 women who had measurements of bone mineral density for an average of three years during and four years after the trial, annual rates of bone mineral density loss in the women who took estrogen and then stopped it and those who never took estrogen were the same (approximately 1 percent per year) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/postmenopausal-hormone-therapy-in-the-prevention-and-treatment-of-osteoporosis/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>].</p><p/><p>Thus, data on accelerated bone loss after stopping estrogen therapy are inconsistent. Even if there is accelerated bone loss after stopping estrogen, it is unlikely to cause loss of all of the bone mineral density preserved on treatment, as most studies show that postmenopausal women who have taken estrogen in the past have higher bone mineral density than those who have never taken it [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/postmenopausal-hormone-therapy-in-the-prevention-and-treatment-of-osteoporosis/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Treatment of established osteoporosis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Although estrogen therapy is US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved for prevention but not treatment of osteoporosis, data suggest that estrogen is effective in postmenopausal women with established osteoporosis and vertebral fractures. In one study, 75 such women were randomly assigned to treatment with transdermal <a href=\"topic.htm?path=estradiol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">estradiol</a> or placebo; calcium supplements were given to both groups [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/postmenopausal-hormone-therapy-in-the-prevention-and-treatment-of-osteoporosis/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. Estrogen was associated with an increase in bone density in the spine and proximal femur and no change in bone density in the mid-radius. It also lowered the risk of vertebral fractures by more than 50 percent (23 versus 58 fractures per 100 patient-years).</p><p>Estrogen appears to be effective even when started after age 75 years. As an example, in 67 frail older women (over age 75 years), administration of estrogen for nine months increased bone density at the lumbar spine and hip as compared with placebo (4.3 versus 0.4 percent in the spine; 1.7 versus -0.1 percent in the hip) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/postmenopausal-hormone-therapy-in-the-prevention-and-treatment-of-osteoporosis/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Low-dose estrogen</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The dose of estrogen required to prevent bone loss had been thought to be 0.625 mg of conjugated estrogens or its equivalent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/postmenopausal-hormone-therapy-in-the-prevention-and-treatment-of-osteoporosis/abstract/23-25\" class=\"abstract_t\">23-25</a>] (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=preparations-for-menopausal-hormone-therapy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Preparations for menopausal hormone therapy&quot;</a>). However, among postmenopausal women not taking estrogen, those with low (but detectable) serum <a href=\"topic.htm?path=estradiol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">estradiol</a> concentrations have higher bone density than those with undetectable concentrations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/postmenopausal-hormone-therapy-in-the-prevention-and-treatment-of-osteoporosis/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>].</p><p>Based upon this observation, lower doses of estrogen have been explored as a strategy to prevent bone loss while minimizing side effects and breast cancer risk.

As a result, we recommend bisphosphonates or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=raloxifene-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">raloxifene</a> as first-line drugs for prevention and bisphosphonates for treatment of established osteoporosis.
