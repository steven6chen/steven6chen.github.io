In one large series, forearm shaft fractures of the radius ranked as the third most common fracture after distal radial fractures and supracondylar humeral fractures [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/midshaft-forearm-fractures-in-children/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. In addition, midshaft forearm fractures are the most common sites for refracture in children and among the most common sites of pediatric open fractures [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/midshaft-forearm-fractures-in-children/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].</p><p>Forearm fractures have been associated with falls from playground equipment (eg, monkey bars) and from backyard trampolines [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/midshaft-forearm-fractures-in-children/abstract/5,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,6</a>]. However, any fall with adequate force may result in fracture.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">PERTINENT ANATOMY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The bones, muscles, ligaments, and tendons all work together in stabilizing the forearm. An interosseous membrane connects the radius and ulna, and the radius rotates around the ulna during supination and pronation of the forearm (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F78612\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef78612 \">figure 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F64025\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef64025 \">figure 2</a>)&nbsp;[<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/midshaft-forearm-fractures-in-children/abstract/1,7-10\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,7-10</a>]. The two areas where the radius and ulna meet, at the elbow and the wrist, are called the radioulnar articulations. Because of the interosseous membrane and these articulations, any disruption or fracture of one bone is usually accompanied by fracture to the other (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F58106\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef58106 \">image 1</a>)&nbsp;[<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/midshaft-forearm-fractures-in-children/abstract/1,4,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,4,9</a>].</p><p>If only one bone appears to be fractured, the clinician should check the proximal and distal joints for injury to the other bone or the joint.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h1\">MECHANISM OF INJURY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Most both bone midshaft forearm fractures in children result from a fall onto an outstretched hand (FOOSH) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/midshaft-forearm-fractures-in-children/abstract/2,8,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,8,9</a>]. A direct blow to the middle of the forearm may cause an isolated fracture of the midshaft ulna (&quot;nightstick fracture&quot;) or, less commonly, the radius.</p><p>Midshaft forearm fractures are not typically associated with multiple trauma. However, children who fall from a height greater than three times their standing height or sustain a midshaft forearm fracture as a result of another major trauma mechanism (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F57293\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef57293 \">table 1</a>) are at risk for multiple trauma and warrant a complete physical examination and appropriate ancillary studies.

The bone may have poked through the skin and then retracted, leaving a small puncture. In contrast to an abrasion or puncture from the outside of the arm overlying the fracture site, these small punctures resulting from the fracture tend to ooze blood.

Typically, a second person is needed to hold the arm (by the fingers) in the proper position.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Materials</strong> &ndash; The layers of the cast consist of stockinette next to the skin, cotton padding (eg, two inch Webril&reg;) that is rolled with one half inch overlap, and two inch fiberglass or plaster casting material. Extra padding should be applied to common pressure points at the wrist and elbow. It is important to ensure no major wrinkles exist in the stockinette and the padding before casting material is applied.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Molding</strong> &ndash; Three-point molding of the forearm portion of the cast maintains the fracture reduction and allows the clinician to mold the cast without causing pressure points. The palm of one hand pushes gently distal to the fracture on the side of the intact periosteum, while the palm of the other hand pushes gently proximal to the fracture on the opposite side of the arm. An assistant's hand is placed more proximally on the arm (below the elbow) on the same side as the most distal hand. Once completed, the cast should be wider in the horizontal diameter than in the vertical diameter when viewed on end (vertical to horizontal diameter ratio 0.7) and the ulnar border should be straight (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F52462\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef52462 \">figure 8</a>)&nbsp;[<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/midshaft-forearm-fractures-in-children/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Forearm position in the cast</strong> &ndash; The cast should be in neutral position with respect to supination and pronation of the hand [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/midshaft-forearm-fractures-in-children/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Although some orthopedists prefer the wrist to be casted in slight flexion with ulnar deviation to counteract opposing muscles, an observational study of 109 children with distal forearm fractures concluded that the position of immobilization (neutral, pronation, or supination) does not appear to affect maintenance of fracture reduction and residual angulation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/midshaft-forearm-fractures-in-children/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Length of cast</strong> &ndash; A long arm cast should be placed on all reduced midshaft forearm fractures.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Post-casting neurovascular assessment</strong> &ndash; The patient should have good perfusion of the fingers and be able to fully extend his or her fingers and thumb actively and passively after casting [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/midshaft-forearm-fractures-in-children/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].

(See <a href=\"#H24\" class=\"local\">'Indications for orthopedic consultation or referral'</a> above and <a href=\"#H25\" class=\"local\">'Definitive care'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Children with vascular insufficiency may require partial closed reduction in the emergency department in an attempt to restore distal circulation. Patients who display a cold, cyanotic hand despite reduction attempts require emergent operative exploration and vascular repair. (See <a href=\"#H21\" class=\"local\">'Absent pulse'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Suspected compartment syndrome should prompt measurement of compartment pressure in addition to emergent consultation with an orthopedic surgeon with appropriate pediatric expertise. Once confirmed by compartment pressure measurement or clinical assessment, immediate management of suspected acute compartment syndrome includes relieving all external pressure on the compartment. Definitive treatment consists of fasciotomy to decompress all involved compartments. (See <a href=\"#H22\" class=\"local\">'Compartment syndrome'</a> above and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acute-compartment-syndrome-of-the-extremities#H10\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Acute compartment syndrome of the extremities&quot;, section on 'Measurement of compartment pressures'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Additional recommendations in children with open fractures include administration of intravenous antibiotics, tetanus prophylaxis, and emergency orthopedic consultation. (See <a href=\"#H675347962\" class=\"local\">'Open fracture'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For children with adequate distal circulation, initial therapy consists of pain management and immobilization to prevent further displacement of the fracture. (See <a href=\"#H23\" class=\"local\">'Analgesia and splinting'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients with nondisplaced or minimally displaced midshaft fractures may receive immobilization with a long arm splint or cast and a sling in the emergency department and follow-up with an orthopedic surgeon with appropriate pediatric expertise within one week. (See <a href=\"#H27\" class=\"local\">'Greenstick fracture'</a> above and <a href=\"#H26\" class=\"local\">'Plastic deformation'</a> above.)</p></div><div id=\"topicAgreement\">Use of UpToDate is subject to the <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/legal/license\" class=\"licenseLink\" id=\"sla_in_page\">Subscription and License Agreement</a>.</div><div id=\"references\" class=\"headingAnchor\"><h1>REFERENCES</h1><ol id=\"reference\"><li class=\"breakAll\">Price CT, Flynn JM.
