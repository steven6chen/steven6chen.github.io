Even though the object doesn't go through the skull, parts of the head can still get damaged. A closed head injury can cause:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A broken bone of the skull or face (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F62443\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef62443 \">figure 1</a>)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Brain injury or swelling</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Bleeding in or around the brain</p><p/><p>The most common causes of a closed head injury are falls, sports injuries, and car and bike accidents.</p><p>Some closed head injuries are mild. Another word for a mild brain injury is a &quot;concussion.&quot; Closed head injuries can also be severe and life-threatening.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H28339984\"><span class=\"h1\">What are the symptoms of a closed head injury?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Symptoms depend on the type of injury a person has and how severe it is. People with a mild closed head injury, such as a bump on the head, might not have any symptoms.</p><p>When a closed head injury does cause symptoms, it can cause:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A headache</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Nausea or vomiting</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Swelling, bleeding, or bruising on the scalp</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Dizziness</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Confusion or memory problems</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Feeling tired</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Mood or behavior changes</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Trouble walking or talking</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Seizures &ndash; Seizures are waves of abnormal electrical activity in the brain. They can make you pass out, or move or behave strangely.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Passing out</p><p/><p>A closed head injury that involves a broken skull or face bone can also cause:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Bruising around the eyes or behind the ear</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Blood or clear fluid draining from the nose or ear</p><p/><p>Symptoms can start right after a closed head injury, or a few hours or days later. Some people have symptoms that last a short time only. Other people have symptoms that cause long-lasting problems.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H28339999\"><span class=\"h1\">Will I need tests?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>It depends on your injury and symptoms. Your doctor or nurse will ask about your symptoms and do an exam. He or she will also ask questions to check your thinking.</p><p>If your doctor or nurse thinks you might have a serious injury, he or she might order an imaging test of your brain, such as a CT or MRI scan. These tests create pictures of your skull and brain.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H28340014\"><span class=\"h1\">How is a closed head injury treated?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Treatment depends on your injury and how serious it is.</p><p>Usually, mild closed head injuries do not need treatment. But your doctor might recommend that someone watch you for 24 hours after your injury. This person should watch for new symptoms or the symptoms listed above, and make sure that you can be woken up after you fall asleep.</p><p>Severe closed head injuries need to be treated in the hospital. Treatment can include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Medicines &ndash; Some medicines help prevent brain swelling. Others help prevent seizures.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Surgery &ndash; If you have bleeding in or around your brain, or if your brain swells, you might need surgery.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H28340029\"><span class=\"h1\">When should I call the doctor or nurse?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>After your closed head injury, call your doctor or nurse if:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Your headache gets worse</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>You vomit</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Your thinking or behavior changes</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>You can&rsquo;t walk normally</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>You have a seizure</p><p/><p>Plus, the person watching you should call the doctor or nurse if he or she can't wake you up.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H28340044\"><span class=\"h1\">When can I play sports or do my usual activities again?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Ask your doctor when you can play sports or do your usual activities again. It will depend on your injury and symptoms.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H28340059\"><span class=\"h1\">How can I prevent another closed head injury?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>To help prevent another closed head injury, you should wear a helmet when you ride a bike or motorcycle, or play sports where you could get hurt.
