As a result, clinicians often rely on professional societies for guidance in treating their patients with these illnesses.</p><p>Organizations such as the American Heart Association (AHA), the American College of Cardiology (ACC), the European Society of Cardiology, the International Society for Heart and Lung Transplantation, and the Heart Failure Society of America have developed and disseminated guidelines to aid practitioners in the management of these complex medical conditions.</p><p>The guideline committees summarize the evidence and expert opinion, and provide final, graded recommendations for patient evaluation and therapy. The guidelines address both acute inpatient and chronic outpatient care. Although some improvements in the use of these evidence-based therapies have occurred, compliance with all appropriate therapies remains suboptimal [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/guideline-adherence-and-outcomes-in-coronary-heart-disease-and-heart-failure/abstract/1-15\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-15</a>]. As an example, less than one-third of eligible patients hospitalized for HF receive guideline-recommended aldosterone antagonist therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/guideline-adherence-and-outcomes-in-coronary-heart-disease-and-heart-failure/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>].</p><p>This topic will: review the evidence for the importance of guideline adherence in the management of myocardial infarction and HF; review how well these guidelines are adhered to; and provide evidence based strategies for improving adherence.

The magnitude of the effect of adherence to the multiple recommendations provided by guidelines was best illustrated in an observational study of almost 65,000 patients with a non-ST elevation acute coronary syndrome (ACS) from 2001 to 2003 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/guideline-adherence-and-outcomes-in-coronary-heart-disease-and-heart-failure/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].

In-hospital mortality was significantly lower in the hospitals in the highest compared to lowest adherence quartile (4.2 versus 6.3 percent).</p><p>Further support for the benefit of following guideline recommendations comes from a report from the CRUSADE registry [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/guideline-adherence-and-outcomes-in-coronary-heart-disease-and-heart-failure/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>].

In a report of over one thousand patients enrolled in a registry after an acute coronary syndrome, 28 percent of patients had discontinued one or more of the following guideline recommended therapies at three months: <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aspirin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">aspirin</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clopidogrel-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">clopidogrel</a>, angiotensin receptor blockers or statin therapy.

However, patients undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) had lower rates of evidence-based therapies compared to recipients of PCI.</p><p>A later report evaluated the efficacy of real-time monitoring of key quality of care indicators in the GAP program in patients with an acute coronary syndrome [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/guideline-adherence-and-outcomes-in-coronary-heart-disease-and-heart-failure/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. Real-time implementation was performed in 1170 patients seen between July 2002 and December 2004; the outcomes were compared to those in 2019 patients seen between January 1999 and June 2002 when real-time monitoring was not used.</p><p>Real-time monitoring was associated with significant increases in the use of in-hospital ACE inhibitors (73 versus 64 percent), beta blockers (93 versus 90 percent), statins (81 versus 66 percent), and other modalities, and higher discharge rates of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aspirin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">aspirin</a> (92 versus 87 percent), beta blockers (87 versus 79 percent), statins (81 versus 65 percent), and ACE inhibitors (67 versus 56 percent). Patient outcomes were also improved. (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Efficacy of CHD guideline adherence'</a> above.)</p><p>Furthermore, real-time monitoring, compared to lack of use of real-time monitoring, was associated with the following significant benefits during the six months after discharge: fewer rehospitalization for heart disease (20 versus 25 percent), a lower rate of MI (3.5 versus 5.4 percent), and a lower rate of the combined end point of death, MI, or cerebrovascular accident (9.5 versus 13.9 percent).</p><p>With respect to its effect on mortality, GAP use was associated with significant reductions in mortality in-hospital (10.4 versus 13.6 percent), 30 days (16.7 versus 21.6 percent, adjusted odds ratio 0.74, 95% CI 0.59-0.94), and one year (33.2 versus 38.3 percent, adjusted odds ratio 0.78, 95% CI 0.64-0.95) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/guideline-adherence-and-outcomes-in-coronary-heart-disease-and-heart-failure/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>].

The program targets patients presenting with CHD and promotes discharge on recommended key medical therapies and patient counseling for risk factor modification. The different components of secondary prevention are discussed separately [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/guideline-adherence-and-outcomes-in-coronary-heart-disease-and-heart-failure/abstract/51\" class=\"abstract_t\">51</a>].

This interactive quality improvement reporting system, used to prospectively collect data and measure hospital performance, offered additional support in patient management. Reminder screens provided immediate reference to the appropriate guideline and alerted health care providers to specific guideline-recommended interventions that were being overlooked in each patient. The tool also allowed providers to generate patient education sheets and produce written correspondences to the patient's primary care clinician detailing the diagnosis, risk assessment, and interventions performed during the hospitalization.</p><p>In an analysis of nearly 150,000 patients enrolled in the GWTG-CAD registry between 2002 and 2009, adherence to the following six performance measures was recorded: <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aspirin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">aspirin</a> within 24 hours, discharge with aspirin and beta blockers, patients with low ejection fraction discharged with angiotensin-converting enzyme <span class=\"nowrap\">inhibitors/angiotension</span> receptor blockers, smoking cessation counseling, and use of lipid-lowering medications [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/guideline-adherence-and-outcomes-in-coronary-heart-disease-and-heart-failure/abstract/52\" class=\"abstract_t\">52</a>]. From 2007 onward, there was more than 90 percent adherence for each measure. There were predictors of worse adherence. In particular, older age and female sex were strongly predictive of worse adherence in essentially all models, drawing attention to the disparities in adherence to guideline-based care [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/guideline-adherence-and-outcomes-in-coronary-heart-disease-and-heart-failure/abstract/52\" class=\"abstract_t\">52</a>].</p><p>While referral by a health care practitioner to a cardiac rehabilitation program is an essential step in a secondary prevention strategy, the benefits of such programs can only be accrued if the patient enrolls. Analysis of patient data from one hospital that used the GWTG program in 2002 and 2003 found that 55 percent of patients in the program were referred for cardiac rehabilitation, but only 34 percent of referred patients (19 percent of all patients) enrolled [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/guideline-adherence-and-outcomes-in-coronary-heart-disease-and-heart-failure/abstract/53\" class=\"abstract_t\">53</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H16\"><span class=\"h3\">CRUSADE registry</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>One database that has been used to evaluate guideline adherence and increase the practice of evidence-based medicine in non-ST elevation ACS (including unstable angina) is the CRUSADE registry, which was developed in 2001; about 200,000 patients were enrolled as of 2007 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/guideline-adherence-and-outcomes-in-coronary-heart-disease-and-heart-failure/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. In early 2007, the CRUSADE registry and the National Registry for Myocardial Infarction (NRMI) collaborated with the American College of Cardiology Foundation's National Cardiovascular Data Registry to launch a new registry called NCDR-ACTIONTM. This new registry has taken over the CRUSADE database as CRUSADE closed its enrollment as of January 31, 2007 with a final enrollment of 205,048. The goal of this new initiative is to improve the safety and outcomes of ACS patients using this merged database and to provide broader spectrum reporting [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/guideline-adherence-and-outcomes-in-coronary-heart-disease-and-heart-failure/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. Nonetheless, the registry's original data provides invaluable information into guideline adherence and thus is discussed in detail here.</p><p>The CRUSADE database was used to evaluate the utilization of the early invasive and conservative approaches in a subset of high risk patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/guideline-adherence-and-outcomes-in-coronary-heart-disease-and-heart-failure/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. Patient characteristics such as demographic information (age, gender, race), body mass index, and risk factors for CHD were analyzed. Among 17,296 patients, 62 percent underwent cardiac catheterization at some point during the index hospitalization: 45 percent within the first 48 hours of hospitalization (early invasive approach) and 17 percent after the first 48 hours. Recipients of the early invasive approach were younger, more frequently male and Caucasian, more likely to be under the care of a cardiologist, and less likely to have heart failure or impaired renal function.</p><p>Recipients of the early invasive approach were also more likely to receive <span class=\"nowrap\">ACC/AHA</span> guidelines-recommended pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic interventions, both in the acute setting and at time of discharge. These included administration of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aspirin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">aspirin</a>, beta blockers, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clopidogrel-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">clopidogrel</a>, statins, ACE inhibitors, and counseling for modifications in diet, smoking cessation, and referral for cardiac rehabilitation. This may have followed from standard post-procedure order sets which emphasize the use of evidence-based treatment for all eligible patients.</p><p>Patients who were older were often treated conservatively even though clinical trials suggest that they derive greater benefit from an early aggressive approach.
