Approximately half of all pregnancies were unintended and 40 percent of these were terminated, meaning that 21 percent of all pregnancies were aborted. The number of induced abortions declined by 13 percent between 2008 and 2011, but the number of terminations of intended pregnancies has increased due to advances in prenatal testing for fetal abnormalities [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/counseling-regarding-pregnancy-termination/abstract/1-3\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-3</a>]. Women require appropriate counseling before and after pregnancy termination. It is important to note that the psychological context of pregnancy termination varies depending upon whether the reason is an unwanted pregnancy, multiple gestation, or fetal anomalies.</p><p>Counseling of women regarding pregnancy termination is reviewed here. Psychiatric illness associated with pregnancy termination and other issues regarding pregnancy termination are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pregnancy-termination-and-potential-psychiatric-outcomes\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pregnancy termination and potential psychiatric outcomes&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-pregnancy-termination\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of pregnancy termination&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1837728144\"><span class=\"h1\">OVERVIEW</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Counseling before pregnancy termination includes education about the nature and purpose of the procedure, alternatives, and possible complications and ascertains that the patient is making the decision voluntarily. It also provides emotional support and helps identify those who require additional emotional support. Few patients are likely to fall into this latter category. Several approaches to counseling and resources for clinicians are available [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/counseling-regarding-pregnancy-termination/abstract/4,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,5</a>].</p><p>Some states in the United States have legal requirements regarding giving patients information about potential adverse emotional consequences of abortion. Clinicians should consult with their professional organization and local government authority about these requirements.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2631578888\"><span class=\"h1\">PREPROCEDURE COUNSELING</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1109548224\"><span class=\"h2\">Source of counseling</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Some women who consider pregnancy termination present directly to abortion clinics, while others seek the advice of their primary care clinician, gynecologist, midwife, or other clinicians, and are then referred to an abortion provider or clinic.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H868423035\"><span class=\"h3\">Referring clinician</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Clinicians who refer patients for induced abortion can play an important role in counseling patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/counseling-regarding-pregnancy-termination/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. Awareness of potential psychiatric outcomes and modifying factors is helpful in counseling patients. For referring clinicians, a key goal is to identify patients with preexisting mental illness, a lack of social support, or intimate partner issues (violence or coercion) and help the patient to access appropriate services.</p><p>Referring clinicians should be able to provide contact information for abortion providers (as well as adoption agencies) and have a general knowledge of different options for pregnancy termination. A referral list based upon personal knowledge of colleagues and previous experiences of patients is helpful to patients and preferable to advising a patient to check a printed or online directory.</p><p>Clinicians should be aware that it may be difficult for patients to bring up the subject of pregnancy termination and should approach patients in a manner that puts them at ease and avoids a perception of stigma. Poor support from the woman&rsquo;s gynecologist or primary care provider may be associated with emotional distress in women undergoing abortion.</p><p>Clinicians may have differing personal views of abortion. However, codes of medical ethics require clinicians to provide impartial information and referrals to patients. Regarding pregnancy termination, the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists advises, &ldquo;All health care providers must provide accurate and unbiased information so that patients can make informed decisions&rdquo; [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/counseling-regarding-pregnancy-termination/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3804094671\"><span class=\"h3\">Clinician performing the termination</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Pregnancy termination may be provided in a clinic, hospital, or clinician&rsquo;s office. In any of these settings, counseling should be provided before and after the termination, with the following goals:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Assist decision-making regarding termination. Although few women who request termination would also consider carrying a pregnancy to term, counselors should ensure that this alternative is considered either through parenting or placing for adoption. The risks of abortion versus delivery must be included in the information to those who require this additional counseling.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Inform patients about the procedure, including the different types of abortion that are available and details of the procedure (including risk of complications and post-termination health risks), and follow-up care. Written information is useful for the patient to review later and share with partners. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-pregnancy-termination#H24\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of pregnancy termination&quot;, section on 'Complications'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Provide emotional support and help the patient identify sources of social support.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Identify patients with psychiatric symptoms or disorders who require additional psychiatric evaluation or care; abortion providers should have a list of resources for referrals as needed.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Provide information about post-termination contraception to avoid a subsequent unplanned pregnancy. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=postpartum-contraception-initiation-and-methods\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Postpartum contraception: Initiation and methods&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Review payment options. Financial aspects of abortion contribute to emotional distress.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4144286471\"><span class=\"h2\">Decision-making</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>It is important for clinicians to acknowledge the individual situation of the patient and offer support in decision-making if needed. Many private and public family planning and abortion services offer decision-making counseling and employ staff specifically trained to help women with this process. Several studies have found that the process of decision-making is a key factor in postabortion reactions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/counseling-regarding-pregnancy-termination/abstract/8-10\" class=\"abstract_t\">8-10</a>].</p><p>Unintended pregnancies are not necessarily unwanted, but financial problems, age and maturity, and lack of a supportive partner or parents may contribute to the decision to terminate. For women who feel compelled by their circumstances to have an abortion, reactions may range from welcoming the opportunity to end the pregnancy safely to feelings of profound ambivalence and disapproval. Ambivalence and disapproval are particularly common among women who have an anti-abortion perspective or believe that abortion is akin to murder. Clinicians can help identify the key issues and considerations to facilitate a decision that will mitigate negative psychological responses in the future. For women who are ambivalent about abortion, feelings of sadness and grieving are appropriate responses, and women can benefit from the opportunity to express all of their feelings about the pregnancy and potential parenthood [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/counseling-regarding-pregnancy-termination/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. Women with a great degree of emotional conflict may benefit from referral to a psychotherapist.</p><p>Women should ideally make the decision of carrying a pregnancy to term or terminating it without coercion and with the support of their partners, families, and health care providers. Counselors should ask women considering pregnancy termination whether they feel pressured into making a particular choice, and should provide unbiased counseling to help a woman arrive at her own decision. For adolescent patients, particular attention should be paid to possible pressure to terminate or continue the pregnancy by her partner or parents.</p><p>Control of decision-making may be an aspect of intimate partner violence. Several studies suggest that women who experience relationship violence are more likely to have repeat terminations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/counseling-regarding-pregnancy-termination/abstract/11-13\" class=\"abstract_t\">11-13</a>]. This may be due to partners not allowing the use of contraception. Screening for intimate partner violence should be provided for all women who present with clinical symptoms or signs listed in the table (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F53373\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef53373 \">table 1</a>), as well as women who present for an initial visit to primary care clinicians or obstetrician-gynecologists. Screening and management of intimate partner violence is discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=intimate-partner-violence-diagnosis-and-screening\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Intimate partner violence: Diagnosis and screening&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=intimate-partner-violence-intervention-and-patient-management\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Intimate partner violence: Intervention and patient management&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3525346415\"><span class=\"h2\">Emotional support</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Studies suggest that counseling support before and after the abortion can have a positive effect on mental state and perception of the pregnancy termination experience [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/counseling-regarding-pregnancy-termination/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].</p><p>Clinicians can discuss concerns, feelings, and attitudes that women have about pregnancy termination, and other issues such as relationship health, which may impact a woman&rsquo;s emotional response. The discussion may also identify sources of emotional support beyond the clinician, such as family, friends, support groups, and therapy. In addition, postabortion support talk lines can provide ongoing emotional support subsequent to an abortion, particularly benefiting women who experience distress that does not manifest while in the clinic [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/counseling-regarding-pregnancy-termination/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>].</p><p>The clinician can help the woman to identify potential coping mechanisms, especially for women who are experiencing or anticipating emotional distress. A study of women seeking an abortion (n &gt;5000) found that prior to the procedure, most women anticipated positive emotions following pregnancy termination [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/counseling-regarding-pregnancy-termination/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. However, women who anticipated poor coping included adolescents, women with a history of depression, women who were ambivalent or felt pushed into terminating the pregnancy, women who had spiritual concerns about abortion, and women terminating pregnancies with fetal anomalies. In an observational study of women who underwent surgical abortion (n = 114), changes from preoperative anxiety were assessed postoperatively; the decreases were greater in women who were accompanied in the postoperative recovery room by a support person, compared with women who were not accompanied [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/counseling-regarding-pregnancy-termination/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H238068609\"><span class=\"h3\">Women at risk of adverse psychiatric outcomes</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Women planning pregnancy termination should receive counseling, and those at risk for mental health issues should be identified. As noted above, risk factors for postabortion emotional distress or mental health disorders include (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pregnancy-termination-and-potential-psychiatric-outcomes#H270580033\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pregnancy termination and potential psychiatric outcomes&quot;, section on 'Factors that may increase risk of postabortion psychiatric problems'</a>):</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Mental disorders prior to abortion</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Lack of social support</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Relationship violence</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Negative attitude toward pregnancy termination in general</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Small family size or no children</p><p/><p>Numerous validated inventories are available to help assess depression and anxiety pre- and postabortion, including the following self-report instruments that are in the public domain:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patient Health Questionnaire &ndash; Nine-Item (PHQ-9) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F59307\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef59307 \">table 2</a>) &ndash; The PHQ-9 screens for depression. The two-item Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-2) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F89663\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef89663 \">table 3</a>) can also be used; this instrument consists of the first two items from the PHQ-9. The PHQ-2 is briefer and somewhat less accurate than the PHQ-9. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=screening-for-depression-in-adults#H22016485\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Screening for depression in adults&quot;, section on 'Screening instruments'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Generalized Anxiety Disorder &ndash; Seven-Item (GAD-7) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F77755\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef77755 \">table 4</a>) &ndash; The GAD-7 screens for anxiety symptoms (eg, excessive fears and worrying).</p><p/><p>For patients who express clinically significant distress, mental health referrals should be made; additional referrals to further in-clinic counseling, community support organizations, or abortion talk lines may also be helpful. In the rare circumstance in which a woman might be at risk of self-harm or suicide, she should be referred to a mental health clinician or hospital emergency department, depending upon the level of acuity.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H716083996\"><span class=\"h1\">POSTPROCEDURE COUNSELING</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Although not often routinely performed, counseling after pregnancy termination presents another opportunity to identify women at risk for significant emotional distress. Assessment for current symptoms or a prior history of mental health disorders are key components of this evaluation.</p><p>Clinicians should acknowledge feelings of sadness and grief that are expressed; based upon our clinical experience, discussing these feelings helps women cope following pregnancy termination. Women who need further postpregnancy termination emotional support should be referred to therapists or organizations that offer support services, as women rarely return to the abortion provider for postabortion support.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3824670643\"><span class=\"h1\">SOCIETY GUIDELINE LINKS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Links to society and government-sponsored guidelines from selected countries and regions around the world are provided separately.
