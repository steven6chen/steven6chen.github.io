It is a stimulant, and is often used to enhance mental alertness.</p><p>Although there is no high quality evidence that a modest level of caffeine consumption has adverse effects on fertility or pregnancy outcome, putative beliefs about a relationship between caffeine intake and adverse reproductive outcomes are common, and caffeine consumption is often perceived to be an unhealthy habit. The consumption of caffeinated beverages has been implicated in fertility problems, while consumption during pregnancy has been associated with an increased risk of miscarriage, congenital malformations, fetal growth restriction, stillbirth, and long-term behavioral effects in offspring. The biologic rationale for these associations is caffeine's ability to accumulate in fetal tissues and produce diverse pharmacologic effects that could interfere with fetal growth and development [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-effects-of-caffeine-on-reproductive-outcomes-in-women/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>]. </p><p>This topic will review the relationship between caffeine intake and reproductive issues in women. The physiological effects of caffeine and caffeinated beverages and the effects of caffeine on specific disease processes, including insulin resistance, cancer, cardiovascular disease, and mortality are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cardiovascular-effects-of-caffeine-and-caffeinated-beverages\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Cardiovascular effects of caffeine and caffeinated beverages&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=benefits-and-risks-of-caffeine-and-caffeinated-beverages\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Benefits and risks of caffeine and caffeinated beverages&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">SOURCES OF CAFFEINE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Caffeine originates in more than 60 plants, occurs naturally in various food products and beverages (including coffee, tea, chocolate, cocoa products, colas), and is added to some soft drinks and most &quot;energy&quot; drinks. Caffeine is also present in some prescription and over-the-counter medications, such as cold and flu remedies, allergy and headache treatments, diet pills, diuretics, and stimulants. Increasingly, caffeine is now present as an additive in snack foods, sports performance supplements, and dietary supplements. Examples of the caffeine content of various products can be found online (eg, <a href=\"http://www.cspinet.org/new/cafchart.htm&amp;token=sXYcgWfQbbrdHJNyr4pjeNg9wFRNKL2Vg4bFmc+iFaaIi1ylvE8/6oPy5YpUO2pd&amp;TOPIC_ID=406\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">http://www.cspinet.org/new/cafchart.htm</a>) and in the table (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F79304\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef79304 \">table 1</a>).</p><p>Coffee, tea, cocoa and carbonated soft drinks are the main sources of caffeine intake. Consumption varies throughout the world, and is influenced by culture, individual preferences, availability, and advertising. Coffee contains 50 to 70 percent more caffeine than tea and other products, accounting for the main source of caffeine in many populations.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">CAFFEINE CONSUMPTION IN WOMEN OF REPRODUCTIVE AGE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Estimates of daily caffeine intake vary widely, both worldwide and within individual countries, due to the many significant difficulties in ascertaining caffeine consumption. (See <a href=\"#H8\" class=\"local\">'Quality of existing evidence and methodological considerations'</a> below.) In a study of data from a United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) Survey of Food Intakes by Individuals, caffeine was consumed by 89 percent of women aged 18 to 34 years and their average intake was 164 mg per day [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-effects-of-caffeine-on-reproductive-outcomes-in-women/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. In a study from the United Kingdom, the average daily caffeine intake of women of childbearing age was estimated to be 174 mg per day, with up to 18 percent consuming more than 300 mg per day [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-effects-of-caffeine-on-reproductive-outcomes-in-women/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. A study from Japan reported the mean caffeine intake of women aged 30 to 39 years was 213 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day,</span> and 7 percent consumed more than 400 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-effects-of-caffeine-on-reproductive-outcomes-in-women/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].</p><p>Although most women reduce their caffeine intake during pregnancy, in part because of nausea, pregnant women have been reported to consume an average of 60 to 125 mg of caffeine per day [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-effects-of-caffeine-on-reproductive-outcomes-in-women/abstract/3,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,6</a>], and 10 to 15 percent consumed more than 160 to 200 mg daily [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-effects-of-caffeine-on-reproductive-outcomes-in-women/abstract/6,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,7</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h1\">PHARMACOKINETICS, METABOLISM, AND PHYSIOLOGIC EFFECTS</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">General population</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Caffeine (methylated xanthine 1,3,7-trimethylxantine) is a highly soluble compound that readily crosses cell membranes throughout the body. It is rapidly absorbed in the stomach and small intestine and can be detected in human tissues 30 to 45 minutes after ingestion, with peak blood concentration reached within two hours. Clearance values are 1 to 3 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/kg/min</span> in both men and women after low caffeine intake; however, clearance is diminished with higher doses, largely because of saturable metabolism of caffeine metabolites that accumulate in plasma and reduce caffeine clearance [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-effects-of-caffeine-on-reproductive-outcomes-in-women/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. The volume of distribution of caffeine is 0.7 to 1.3 <span class=\"nowrap\">L/kg</span> and elimination half-life is 4.1 to 6.4 hours.</p><p>Caffeine is metabolized in the liver by the cytochrome P450 family. Cytochrome P450 1A2 (CYP 1A2) is the predominant isoform, accounting for 95 percent of primary caffeine metabolism [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-effects-of-caffeine-on-reproductive-outcomes-in-women/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. CYP 2E1 and CYP 1B1 may also make a minor contribution to the primary metabolism of caffeine [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-effects-of-caffeine-on-reproductive-outcomes-in-women/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p>The primary metabolites of caffeine, paraxanthine (1,7 dimethylxanthine), <a href=\"topic.htm?path=theophylline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">theophylline</a> (1,3 dimethylxanthine) and theobromine (3,7 dimethylxanthine), share many of the biological activities of caffeine and also occur independently in natural products [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-effects-of-caffeine-on-reproductive-outcomes-in-women/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Paraxanthine is the main metabolite in humans and is present in coffee beans; theophylline is a significant xanthine in tea leaves; and theobromine, the weakest of xanthines, is present in cacao beans. Metabolism of these metabolites leads to the formation of monomethylxanthines and methyluracils. Caffeine is excreted by the kidneys, mainly in the form of different metabolites; only 5 to 10 percent is excreted unchanged [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-effects-of-caffeine-on-reproductive-outcomes-in-women/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].</p><p>Caffeine metabolism depends on numerous genetic and environmental factors. Individuals can be classified as slow or fast metabolizers. The factors influencing caffeine metabolism primarily affect CYP 1A2 activity and include cigarette smoking, pregnancy, oral contraceptive use, liver disease, certain medications, genetic polymorphism of CYP 1A2, and ethnicity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-effects-of-caffeine-on-reproductive-outcomes-in-women/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. As an example, smoking accelerates caffeine metabolism and almost doubles its clearance rate via induction of hepatic oxidative enzymes; this results in a two- to three-fold lower median plasma caffeine concentration in smokers than in non-smokers at the same level of caffeine intake [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-effects-of-caffeine-on-reproductive-outcomes-in-women/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. CYP 1A2 activity is higher in adult males than in females; therefore, females, particularly non-smokers, are prone to more prolonged exposure to caffeine.</p><p>Caffeine is a stimulant and is commonly used to enhance mental alertness; however, it has a wide range of physiological effects. Chronic use is often associated with habituation and tolerance, while discontinuation may produce withdrawal symptoms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-effects-of-caffeine-on-reproductive-outcomes-in-women/abstract/1,2,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2,8</a>]. The physiological effects of caffeine in adults are reviewed in detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=benefits-and-risks-of-caffeine-and-caffeinated-beverages\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Benefits and risks of caffeine and caffeinated beverages&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cardiovascular-effects-of-caffeine-and-caffeinated-beverages\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Cardiovascular effects of caffeine and caffeinated beverages&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Maternal and fetal kinetics</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Caffeine and its metabolites readily cross the placenta and can be found in substantial quantities in the amniotic fluid and fetal blood [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-effects-of-caffeine-on-reproductive-outcomes-in-women/abstract/10,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,11</a>]. Maternal caffeine metabolism declines significantly during pregnancy; the half life increases three-fold in the third trimester, reaching a t<sub><span class=\"nowrap\">1/2</span> </sub>of 11.5 to 18 hours. The fetus metabolizes caffeine very slowly, mainly due to immaturity of caffeine-metabolizing hepatic microsome enzymes and lack of CYP 1A2 activity in the placenta. Therefore, even low maternal caffeine consumption can be expected to lead to prolonged fetal caffeine exposure, particularly when the mother is a genetically slow caffeine metabolizer. Infants of smokers have lower umbilical cord blood caffeine concentrations and higher concentrations of caffeine metabolites than infants of non-smokers, reflecting faster caffeine metabolism in smokers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-effects-of-caffeine-on-reproductive-outcomes-in-women/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h1\">QUALITY OF EXISTING EVIDENCE AND METHODOLOGICAL CONSIDERATIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Examining the association between caffeine consumption and adverse reproductive outcomes presents a considerable challenge. The consistency and quality of available data have generally been poor. Most studies have methodological shortcomings and were based on epidemiologic research designs usually classified as level III or low quality evidence (ie, comparative studies with concurrent controls but allocation not randomized, cohort studies, case-control studies, or interrupted time series with a control group) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-effects-of-caffeine-on-reproductive-outcomes-in-women/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. A 2015 systematic review comparing the effects of caffeinated coffee intake with decaffeinated coffee use on pregnancy outcomes concluded there was insufficient evidence to confirm or refute the effect of caffeine avoidance on pregnancy outcomes and neonatal health [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-effects-of-caffeine-on-reproductive-outcomes-in-women/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. </p><p>There are many potential reasons for inconsistent outcomes among studies, including but not limited to [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-effects-of-caffeine-on-reproductive-outcomes-in-women/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]: </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Inaccurate estimation of caffeine consumption</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Recall bias due to retrospective assessment of caffeine intake</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Failure to allow for individual variations in caffeine metabolism</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Inadequate control of confounding factors </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Selection bias</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Chemicals other than caffeine in dietary products, which may contribute to the observed outcome</p><p/><p>Comprehensive reviews of these methodologic issues are available elsewhere [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-effects-of-caffeine-on-reproductive-outcomes-in-women/abstract/1,14,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,14,15</a>], and will be reviewed briefly here. In particular, caffeine consumption is likely to be lower in early than late pregnancy because of early pregnancy nausea [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-effects-of-caffeine-on-reproductive-outcomes-in-women/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. The majority of existent studies primarily capture the short-term effects of caffeine by assessing consumption in the period shortly before the studied reproductive event or in individual trimesters rather than throughout pregnancy, although many health-related conditions are likely to have multifactorial causes and a long natural history. It has been difficult to document the long-term effects of caffeine because many new caffeinated products appear in the marketplace and consumption patterns change as a result of dietary advice from a variety of experts. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h2\">Assessment of caffeine intake</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Assessment of caffeine consumption is methodologically challenging due, in part, to the wide variation of caffeine content in beverages and large differences in serving sizes. The amount of caffeine varies according to source (coffee, tea, chocolate, soft drink), portion size (eg, cup size), brewing method (for coffee and tea), and brand [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-effects-of-caffeine-on-reproductive-outcomes-in-women/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. A standard cup of coffee is often assumed to provide 100 mg of caffeine; however, an analysis of caffeine content of different coffees from various coffee shops revealed variations of 72 to 130 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/cup</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-effects-of-caffeine-on-reproductive-outcomes-in-women/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. For espresso, an analysis of caffeine content reported caffeine content of 200 to 322 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/cup</span> in 20 commercially available espresso products [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-effects-of-caffeine-on-reproductive-outcomes-in-women/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>].</p><p>Coffee is reported as the only source of caffeine in 19 percent of pregnant caffeine consumers, with 26 percent of caffeine intake solely from other non-coffee dietary sources [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-effects-of-caffeine-on-reproductive-outcomes-in-women/abstract/19,20\" class=\"abstract_t\">19,20</a>]. Therefore, using coffee consumption as a proxy for caffeine intake leads to gross underestimation of caffeine consumption. The majority of studies on caffeine and reproductive outcomes neither made a comprehensive analysis of intake of all food, drinks, and drugs containing caffeine, nor carefully accounted for the variation of caffeine content from individual portion size, brand, or preparation method of these foods and drinks.</p><p>Furthermore, most epidemiological studies have relied on self-reported intake of caffeine instead of laboratory assessment of biomarkers. The biomarkers of caffeine exposure (caffeine and its metabolites in blood, urine, and saliva) are of limited use in large population samples, are highly dependent on the timing of the last caffeine intake, and primarily indicate recent consumption rather than long-term exposure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-effects-of-caffeine-on-reproductive-outcomes-in-women/abstract/7,21\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,21</a>].</p><p>Although caffeine is detectable in amniotic fluid and in the nails of exposed newborns, studies have not used these types of assays to monitor in utero caffeine exposure.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h2\">Recall bias</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Recall bias refers to differential recall between cases and controls and is of concern because it distorts the internal validity of studies using self-reported data. It affects studies (both retrospective and prospective) in which assessment of caffeine consumption is determined after, rather than before, the occurrence of the health outcome of interest. Patients who have had an adverse event may be more likely to remember perceived unhealthy habits and associate their consumption of coffee with the adverse event, and thus may overestimate their past caffeine consumption compared with patients who have not experienced an adverse event.</p><p>The importance of recall bias was highlighted by a study that found the correlation between modest caffeine consumption and pregnancy loss disappeared when pregnant women were interviewed about caffeine consumption before, rather than after, they had miscarried [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-effects-of-caffeine-on-reproductive-outcomes-in-women/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h2\">Individual variations in caffeine metabolism</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The clearance rate of caffeine varies among individuals and depends on factors affecting cytochrome P450 enzymes, particularly genetic polymorphisms; smoking; and exposure to other compounds that are metabolized by the same enzyme. As a result, despite equivalent caffeine intake, slow metabolizers have higher caffeine concentrations and may be at higher caffeine-related risk than fast metabolizers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-effects-of-caffeine-on-reproductive-outcomes-in-women/abstract/23,24\" class=\"abstract_t\">23,24</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h2\">Potential confounders of caffeine consumption</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Heavy coffee consumption tends to be strongly associated with increased age, cigarette smoking, alcohol consumption, a less health conscious lifestyle, and lower educational level and household income [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-effects-of-caffeine-on-reproductive-outcomes-in-women/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Other potential confounders include ethnicity, stress, and sleeping pattern. Trying to establish the independent health effects of coffee consumption by adjusting for these potential confounders is difficult and can be inaccurate since their assessment is also affected by measurement error.</p><p>Nausea and other symptoms of a viable early pregnancy are sometimes called the &ldquo;pregnancy signal.&rdquo; A particular concern in studies of the effects of caffeine intake during pregnancy is that pregnancy related nausea is common and an important confounding factor [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-effects-of-caffeine-on-reproductive-outcomes-in-women/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. Nausea in early pregnancy tends to cause dietary changes, such as an aversion to coffee, but is also strongly predictive of fetal survival, presumably because nausea reflects hormonal changes that support continued pregnancy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-effects-of-caffeine-on-reproductive-outcomes-in-women/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. For this reason, there has been a concern that the lower caffeine consumption and more favorable pregnancy prognosis among women with nausea compared with those who do not have nausea result in an artificial positive association between low caffeine consumption and better pregnancy outcome. Well-designed studies of caffeine intake and pregnancy outcome attempt to control for the presence or absence of pregnancy signal symptoms in their subjects.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14\"><span class=\"h2\">Selection bias</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Many of the studies on the effect of caffeine on reproductive adversity are based on data obtained from preconception counseling and prenatal health services. The patients attending these services are likely to be more health conscious, which may be associated with lower coffee consumption and thus lead to selection bias, but this would also tend to reduce the associated odds ratios.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15\"><span class=\"h2\">Other components of caffeinated beverages that may contribute to health effects</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Coffee, tea, and cocoa products contain hundreds of compounds other than caffeine that may contribute to the observed health effects of caffeine consumption [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-effects-of-caffeine-on-reproductive-outcomes-in-women/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. In addition, coffee and black tea are often consumed with a creamer. Non-dairy creamers contain partially hydrogenated oils that, when used in large amounts, could be a significant dietary source of trans fatty acids, which may have independent adverse effects on reproduction. Trans fatty acids may interfere with the desaturation and elongation of n-3 (omega-3) fatty acids. These are important for the prevention of heart disease and possibly some complications of pregnancy. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H16\"><span class=\"h1\">EFFECTS OF CAFFEINE ON REPRODUCTIVE OUTCOMES</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10028135\"><span class=\"h2\">Animal and in vitro studies</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Studies in animals can overcome many of the methodological limitations of studies in humans, but pose additional methodological issues that prevent extrapolation to humans. First, humans are highly unlikely to consume the high doses of caffeine used in animal studies. Second, although many metabolic and pharmacokinetic factors related to caffeine are similar in humans and animals, there is not a direct correlation between teratogenic effects in animals and in humans, and the <span class=\"nowrap\">dose/anomaly</span> relationship may vary between the species. Finally, in some animal studies, caffeine intake is by intravenous or intraperitoneal infusion or gavage feeding, rather than by oral consumption in <span class=\"nowrap\">food/drink</span> over the course of a day, as in humans. This difference may result in different effects in laboratory animals versus humans. Indeed, when animals receive caffeine doses typically consumed by humans, caffeine is not mutagenic, oncogenic, or cytotoxic [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-effects-of-caffeine-on-reproductive-outcomes-in-women/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. However, it is possible that subteratogenic doses of caffeine may have synergistic detrimental effects with other therapeutic agents consumed by pregnant women. </p><p>Some examples of findings from animal studies are summarized below:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In rodents, a teratogenic effect was demonstrated at high caffeine doses (100 to 330 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg);</span> limb deficiencies, cleft palate, and neural tube defects (NTDs) were among the most frequently observed caffeine-induced congenital malformations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-effects-of-caffeine-on-reproductive-outcomes-in-women/abstract/28-31\" class=\"abstract_t\">28-31</a>]. The caffeine-induced NTD phenotype has been demonstrated by others in various animal models [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-effects-of-caffeine-on-reproductive-outcomes-in-women/abstract/32-35\" class=\"abstract_t\">32-35</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Caffeine injected into chicken eggs affected monoamine neurotransmitter synthesis in chick embryos and was not metabolized in embryonic brains, which led to caffeine accumulation and magnification of the adverse effects [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-effects-of-caffeine-on-reproductive-outcomes-in-women/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>]. These changes have been implicated in subsequent neurobehavioral or neurophysiologic deficiencies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-effects-of-caffeine-on-reproductive-outcomes-in-women/abstract/36-38\" class=\"abstract_t\">36-38</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Rodents given a large bolus or parenteral dose of caffeine are at increased risk of growth restriction in pups; however, no effect on birth weight has been observed when large doses of caffeine were consumed over the course of the day in drinking water [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-effects-of-caffeine-on-reproductive-outcomes-in-women/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. Caffeine boluses also delayed conception and decreased placental weight and gain in maternal bodyweight; these effects were dose dependent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-effects-of-caffeine-on-reproductive-outcomes-in-women/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>]. Using a dose-conversion correlation between humans and rats, the lowest dose of caffeine given to pregnant rats and associated with the above effects appeared to be equivalent to 3.2 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> per day in humans, which is equivalent to consumption of 1.5 to 2.2 cups of coffee by a 70 kg woman. </p><p/><p>Several basic research studies have assessed the effect of caffeine on trophoblast biology in vitro and suggested molecular mechanisms for deleterious caffeine effect on pregnancy outcomes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-effects-of-caffeine-on-reproductive-outcomes-in-women/abstract/40-42\" class=\"abstract_t\">40-42</a>].

Excessive coffee consumption was associated with a 50 percent increased risk of hyperactivity-inattention disorder, while excessive tea consumption was associated with a 28 percent increased risk of anxiety-depressive disorders and 24 percent increased risk of any psychiatric disorder. Strengths of the study include the older age of the assessed children and large sample size, while the study is limited by use of maternal self-report of caffeine intake. Of note, anxious mothers tend to consume more caffeine, which in itself creates an inherent selection bias or reverse causation. More work with adjustment to maternal emotional status is required to shed light on effect of caffeine consumption on behavioral disorders in offspring. </p><p/><p>Associations between in utero caffeine exposure and leukemia, testicular cancer, and sudden infant death syndrome in offspring have been evaluated, but the available data are inconclusive [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-effects-of-caffeine-on-reproductive-outcomes-in-women/abstract/117-120\" class=\"abstract_t\">117-120</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H25\"><span class=\"h1\">LACTATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Caffeine is detectable in breast milk within 15 minutes of consumption and levels peak after about one hour.

Caffeine and its metabolites readily cross the placenta and can be found in substantial quantities in the amniotic fluid and fetal blood. Higher maternal plasma caffeine levels appear to be associated with a longer duration of fetal arousal, increased fetal heart rate variability, lower basal fetal heart rate, increased fetal breathing activity, and inconsistent effects on fetal and placental blood flow.
