It is now clear that asthma is a syndrome with many distinct and overlapping phenotypes with severe GC-refractory asthma at one end of a spectrum of GC responsiveness [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mechanisms-and-clinical-implications-of-glucocorticoid-resistance-in-asthma/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Patients with GC-refractory asthma account for a large percentage of the overall costs for asthma worldwide, but also provide unique insights into the mechanisms of GC action. These patients should not be confused with those who either do not take their anti-inflammatory medication or patients who do not have access to the correct treatments [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mechanisms-and-clinical-implications-of-glucocorticoid-resistance-in-asthma/abstract/2,3\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,3</a>]. </p><p>The European Respiratory <span class=\"nowrap\">Society/American</span> Thoracic Society <span class=\"nowrap\">(ERS/ATS)</span> and the Global Initiative for Asthma (GINA) guidelines provide pragmatic approaches to treatment strategy for severe asthma based on patient stratification and expert opinion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mechanisms-and-clinical-implications-of-glucocorticoid-resistance-in-asthma/abstract/1,2,4\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2,4</a>].</p><p>The basic mechanisms of glucocorticoid resistance in asthma and clinical implications for diagnosis and management of severe asthma will be reviewed here.

A larger subset of patients with asthma that is poorly-controlled despite optimal treatment or who experience worsening of asthma control during GC withdrawal have severe asthma and are considered relatively GC-insensitive [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mechanisms-and-clinical-implications-of-glucocorticoid-resistance-in-asthma/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].

The induction or repression of target genes ultimately results in the altered expression of GC-regulated proteins, such as increased transcription of antiinflammatory genes such as the cytokine interleukin (IL)-10 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mechanisms-and-clinical-implications-of-glucocorticoid-resistance-in-asthma/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>GC-induced gene transcription is associated with changes in chromatin structure as evidenced by enhanced acetylation of core histones around which DNA is wound. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Administration of glucocorticoids, systemically or through inhalation, results in a significant increase in systemic or local IL-10 synthesis, respectively.

As the preceding section implies, modulation of GC activity theoretically could occur through changes in binding kinetics of the cytosolic or nuclear receptors, or through alterations in the interactions with other transcription factors. Defects in most aspects of intracellular glucocorticoid receptor (GR) activity, such as binding of GCs to GR and nuclear translocation of GC-GR complex, have been implicated as being defective in patients with severe asthma. However, is it likely that the major mechanisms for GC resistance occur distal to the nuclear translocation step, such as in splicing of RNA, cytokine expression, binding to GC response elements on DNA, and interactions of the GC-GR complex with other nucleoproteins. Thus far, GC resistance in asthma <strong>cannot</strong> be explained by malabsorption or pharmacokinetic mechanisms. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H913131512\"><span class=\"h2\">Genetic determinants</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There are few data addressing whether GC insensitivity is genetically determined although genome-wide association studies indicate other genetic links to severe asthma (eg, ORMDL3, interleukin [IL]-1RL1) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mechanisms-and-clinical-implications-of-glucocorticoid-resistance-in-asthma/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. Given the marked variability in the dose of glucocorticoids needed to inhibit T-cell proliferative responses in normal individuals, it is possible that there are genetic determinants of glucocorticoid responsiveness that only become manifest clinically with the development of a disease process requiring GC therapy. For example, in a study in 451 subjects, no significant differences in the frequency of Tth111I, BclI, and <span class=\"nowrap\">ER22/23EK</span> polymorphisms of the GC receptor gene were observed when comparing across severity alone [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mechanisms-and-clinical-implications-of-glucocorticoid-resistance-in-asthma/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. However, a significant correlation was noted between the Tth111I polymorphism in severe asthmatics with an Asthma Control Test (ACT) score &ge;20.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Altered splicing of GC receptor pre-messenger RNA</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Alternative splicing of GR RNA can produce C-terminal isoforms termed GC receptor-alpha (GRalpha) and GC receptor-beta (GRbeta) along with several N-terminal truncated isoforms of both GRalpha and GRbeta [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mechanisms-and-clinical-implications-of-glucocorticoid-resistance-in-asthma/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. These isoforms appear to contribute to GC-resistance in severe asthma, although conflicting effects have been reported. The expression of GRbeta is significantly increased in some patients with GC-resistant asthma and may contribute to GC resistance via several mechanisms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mechanisms-and-clinical-implications-of-glucocorticoid-resistance-in-asthma/abstract/16,17\" class=\"abstract_t\">16,17</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>GRbeta cannot bind GCs; thus, it cannot form a normal GC receptor complex.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>GRbeta impairs nuclear translocation of the normal GC receptor complex [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mechanisms-and-clinical-implications-of-glucocorticoid-resistance-in-asthma/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>GRbeta binds DNA and blocks transcriptional activation by the normal GC receptor complex [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mechanisms-and-clinical-implications-of-glucocorticoid-resistance-in-asthma/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>].</p><p/><p>However, GRbeta does not always act as a dominant-negative inhibitor of GRalpha. In an in vitro study, GRalpha (which can bind cortisol) and GRbeta acted in a similar manner, repressing transcription of IL-5 and IL-13 genes through recruitment of histone deacetylase (HDAC) complexes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mechanisms-and-clinical-implications-of-glucocorticoid-resistance-in-asthma/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>].

Instead, GRbeta overexpression decreases TNF-alpha-induced histone H4 acetylation at the IL-8 promoter site possibly through an effect on HDAC expression and activity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mechanisms-and-clinical-implications-of-glucocorticoid-resistance-in-asthma/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>].</p><p>GC treatment increases the expression of GRbeta in inflammatory cells, suggesting that GC treatment may induce GC resistance over time by altering the relative production of GR isoforms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mechanisms-and-clinical-implications-of-glucocorticoid-resistance-in-asthma/abstract/22,23\" class=\"abstract_t\">22,23</a>]. Autopsies of patients who suffered fatal asthma have revealed increased expression of GRbeta, although it is uncertain if this is due to GC treatment or if GRbeta causes severe asthma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mechanisms-and-clinical-implications-of-glucocorticoid-resistance-in-asthma/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>].

An increase in the basal levels of AP-1 DNA binding was also detected in the nuclei from patients with GC-resistant asthma.

Many of these eQTLs reside in regulatory elements of genes enriched in the Th2 lymphocyte and IL-33 immune responses, for example, in a cell-specific manner.

Several large groups such as the Severe Asthma Research Program (SARP) and Unbiased BIOmarkers in PREDiction of respiratory disease outcomes (U-BIOPRED), as well as individual centers, have been instrumental in defining these subgroups of asthma and severe asthma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mechanisms-and-clinical-implications-of-glucocorticoid-resistance-in-asthma/abstract/85\" class=\"abstract_t\">85</a>].

As an example, a high Th2 cytokine profile along with high circulating levels of periostin has been used to define asthmatic patients who will respond to GCs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mechanisms-and-clinical-implications-of-glucocorticoid-resistance-in-asthma/abstract/86\" class=\"abstract_t\">86</a>]. High serum and airway periostin levels are characteristic of the Th2 high group of asthmatic subjects and are a good predictor of airway eosinophilia in patients with severe asthma who remain symptomatic despite maximal ICS therapy. These biomarkers may define a group of patients who would respond to anti-IL-13 or anti-IL-4 receptor approaches [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mechanisms-and-clinical-implications-of-glucocorticoid-resistance-in-asthma/abstract/88\" class=\"abstract_t\">88</a>].

(See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Definition'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In patients with GC-resistant asthma, the function of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis appears normal. Serum cortisol measurements and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dexamethasone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">dexamethasone</a> suppression responses are normal, and GC-induced side-effects are a major issue. (See <a href=\"#H9\" class=\"local\">'Clinical features'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>GC resistance in asthma <strong>cannot</strong> be explained by malabsorption or pharmacokinetic mechanisms. Defects in GC-glucocorticoid receptor (GR) binding, GR nuclear translocation, and intranuclear actions of GR have all been proposed as major mechanisms for GC resistance (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F67246\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef67246 \">figure 1</a>). (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Mechanisms of glucocorticoid action'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The exact mechanism of GC resistance in asthma is not known. Possible mechanisms include altered splicing of the GR pre-messenger RNA, altered pro-inflammatory cytokine expression, a reduced number of GRs, and epigenetic changes. (See <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Mechanisms of glucocorticoid resistance'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Among patients who require high dose inhaled glucocorticoids or chronic oral glucocorticoids to maintain asthma control, approximately 50 percent have persistent airflow limitation and 69 percent have sputum eosinophilia (defined as &ge;2 percent eosinophils). While the cutaneous vasoconstrictor response to topical glucocorticoid is significantly reduced, other tissues (eg, adrenal, bone) do not appear to have an abnormal GC response. (See <a href=\"#H9\" class=\"local\">'Clinical features'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients with severe asthma who require oral GCs to achieve asthma control or whose asthma remains poorly-controlled despite oral GCs should be evaluated following guidelines for severe asthma to exclude alternative diagnoses, comorbid diseases, and confounding issues that may exacerbate asthma. As GC-resistance is almost always relative and does not clearly affect the treatment approach, specific testing to establish GC-insensitivity is not needed. (See <a href=\"#H3656784489\" class=\"local\">'Evaluation'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The optimal treatment for GC-resistant asthma is not known. Treatment strategies may include use of higher doses of systemic GCs for a longer duration using a pulsed approach, and optimization of non-GC agents (eg, beta-adrenergic agonists, anticholinergic agents, antileukotriene agents, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=omalizumab-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">omalizumab</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=mepolizumab-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">mepolizumab</a>) and nonpharmacologic therapies (eg, trigger avoidance and possibly bronchial thermoplasty).

Biomarkers of adherence to therapy, eosinophilic and noneosinophilic phenotypes of severe asthma, and predictors of response to novel therapeutic agents are needed.
