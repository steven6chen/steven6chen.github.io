A child may be at a different level of competency for each domain of literacy.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Literacy acquisition begins when children learn to recognize letters as unique patterns and comprehend that print, not pictures, carries the message. Next, children become aware that letters provide clues for reading, and they may recognize some words. During the third stage of literacy development, children realize sounds are determined by letters and words are created by putting sounds together. In the most advanced phase of development, children begin to immediately recognize morphemic parts of words [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/emergent-literacy-including-language-development/abstract/2,3,6,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,3,6,7</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The acquisition of literacy requires not only competent oral language skills, but an understanding of the relationship between oral and written language [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/emergent-literacy-including-language-development/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. Literacy and language are related in important ways. Both occur in a social context for the purpose of communication. Characteristics of parent-child interactions that support language acquisition also facilitate early reading and writing development. Oral language competence is highly correlated with success in learning to read [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/emergent-literacy-including-language-development/abstract/2,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,9</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Environment</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A child's early literacy environment plays a critical role in the emergence of literacy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/emergent-literacy-including-language-development/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. Young children learn many important concepts about reading before going to school [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/emergent-literacy-including-language-development/abstract/6,11-13\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,11-13</a>]. Their early experience with books and reading contributes to their later success or failure in learning to read [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/emergent-literacy-including-language-development/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>].</p><p>Children enter school with different knowledge levels and learn to read at different rates. Those who enter school with the least knowledge of beginning reading skills are at academic risk [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/emergent-literacy-including-language-development/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. The United States Department of Education's February 2000 report states that America's kindergartners who are living in poverty, from single-parent homes and non-English-speaking families, and have parents who did not finish high school have fewer early reading and math skills, exhibit more problem behaviors, and are less healthy than their peers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/emergent-literacy-including-language-development/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>].

Parents in families who are involved in clinic-based literacy promotion projects (eg, Beginning with Books or Reach Out and Read) are more likely to read regularly to their children and to describe reading as a favorite parent-child activity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/emergent-literacy-including-language-development/abstract/24-27\" class=\"abstract_t\">24-27</a>]. The frequency of parent-child book sharing in first-generation Hispanic immigrant families also is related directly to parental reports that they read frequently to themselves [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/emergent-literacy-including-language-development/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>].</p><p>The reports of the effects of clinic-based literacy programs on language and literacy development vary slightly [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/emergent-literacy-including-language-development/abstract/29-32\" class=\"abstract_t\">29-32</a>]. However, most studies demonstrate an increase in the expressive and receptive language scores of children who received books and whose parents received modeling and encouragement to read aloud during health maintenance visits. Children in prekindergarten classes who were given books and encouraged to share them with their parents had greater word knowledge, spelling, and story-reading ability at the end of kindergarten than did those who did not receive books [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/emergent-literacy-including-language-development/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. In addition, fewer of the children who were given books were in low reading groups at the end of first grade.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Quality</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In addition to the frequency of early literacy experiences, the quality of the parent-child interaction and the child's environment affect literacy development [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/emergent-literacy-including-language-development/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. Children need access to a variety of reading materials and need to observe diverse, developmentally appropriate literate behaviors to achieve their literacy potential. As Marilyn Jager Adams states, &quot;it is not just reading to children that makes the difference, it is enjoying the books with them and reflecting on their form and content&quot; [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/emergent-literacy-including-language-development/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>].</p><p>Considerable interaction exists between adult reading style and the child's skill level. Various reading styles benefit different literacy skills depending upon the child's level of development. A lower-demand reading style (describing and labeling) may be most appropriate for advancing vocabulary development with younger or less skilled learners, whereas a higher-demand, uninterrupted style (discussion before and after the story) may be most beneficial for older or more advanced children [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/emergent-literacy-including-language-development/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>].</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In observational studies, parents do alter the interactional style of reading depending upon the child's level of communicative competence [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/emergent-literacy-including-language-development/abstract/35,36\" class=\"abstract_t\">35,36</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Children whose parents were instructed to increase open-ended questions, expand on replies, and encourage discussions of function and attributes had higher expressive language scores and longer mean utterance than did children whose parents did not receive this intervention [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/emergent-literacy-including-language-development/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The type of book that is read affects the teaching strategy of parents; greater participation from mothers and children is elicited when expository books (collections of pictures or labels), rather than narrative books (stories), are read [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/emergent-literacy-including-language-development/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h2\">Demographics</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Researchers have reported variable effects of socioeconomic status, ethnicity, and parental education on emergent literacy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/emergent-literacy-including-language-development/abstract/10,13,38-40\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,13,38-40</a>].</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Some researchers report that low socioeconomic, minority, and less educated parents may be adequate teachers for their child's present level of development but less sensitive to the changing needs and capabilities of their children [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/emergent-literacy-including-language-development/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>] and less able to foster the acquisition of prereading skills [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/emergent-literacy-including-language-development/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>].

Bilangual books enhance bilingual language development for the child, improve English as a second language for the parents, and demonstrate respect across cultures and the value of traditions.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H24\"><span class=\"h1\">SUGGESTIONS FOR PARENTS</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Speak slowly and succinctly</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Label objects</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Repeat, repeat, repeat</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Ask open-ended questions</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Expand on the child's conversation</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Correct positively &ndash; Rephrase, repeat, relabel</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Use interactive games and humor</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Encourage your child</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Tell stories to each other</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Limit television viewing time</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Visit the library regularly</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Dialogue your activities: tell your child about what you are doing, even if it is baking a cake</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Read every day [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/emergent-literacy-including-language-development/abstract/64\" class=\"abstract_t\">64</a>]</p><p/><p>The American Academy of Pediatrics has developed a <a href=\"http://www.aap.org/en-us/advocacy-and-policy/aap-health-initiatives/Literacy-Toolkit/Pages/Toolkit.aspx&amp;token=fsPcGpW6+iYdo99n2xFWf93DK42SfYbqoVcVHPB0YFj6Hi8PklyE4njSaMrQH3JNh89g3G0ThN+ZuOEsF7l3VjZJlmuuoFvbvtdPEHGmmky+tFfyStA7m/bmkKcHZybB&amp;TOPIC_ID=617\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">Literacy Toolkit</a> that includes information for parents about selecting books and sharing books with children of various ages and a policy statement for literacy promotion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/emergent-literacy-including-language-development/abstract/64\" class=\"abstract_t\">64</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H184273897\"><span class=\"h1\">SUMMARY</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Communication has verbal and nonverbal domains. Verbal communication includes receptive language, expressive language, and linguistics. Nonverbal communication includes body language, gestures, and signing. (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Domains of communications'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The development of language and literacy occurs along a continuum that has a hierarchy of stages, including the acquisition of oral language, reading, writing, and spelling skills (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F78646\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef78646 \">figure 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F72624\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef72624 \">table 1</a>). The development of literacy requires competent oral language skills and an understanding of the relationship between oral and written language. Oral language competence is highly correlated with success in learning to read. (See <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Literature review'</a> above and <a href=\"#H10\" class=\"local\">'Normal language development'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A child's early literacy environment plays a critical role in the emergence of literacy. Early experience with books and reading contributes to subsequent success or failure in learning to read. (See <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'Environment'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The frequency of early literacy experiences, including listening to stories, in preschoolers is directly associated with oral language skills, reading comprehension, and reading achievement. The frequency of parent-child reading increases when parents receive books and encouragement to read at health supervision visits. (See <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'Frequency'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>There are a number of things that parents can do to promote their child's early language and literacy development. These include speaking slowly and succinctly, asking open-ended questions, expanding on the child's conversation, telling stories to each other, limiting television time, visiting the library, telling the child what they are doing, and reading every day. (See <a href=\"#H24\" class=\"local\">'Suggestions for parents'</a> above.)</p></div><div id=\"topicAgreement\">Use of UpToDate is subject to the <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/legal/license\" class=\"licenseLink\" id=\"sla_in_page\">Subscription and License Agreement</a>.</div><div id=\"references\" class=\"headingAnchor\"><h1>REFERENCES</h1><ol id=\"reference\"><li class=\"breakAll\">Teale W, Sulzby E.
