They are derivatives of the older macrolide antibiotic, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=erythromycin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">erythromycin</a>. Structural modifications of erythromycin cause a change in the spectrum of activity, dosing, and administration of the newer macrolides and ketolides. <a href=\"topic.htm?path=telithromycin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Telithromycin</a> (Ketek) is the first member of the ketolide class of antimicrobials, which is related to the macrolide class. Concerns about postmarketing reports of hepatotoxicity and exacerbations of myasthenia gravis have led to significant restrictions on the use of telithromycin. (See <a href=\"#H12\" class=\"local\">'Warnings about telithromycin'</a> below.)</p><p>The spectrum of activity, mechanisms of action and resistance, pharmacokinetics, interactions with other drugs, and adverse effects of these newer macrolide antibiotics will be reviewed here.

For this reason, azithromycin is more precisely referred to as an azalide rather than a macrolide [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/azithromycin-clarithromycin-and-telithromycin/abstract/2-4\" class=\"abstract_t\">2-4</a>].</p><p>These structural changes have made the newer macrolides more acid stable than <a href=\"topic.htm?path=erythromycin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">erythromycin</a>, providing improved oral absorption, tolerance, and pharmacokinetic properties. The newer macrolides also have a broader spectrum of antibacterial activity than erythromycin [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/azithromycin-clarithromycin-and-telithromycin/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>].</p><p>The ketolide, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=telithromycin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">telithromycin</a>, was designed to specifically target macrolide-resistant respiratory tract pathogens. It has a keto group substituted for the L-cladinose at C3, a methoxy group at C6, and an N-substituted carbamate at <span class=\"nowrap\">C11/C12</span>.

Despite the fact that clarithromycin's 14-hydroxy metabolite has activity against <em>H. influenzae</em>, in one study, only 63 percent of <em>H. influenzae</em> isolates were susceptible to clarithromycin, whereas 96 percent were susceptible to azithromycin [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/azithromycin-clarithromycin-and-telithromycin/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. For this reason, azithromycin is preferred over clarithromycin in outpatients with community-acquired pneumonia who have comorbidities, such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/azithromycin-clarithromycin-and-telithromycin/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. <a href=\"topic.htm?path=erythromycin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Erythromycin</a> does not have activity against <em>H. influenzae</em>.

As with resistance to other drugs, antibiotic use has been associated with development of resistance. This relationship was directly demonstrated in a randomized double-blind trial in which 224 healthy volunteers were assigned to <a href=\"topic.htm?path=azithromycin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">azithromycin</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clarithromycin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">clarithromycin</a>, or placebo; the end point was the development of pharyngeal carriage of macrolide-resistant streptococci [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/azithromycin-clarithromycin-and-telithromycin/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. The proportion of macrolide-resistant streptococci was 26 to 30 percent at baseline. Both macrolides significantly increased the proportion of macrolide-resistant streptococci compared with placebo, peaking at day 4 to 8, with a mean increase of about 50 percent (to an absolute proportion of over 80 percent) compared with a 4 percent increase with placebo. The increase in resistance was greater with azithromycin, a possible reflection of its much longer half-life. Clarithromycin resistance among <em>Mycobacterium avium</em> complex and <em>Mycobacterium abscessus</em> has also been reported [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/azithromycin-clarithromycin-and-telithromycin/abstract/9,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,10</a>].</p><p>Two main mechanisms of acquired macrolide resistance have been described [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/azithromycin-clarithromycin-and-telithromycin/abstract/11-13\" class=\"abstract_t\">11-13</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Methylases encoded by the <em>erm</em> (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=erythromycin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">erythromycin</a> ribosome methylase) genes (<em>ermA</em>, <em>ermB</em>, <em>ermC</em>) alter the macrolide-binding site on the bacterial ribosomal RNA, usually conferring a high degree of macrolide resistance [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/azithromycin-clarithromycin-and-telithromycin/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>].

In contrast with the mechanisms of acquired resistance, intrinsic resistance exhibited by Enterobacteriaceae, <em>Pseudomonas</em> spp, and <em>Acinetobacter</em> spp is due to decreased permeability of the outer cell envelope. Resistance to macrolides due to mutation of native chromosomal genes is uncommon because many bacteria have multiple copies of the ribosomal RNA genes that encode the macrolide-binding sites on the ribosome, and mutations of multiple gene copies are infrequent. Mycobacteria are an exception. Because they have a single chromosomal copy of the ribosomal RNA gene, selection of mutational resistance can occur readily.</p><p>Mechanisms of resistance to <a href=\"topic.htm?path=azithromycin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">azithromycin</a> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clarithromycin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">clarithromycin</a> are the same as or similar to those of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=erythromycin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">erythromycin</a>. There is complete cross-resistance between erythromycin, azithromycin, and clarithromycin for gram-positive organisms by the alteration in ribosomal RNA mechanism. In contrast, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=telithromycin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">telithromycin</a> binds to the ribosome at two sites, making resistance to telithromycin by this mechanism uncommon. As a result, telithromycin is active against many erythromycin-resistant respiratory pathogens. However, resistance due to ketolide efflux pumps can cause resistance to telithromycin [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/azithromycin-clarithromycin-and-telithromycin/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. Telithromycin-resistant isolates have been isolated in vitro, and a case report has documented a telithromycin-resistant <em>S. pneumoniae</em> isolate recovered from blood following telithromycin treatment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/azithromycin-clarithromycin-and-telithromycin/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>].</p><p>Despite relatively high rates of in vitro macrolide-resistant <em>S. pneumoniae</em>, studies of hospitalized patients with community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) have shown improved outcomes when macrolides are included in combination antibiotic regimens. Macrolides have immunomodulatory and anti-inflammatory effects that reduce interleukin-8 and tumor necrosis factor-alpha, which may in part explain the benefit [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/azithromycin-clarithromycin-and-telithromycin/abstract/20-22\" class=\"abstract_t\">20-22</a>].
