Children with type 1 diabetes (or &quot;type 1 diabetes mellitus&quot;) need to take insulin as a medicine to lower their body's blood sugar level.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2056301\"><span class=\"h1\">Are there different types of insulin?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Yes. Some types of insulin start working faster than others or last for a longer amount of time. Your child will need different types of insulin each day. That way, his or her body can have the right amount of insulin all day and night.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2056316\"><span class=\"h1\">How many times a day does my child need insulin?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>It depends on your child's treatment plan. Your child will need insulin doses at different times of the day, including before he or she eats meals and snacks.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2056331\"><span class=\"h1\">How much insulin should I use?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>For some doses, your child's doctor or nurse will tell you how much insulin to give your child. For other doses, you will need to figure out the amount of insulin to give to your child. The amount of insulin will depend on:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>What your child will eat at the next meal</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>How much exercise your child plans to do</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>What your child's blood sugar level is</p><p/><p>You will need to change your child's insulin dose at certain times, such as when:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Your child gets sick or has surgery</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>You travel or your child's routine changes</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Your child grows older and gets bigger</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Your child does certain activities, such as camps or sports</p><p/><p>Your child's doctor or nurse will tell you how to change the insulin dose during these times.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2056346\"><span class=\"h1\">How do I give my child insulin?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Insulin comes in different forms. The best form for your child depends on his or her situation. Your child's doctor will help you figure out which form to use.</p><p>Many children get insulin as a shot (called an &quot;injection&quot;). When your child is young, you will need to give him or her insulin shots. When your child gets older, he or she can learn to give the insulin shots.</p><p>Your child's doctor or nurse will teach you how to give your child an insulin shot. You will need to use a needle and syringe to draw up the right amount of insulin from a small bottle. Then you:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Choose a part of the body &ndash; You can give insulin shots in different parts of the body (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F57381\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef57381 \">figure 1</a>). It's best to change the part of the body each time you give the shot.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Clean that area, if your doctor or nurse recommends it. Some people use an alcohol wipe.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pinch up some skin and quickly insert the needle (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F80789\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef80789 \">figure 2</a>).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Push the plunger down all the way and then count to 5.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Let go of the skin and remove the needle.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Throw out the used needle and syringe in a container that is made for used needles &ndash; Do not throw out used needles and syringes in the regular trash.</p><p/><p>Instead of a needle and syringe, some children get insulin in a different form:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>An insulin pump &ndash; An insulin pump is a device that slowly delivers insulin to the body. The insulin goes from the pump, through a thin tube, and into the body through a tiny needle put under the skin. Insulin pumps work by giving small doses of fast-acting insulin throughout the day and night. Before meals and snacks, you or your child can use the pump to give extra insulin (called a &quot;meal bolus&quot;).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A &quot;pen injector&quot; &ndash; A pen injector is a device that looks like a pen and has insulin in it. A pen injector uses a new needle for each insulin dose. The steps for using a pen injector are very similar to the steps for using a needle and syringe.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2056361\"><span class=\"h1\">How do I know if I'm giving my child the right amount of insulin?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>To know if you are giving your child the right amount of insulin, you can check your child's blood sugar level.</p><p>If you use too much insulin, your child's blood sugar level can get too low. If you don't use enough insulin, your child's blood sugar level can get too high. Levels that are too low or too high can cause serious problems.</p><p>Checking your child's blood sugar level can also help you choose your child's next insulin dose. To check your child's blood sugar level, you can use a device called a &quot;blood glucose meter.&quot; Your child's doctor or nurse will show you how to use it.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2056376\"><span class=\"h1\">More on this topic</span></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=type-1-diabetes-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Type 1 diabetes (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=checking-your-childs-blood-sugar-level-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Checking your child's blood sugar level (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=keeping-your-childs-blood-sugar-under-control-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Keeping your child's blood sugar under control (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=carb-counting-for-children-with-diabetes-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Carb counting for children with diabetes (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=managing-diabetes-in-school-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Managing diabetes in school (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=the-abcs-of-diabetes-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: The ABCs of diabetes (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=using-insulin-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Using insulin (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=should-i-switch-to-an-insulin-pump-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Should I switch to an insulin pump?
