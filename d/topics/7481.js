Awareness of frailty and associated risks for adverse outcomes, and an understanding of its biological basis, can improve care for this most vulnerable subset of patients.</p><p>Frailty is most often defined as a syndrome of physiological decline in late life, characterized by marked vulnerability to adverse health outcomes. Frail older adults are less able to adapt to stressors such as acute illness or trauma than younger or non-frail older adults. This increased vulnerability contributes to increased risk for multiple adverse outcomes, including procedural complications, falls, institutionalization, disability, and death [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/frailty/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Increasingly, frailty in older patients is considered the hallmark geriatric syndrome and a forerunner to many other geriatric syndromes, including falls, fractures, delirium, and incontinence.</p><p>Importantly, old age itself does not define frailty. Some patients remain vigorous, despite advanced age, while others have gradual yet unrelenting functional decline in the absence of apparent disease states, or failure to rebound following illness or hospitalization.</p><p>Although there is no gold standard for detecting frailty in older adults, multiple frailty screening tools have been developed and utilized for risk assessment and epidemiologic study. These tools have mostly been utilized to identify older adults at high risk of adverse outcomes in a variety of clinical settings. Clinicians from a variety of disciplines are utilizing frailty status to identify patients at highest risk of adverse outcomes related to procedures and interventions, and working towards safer interventions.</p><p>This topic will review the definition, pathophysiology, epidemiology, and diagnosis of frailty and present a clinical approach that may attenuate vulnerability and relieve symptoms.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H573088821\"><span class=\"h1\">EPIDEMIOLOGY AND PROGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Many epidemiologic studies of frailty have been performed using a variety of frailty measures. Not surprisingly, the prevalence of frailty varies with the tool used to define frailty and with the population studied, but prevalence in several studies in the United States ranges from 4 to 16 percent in men and women aged 65 and older [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/frailty/abstract/2-6\" class=\"abstract_t\">2-6</a>] and 43 percent of older patients with cancer [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/frailty/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. Pre-frailty (patients at risk for frailty who fulfill some, not but all, criteria for frailty) has a prevalence ranging from 28 to 44 percent in several studies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/frailty/abstract/2,5,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,5,6</a>].</p><p>A systematic review found that when frailty was defined on the basis of physical findings alone, overall prevalence in 15 studies (44,894 participants) was 9.9 percent; when psychosocial aspects were included in the definition, prevalence was 13.6 percent among eight studies (24,072 participants) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/frailty/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. In a European study (the Survey of Health, Ageing, and Retirement in Europe [SHARE]) comparing eight frailty scales, frailty prevalence ranged from 6 to 44 percent when applied to a database of individuals aged 50 to 104 years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/frailty/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. In a US study of people aged 90 and older, the prevalence of frailty was 24 percent for those aged 90 to 94 and 39.5 percent for those 95 and older [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/frailty/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>].</p><p>Factors associated with an increased prevalence of frailty include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Older age [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/frailty/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Lower educational level [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/frailty/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Current smoker [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/frailty/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Current use of postmenopausal hormone therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/frailty/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a United States sample, African-American or Hispanic ethnicity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/frailty/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Not married [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/frailty/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Depression, or use of antidepressants [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/frailty/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Intellectual disability [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/frailty/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]</p><p/><p>In a study in the United States of nearly 6000 community-dwelling men aged 65 and older, at an average follow-up of 4.6 years, 54.4 percent of men who were robust at baseline remained robust, 25.3 percent became pre-frail, and 1.6 percent became frail (5.7 percent died and the remainder could not be assessed) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/frailty/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].</p><p>Frailty is associated with increased mortality risk, with varying hazard ratios (HR) depending on frailty definitions and populations. In the longitudinal Women's Health Initiative Observational Study, mortality was increased in those with baseline frailty (HR 1.71; 95% CI 1.48-1.97) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/frailty/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. In a study in men, mortality was twice as high for frail, compared with robust, men (HR 2.05; 95% CI 1.55-2.72) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/frailty/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. In a European study, mortality was best predicted by the Frailty Index and Edmonton scales, with death rates three to five times higher in cases classified as frail compared with those not classified as frail [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/frailty/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].</p><p>After adjustment for comorbidities, frailty predicted hip fractures, disability, and hospitalization [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/frailty/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. Frailty also predicted adverse outcomes related to renal transplantation, general surgery (elective and emergency), and cardiac surgery interventions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/frailty/abstract/14-17\" class=\"abstract_t\">14-17</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">CONCEPTS AND DEFINITIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>It is generally recognized that the term &quot;frailty&quot; captures the essence of age-related vulnerability and decline, and that it can be useful in clinical practice [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/frailty/abstract/18,19\" class=\"abstract_t\">18,19</a>]. Consensus conference participants have concluded that frailty is a medical syndrome with multiple causes and contributors, characterized by diminished strength and endurance and reduced physiological function, leading to increased vulnerability for adverse health outcomes such as functional decline and early mortality.</p><p>However, acceptance of a standardized definition for frailty in clinical practice has been slowed in part by a proliferation of frailty measurement tools with differing conceptual bases and that often fail to differentiate between disability, comorbidity, and frailty. A summary of conceptual commonalities includes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/frailty/abstract/18-21\" class=\"abstract_t\">18-21</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Multiple factors (medical, environmental, educational, and psychological background) impact frailty, functional status and physiologic reserve among older adults.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Age, chronic comorbidities, and disability, while associated with frailty, do not establish the diagnosis of frailty [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/frailty/abstract/2,21-23\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,21-23</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Frailty exists on a spectrum. The end stage of the continuum of frailty is often considered to be failure to thrive.

Many have been validated in their ability to identify those individuals at highest risk for adverse health outcomes in a variety of clinical settings. Efforts are increasing to incorporate frailty measurement tools into both subspecialty and primary care practices [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/frailty/abstract/24,25\" class=\"abstract_t\">24,25</a>]. </p><p>A 2016 comprehensive review of the most frequently cited frailty measurement tools identified 67 different frailty instruments, capturing varying domains and criteria depending upon the intended use of the instrument [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/frailty/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. A subsequent study found a wide range of agreement among these instruments when tested in the same population, ranging from virtually no agreement to almost complete agreement [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/frailty/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>].</p><p>Most tools have been developed around the conceptualization of physical or syndromic frailty, and the most commonly utilized physical frailty screening tools do not incorporate cognitive assessment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/frailty/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. However, in a 2011 systematic review of 22 articles addressing the definition of frailty, commonly used measurements for frailty screening were physical function, gait speed, and cognition [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/frailty/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>].</p><p>The majority of screening tools used to determine frailty status have been developed based upon one of two concepts: &quot;physical&quot; or &quot;phenotypic&quot; frailty versus &quot;deficit accumulation&quot; or &quot;index&quot; frailty [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/frailty/abstract/24,29,30\" class=\"abstract_t\">24,29,30</a>]. Physical or phenotypic frailty is thought to result from multisystem biological decline leading to specific symptoms such as weight loss, weakness, and walking speed. Deficit accumulation or index frailty is the combination of comorbidities, social situations, and disabilities (rather than a specific biology per se) that are summed to assess risk.</p><p>The most commonly cited frailty screening tool is the Physical Frailty Phenotype (also known as the Fried or Hopkins Frailty Phenotype) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/frailty/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. This tool was developed based on observations of progressive weakness and declines in activity in older adults most vulnerable to adverse outcomes and has been validated in the Cardiovascular Health Study (CHS), involving over 5000 men and women aged &ge;65 years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/frailty/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>], as well as multiple other studies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/frailty/abstract/14,15,31,32\" class=\"abstract_t\">14,15,31,32</a>]. Because it requires measurement of grip strength and walking speed, it requires patient participation and specialized equipment for grip strength measurement.</p><p>The tool defines the frailty phenotype as meeting three or more of the following five criteria [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/frailty/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].

It requires answering 20 or more medical and functional-related questions. The higher the number of deficits, the higher the frailty score. The tool can be adapted to information available in the medical record and does not require a patient interview or exam to assess frailty.</p><p>Although the frailty phenotype assessment and the frailty index approach are the most commonly cited approaches to frailty measurement, clinicians and patients may benefit from using a quicker frailty screening assessment tool. A tool that takes only minutes to perform, and can be incorporated into the history-taking part, is the FRAIL scale. The mnemonic &quot;FRAIL&quot; is helpful in remembering the component questions listed below [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/frailty/abstract/34,35\" class=\"abstract_t\">34,35</a>].</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>F</strong>atigue (&quot;Are you fatigued?&quot;)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>R</strong>esistance (&quot;Can you climb one flight of stairs?&quot;)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>A</strong>mbulation (&quot;Can you walk one block?&quot;)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>I</strong>llnesses (greater than five)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>L</strong>oss of weight (greater than 5 percent)</p><p/><p>&quot;Yes&quot; to three or more questions indicates frailty. &quot;Yes&quot; to one or two questions indicates pre-frailty.</p><p>Another assessment tool known for its ease in administering in most clinical settings is The Study of Osteoporotic Fractures (SOF) frailty tool [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/frailty/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>]. Frailty is defined as the presence of at least two of three components:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Weight loss of 5 percent in last year;</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Inability to rise from a chair five times without use of arms; or</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A &quot;no&quot; response to the question &quot;Do you feel full of energy?&quot;</p><p/><p>Finally, the Clinical Frailty Scale is a rapid frailty screening tool that is scored between 1 (very fit) and 7 (severely frail) based on self-report of comorbidities and the need for help with activities of daily living (ADLs) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/frailty/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>]. This and other rapid screening tools can be utilized to identify those who might need a more formal comprehensive geriatric assessment (CGA) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/frailty/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>].</p><p>Several studies have compared the most commonly utilized screening tools and found that these indices were comparable in predicting risk of adverse health outcomes and mortality [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/frailty/abstract/3,36,39\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,36,39</a>].</p><p>Frailty is associated with an increased risk of mild cognitive impairment and an increased rate of cognitive decline with aging [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/frailty/abstract/40,41\" class=\"abstract_t\">40,41</a>]. Conversely, the presence of cognitive impairment increases the likelihood of adverse health outcomes in geriatric patients who meet criteria for physical frailty, and hence may be considered an additive risk factor to frailty in those older adults with both conditions. The lack of inclusion of cognition in physical or syndromic frailty definitions is under debate, and some scales used to define frailty do include cognitive status.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H598976126\"><span class=\"h1\">PATHOPHYSIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There is increasing evidence that dysregulated immune, endocrine, stress, and energy response systems are important to the development of physical or syndromic frailty.

As the older adult progresses along the frailty spectrum and develops more severe disease <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> disability, it becomes increasingly important to tailor medical care to the needs of these vulnerable patients while keeping the individual's values and goals in mind. Comprehensive geriatric assessment (CGA) may help guide development of management and intervention plans for frail patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/frailty/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>].

In one trial conducted in community-dwelling frail and pre-frail individuals, interventions aimed at cognitive skills (weekly training for 12 weeks followed by fortnightly &quot;booster&quot; sessions for 12 weeks), physical exercise (supervised group exercises two days per week for 12 weeks), and nutrition (supplemental iron, calcium, vitamins, and calories), individual or combination interventions improved frailty scores at three and six months but did not impact patient-meaningful secondary outcomes (hospitalizations, falls, or performance of activities of daily living [ADLs]) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/frailty/abstract/70\" class=\"abstract_t\">70</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H598978339\"><span class=\"h3\">Exercise</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Exercise is believed to be the most effective intervention in older adults to improve quality of life and functionality.

The benefit of exercise in frail individuals was seen in a trial involving 1635 community-dwelling sedentary adults aged 70 to 89 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/frailty/abstract/79,80\" class=\"abstract_t\">79,80</a>]. A structured, moderate-intensity physical activity program (including aerobic, resistance, and flexibility training activities) was compared with a health education program consisting of workshops and stretching exercises. Physical activity modestly reduced the incidence of major mobility disability (defined as the inability to walk 400 meters) over a two-year period. The effect was similar in frail and non-frail individuals. However, the physical activity program did not lower the risk of becoming frail.</p><p>Resistance training alone has also demonstrated benefit in frail, older adults. As an example, a program of resistance training in nursing home residents (mean age of 87) doubled muscle strength and slightly but significantly increased lower extremity muscle size and gait velocity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/frailty/abstract/76\" class=\"abstract_t\">76</a>]. These changes were associated with increased mobility and spontaneous physical activity.</p><p>While functionally limited or frail individuals may never be able to meet minimum recommended activity levels, even modest activity and muscle strengthening can impact the progression of functional limitations. The adage &quot;start low and go slow&quot; should be kept in mind. It is acceptable to begin a baseline physical activity recommendation of walking for five minutes twice a day as a starting point. The key is to identify a set of activities the patient feels capable of doing, thus incorporating the concept of self-efficacy into the physical activity recommendation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/frailty/abstract/81\" class=\"abstract_t\">81</a>].

Vitamin D supplementation also may improve balance and preserve muscle strength [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/frailty/abstract/90\" class=\"abstract_t\">90</a>] and may play a role in preventing or treating frailty. In one report, lower serum levels of 25-hydroxyvitamin D (&lt;20.0 <span class=\"nowrap\">ng/mL)</span> were associated with a higher prevalence of frailty at baseline in a group of 1600 men over age 65 but did not predict greater risk for developing frailty at 4.6 years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/frailty/abstract/91\" class=\"abstract_t\">91</a>]. Given that vitamin D appears to play an important role in both muscle and nervous tissue maintenance with aging, further studies to evaluate the association between vitamin D and frailty are indicated.
