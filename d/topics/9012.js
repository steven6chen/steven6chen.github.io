Consensus recommendations of the American Academy of Sleep Medicine and Sleep Research Society specify that adults aged 18 to 60 years should sleep seven or more hours per night on a regular basis for optimal sleep health [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/insufficient-sleep-evaluation-and-management/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Similarly, the National Sleep Foundation consensus report specifies that seven to nine hours is recommended for adults aged 18 to 64 years and seven to eight hours is recommended for those 65 years of age and older (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SLEEP%2F106597\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef106597 \">figure 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/insufficient-sleep-evaluation-and-management/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Infants, children, and teenagers require substantially more sleep than adults.</p><p>Insufficient sleep is a public health problem: nearly 30 percent of adults in the United States report sleeping six or fewer hours per day, and rates are even higher among younger adults, racial and ethnic minorities, and patients with low socioeconomic status. In observational studies, short sleep duration has been associated with a variety of adverse health outcomes, including cardiovascular disease, obesity, and all-cause mortality. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=insufficient-sleep-definition-epidemiology-and-adverse-outcomes#H11332005\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Insufficient sleep: Definition, epidemiology, and adverse outcomes&quot;, section on 'Epidemiology'</a>.)</p><p>Formal diagnostic criteria for insufficient sleep syndrome (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SLEEP%2F108181\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef108181 \">table 1</a>) specify that a lack of adequate habitual sleep results in daytime sleepiness; associated symptoms may include irritability, decreased concentration, attention deficits, reduced vigilance, distractibility, poor motivation, fatigue, malaise, lack of energy, restlessness, and incoordination [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/insufficient-sleep-evaluation-and-management/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. These and other adverse effects of insufficient sleep are reviewed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=insufficient-sleep-definition-epidemiology-and-adverse-outcomes\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Insufficient sleep: Definition, epidemiology, and adverse outcomes&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Insufficient sleep is only one of many causes of daytime sleepiness. This topic reviews the evaluation and management of insufficient sleep in otherwise healthy adults. An approach to the evaluation of excessive daytime sleepiness is presented separately.

A complaint of sleepiness can be quantified using the Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SLEEP%2F77101\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef77101 \">table 2</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/insufficient-sleep-evaluation-and-management/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=approach-to-the-patient-with-excessive-daytime-sleepiness#H1822286\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Approach to the patient with excessive daytime sleepiness&quot;, section on 'Initial evaluation'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H995994818\"><span class=\"h2\">Sleep diary</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Sleep diaries provide valuable information about sleep patterns and practices to ensure patients are getting a sufficient amount of habitual sleep. They are inexpensive, readily available, and can be used to guide treatment recommendations and monitor response to therapy.</p><p>The diary should be kept for 7 to 14 consecutive days. A simple 24-hour log (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SLEEP%2F104097\" class=\"graphic graphic_form graphicRef104097 \">form 1</a>) or the more detailed consensus sleep diary (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SLEEP%2F87134\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef87134 \">table 3</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F87859\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef87859 \">table 4</a>) can be used [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/insufficient-sleep-evaluation-and-management/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. The recorded period should reflect the patient's typical sleep pattern on both weekdays and weekends. Patients should avoid recording days during which they are ill or recovering from illness.</p><p>Ideally, sleep diaries should include the following elements:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Time the patient gets into bed</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Time the patient fell asleep</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Number of times the patient awoke during the night</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Amount of time it took the patient to return back to sleep</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Time the patient awoke after nocturnal sleep period</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Time the patient gets out of bed for the day</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Number and duration of daytime naps</p><p/><p>Additional information such as typical bedtime routine, what the patient did during awakenings at night, feelings about sleep quality, and caffeine, alcohol, or medication use may also be included. While there is no standard way of analyzing the sleep diary, average sleep time on weekdays and average sleep time on weekends can be extracted. Typically, additional information gleaned from sleep diaries will include sleep latency and sleep efficiency. The difference between weekday and weekend sleep times and sleep duration can give an indication of &quot;social jet lag.&quot; Significantly increased sleep time on weekends, compared with weekdays, can suggest significant chronic sleep deprivation due to work-related, social, or other weekday obligations.</p><p>To maximize patient adherence to completing a sleep diary and promote accuracy of data, patients should be advised to log habitual, daily sleep for a period of seven or more days and record best estimates about the previous night immediately upon waking in the morning [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/insufficient-sleep-evaluation-and-management/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. When available, use of electronic diaries rather than paper-based tools may also help with adherence [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/insufficient-sleep-evaluation-and-management/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].</p><p>Compared with more objective sleep data obtained by actigraphy, sleep diaries have shown differences in bedtime, sleep onset latency, nap frequency, nap duration, and nighttime awakenings [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/insufficient-sleep-evaluation-and-management/abstract/7-9\" class=\"abstract_t\">7-9</a>]. One large study of 615 adults showed only modest correlation (r = 0.6) between sleep duration as measured by single-night sleep log versus actigraphy, and participants had a tendency to over-report habitual sleep duration [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/insufficient-sleep-evaluation-and-management/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. Despite these limitations, sleep diaries remain a convenient, helpful, and commonly used tool. (See <a href=\"#H32858114\" class=\"local\">'Actigraphy'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2140453186\"><span class=\"h2\">Sleep questionnaires</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The Sleep Timing Questionnaire (STQ) is a single administration instrument that generates measures of sleep that can approximate those obtained from a formal two-week sleep diary [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/insufficient-sleep-evaluation-and-management/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. The STQ includes questions about habitual wake times and bedtimes on weekdays and weekends, similar to those obtained from a sleep diary (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SLEEP%2F108180\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef108180 \">table 5</a>).</p><p>The questionnaire has reasonable test-retest reliability for bedtime and wake time but, like sleep diaries, correlates modestly with objective actigraphy data. The STQ may still be a useful tool to obtain habitual sleep duration when patient adherence with sleep diaries is a concern.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H32858114\"><span class=\"h2\">Actigraphy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Actigraphy allows for objective estimation of habitual sleep duration. While not required in all cases, it can be especially useful when patients are unable to reliably complete a sleep log or there are questions about the validity of the information provided. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-actigraphy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of actigraphy&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Actigraphy records movements via a sensitive accelerometer, typically worn on the wrist, and estimates sleep parameters using a computerized algorithm. Actigraphy is used widely in research settings and increasingly in clinical settings, where use may be limited by lack of insurance coverage.</p><p>Where available, actigraphy can be a very useful tool for estimating sleep patterns and sleep duration in healthy adults [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/insufficient-sleep-evaluation-and-management/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. Actigraphy is well validated against objective sleep times obtained from polysomnography (PSG) and provides useful estimates of total sleep time, the amount of wake after sleep onset, and sleep percentage [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/insufficient-sleep-evaluation-and-management/abstract/11-13\" class=\"abstract_t\">11-13</a>].</p><p>Actigraphy is typically used for a one- to two-week duration. Some actigraphy devices also include light sensors, which can help quantify patients' light exposure at night or in the morning and verify bedtime. Such data can help identify patients with circadian sleep-wake rhythm disorders influenced by inappropriate light exposure. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-circadian-sleep-wake-rhythm-disorders\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of circadian sleep-wake rhythm disorders&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Supplemental sleep diaries are required during the actigraphy monitoring period. This may provide back-up data in case of device malfunction, differentiate wake but motionless periods misinterpreted as sleep on actigraphy, and provide an opportunity for the patient to explain uncharacteristic behaviors or situational context for arousals and napping.</p><p>Some actigraphy devices have an event marker that allows patients to record time in and out of bed. Patients should be instructed to use this function if available, as it can facilitate accurate interpretation of data downloaded from the actigraph. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-actigraphy#H1757092177\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of actigraphy&quot;, section on 'Preparation'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1031620487\"><span class=\"h2\">Consumer wearable devices</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Accelerometer-based wearable activity monitors are increasingly popular. They typically report a variety of sleep measures, including sleep duration.</p><p>The accuracy of the data provided by these consumer devices is not well known, and there are few published studies validating them with standard wrist-based actigraphy or PSG. The available data suggest that all devices overestimate minutes of sleep compared with actigraphy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/insufficient-sleep-evaluation-and-management/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>].</p><p>The technology of personal monitoring devices is constantly evolving, and, by the time validation studies are published, newer versions of the devices are often available. Given the popularity of these devices, multistage validation studies are needed to assess sensitivity and specificity against actigraphy or gold-standard PSG, especially before consumer wearable-generated data can be used effectively in clinical practice [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/insufficient-sleep-evaluation-and-management/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-actigraphy#H2509159254\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of actigraphy&quot;, section on 'Consumer wearable devices'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H71165672\"><span class=\"h1\">IMPROVING TOTAL SLEEP TIME</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Making a lifestyle change to obtain more sleep is very difficult for most individuals, and it is both crucial and challenging to get buy-in from patients, to a point that they feel motivated to change.</p><p>Good sleep hygiene is critical to obtaining adequate, quality sleep on an ongoing basis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/insufficient-sleep-evaluation-and-management/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. We suggest counseling patients about all of the following:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Stick to a sleep schedule of the same bedtime and wake up time, even on the weekends. Consistency makes it much easier to fall asleep and wake easily. In a study of adolescents, subjects who reported having a bedtime set by their parents had an earlier bedtime and obtained more sleep than those without parent-set bedtimes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/insufficient-sleep-evaluation-and-management/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Practice a bedtime routine. While this is rarely assessed formally in research studies, one study incorporated a routine of personal care, lights out, and reduced sources of noise up to two hours before the desired sleep time as part of a multiphase sleep treatment intervention that effectively improved duration of sleep for a cohort of nursing home patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/insufficient-sleep-evaluation-and-management/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>If you have trouble sleeping at night, avoid naps, especially in the late afternoon. However, short naps lasting approximately 20 minutes can help alleviate daytime fatigue, sleepiness, and even provide cognitive benefit [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/insufficient-sleep-evaluation-and-management/abstract/19,20\" class=\"abstract_t\">19,20</a>]. Nap duration over 30 minutes is more likely than shorter nap duration to produce sleep inertia, a period of reduced alertness and cognitive performance after waking [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/insufficient-sleep-evaluation-and-management/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Naps are often necessary for shift workers to mitigate fatigue and improve alertness during work times [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/insufficient-sleep-evaluation-and-management/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sleep-wake-disturbances-in-shift-workers\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Sleep-wake disturbances in shift workers&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Exercise daily. In one meta-analysis, regular exercise (defined variably across studies) was shown to have small beneficial effects of total sleep duration, small-to-medium beneficial effects on ability to fall asleep faster, and moderate beneficial effects on sleep quality [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/insufficient-sleep-evaluation-and-management/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Maintain a sleep environment conducive to sleep. The bedroom should be comfortably cool, for example between 60 and 67 degrees Fahrenheit. In population studies, nocturnal environmental light and noise significantly impact sleep quality and quantity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/insufficient-sleep-evaluation-and-management/abstract/24,25\" class=\"abstract_t\">24,25</a>]. Use of blackout curtains, ear plugs, or sound machines may help promote an optimal sleep environment for individuals with sleep disruptions due to environmental stimuli.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Sleep on a comfortable mattress and pillows.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Regular bright light exposure in the mornings may help to maximize alertness and maintain a regular circadian rhythm. Studies in extreme latitudes where sunlight is minimal in the winter have found that an hour of exposure to white light in the morning helped subjects go to sleep earlier and wake earlier [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/insufficient-sleep-evaluation-and-management/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. Exposure to blue light in the morning may have more robust effects on the stability of the circadian rhythm [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/insufficient-sleep-evaluation-and-management/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>] and has been shown to improve daytime fatigue and sleepiness [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/insufficient-sleep-evaluation-and-management/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Avoid cigarettes, caffeine, and heavy meals in the evening. While alcohol use does not seem to affect sleep duration, at least one study has reported that alcohol use (average 2.2 drinks per day) has a negative association with sleep quality [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/insufficient-sleep-evaluation-and-management/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Wind down with quiet activities that may promote sleep, such as reading with a dim light. Avoid use of electronics at least 30 minutes before habitual bedtime and in the middle of the night if nocturnal awakenings occur. The blue light emitted from computer screens and hand-held devices can suppress natural melatonin production, resulting in difficulty falling asleep; however, the exact duration of use and intensity of lighting that cause this effect are variable in the literature [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/insufficient-sleep-evaluation-and-management/abstract/30,31\" class=\"abstract_t\">30,31</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>If you cannot sleep, do not look at a clock. Go into another room and do something relaxing until you feel drowsy enough to fall asleep again. Then return to bed.</p><p/><p>Referral to clinical psychology is an option for patients who continue to have difficulty obtaining sufficient sleep despite the sleep hygiene advice above. Similar to insomnia, psychologists employ cognitive and behavioral approaches; in particular, the technique of motivational interviewing is likely to be helpful [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/insufficient-sleep-evaluation-and-management/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>]. In addition, patients may be able to obtain more sleep by reducing stress and anxiety-provoking activities near bedtime [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/insufficient-sleep-evaluation-and-management/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>]. Self-regulation interventions such as mental imagery techniques have been shown to improve sleep-related behaviors and sleep patterns in adults [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/insufficient-sleep-evaluation-and-management/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>].</p><p>Patients with sleep insufficiency may be at risk for drowsy driving and fall-asleep crashes and should be appropriately counseled on prevention and countermeasures [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/insufficient-sleep-evaluation-and-management/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>].
