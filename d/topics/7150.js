If this is an isolated finding, then the prognosis is usually good.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">DEFINITION AND DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Fetal echogenic bowel refers to increased echogenicity or brightness of the fetal bowel noted on second-trimester sonographic examination (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F51551%7EOBGYN%2F73631\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef51551 graphicRef73631 \">image 1A-B</a>). Hyperechogenicity can be diffuse or focal, is uniform over a well-defined area that does not shadow, and is located primarily in the lower fetal abdomen and pelvis.</p><p>Various criteria for diagnosis of bowel echogenicity have been suggested. The simplest criteria, and the one that we use, is echogenicity similar to or greater than that of adjacent bone with the ultrasound gain set to the lowest point at which bone appears white [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fetal-echogenic-bowel/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. The iliac wing is the usual standard for comparison. Some authors have defined grades of echogenicity, with the most severe form (grade 3) being as bright as bone, while grades 1 and 2 are mildly or moderately echogenic [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fetal-echogenic-bowel/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p>Transducer frequency is important when considering the diagnosis of echogenic bowel. Higher-frequency transducers can make the differentiation between normal and abnormal bowel echogenicity difficult, leading to over-diagnosis of the latter. As an example, a study using both 8 and 5 MHz transducers sequentially on the same fetuses found the frequency of echogenic bowel was 31 and 3 percent, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fetal-echogenic-bowel/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. For this reason, we only diagnose echogenic bowel when using a transducer frequency of 5 MHz or below. As discussed above, echogenicity similar to or greater than adjacent bone is a subjective determination, and is therefore prone to interobserver and intraobserver variability [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fetal-echogenic-bowel/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Differential diagnosis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Echogenic bowel should be distinguished from extraintestinal echogenic masses and calcification in the fetal abdomen. The differential diagnosis includes gastric pseudo-mass, meconium peritonitis, and meconium &quot;pseudocyst&quot; (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F58207\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef58207 \">image 2</a>). A description of these and other less-common echogenic lesions in the abdomen can be found separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-echogenic-masses-and-calcification-in-the-fetal-abdomen\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of echogenic masses and calcification in the fetal abdomen&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h1\">PREVALENCE AND NATURAL HISTORY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Bowel echogenicity is not evaluable in the first trimester. </p><p>The prevalence of fetal echogenic bowel in the second trimester is 2 to 14 per 1000 singleton pregnancies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fetal-echogenic-bowel/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. In otherwise normal fetuses, it is generally not associated with adverse sequelae. The prognosis is often poor when the fetus has congenital or chromosomal anomalies, growth restriction, or dilated bowel [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fetal-echogenic-bowel/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Etiology and related disorders'</a> below.)</p><p>In the third trimester, echogenic bowel is common and a normal finding since meconium is present in the colon at this time and can be echogenic.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h1\">ETIOLOGY AND RELATED DISORDERS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Fetal echogenic bowel is a nonspecific sonographic finding. In over 80 to 90 percent of fetuses with an isolated sonographic finding of echogenic bowel, no etiology is identified antepartum and the neonate (including the bowel) are normal at birth [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fetal-echogenic-bowel/abstract/1,7,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,7,8</a>]. An underlying pathologic condition is most likely when echogenic bowel is not an isolated sonographic finding [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fetal-echogenic-bowel/abstract/9,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,10</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Blood in the bowel lumen</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Blood or blood components (pigments, cellular debris) can be present in amniotic fluid as a result of placental and decidual bleeding. When the fetus ingests this fluid, the bowel can appear echogenic, since blood is very echogenic (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F67005%7EOBGYN%2F57271\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef67005 graphicRef57271 \">image 3A-B</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fetal-echogenic-bowel/abstract/11,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,12</a>]. Ultrasound findings of a subchorionic fluid collection or echogenic material in the fetal stomach suggest intraamniotic bleeding as the source of echogenic bowel. The woman may or may not have a history of vaginal bleeding or an invasive obstetric procedure.</p><p>The natural history of this process was illustrated by a study of patients with intraamniotic bleeding after intrauterine fetal transfusion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fetal-echogenic-bowel/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. Bowel echogenicity developed in 7 of 28 fetuses within the first 12 hours after the bleeding episode and remained in 5 fetuses for two or more weeks after the procedure.</p><p>Evidence of intraamniotic bleeding suggests one reason for echogenic fetal bowel, but such bleeding is not rare and does not exclude other causes of echogenic bowel.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Aneuploidy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Echogenic bowel may be due to decreased bowel motility and increased water absorption in aneuploid fetuses, as these changes in bowel function have been reported in aneuploid newborns [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fetal-echogenic-bowel/abstract/9,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,13</a>].</p><p>Aneuploidy rates of 3 to 25 percent have been reported in fetuses with echogenic bowel [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fetal-echogenic-bowel/abstract/2,14-16\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,14-16</a>]. The wide range is likely due to use of differing criteria for diagnosing echogenic bowel and differing <span class=\"nowrap\">inclusion/exclusion</span> criteria, as well as assessment in populations with different levels of aneuploidy risk. The risk of aneuploidy is highest in fetuses who have structural anomalies (eg, cardiac defects, duodenal atresia) or who have multiple sonographic &quot;soft&quot; markers associated with aneuploidy (eg, echogenic cardiac focus, pyelectasis, slightly shortened humerus or femur) (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sonographic-findings-associated-with-fetal-aneuploidy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Sonographic findings associated with fetal aneuploidy&quot;</a>). The most common aneuploidy detected is trisomy 21, which accounted for 17 of 24 (71 percent) fetuses with echogenic bowel and a clinically significant chromosomal abnormality in one large series [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fetal-echogenic-bowel/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. Other aneuploidies have been identified at low frequency in fetuses with echogenic bowel, including 45X, trisomy 13, trisomy 18, triploidy, and mosaics.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Cystic fibrosis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In cystic fibrosis, abnormalities in pancreatic enzyme secretion result in thick, viscous meconium in the small intestine and hypoperistalsis, which is the likely reason for increased fetal bowel echogenicity (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F64460\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef64460 \">image 4</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fetal-echogenic-bowel/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>].</p><p>About 3 percent of fetuses with echogenic bowel had cystic fibrosis in a number of series [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fetal-echogenic-bowel/abstract/1,10,14,18\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,10,14,18</a>], although a rate as high as 7.6 percent has been reported [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fetal-echogenic-bowel/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. This rate is markedly higher than that expected in a Caucasian population, which is 1 in 2000 to 3000 live births.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h2\">Fetal growth restriction</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Echogenic fetal bowel has been associated with fetal growth restriction (FGR). Fetal blood flow is redistributed toward vital organs (brain, heart, adrenals, placenta) in FGR. Reduction in blood flow to the fetal gut may be the cause of the echogenic appearance of fetal bowel; however, there is no evidence supporting this hypothesis and vasodilatation in the superior mesenteric artery and celiac trunk have been demonstrated [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fetal-echogenic-bowel/abstract/20,21\" class=\"abstract_t\">20,21</a>].</p><p>Four to 21 percent of fetuses with echogenic bowel are growth-restricted [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fetal-echogenic-bowel/abstract/10,14,22\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,14,22</a>]. In a case-control study evaluating early signs of FGR, the rate of echogenic bowel was 10-fold higher in fetuses at the lowest quartile for estimated weight than in those with weight &ge;25<sup>th</sup> percentile (4 versus 0.4 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fetal-echogenic-bowel/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>].</p><p>The combination of echogenic fetal bowel and FGR, especially with oligohydramnios and elevated maternal serum alpha-fetoprotein in the second trimester, has a poor prognosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fetal-echogenic-bowel/abstract/22,24,25\" class=\"abstract_t\">22,24,25</a>]. Four to 8 percent of fetuses with both echogenic bowel and early FGR die in utero [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fetal-echogenic-bowel/abstract/8,22\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,22</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h2\">Infection</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Congenital infection may cause echogenic bowel by direct damage to the fetal intestine or as a result of other potential sequelae of congenital infection, such as ascites or growth restriction. Ascites enhances the echogenicity of abdominal structures such as bowel.</p><p>Congenital infection is probably the least common cause of echogenic bowel [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fetal-echogenic-bowel/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>], and this association is controversial. Some series have reported rates of infection as high as 10 percent of fetuses with echogenic bowel [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fetal-echogenic-bowel/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]; however, in other large series, the rate of congenital infection was not higher than expected in the general obstetric population [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fetal-echogenic-bowel/abstract/1,2,14,27-29\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2,14,27-29</a>].</p><p>The most commonly detected infectious agent in the fetus with echogenic bowel is cytomegalovirus, which accounted for 15 of 19 cases in one large series [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fetal-echogenic-bowel/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. Toxoplasmosis is much less common. Parvovirus, varicella, and herpes simplex infection have also been described, but are rare [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fetal-echogenic-bowel/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>].

There is at least one report of fetal echogenic bowel associated with Hirschsprung disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fetal-echogenic-bowel/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h2\">Rare etiologies</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There is one report of echogenic bowel in fetuses with alpha-thalassemia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fetal-echogenic-bowel/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>]. The echogenic bowel was attributed to bowel edema from severe anemia and hypoxemia. Echogenic bowel has also been noted sporadically in fetuses with visceral malformations not involving the gastrointestinal tract and in pregnancies complicated by a variety of placental or maternal disorders [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fetal-echogenic-bowel/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14\"><span class=\"h1\">OBSTETRIC MANAGEMENT</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H709809065\"><span class=\"h2\">Initial evaluation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Initially, a detailed fetal ultrasound examination by an experienced obstetric sonographer is important to determine whether echogenic bowel is an isolated finding or other abnormalities are present that suggest an etiology and thus would guide <span class=\"nowrap\">counseling/further</span> fetal evaluation. If no associated anomalies are observed, women should be counseled about the risk of potential fetal disorders and offered appropriate testing. We do the following:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Determine whether there has been a recent history of uterine bleeding. Echogenic bowel that develops soon after an episode of bleeding, is associated with gastric echogenicity, and resolves within two weeks is likely to be due to fetal swallowing of blood. However, since other causes of echogenic bowel cannot be excluded with certainty, further diagnostic testing is reasonable, especially in the absence of a previously normal second-trimester sonogram. (See <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'Blood in the bowel lumen'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Offer parental cystic fibrosis (CF) carrier screening, if this has not been performed previously. The panel used (standard versus expanded) is determined on a case-by-case basis, considering the ethnicity of the parents and their desire for prenatal diagnosis. If both parents are carriers or carrier status is poorly defined because of ethnicity, a prenatal diagnostic procedure is offered. Because 100 percent of CF mutations cannot be identified, the possibility of CF in the fetus with echogenic bowel cannot be definitively excluded. These issues are discussed in more detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cystic-fibrosis-carrier-screening\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Cystic fibrosis: Carrier screening&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Order maternal serologies including IgG, IgM, and avidity testing for recent cytomegalovirus (CMV) or toxoplasmosis infection. The yield for other infections is too low to justify testing in all pregnancies in which echogenic bowel is detected. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cytomegalovirus-infection-in-pregnancy#H1739744847\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Cytomegalovirus infection in pregnancy&quot;, section on 'How to test'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">If there is serologic evidence of recent maternal infection, fetal infection (CMV, toxoplasmosis) can be diagnosed by polymerase chain reaction of DNA in amniotic fluid or amniocytes. We generally await results of maternal serology before testing amniotic fluid. If amniocentesis is performed for other indications before serology results are available, the amniotic fluid can be held and tested at a later date, if indicated. (See <a href=\"#H10\" class=\"local\">'Infection'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Offer genetic testing for fetal karyotype, if not already available. The patient-specific risk for Down syndrome after ultrasound examination can be estimated using an <a href=\"http://perinatology.com/calculators/Down+Syndromee+Revised+Risk.htm&amp;token=uM3cu9b01pRUWiM62WORPV5+Iluqnimuj7HHXD0W/uAfYzfZtRS71GPMgxLetE2uv52DYVJR4W5Q3BmG5XiGDssEioXHF+knfnn3o7RfE2o=&amp;TOPIC_ID=420\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">equation</a> that includes the odds of Down's syndrome based on a priori risk and the likelihood ratio (LR) for Down syndrome (LR = 6.1) when echogenic bowel is detected [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fetal-echogenic-bowel/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>], but other aneuploidies are also possible. The a priori risk should not be based solely on maternal age if risk has already been adjusted with nuchal translucency <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> biochemistry. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Options for further assessment include amniocentesis for definitive fetal genetic studies or cell-free DNA testing of maternal blood, which screens for trisomies 21, 18, and 13. While cell-free DNA testing is not diagnostic, the residual risk of Down syndrome in screen-negative pregnancies is very low. If cell-free DNA has already been performed, or if testing subsequent to the identification of echogenic bowel is normal, the low diagnostic yield of amniocentesis may not be justified for many patients. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prenatal-genetic-evaluation-of-the-anomalous-fetus#H286557901\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Prenatal genetic evaluation of the anomalous fetus&quot;, section on 'Genetic evaluation of the fetus with &quot;soft markers&quot; and no structural anomalies'</a>.).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">We offer all patients undergoing amniocentesis chromosomal microarray as an alternative to conventional karyotype to detect copy number variants not detectable on G-banding. However, it is not clear that echogenic bowel is a risk factor for microdeletions or duplications. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=use-of-chromosomal-microarray-in-obstetrics\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Use of chromosomal microarray in obstetrics&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H709809075\"><span class=\"h2\">Pregnancy monitoring</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>We believe routine prenatal care is appropriate for pregnancies with isolated echogenic bowel: no evidence of fetal aneuploidy, cystic fibrosis, growth restriction, structural anomalies, congenital infection, comorbidities associated with an increased risk for fetal compromise (eg, preeclampsia), or elevated maternal serum alpha-fetoprotein level. In our series of patients with isolated echogenic bowel and a negative evaluation (including normal maternal serum alpha-fetoprotein level), rates of perinatal morbidity and mortality were similar to those in our general obstetric population [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fetal-echogenic-bowel/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Others have also reported a favorable prognosis for isolated echogenic bowel [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fetal-echogenic-bowel/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. The absence of serious long-term bowel pathology was demonstrated in a small series with follow-up for as long as four years after birth [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fetal-echogenic-bowel/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>]. However, additional studies of pregnancy outcome are needed as one study described seven fetuses with isolated echogenic bowel that died in utero at 21 to 29 weeks and had autopsies showing appropriate for gestational age fetuses without other pathologic findings [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fetal-echogenic-bowel/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].</p><p>If fetal size and amniotic fluid are normal in the second trimester, some experts recommend an ultrasound examination at about 32 weeks to re-evaluate fetal growth and the fetal bowel, since these fetuses are at increased risk of growth restriction (FGR) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fetal-echogenic-bowel/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>]. We do not screen for FGR in the third trimester based on an isolated second-trimester finding of echogenic bowel, given the low risk of late-onset FGR and the poor performance of ultrasound examination for screening for FGR. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=routine-prenatal-ultrasonography-as-a-screening-tool#H95143388\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Routine prenatal ultrasonography as a screening tool&quot;, section on 'Better diagnosis of deficient growth and improvement in perinatal outcome'</a>.)</p><p>For fetuses that are growth-restricted at initial or subsequent ultrasound examination, we order serial ultrasound examinations to evaluate fetal growth and amniotic fluid volume and nonstress tests and Doppler velocimetry in pregnancies &ge;28 weeks of gestation. This is similar to pregnancy management of FGR in other settings. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fetal-growth-restriction-evaluation-and-management#H3\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Fetal growth restriction: Evaluation and management&quot;, section on 'Pregnancy management'</a>.)</p><p>We also perform third trimester fetal assessment in pregnancies with fetal echogenic bowel and an unexplained elevated maternal serum alpha-fetoprotein level. These pregnancies appear to be at increased risk of fetal demise [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fetal-echogenic-bowel/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>] and may benefit from fetal monitoring and intervention if they reach a viable gestational age.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15\"><span class=\"h1\">SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Fetal echogenic bowel refers to bowel echogenicity similar to or greater than that of adjacent bone with the ultrasound gain set to the lowest point at which bone appears white (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F51551%7EOBGYN%2F73631\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef51551 graphicRef73631 \">image 1A-B</a>).

(See <a href=\"#H14\" class=\"local\">'Obstetric management'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We suggest the following approach when echogenic bowel is detected in the second trimester (see <a href=\"#H709809065\" class=\"local\">'Initial evaluation'</a> above):</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>An experienced obstetric sonographer should perform a thorough ultrasound examination including a fetal anatomic survey with attention to the gastrointestinal tract, estimation of fetal <span class=\"nowrap\">size/growth,</span> assessment of markers suggestive of aneuploidy, and evaluation for signs of fetal infection.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>We offer parental cystic fibrosis screening and perform maternal serologic testing for cytomegalovirus and toxoplasmosis infection.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>We offer fetal genetic assessment using cell-free DNA screening for trisomy 21, 18, and 13 in maternal blood, if not already performed. Diagnostic amniocentesis for definitive genetic studies (chromosomal microarray or G-banded karyotype) is also reasonable.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>If parental cystic fibrosis, aneuploidy, or infection screening yields positive results, we suggest amniocentesis to obtain a definitive fetal diagnosis.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Routine prenatal care is appropriate for pregnancies with isolated echogenic bowel and no evidence of fetal aneuploidy, cystic fibrosis, growth restriction, structural anomalies, or congenital infection. If fetal size and amniotic fluid are normal in the second trimester, some experts recommend an ultrasound examination at about 32 weeks to re-evaluate fetal growth and the fetal bowel, since these fetuses are at increased risk of growth restriction. (See <a href=\"#H709809075\" class=\"local\">'Pregnancy monitoring'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pregnancies with fetuses who are growth-restricted at initial or subsequent ultrasound examination are managed similarly to pregnancies with fetal growth restriction in other settings.
