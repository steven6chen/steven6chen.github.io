A basic principle of geriatric medicine is that pathology can make the patient vulnerable to other stressors and these stressors may be the treatment targets, rather than the pathology itself [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-persistent-pain-in-older-adults/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. For example, a patient with low back pain may have degenerative disease of the lumbar spine, but the important treatment target may be co-existent depression.</p><p>Four of the most common and misdiagnosed conditions that cause persistent pain in older adults are myofascial pain syndrome, chronic low back pain, lumbar spinal stenosis, and fibromyalgia syndrome.

The pain often radiates a significant distance from the site of the trigger point, mimicking radiculopathy or neuropathic pain. Common myofascial pain syndromes in older adults include piriformis syndrome (compression of the sciatic nerve in the region of the sciatic notch as the nerve comes in close contact with a piriformis&nbsp;muscle that has myofascial dysfunction), cervicogenic headaches (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cervicogenic-headache\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Cervicogenic headache&quot;</a>), <span class=\"nowrap\">upper/lower</span> back pain related to myofascial dysfunction of the paraxial musculature, trapezius myofascial pain , pseudotrochanteric bursitis (tensor fascia lata myofascial dysfunction), and post-herpetic myofascial pain [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-persistent-pain-in-older-adults/abstract/26,27\" class=\"abstract_t\">26,27</a>].</p><p>Treatment is three-pronged and consists of:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Identifying and treating the underlying factor(s) that are responsible for creating muscle dysfunction leading to myofascial pain (eg, shoulder dysfunction in the patient with myofascial neck pain, poor sitting posture in the patient with upper back myofascial pain, or an anxiety disorder in the patient with myofascial pain at any site).

In a study of 111 community-dwelling older adults with CLBP, over 80 percent had several physical conditions associated with their pain, most commonly myofascial pain, sacroiliac joint syndrome, probable hip osteoarthritis (OA), <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> fibromyalgia syndrome [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-persistent-pain-in-older-adults/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. Our clinical experience suggests that leg length discrepancy following total hip or knee replacement also can precipitate or worsen CLBP. We believe evaluation for these disorders should be performed routinely in older adults with CLBP.</p><p>Spinal imaging has poor predictive validity for pain [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-persistent-pain-in-older-adults/abstract/30,31\" class=\"abstract_t\">30,31</a>]. As a general rule in older adults, imaging the spine is often more helpful in demonstrating absence of disease (ie, compression fractures, metastatic bone disease, disk space infection) rather than the cause of pain. However, patients with history or physical examination findings suggestive of fracture, infection, malignancy, or other serious disease should undergo either plain radiographs or advanced imaging, depending on the clinical scenario. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-of-low-back-pain-in-adults#H83194028\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation of low back pain in adults&quot;, section on 'Imaging'</a>.)</p><p>Older adults commonly have degenerative pathology, much of which has nothing to do with pain. For older adults with CLBP and no clinical findings suggestive of serious disease, imaging should be used judiciously and interpreted cautiously as it is likely to cause undue anxiety over incidental degenerative pathology. Over 95 percent of older adults have degenerative disc <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> facet disease on radiograph [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-persistent-pain-in-older-adults/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>] and fewer than half report experiencing low back pain during the prior year [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-persistent-pain-in-older-adults/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>]. Thus pathology identified on imaging studies may or may not be a contributor to low back pain in the older adult. </p><p>We approach the evaluation and treatment of CLBP in older adults as a geriatric syndrome, that is, a final common pathway for the expression of multiple potential contributors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-persistent-pain-in-older-adults/abstract/33,34\" class=\"abstract_t\">33,34</a>], in which degenerative disease of the lumbosacral spine is a source of vulnerability but not the sole treatment target. We use a set of evidence and expert opinion-based algorithms to guide the evaluation and treatment of common conditions that contribute to pain and disability in older adults with CLBP. The conditions targeted are hip osteoarthritis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-persistent-pain-in-older-adults/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>], myofascial pain [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-persistent-pain-in-older-adults/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>], fibromyalgia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-persistent-pain-in-older-adults/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>], depression [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-persistent-pain-in-older-adults/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>], maladaptive coping [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-persistent-pain-in-older-adults/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>], lumbar spinal stenosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-persistent-pain-in-older-adults/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>], insomnia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-persistent-pain-in-older-adults/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>], lateral <span class=\"nowrap\">hip/thigh</span> pain [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-persistent-pain-in-older-adults/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>], anxiety [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-persistent-pain-in-older-adults/abstract/43\" class=\"abstract_t\">43</a>], sacroiliac joint syndrome [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-persistent-pain-in-older-adults/abstract/44\" class=\"abstract_t\">44</a>], dementia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-persistent-pain-in-older-adults/abstract/45\" class=\"abstract_t\">45</a>], and leg length discrepancy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-persistent-pain-in-older-adults/abstract/46\" class=\"abstract_t\">46</a>].

While imaging evidence of spinal stenosis is required prior to surgical intervention, many older adults have spinal stenosis that is asymptomatic. The LAIDBack study found that one in five asymptomatic older adults has moderate to severe central canal stenosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-persistent-pain-in-older-adults/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>].</p><p>Treatment should follow a stepped-care approach (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lumbar-spinal-stenosis-treatment-and-prognosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Lumbar spinal stenosis: Treatment and prognosis&quot;</a>).

It is imperative to thoroughly evaluate the older patient with neurogenic claudication to identify and treat all contributors to pain and disability and ensure the patient has realistic treatment expectations before referring for a surgical consultation. As discussed above, there are many potential contributors to pain and disability in older adults, thus anatomical lumbar spinal stenosis may not be the most important treatment target [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-persistent-pain-in-older-adults/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>], and treatment outcomes may be suboptimal if only stenosis is treated.

Systemic medications are generally introduced at a later step than in younger adults, due to the increased potential for side effects, toxicity, and interactions with medications used for chronic illnesses. Consequently, the use of nonpharmacologic treatments, or localized use of medications (eg, corticosteroid injections) may be preferred as initial therapy for many conditions, particularly in patients with multiple chronic conditions and medications. When nonpharmacologic therapy is ineffective, pharmacological treatment should be guided by aging-specific considerations as discussed below. (See <a href=\"#H15080467\" class=\"local\">'Nonpharmacologic treatments'</a> below and <a href=\"#H15080574\" class=\"local\">'Pharmacologic treatments'</a> below.) </p><p>In some cases surgical treatment of persistent pain (eg, joint replacement, spinal surgery) may be indicated when nonpharmacologic treatment is ineffective and pharmacologic treatment is either ineffective or not tolerated.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15080467\"><span class=\"h1\">NONPHARMACOLOGIC TREATMENTS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Nonpharmacological approaches to the management of persistent pain are often beneficial, in place of or in addition to pharmacological treatments. Nonpharmacologic therapies encompass a wide array of treatments that may be grouped into the physical interventions (including physical therapy, acupuncture, chiropractic manipulation, massage, and others) and the psychoeducational interventions (such as cognitive-behavioral therapy, meditation, and patient education). Many of these therapies are low cost, with minimal side effects, and may decrease the dose and therefore the risk from any needed medications [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-persistent-pain-in-older-adults/abstract/59\" class=\"abstract_t\">59</a>]. Treatments with associated cost or potential side effects should be used only when there is evidence of benefit in patients with similar painful conditions. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-the-treatment-of-chronic-non-cancer-pain#H24\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of the treatment of chronic non-cancer pain&quot;, section on 'Nonpharmacologic therapies'</a>.)</p><p>General therapies such as self-management education, physical <span class=\"nowrap\">therapy/exercise,</span> and cognitive behavioral therapy may be used for all persistent pain conditions.

The efficacy of nonpharmacologic treatments does not appear to differ in older adults compared with other ages. The 2017 American College of Physicians guidelines for the treatment of acute, subacute, and chronic low back pain recommend nonpharmacological treatments early in the treatment of patients with CLBP [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-persistent-pain-in-older-adults/abstract/73\" class=\"abstract_t\">73</a>]. Two of the three studies cited by the ACP guidelines as demonstrating moderate quality evidence for the efficacy of mindfulness meditation were performed specifically in older adults [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-persistent-pain-in-older-adults/abstract/74,75\" class=\"abstract_t\">74,75</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15080574\"><span class=\"h1\">PHARMACOLOGIC TREATMENTS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients whose pain causes functional impairment or diminished quality of life despite nonpharmacologic treatments may require pharmacologic therapy. Routes of administration, medications, and doses should be selected that are the least likely to lead to toxicity, side effects, or interactions with other medications. Suggested doses may be found in the table (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ANEST%2F95621\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef95621 \">table 2</a>).

Analgesics should be initiated at the lowest effective dose, and titrated to achieve pain control with minimal adverse effects; this requires frequent reassessment of patients for pain relief and side effects as doses are adjusted. Localized use of medication (eg, joint injections, trigger point injections) may be preferable to systemic medications (eg, oral analgesics) when applicable.

(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-of-chronic-pain-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation of chronic pain in adults&quot;</a>.).</p><p>The initial treatment of neuropathic pain involves either antidepressants or anticonvulsants, with adjunctive topical therapy when pain is localized (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ANEST%2F95621\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef95621 \">table 2</a>). In contrast, first-line therapy for nociceptive pain is generally <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acetaminophen-paracetamol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">acetaminophen</a> or nonsteroidal antiinflammatory medications (NSAIDs); however, prolonged use of NSAIDS are contraindicated in older adults with chronic pain because of the increased risk of adverse events in this population.

Prescribing effective treatment starts with an accurate and comprehensive history that 1) defines the older adult's &quot;pain signature&quot; (the parameters affected by pain and the severity of their impact), 2) highlights key comorbidities that contribute to pain or influence its treatment (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ANEST%2F91917\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef91917 \">table 1</a>), and 3) identifies treatment targets. The main goal in the treatment of persistent pain is to maximize function and quality of life while minimizing adverse effects that may be associated with treatment. Identifying each patient's pain signature allows the provider to evaluate response to treatment in a way that is meaningful to the individual. (See <a href=\"#H793058492\" class=\"local\">'General approach'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Four of the most common and misdiagnosed conditions that cause persistent pain in older adults are myofascial pain syndrome, chronic low back pain, lumbar spinal stenosis, and fibromyalgia syndrome. (See <a href=\"#H613900789\" class=\"local\">'Identifying physical contributors to persistent pain'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A &quot;stepped&quot; approach to the treatment of pain is advocated for older adults. The least potentially toxic interventions are used initially, followed as needed by therapies associated with greater risks. Nonpharmacologic therapies should be used initially whenever possible, and in combination with pharmacologic interventions to minimize the risk of adverse effects. (See <a href=\"#H15080467\" class=\"local\">'Nonpharmacologic treatments'</a> above.). </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pharmacologic interventions have increased risk of toxicity because of potential drug-drug and drug-disease interactions as well as aging-associated vulnerabilities. (See <a href=\"#H2826368\" class=\"local\">'Stepped care'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pharmacologic therapy should begin with the routes of administration, medications, and doses which are the least likely to lead to toxicity, side effects, or interactions with other medications (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ANEST%2F95621\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef95621 \">table 2</a>). Localized use of medication (eg, joint or spinal injections, trigger point injections, topical analgesics (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F93846\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef93846 \">table 3</a>)) may be preferable to systemic medications (eg, oral analgesics) when applicable. In most cases a non-opioid medication is the initial choice. (See <a href=\"#H15080574\" class=\"local\">'Pharmacologic treatments'</a> above and <a href=\"#H15080593\" class=\"local\">'Non-opioids'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Doses of opioid medications should be reduced in older adults and titrated slowly to effect, with close monitoring for side effects. We suggest decreasing the initial dose by 25 percent for a 60-year-old patient (by 50 percent for an 80-year-old) from the initial dose that a 40-year-old would normally receive, but at the same intervals (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). Opioids with short half-lives and without active or toxic metabolites are preferred. (See <a href=\"#H15080636\" class=\"local\">'Opioids'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients with mild to moderate dementia can often reliably report pain. Before treating it, the healthcare provider must validate that it is associated with suffering, and not simply perseveration or the expression of distress related to another unmet need. (See <a href=\"#H15080690\" class=\"local\">'Considerations for patients with dementia'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients with advanced dementia may be unable to communicate the need for analgesic medications. In such cases, an empiric analgesic trial accompanied by careful documentation of outcomes (eg, decreased agitation) may be warranted. (See <a href=\"#H15080690\" class=\"local\">'Considerations for patients with dementia'</a> above.)</p></div><div id=\"topicAgreement\">Use of UpToDate is subject to the <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/legal/license\" class=\"licenseLink\" id=\"sla_in_page\">Subscription and License Agreement</a>.</div><div id=\"references\" class=\"headingAnchor\"><h1>REFERENCES</h1><ol id=\"reference\"><li><a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-persistent-pain-in-older-adults/abstract/1\" class=\"nounderline abstract_t\">Won AB, Lapane KL, Vallow S, et al.
