LMW heparin preparations for clinical use have been produced by several companies (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F78074\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef78074 \">table 1</a>). They have an average molecular weight of 4000 to 6500 Daltons; by comparison, commercially available unfractionated heparin has an average molecular weight of 15,000 Daltons. Several LMW heparin preparations have been evaluated by clinical trials. The recommendations contained in this topic review are linked to the strength of the evidence from clinical trials [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/low-molecular-weight-heparin-for-venous-thromboembolic-disease/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].

Many of the European clinical trials have evaluated regimens begun preoperatively, whereas the North American clinical trials have tested prophylaxis begun postoperatively. It is possible that LMW heparin begun preoperatively may be more effective than prophylaxis begun postoperatively, without an increased risk of major bleeding. This issue is now clearer because of a randomized trial published in 2000 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/low-molecular-weight-heparin-for-venous-thromboembolic-disease/abstract/20,33,35\" class=\"abstract_t\">20,33,35</a>].
