This topic reviews these aspects of the anesthetic management of burn patients. Other issues in the management of burn patients are reviewed separately.

Calculation of TBSA is based on the Lund-Browder chart (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F71190\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef71190 \">figure 1</a>). A major burn injury is a partial-thickness burn greater than 25 percent TBSA in adults, or greater than 20 percent in children younger than 10 years old or adults older than 40 years old (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F74855\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef74855 \">table 1</a>). Major burn injury is also defined as full-thickness burns involving more than 10 percent TBSA. High-voltage burns, smoke inhalation injury, and burns to the face, eyes, ears, hands, feet, or perineum are also defined as major burns. Major burns may cause an intense physiologic and inflammatory response that has a direct impact on the subsequent hospital course. The ABA recommends that second-degree or greater burns to face, hands, feet, perineum, and major joints should be referred to a certified burn center. The reason besides cosmetic implications (face) is that these areas have a complex anatomy and inadequate management of burn injuries could result in important functional derangements. In addition, patient with burns to the face might have airway involvement or smoke inhalation.

A systemic inflammatory response occurs during this period, with loss of plasma fluid, electrolytes, and proteins due to increased capillary permeability [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anesthesia-for-burn-patients/abstract/1-3\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-3</a>]. Effective fluid resuscitation is guided by formulas (eg, Parkland formula) targeted to achieve the American Burn Association (ABA)-recommended urinary output (UO) of 0.5 to 1 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/kg</span> per hour as the resuscitative endpoint [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anesthesia-for-burn-patients/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. Excessive intravenous fluid administration (eg, &ldquo;fluid creep&rdquo;) can put the patient at risk of developing pulmonary edema, abdominal compartment syndrome, or compromised circulation of extremities.

CO is reduced up to 60 percent from baseline due to hypovolemia from permeability-induced plasma loss, reduced myocardial response to catecholamines, increased systemic vascular resistance due to elevated vasopressin levels, and possible myocardial ischemia due to decreased coronary blood flow [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anesthesia-for-burn-patients/abstract/6,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,7</a>]. Initial under-resuscitation with fluid therapy, followed by over-resuscitation, leads to pulmonary edema and right heart failure.</p><p>At 72 to 96 hours postburn, during the recovery phase, cardiovascular changes evolve into a &ldquo;flow&rdquo; phase. The hyperdynamic and hypermetabolic responses during this phase include increased CO, tachycardia, increased myocardial oxygen consumption, and decreased systemic vascular resistance [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anesthesia-for-burn-patients/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].</p><p>Ensuring adequate end-organ perfusion in burn-induced cardiogenic shock involves maintaining UO &ge;0.5 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/kg</span> per hour. Invasive monitoring of dynamic hemodynamic parameters is often employed to guide vasoactive therapy to maintain optimal hemodynamics and fluid administration to maintain optimal intravascular volume (eg, qualitative assessment of intra-arterial waveform (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ANEST%2F86275\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef86275 \">figure 2</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ANEST%2F85850\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef85850 \">table 2</a>)) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anesthesia-for-burn-patients/abstract/3,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,8</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H103618107\" class=\"local\">'Monitoring'</a> below.) &#160; </p><p>A nonselective beta blocker to block catecholamine receptors is used to treat cardiac dysfunction and hyperdynamic response that occurs during the flow phase [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anesthesia-for-burn-patients/abstract/9,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,10</a>].

Catecholamines elevation in major burns produces hyperdynamic circulation, augments energy expenditure, and promotes protein catabolism in skeletal muscle. Beta blockers attenuate these catecholamine actions and are important in the reduction of the post-burn hypermetabolic response. &#160;</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H463534929\"><span class=\"h2\">Pulmonary</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Immediately after a burn injury, systemic inflammatory processes lead to pulmonary hypertension and disruption of the pulmonary capillary alveolar membrane. This occurs in a setting of hypoproteinemia and reduced plasma oncotic pressure due to aggressive crystalloid resuscitation (see <a href=\"#H647566294\" class=\"local\">'Fluid resuscitation'</a> above). Thus, patients often have increased extravascular lung water and impaired gas exchange. Also, bronchospasm is common and may require aggressive bronchodilator therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anesthesia-for-burn-patients/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H187677634\"><span class=\"h3\">Smoke inhalation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Frequently, burn patients present with smoke inhalation, particularly if the fire was in a closed space [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anesthesia-for-burn-patients/abstract/3,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,12</a>]. Singing of facial or nasal hair, evidence of oropharyngeal carbonaceous deposits, or carboxyhemoglobin (COHb) levels &gt;10 percent are highly predictive of inhalation injury confirmed by bronchoscopy, as is wheezing [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anesthesia-for-burn-patients/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. Patients with burn injury and concomitant smoke inhalation have increased fluid resuscitation requirements and a higher likelihood of pulmonary complications and mortality, compared with those having isolated burn injury [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anesthesia-for-burn-patients/abstract/12,14,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,14,15</a>].</p><p>The inflammatory response produced by chemicals in the smoke induces bronchospasm, ciliary dysfunction, increased transvascular fluid flux (pulmonary edema), and thickening of secretions with concomitant atelectasis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anesthesia-for-burn-patients/abstract/12,16\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,16</a>]. These changes result in hypoventilation, loss of hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction, and increased pulmonary shunting with ventilation-perfusion mismatch. Systemic and respiratory effects of chemicals in smoke (carbon monoxide, cyanide) are discussed in detail elsewhere.

In contrast to most surgical patients, in whom enteral nutrition is withheld before and during surgery, nutritional supplementation (enteral, parenteral) is continued throughout the perioperative period in burn patients to improve long-term outcomes, including reduction in caloric deficit, need for exogenous albumin supplementation, and incidence of wound infections [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anesthesia-for-burn-patients/abstract/3,19,20\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,19,20</a>]. This decision is made on a case-by-case basis.</p><p>The hypermetabolic response to a burn injury can persist for three years following a severe burn.

Causes include changes in plasma protein concentrations, alterations in specific drug receptors, and cardiovascular factors. In particular, reduction in plasma albumin levels increases the volume of distribution and the available free fraction of any medication that binds to albumin (eg, benzodiazepines). Albumin levels are decreased because of plasma protein loss through endovascular &ldquo;leaking,&rdquo; as well as protein dilution resulting from crystalloid resuscitation (see <a href=\"#H647566294\" class=\"local\">'Fluid resuscitation'</a> above). In severely burned patients, shock-induced decreases in cerebral, hepatic, and renal blood flow will affect drug pharmacology [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anesthesia-for-burn-patients/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H463534966\"><span class=\"h1\">ANESTHETIC MANAGEMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Burn patients undergo multiple surgical procedures at the hospital bedside and in the operating room that require anesthetic management.

The burn wound is excised either at a dermal level (eg, tangential excision, for partial-thickness burns) or deep to the subcutaneous tissue (eg, fascial excision, for full-thickness burns), depending on the depth of the burn. Then, the excised areas are covered, ideally with split-skin autografts. When there is insufficient donor skin, other coverage is used (eg, allografts, xenografts, synthetic skin products, and cultured epithelial autografts) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anesthesia-for-burn-patients/abstract/25,26\" class=\"abstract_t\">25,26</a>]. Blood loss during burn excision operations can be extensive [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anesthesia-for-burn-patients/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H463535038\" class=\"local\">'Intraoperative blood transfusion'</a> below.).</p><p>Burn dressing changes are painful procedures that usually occur in the hospital bed. Depending on the complexity of the wound, the age of the patient, and the anticipated procedural pain intensity, these patients may require moderate to deep sedation, and occasionally general anesthesia, outside of the operating room setting.</p><p>Small burns (&lt;5 percent total body surface area [TBSA]) that do not involve joints or vital organs can generally be treated on an outpatient basis.

However, the burn patient may present challenges in the use of standard monitors. For example, burns on the torso and upper extremities prevent adhesive electrocardiogram lead placement. In these cases, needle electrodes or surgical stapling of the electrodes may be necessary.</p><p>Available sites for pulse oximeter probe application may be limited in patients with extensive burns to the face, neck, extremities, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> planned skin graft harvests in unburned extremities. Thus, probes for multiple sites should be immediately available. Also, carboxy-hemoglobinemia in patients with smoke inhalation and carbon monoxide poisoning may falsely elevate pulse oximetry values. In these cases, a co-oximeter may be necessary to obtain an accurate level of oxyhemoglobin. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pulse-oximetry#H8\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pulse oximetry&quot;, section on 'Carboxyhemoglobin'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=carbon-monoxide-poisoning#H9\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Carbon monoxide poisoning&quot;, section on 'Diagnosis'</a>.)</p><p>Placement of a noninvasive blood pressure (BP) cuff may not be possible in a patient with significant edema or generalized burns to the extremities. In these cases, an intra-arterial catheter may be necessary. When no other options are available, the catheter may be placed into burned or newly grafted skin. An intra-arterial catheter provides moment-to-moment measurement of BP and allows assessment of respiratory variations in the intra-arterial waveform as a dynamic hemodynamic variable to guide fluid therapy (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ANEST%2F86275\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef86275 \">figure 2</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anesthesia-for-burn-patients/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].</p><p>Arterial blood gases (ABGs) are intermittently monitored.

Hypothermia has been associated with increased risk of coagulopathy, infection including sepsis, and mortality in surgical populations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anesthesia-for-burn-patients/abstract/3,32-38\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,32-38</a>]. Burn patients are at high risk for perioperative hypothermia because of accelerated heat loss through injured skin, exacerbated by prolonged exposure of a large surface area to ambient temperature during the length of the surgical procedure, including skin preparation and surgery itself on both donor sites and the excised areas, as well as administration of cold intravenous fluids. Severely burned patients can lose up to 1&deg;C every 15 minutes when exposed to ambient temperature. Cold room temperatures have a significant impact on any patient&rsquo;s core temperature even if there are no burned skin areas, particularly during the first hour after induction of anesthesia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anesthesia-for-burn-patients/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>].</p><p>Conversely, fever may be present in a burn patient due to infection or to unopposed action of pyrogenic cytokines. Fever further increases metabolic demand, which is already increased after a burn.

Signs of probable inhalation injury and potential anatomic challenges for laryngoscopy due to oropharyngeal tissue injury or edema include burns around the mouth, deep facial or neck burns, singed hair in the nares, blistering or edema of the oropharynx, persistent cough or wheezing, carbonaceous sputum, or abnormalities in arterial blood gases (ie, hypoxia or hypercapnia). Ongoing fluid resuscitation may exacerbate laryngeal swelling. Mouth opening and neck mobility may be restricted due to pain, edema, burn eschars, or contractures. Tightness of the submandibular space can limit displacement of the tongue, making laryngoscopy difficult. A tongue depressor or laryngoscope blade may be used to evaluate the degree of mouth-opening and appearance of the oropharyngeal tissue.</p><p>Bag-mask ventilation of patients with burns to the face may be challenging due to burn dressings that prevent a good seal around the mask.

A combination of these techniques may be used to decrease blood loss and transfusion requirements [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anesthesia-for-burn-patients/abstract/85\" class=\"abstract_t\">85</a>].</p><p>Topical <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epinephrine-adrenaline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">epinephrine</a> is the most commonly used technique to limit blood loss in both burn excision and donor skin harvest sites. The anesthesiologist should monitor for potential systemic effects of absorbed epinephrine (eg, increased blood pressure, heart rate, or serum glucose) after topical application or subcutaneous injection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anesthesia-for-burn-patients/abstract/86,87\" class=\"abstract_t\">86,87</a>]. One study of topical epinephrine use during skin grafting reported increased serum epinephrine and lactate levels, a higher lactate&ndash;pyruvate ratio, and higher heart rate in burn patients compared with other patients needing skin grafts [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anesthesia-for-burn-patients/abstract/86\" class=\"abstract_t\">86</a>]. However, other studies report no difference in catecholamine levels or hemodynamic parameters in burn patients receiving epinephrine solutions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anesthesia-for-burn-patients/abstract/88,89\" class=\"abstract_t\">88,89</a>]. <a href=\"topic.htm?path=phenylephrine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Phenylephrine</a> (5 <span class=\"nowrap\">mcg/mL)</span> has also been used for subcutaneous infiltration of skin donor sites and was effective in reducing blood loss without systemic effects [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anesthesia-for-burn-patients/abstract/90\" class=\"abstract_t\">90</a>]. Despite these efforts to decrease intraoperative hemorrhage, burn excision is often accompanied by significant blood loss.</p><p>One method to reduce intraoperative allogeneic transfusion is the use of intraoperative acute normovolemic hemodilution (ANH), with subsequent autologous blood transfusion. In one study, patients with &lt;20 percent TBSA burn who received intraoperative ANH had reduced allogenic transfusion requirements. Although total blood volume loss was unchanged, ANH significantly reduced the actual loss of RBCs, coagulation factors, and platelets, presumably because the lost blood was hemodiluted blood [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anesthesia-for-burn-patients/abstract/91\" class=\"abstract_t\">91</a>]. The risks of this technique in burn patients, such as bacteremia, have not been clearly determined.

However, this is not analogous to acute traumatic coagulopathy encountered in trauma patients and is likely due to dilutional coagulopathy associated with fluid resuscitation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anesthesia-for-burn-patients/abstract/93\" class=\"abstract_t\">93</a>].

The role of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) for severe respiratory failure in patients with burns and smoke inhalation is unclear and requires further study [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anesthesia-for-burn-patients/abstract/97,98\" class=\"abstract_t\">97,98</a>]. &#160; &#160;</p><p>Patients who are at increased risk of ongoing bleeding or frequent return to the operating room for additional surgery are generally not extubated [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anesthesia-for-burn-patients/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Another advantage of keeping the patient intubated and well-sedated is minimization of the risk of postoperative motion and graft disruption. This is particularly important with delicate sheet grafting to the face and neck. If postoperative extubation is planned, we often use adjunctive analgesic techniques (eg, administration of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ketamine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ketamine</a> or infiltration of local anesthetics) to reduce opioid requirements, since burn patients are at risk for development of opioid tolerance.</p><p>Continuous pain management and intermittent sedation for bedside procedures are treatment priorities in the postoperative period [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anesthesia-for-burn-patients/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].
