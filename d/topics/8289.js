With the increasing survival of HIV-infected patients on antiretroviral therapy (ART) and increased case finding with wider HIV screening, the proportion of HIV-infected patients in this older age bracket has increased substantially [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hiv-infection-in-older-adults/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].

By the end of 2013, over four million individuals older than 50 years were living with HIV infection.</p><p>In resource-rich settings, approximately 30 percent of the HIV-infected adult population is 50 years and older [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hiv-infection-in-older-adults/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. In the United States, the cumulative number of AIDS cases reported to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in adults aged 50 years or older increased more than 10-fold from 16,288 in 1990 to over 170,000 by the end of 2012 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hiv-infection-in-older-adults/abstract/3,4\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,4</a>]. In 2013, almost 20 percent of all newly diagnosed HIV infections were in patients &ge;50 years of age [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hiv-infection-in-older-adults/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].</p><p>In resource-limited settings, the burden of HIV infection in older adults is increasing as well. One study estimated that over the next 30 years in rural South Africa, the prevalence of HIV infection among patients older than 50 years will double, and the proportion of all HIV infections that occur in those older than 50 years will triple [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hiv-infection-in-older-adults/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Risk groups</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Sexual exposure is the most common mode of transmission for HIV infection in adults older than 50 years old [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hiv-infection-in-older-adults/abstract/3,6,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,6,7</a>]. Injection drug use is an important but less common risk factor; a history of transmission through blood transfusion is infrequent.</p><p>Sexual activity remains common among older adults. In a survey of over 3000 older adults in the United States, sexual activity within the prior 12 months was reported in 73 percent of those aged 57 to 64 years, 53 percent of those aged 65 to 74 years, and 26 percent of those aged 75 to 85 years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hiv-infection-in-older-adults/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. In all age brackets, a higher proportion of men reported being sexually active than women.</p><p>For men, including those aged 50 years or older, male-to-male sexual contact is the most common HIV transmission risk in the United States, Europe, and Australia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hiv-infection-in-older-adults/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. This pattern differs from most of the rest of the world where heterosexual transmission to men is common.</p><p>For women aged 50 years or older, the primary exposure is through heterosexual contact. Certain age-related issues may cause older women to be at higher risk for HIV acquisition, such as atrophic vaginitis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hiv-infection-in-older-adults/abstract/6,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,9</a>]. Aging women would be unlikely to use barrier contraception methods to block fertility, which may put them at risk for HIV acquisition if they entered a new sexual partnership [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hiv-infection-in-older-adults/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Underdiagnosis of HIV</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Underdiagnosis of HIV infection among older patients continues to be a significant problem. Clinicians should have heightened awareness of the potential for HIV infection in their older patients and consider testing them sooner and more frequently. In the United States, recommendations are to routinely screen for HIV infection in individuals up to 65 years old, with some expert groups recommending screening up to 75 years of age [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hiv-infection-in-older-adults/abstract/10-12\" class=\"abstract_t\">10-12</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=screening-and-diagnostic-testing-for-hiv-infection#H1254169412\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Screening and diagnostic testing for HIV infection&quot;, section on 'Routine screening'</a>.)</p><p>Older individuals are frequently not perceived by their clinicians as being at risk for HIV infection, and consequently, are less likely to be tested for HIV compared with younger adults [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hiv-infection-in-older-adults/abstract/1,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,13</a>]. Additionally, undiagnosed older HIV-infected patients may present with the gradual onset of weight loss, low grade fever, and fatigue, leading clinicians to evaluate for cancer and forget to include HIV as part of the differential diagnosis. When testing for HIV is undertaken in the older patient, the diagnosis is often made late in the natural history of the individual's disease, when the patient has already progressed to AIDS.</p><p>HIV transmission and high rates of late diagnoses among adults aged 50 years and older were evaluated in a study of 8255 older adults who accessed HIV care in England, Wales, and Northern Ireland [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hiv-infection-in-older-adults/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. Almost half of older adults were diagnosed late (with CD4 cell count &lt;200 <span class=\"nowrap\">cells/microL)</span> compared with a third of younger adults. Older adults who were diagnosed late were 14 times more likely to die within a year of diagnosis compared with older adults who were not diagnosed late (14 versus 1 percent) and were 2.4 times more likely to die than younger adults who were diagnosed late. Of older adults diagnosed between 2000 and 2007, 48 percent acquired their infection when they were &ge;50 years old.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H353725167\"><span class=\"h1\">ANTIRETROVIRAL USE</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H353725173\"><span class=\"h2\">Indications and selection</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Antiretroviral therapy (ART) reduces HIV-related morbidity and mortality, even in individuals with very high CD4 cell counts [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hiv-infection-in-older-adults/abstract/15,16\" class=\"abstract_t\">15,16</a>]. The World Health Organization (WHO) as well as expert groups in the United States and Europe recommend ART for all HIV-infected patients, regardless of CD4 cell count [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hiv-infection-in-older-adults/abstract/17-20\" class=\"abstract_t\">17-20</a>]. A section in the United States Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) guidelines on the treatment of the older HIV-infected patient emphasized this recommendation for universal ART for HIV-infected patients older than 50 years of age because of a higher risk of non-AIDS-related complications in this age group and the reduced immunologic response to ART with advanced age. The strength of the evidence supporting these treatment guidelines and selection of antiretroviral regimens are reviewed in detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=when-to-initiate-antiretroviral-therapy-in-hiv-infected-patients\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;When to initiate antiretroviral therapy in HIV-infected patients&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=selecting-antiretroviral-regimens-for-the-treatment-naive-hiv-infected-patient\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Selecting antiretroviral regimens for the treatment-na&iuml;ve HIV-infected patient&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The choice of the ART regimen should take into account existing medications and comorbidities, particularly liver and kidney disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hiv-infection-in-older-adults/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Polypharmacy, or taking five or more medications, is common in older adults and is a risk factor for adverse drug events, drug-drug interactions, inappropriate medication, delirium, falls, fractures, and poor adherence [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hiv-infection-in-older-adults/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. When treating older HIV-infected patients, cytochrome P450 interactions of protease inhibitors and nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors, as well as P-glycoprotein effects of antiretroviral agents, should be considered to minimize risk for drug-drug interactions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hiv-infection-in-older-adults/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H353725673\" class=\"local\">'Safety and tolerability'</a> below and <a href=\"#H353725747\" class=\"local\">'Polypharmacy'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H353725281\"><span class=\"h2\">Immunologic recovery with ART</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Most studies have demonstrated that, despite successful ART and viral suppression, immune recovery is less robust with increasing age, highlighting the importance of diagnosis and treatment of HIV at an earlier age [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hiv-infection-in-older-adults/abstract/23-28\" class=\"abstract_t\">23-28</a>].</p><p>The following observational studies illustrate the range of findings:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a study of 92,130 HIV-infected adults who initiated ART in Zambia, increased age at ART initiation was associated with worse clinical outcomes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hiv-infection-in-older-adults/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. The median age was 34 years and 6281 (6.8 percent) were aged &ge;50 years. Compared with 16 to 29 year olds, HIV-infected adults in age brackets older than 40 years had reduced CD4 cell count recovery during ART.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Among 12,196 treatment-na&iuml;ve HIV-infected patients who initiated ART and were included in the North American AIDS Cohort Collaboration on Research and Design (NA-ACCORD), the mean baseline CD4 cell count was similar by age [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hiv-infection-in-older-adults/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. The immunologic response after 24 months of treatment decreased with increasing age starting at age 40. Older age did not have an effect on viral suppression in this observational cohort.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A French prospective study that evaluated treatment outcomes in 3015 treatment-na&iuml;ve patients (401 of whom were over age 50) reported that rates of viral suppression were better in older patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hiv-infection-in-older-adults/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. Despite better virologic control, CD4 cell recovery was slower and the risk of clinical progression to an AIDS-defining illness was higher in the older age group (hazard ratio [HR] 1.52; 95% CI 1.2-2.0).</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H353725567\"><span class=\"h2\">Adherence</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Several studies have suggested that older patients with HIV infection tend to be more adherent with medications than younger individuals, with some studies reporting more than 95 percent adherence [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hiv-infection-in-older-adults/abstract/29-33\" class=\"abstract_t\">29-33</a>]. In a retrospective case-control study, 101 HIV-infected patients with a mean age of 57 years were matched to 202 younger HIV-infected patients with a mean age of 33 years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hiv-infection-in-older-adults/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. Older HIV-infected patients were less likely to interrupt ART than younger patients (11 versus 26 percent). It is unclear whether this represented better medication adherence or tolerability. Increased medication exposure translated into better rates of viral suppression (47 versus 34 percent) with comparable immunologic outcomes.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H353725673\"><span class=\"h2\">Safety and tolerability</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There are few studies that have examined the tolerability and safety of ART in older HIV-infected patients, who may have decreased renal and hepatic function and may have other comorbidities, placing them at greater risk of adverse effects. However, these studies were done with older HIV medications, which are less well tolerated than more contemporary antiretroviral agents such as integrase inhibitors. Although there are no recommendations for dose adjustments of antiretroviral agents based on age alone, renal and hepatic function should be carefully assessed in the older HIV-infected patient on an ongoing basis and regimen modifications made accordingly. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-antiretroviral-agents-used-to-treat-hiv\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of antiretroviral agents used to treat HIV&quot;</a>.)</p><p>In one study of HIV-infected patients who initiated a protease-inhibitor (PI)-containing regimen, the majority of patients older than 60 years had switched to a non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI) containing regimen by 24 months of follow-up because of adverse events (64 versus 35 percent of patients younger than 40 years) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hiv-infection-in-older-adults/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>]. Similarly, another study of 508 treatment-na&iuml;ve patients who started ART from 2000 to 2005 reported that the rate of treatment changes due to toxicity was associated with increasing age (for every 10-year increase in age the incidence rate ratio was 1.28, 98% CI 1.04-1.57) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hiv-infection-in-older-adults/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>]. However, in the multivariable analysis, current age was not a significant predictor of this outcome.</p><p>Drug-related toxicity in the older age group may also be related to age-related physiologic changes that alter pharmacokinetics, such as increased adiposity, increased gastric pH, decreased albumin levels, and changes in the cytochrome p450 enzyme system [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hiv-infection-in-older-adults/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>]. Since both NNRTIs and PIs are metabolized by cytochrome p450, older HIV-infected patients may have significantly higher drug exposure when treated with antiretroviral agents. This principle was well illustrated in a study (ACTG 5015) in which HIV-infected patients received ritonavir-boosted lopinavir-based therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hiv-infection-in-older-adults/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>]. Concentrations of lopinavir and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ritonavir-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ritonavir</a> were measured at 24, 36, and 96 weeks. Increasing age was negatively associated with lopinavir clearance, consistent with an age-related loss of Cyp3A4 activity. Changes in drug elimination in aging may lead to increased vulnerability to short- and long-term drug toxicities in this patient population.</p><p>Reduced drug clearance is also associated with heart failure, cirrhosis, or conditions that diminish cardiac output and hepatic blood flow. Higher drug exposure may result in greater drug intolerance <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> organ toxicity.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H353725747\"><span class=\"h2\">Polypharmacy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A high burden of medication use and drug-drug interactions are issues for older patients among the general population who have multiple comorbidities, and are a particular challenge for older HIV-infected patients. A thorough review of all medications and supplements is an important component of care for older HIV-infected patients.</p><p>This issue was highlighted by the findings of a study that reviewed the prescriptions of nearly 1500 HIV-infected patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hiv-infection-in-older-adults/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>]. Patients 50 years and older were more likely to have potential drug-drug interactions compared with younger patients (51 versus 35 percent). Among the older patients, potential interactions with antiretroviral agents occurred mainly with cardiovascular drugs, central nervous system agents (including anxiolytics, antidepressants, and anticonvulsants), and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methadone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">methadone</a>. Similarly, in a study of 89 HIV-infected patients older than 60 years, the median number of medications per patient was 13, and 70 percent of patients had at least one potential category D drug-drug interaction (consider modification) compared with 39 percent of age- and sex-matched HIV-uninfected patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hiv-infection-in-older-adults/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>]. One-third of the drug interactions among HIV-infected patients were between non-antiretroviral medications.</p><p>Specific drug interactions can be reviewed in the Lexi-Interact program included with UpToDate. A general discussion of drug prescribing for older adults, including issues around polypharmacy and a stepwise approach to medication management, are found elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=drug-prescribing-for-older-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Drug prescribing for older adults&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=patient-monitoring-during-hiv-antiretroviral-therapy#H4\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Patient monitoring during HIV antiretroviral therapy&quot;, section on 'General laboratory monitoring'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H536834565\"><span class=\"h1\">HIV-RELATED MORTALITY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Overall, in resource-rich settings, life expectancies of HIV-infected patients successfully treated with antiretroviral therapy (ART) may now be similar to the general population, especially if treatment is started early. In the United States, in part because of the improved survival of HIV-infected patients older than 50 years, the median age at death from HIV infection has accordingly risen [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hiv-infection-in-older-adults/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>] (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F102375\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef102375 \">figure 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F102376\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef102376 \">figure 2</a>). Although earlier studies suggested that older HIV-infected patients had delayed immune recovery in response to ART, more recent data have shown that ART has had a substantial impact on decreasing HIV-related mortality among older HIV-infected adults. (See <a href=\"#H353725281\" class=\"local\">'Immunologic recovery with ART'</a> above.)</p><p>As an example, in one observational study of over 3500 HIV-infected individuals in the United States, the mortality risk reduction associated with initiation of ART at a CD4 cell count threshold of 500 <span class=\"nowrap\">cells/microL</span> rather than 250 to 300 <span class=\"nowrap\">cells/microL</span> was greatest among patients aged 45 to 65 years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hiv-infection-in-older-adults/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>]. Similarly, in a retrospective study from the United Kingdom, ART initiation at CD4 cell counts &lt;200 <span class=\"nowrap\">cells/microL</span> was associated with a greater reduction in mortality among adults &ge;50 years old compared with younger adults (42 versus 12 percent fewer deaths) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hiv-infection-in-older-adults/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>].</p><p>Nevertheless, other studies continue to suggest that older patients have a greater HIV-associated mortality than younger patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hiv-infection-in-older-adults/abstract/23,27,42,43\" class=\"abstract_t\">23,27,42,43</a>]. In a multinational study of 16,534 HIV-infected patients with known duration of HIV infection, the excess mortality associated with HIV infection compared with the general population progressively declined among all age groups since the introduction of ART [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hiv-infection-in-older-adults/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>]. However, there remained an association between increasing age at seroconversion and excess mortality. In the United States, according to surveillance data, the proportion of persons surviving 12 to 36 months following a diagnosis of HIV or AIDS decreases as the age of diagnosis increases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hiv-infection-in-older-adults/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3798191\"><span class=\"h1\">NON-AIDS MORBIDITY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Successful antiretroviral therapy (ART) has lengthened survival in HIV-infected individuals and has led to changing patterns of morbidities and mortality. As deaths from AIDS and opportunistic infections have declined, age-related medical conditions have become more prevalent. In a retrospective analysis of United States health care insurance databases (commercial, Medicaid, and Medicare) between 2003 and 2013 that included over 60,000 HIV-infected patients, essential hypertension (recorded in 31, 39, and 76 percent, respectively), hyperlipidemia (29, 22, and 50 percent), and endocrine disease (22, 27, and 54 percent) were the most common comorbidities [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hiv-infection-in-older-adults/abstract/44\" class=\"abstract_t\">44</a>]. The proportion of patients with each of these diagnoses increased over the ten-year study period and was highest in Medicare beneficiaries. Other reported comorbidities included deep vein thrombosis, hepatitis C virus infection, renal impairment, thyroid disease, and liver disease. </p><p>Overall, HIV-infected patients appear to have a higher risk of such conditions compared with the general population. As an example, in a study of 540 HIV-infected individuals and 524 HIV-uninfected controls &ge;45 years old, HIV infection was independently associated with a higher burden of age-associated comorbidities, including cardiovascular, metabolic, pulmonary, renal, bone, and malignant disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hiv-infection-in-older-adults/abstract/45\" class=\"abstract_t\">45</a>]. The prevalence of each comorbidity documented was numerically higher among HIV-infected individuals, and the differences were statistically significant for hypertension, myocardial infarction, peripheral arterial disease, and impaired renal function. Similarly, another case-control study demonstrated that among HIV-infected patients aged 41 to 50 years, the prevalence of two or more noninfectious comorbidities (&quot;polypathology&quot;) was comparable to that among HIV-uninfected controls aged 51 to 60 years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hiv-infection-in-older-adults/abstract/46\" class=\"abstract_t\">46</a>]. Factors associated with polypathology were nadir CD4 cell count &lt;200 <span class=\"nowrap\">cells/microL,</span> older age, male sex, and prolonged ART exposure.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H602296363\"><span class=\"h2\">Immune activation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The long-term consequences of HIV infection include premature aging, cardiovascular disease, non&ndash;AIDS-associated cancers, osteoporosis, frailty, and neurocognitive decline [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hiv-infection-in-older-adults/abstract/47\" class=\"abstract_t\">47</a>]. These are thought to result from chronic inflammation, immune activation, and immunosenescence [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hiv-infection-in-older-adults/abstract/48\" class=\"abstract_t\">48</a>]. HIV infection causes immune activation with inflammation that is most intense in the early stages of infection and persists throughout the life of the patient. Causes of this persistent inflammatory state are poorly understood, but viral persistence and microbial translocation from the gastrointestinal tract (ie, &quot;leaky gut&quot;) are thought to play important roles [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hiv-infection-in-older-adults/abstract/49\" class=\"abstract_t\">49</a>]. Laboratory markers of inflammation that are elevated during this chronic inflammatory state include interleukin (IL)-6, D-dimer, high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (CRP), and cellular CD14 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hiv-infection-in-older-adults/abstract/50,51\" class=\"abstract_t\">50,51</a>]. As demonstrated in several trials, ART that successfully controls HIV infection reduces these inflammatory markers but does not return them to normal levels [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hiv-infection-in-older-adults/abstract/51,52\" class=\"abstract_t\">51,52</a>].</p><p>Studies have also emphasized the role of untreated HIV infection on aging and have concluded that immune activation results in &quot;immunosenescence&quot; (eg, accelerated aging of T cells) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hiv-infection-in-older-adults/abstract/53,54\" class=\"abstract_t\">53,54</a>].

Premature age-associated neurocognitive decline is related to structural and functional brain changes seen on neuroimaging and on pathology.

Studies evaluating frailty among HIV-infected patients have generally used similar deficits to identify frailty (weight loss, exhaustion, low activity, slowness, weak grip strength) but have defined these deficits differently [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hiv-infection-in-older-adults/abstract/68,69\" class=\"abstract_t\">68,69</a>].

Factors associated with frailty in HIV-infected populations include increased age, low nadir and current CD4 cell count, detectable viremia, non-normal body mass index (BMI), depression, cognitive impairment, and less than high school education [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hiv-infection-in-older-adults/abstract/47,68\" class=\"abstract_t\">47,68</a>].</p><p>Although not specifically developed as a frailty index, the VACS index has also been used to identify multisystem deterioration and susceptibility to adverse outcomes among HIV-infected patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hiv-infection-in-older-adults/abstract/72,73\" class=\"abstract_t\">72,73</a>]. It is based on several objective findings: age, CD4 cell count, HIV RNA level, hemoglobin level, aspartate and alanine aminotransferase levels, platelets, creatinine, and hepatitis C status. The VACS index has correlated with mortality in HIV-infected populations more closely than measures of age, CD4 cell count, and HIV RNA level alone.

Older adults are frequently not perceived as being at risk for HIV and are less likely to be tested. Even when testing for HIV is undertaken in the older patient, the diagnosis is often made later in the natural history of their disease, which increases the risk of opportunistic infections and transmission to others.

The choice of the ART regimen takes into account existing medications, comorbidities, and potential organ system deficits. Older patients may especially be at risk for impaired liver or kidney dysfunction, which should be assessed on an ongoing basis. Additionally, polypharmacy is common in older adults and potential drug-drug interactions are thus critical considerations when selecting and managing ART regimens in older HIV-infected adults.

As deaths from AIDS and opportunistic infections have declined, however, age-associated medical comorbidities, such as cardiovascular, metabolic, liver, bone, and malignant disease, have become more prevalent. These are particularly prevalent in HIV-infected individuals, in part because of chronic inflammation, immune activation, and immunosenescence associated with HIV.
