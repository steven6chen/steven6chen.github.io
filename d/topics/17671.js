Management is often orchestrated by a multidisciplinary team comprised of dermatologists, medical oncologists, and radiation oncologists. The choice of therapy at different time points is largely dependent upon the goals of therapy, which include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Long-term disease control</strong> &ndash; Long-term disease control is the main goal of therapy for most patients with MF. Since most agents have a short duration of response after the cessation of therapy, maintenance therapy that incorporates agents with low toxicity, an absence of cumulative toxicity, and preservation of the immune response is usually preferred, even if these agents have a slower time to response or lower overall response rate than more toxic drugs. (See <a href=\"#H1215601089\" class=\"local\">'Long-term disease control'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Prompt symptom relief</strong> &ndash; Patients who have extreme symptoms limiting quality of life should be considered for therapies with a faster onset of action (eg, radiation), even if the long term control is not as good with these agents. Often faster-acting agents, such as cytotoxic chemotherapy, can depress the host immune response and may decrease the efficacy of immunomodulatory treatments in the future. In addition, patients often benefit from ancillary therapies, including skin-directed therapies, therapies directed at symptoms such as pruritus, and superinfections. (See <a href=\"#H1215605270\" class=\"local\">'Symptom control'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Addressing life threatening (aggressive) disease</strong> &ndash; Patients with clinically aggressive disease are less likely to have long term control with standard regimens and require more aggressive and toxic therapies given with curative intent. (See <a href=\"#H1215605571\" class=\"local\">'Aggressive disease'</a> below.)</p><p/><p>Consensus recommendations regarding the treatment of MF and S&eacute;zary syndrome have been proposed by the US Cutaneous Lymphoma Consortium, National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN), British Association of <span class=\"nowrap\">Dermatologists/United</span> Kingdom Cutaneous Lymphoma Group, European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC), European Society of Medical Oncology (ESMO), and Japanese Dermatologic Association <span class=\"nowrap\">(JDA)/Japanese</span> Skin Cancer Society (JSCS) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-advanced-stage-iib-to-iv-mycosis-fungoides/abstract/2-7\" class=\"abstract_t\">2-7</a>]. Our approach is generally consistent with these guidelines.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1215601089\"><span class=\"h1\">LONG-TERM DISEASE CONTROL</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1215613997\"><span class=\"h2\">Overview of disease management</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Most patients with MF have a chronic clinical course with the application of sequential therapies that keep the disease under control with choice of therapies directed at the type and site of disease (eg, <span class=\"nowrap\">patch/plaque,</span> tumor, erythroderma, extracutaneous disease). Since most agents have a short duration of response after the cessation of therapy, maintenance therapy that incorporates agents with low toxicity and preserves the immune response is usually preferred, even if these agents have a slower time to response or lower overall response rate than more toxic drugs. In contrast, more potent therapy is required for cases with an aggressive clinical presentation. (See <a href=\"#H1215605571\" class=\"local\">'Aggressive disease'</a> below.)</p><p>There is no standard initial therapy, and experts differ in their preferred approach. Patients should be encouraged to participate in clinical trials. (See <a href=\"#H47\" class=\"local\">'Clinical trials'</a> below.)</p><p>Data regarding the efficacy of treatment come largely from retrospective case or cohort studies, or open-label, single arm clinical trials. Very few randomized trials have been performed. As such, it is difficult to accurately compare response, disease-specific survival, and overall survival rates among treatments. In addition, response criteria have changed over time and have not been demonstrated to correlate with prognosis. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=staging-and-prognosis-of-mycosis-fungoides-and-sezary-syndrome\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Staging and prognosis of mycosis fungoides and S&eacute;zary syndrome&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Decisions to continue or switch therapy are made on a clinical basis, incorporating data from the following:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Complete skin examination including a determination of the type of skin lesions and the estimated percentage of total body surface area involved by patches, plaques, and tumor lesions</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Survey of the lymph nodes and assessment for organomegaly</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Complete blood count with manual differential and assessment for S&eacute;zary cells</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Repeat imaging studies that were previously abnormal</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patient and physician perception of disease severity and symptom control. This factor is particularly important as most systemic therapies provide partial, as opposed to complete, responses. </p><p/><p>Patients who demonstrate adequate clinical benefit should be considered for maintenance or taper regimens to maximize response duration. Patients who relapse off therapy may respond to retreatment with the same agent. Patients who relapse on therapy should generally be treated with alternate low toxicity drugs before moving on to more aggressive treatments for refractory disease. Patients whose disease cannot be adequately controlled with lower toxicity agents or who develop aggressive disease refractory to milder agents should be considered potential candidates for allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT), as this is the only known curative therapy for advanced stage MF or S&eacute;zary syndrome (SS). (See <a href=\"#H1215605715\" class=\"local\">'Hematopoietic cell transplantation'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1215597710\"><span class=\"h2\">Cutaneous tumors</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h3\">Limited extent</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>For most patients with cutaneous tumors involving a limited percent body surface area (typically &lt;10 percent), we suggest treatment with local radiation to the tumors plus skin-directed therapy as needed for concurrent <span class=\"nowrap\">patch/plaque</span> disease. Alternatively, systemic therapy similar to that given for more extensive tumor involvement can be used. These two approaches have not been compared directly in a prospective trial. However, a randomized trial demonstrated that there is no advantage in terms of survival to early aggressive combination therapy with radiation and chemotherapy when compared with conservative sequential topical therapies in the management of advanced disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-advanced-stage-iib-to-iv-mycosis-fungoides/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. With either approach, patients with multiple cutaneous tumors have a median survival of 3.5 to 4.0 years, and the majority will die from complications of MF [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-advanced-stage-iib-to-iv-mycosis-fungoides/abstract/9,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,10</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-early-stage-ia-to-iia-mycosis-fungoides\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of early stage (IA to IIA) mycosis fungoides&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Electron beam therapy (EBT) is most commonly used for MF, since lesions are superficial and EBT has a limited depth of penetration, which varies with the electron energy. This is in contrast to photons (x-rays) that penetrate more deeply and are associated with greater risk to deeper tissues. However, in some instances where there is deep infiltration of disease or involvement of an extremity, a better dose distribution can be achieved with photons than with electrons. MF is extremely sensitive to radiation therapy, and radiation results in complete clearance of the tumor in more than 90 percent of cases. For treating individual tumor lesions, doses as low as 8 Gy delivered in a single fraction can achieve long term local control in as many as 95 percent of patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-advanced-stage-iib-to-iv-mycosis-fungoides/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. Total skin electron beam therapy can be considered in patients with limited tumors and extensive <span class=\"nowrap\">patch/plaque</span> disease, and is the most effective way to reduce disease burden in these patients, but may be associated with more side effects than the combination of localized EBT plus other skin-directed therapies. The administration of radiation and associated side effects are presented separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-early-stage-ia-to-iia-mycosis-fungoides#H18\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of early stage (IA to IIA) mycosis fungoides&quot;, section on 'Electron beam therapy'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-early-stage-ia-to-iia-mycosis-fungoides#H17\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of early stage (IA to IIA) mycosis fungoides&quot;, section on 'Radiation therapy'</a> and <a href=\"#H9\" class=\"local\">'Total skin electron beam therapy'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h3\">Generalized tumor</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>For patients with generalized tumors (eg, &gt;10 percent body surface area), equally acceptable treatment options are the use of total skin electron beam therapy (TSEBT), systemic therapies (eg, <span class=\"nowrap\">biologics/immunotherapies,</span> histone deacetylase inhibitors, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=brentuximab-vedotin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">brentuximab vedotin</a> [BV], single-agent chemotherapy) or combination therapies (systemic plus skin-directed or systemic plus systemic). BV can be especially effective for tumor stage disease. TSEBT can be followed by other skin-directed therapies or systemic therapies to prolong response duration. TSEBT often provides a complete response, albeit temporary in most cases, while systemic agents generally provide partial responses but can be given in a maintenance fashion. A choice among these treatments is made based upon patient preference and clinician experience. As an example, patients who live at a significant distance from their medical center may find the frequent visits required for TSEBT difficult and may prefer treatment with an oral systemic agent. In contrast, a choice among systemic therapies must take into account certain comorbidities that may be exacerbated with treatment (eg, hyperlipidemia with retinoids; autoimmune conditions with interferon). Systemic therapies are described in more detail separately. (See <a href=\"#H23\" class=\"local\">'Generalized erythroderma'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h4\">Total skin electron beam therapy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Total skin electron beam therapy (TSEBT) results in a complete response in 44 to 74 percent of patients with tumor (stage IIB) disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-advanced-stage-iib-to-iv-mycosis-fungoides/abstract/12-15\" class=\"abstract_t\">12-15</a>]. TSEBT is typically followed by the use of an adjuvant therapy, either skin-directed (eg, nitrogen mustard or PUVA [psoralen plus ultraviolet A photochemotherapy]) or systemic (eg, interferon alfa, retinoids, or photopheresis), in order to prolong the response duration [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-advanced-stage-iib-to-iv-mycosis-fungoides/abstract/16-18\" class=\"abstract_t\">16-18</a>]. It remains unclear if such adjuvant therapy improves overall survival [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-advanced-stage-iib-to-iv-mycosis-fungoides/abstract/12,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,13</a>].</p><p>TSEBT may be given on a variety of schedules, most commonly variations of the &quot;Stanford technique.&quot; On this schedule, a &quot;cycle&quot; of TSEBT is administered over two days using a six-field technique that delivers a dose of 1.5 to 2.0 Gy to anterior, posterior, and four opposed oblique fields. On the first day, treatment is applied to the anterior and two posterior oblique fields, while the posterior and two anterior oblique fields are treated on the second day. A total dose of 30 to 36 Gy has classically been administered over a 9- to 10-week period. A one-week break may be given after a dose of 18 to 20 Gy has been delivered to provide relief from the generalized skin erythema associated with treatment. Of importance, some areas, such as the top of the scalp, the perineum, the underside of the breasts, panniculus folds, and the soles of the feet, are &quot;shadowed&quot; and may require supplemental treatment.</p><p>The ideal total radiation dose used for TSEBT is unknown. Initial studies used doses as low as 8 Gy and demonstrated high response rates and minimal toxicity, but significant relapse rates. The doses used were gradually increased over time to 30 to 36 Gy, a dose that is associated with greater toxicity but longer remission durations. Subsequent studies have attempted to define an equally effective dose with minimal toxicity. Trials investigating doses as low as 4 Gy have demonstrated unacceptably short response durations (&lt;3 months) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-advanced-stage-iib-to-iv-mycosis-fungoides/abstract/19,20\" class=\"abstract_t\">19,20</a>]. A single center retrospective analysis of TSEBT dose in 102 patients with advanced stage MF demonstrated that TSEBT doses of 10 to &lt;20 Gy and 20 to &lt;30 Gy resulted in similar rates of overall response, survival, progression-free survival, and relapse-free survival when compared with doses of &ge;30 Gy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-advanced-stage-iib-to-iv-mycosis-fungoides/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. Prospective phase II clinical trials report an mSWAT reduction of 61 to 100 percent (median 94 percent) after just 12 Gy with an overall response rate of 88 percent and complete response rate 27 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-advanced-stage-iib-to-iv-mycosis-fungoides/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. These trials also show a duration of clinical benefit defined as time to progressive disease or institution of another total skin or systemic therapy of 42 to 134 weeks (median 71). These lower doses of TSEBT are an attractive option for palliation since they require only three weeks of treatment.</p><p>After the completion of TSEBT, adjuvant therapy with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=mechlorethamine-nitrogen-mustard-topical-gel-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">topical nitrogen mustard</a> (in an ointment base) with or without systemic agents (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=bexarotene-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">bexarotene</a>, photopheresis) is administered for 6 to 12 months. This therapy provides the dual role of treatment for any residual disease and acts as an emollient of the skin, which is often chronically dry after completion of TSEBT.</p><p>Side effects of TSEBT include desquamation, xerosis, and erythema of the skin. These are presented in more detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-early-stage-ia-to-iia-mycosis-fungoides#H27\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of early stage (IA to IIA) mycosis fungoides&quot;, section on 'TSEBT toxicities'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H23\"><span class=\"h2\">Generalized erythroderma</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients with generalized erythroderma (covering at least 80 percent of the body surface area) without any lymph node, visceral, or blood involvement can be treated with skin-directed therapies, systemic therapies, or a combination of the two. Caution must be used in this group because they often have severe pruritus and skin inflammation that can be further irritated by many topical therapies. Standard electron beam therapy (EBT) is generally <strong>not</strong> used because these patients may suffer severe desquamation with total doses as low as 4 Gy. For most patients with generalized erythroderma without additional manifestations, we typically administer both a skin directed therapy (eg, topical steroids) and a systemic therapy (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methotrexate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">methotrexate</a>, retinoids). Other experts use skin-directed therapy alone and then proceed to systemic therapies upon progression or failure of response.</p><p>Topical therapy with nitrogen mustard or corticosteroids is the same as that used for early stage (IA to IIA) MF. Caution must be used in patients with erythroderma because topical therapies can exacerbate pruritus and skin inflammation. The use of topical therapies is presented in more detail separately.

In general, we prefer immune preserving (eg, retinoids, low dose <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methotrexate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">methotrexate</a>) or immunostimulatory (eg, interferon) therapies prior to the use of more toxic regimens [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-advanced-stage-iib-to-iv-mycosis-fungoides/abstract/23,24\" class=\"abstract_t\">23,24</a>]. Most patients will relapse after initial treatment, and relapsed disease may respond to repeated treatment with the same agent, or to other skin-directed or systemic therapies. The choice of systemic therapy is influenced by patient characteristics, prior therapies, likely toxicities, comorbid illnesses, physician experience, and patient preferences. </p><p>A phase 3 study reported superior responses, but higher rates of peripheral neuropathy, among patients with MF who were randomly assigned to treatment with BV compared with the physician's choice of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methotrexate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">methotrexate</a> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=bexarotene-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">bexarotene</a>. (See <a href=\"#H1343743896\" class=\"local\">'Brentuximab vedotin'</a> below.)</p><p>Most other data regarding responses to systemic therapies are derived from modest sized studies that did not directly compare agents. Compared with studies of newer agents (eg, histone deacetylase inhibitors, BV), many older studies of interferon and systemic retinoids used less rigorous or objective response criteria. Furthermore, some patients with MF will experience spontaneous regressions following treatment with placebo [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-advanced-stage-iib-to-iv-mycosis-fungoides/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. </p><p>Patients whose disease cannot be adequately controlled with various systemic therapies are candidates for allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT), as this is the only known curative therapy for advanced stage MF or SS.

Retinoids can be used alone, or more often, in combination with topical steroids, PUVA, or interferon. Retinoids are teratogenic. Common side effects include hyperlipidemia and central hypothyroidism.

IFN can be combined with other systemic (eg, retinoids) or skin-directed (topical agents, PUVA, total skin electron beam therapy) therapy.

(See <a href=\"#H1215597710\" class=\"local\">'Cutaneous tumors'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For most patients with generalized erythroderma without blood involvement, we typically administer both a skin-directed therapy (eg, topical steroids) and a systemic therapy (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methotrexate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">methotrexate</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=bexarotene-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">bexarotene</a>).

Local radiation therapy may be used in conjunction with systemic therapy for local control of visceral disease or lymph node involvement. (See <a href=\"#H1215604950\" class=\"local\">'Lymph node or visceral involvement'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients who have extreme symptoms limiting quality of life should be treated with therapies with a faster onset of action (eg, radiation or therapies for aggressive disease), even if the long term control is not as good with these agents. In addition, patients often benefit from ancillary therapies directed at symptoms related to pruritus and superinfections. (See <a href=\"#H1215605270\" class=\"local\">'Symptom control'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients with clinically aggressive disease are less likely to have long term control with standard regimens and require more aggressive and riskier therapies. For such patients, we use agents with a shorter time to response and a higher response rate. Options include <a href=\"topic.htm?path=romidepsin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">romidepsin</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=brentuximab-vedotin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">brentuximab vedotin</a>, single agent chemotherapy, and combination chemotherapy. Patients with disease that is difficult to control should be considered for allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation with curative intent.
