Spinal shock can last days to weeks after SCI [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anesthesia-for-adults-with-acute-spinal-cord-injury/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Neurogenic shock is part of the spinal shock syndrome and refers to the hemodynamic state, which includes hypotension, bradycardia, and hypothermia, as a result of loss of sympathetic tone after SCI [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anesthesia-for-adults-with-acute-spinal-cord-injury/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H434208\"><span class=\"h2\">Cardiovascular complications</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>ASCI can produce a number of cardiovascular complications including hypotension, bradycardia and other arrhythmias, and early autonomic dysreflexia. Therefore, patients presenting for anesthesia may be in an unstable hemodynamic condition. In addition, patients with SCI may have other traumatic injuries; when appropriate, hemorrhagic shock, cardiac tamponade, and pneumothorax should be ruled out as causes for hypotension.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Neurogenic shock</strong> &ndash; Clinical manifestations of neurogenic shock include hypotension, bradycardia, and hypothermia. SCI that disrupts descending sympathetic pathways results in altered regulation of autonomic cardiovascular function. The predominance of parasympathetic influence causes neurogenic shock, with hypotension and bradycardia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anesthesia-for-adults-with-acute-spinal-cord-injury/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Impaired sympathetic tone reduces vascular resistance in large vascular beds (ie, skeletal muscles and splanchnic vessels), resulting in increased venous capacitance, decreased venous return to the heart, and hypotension. In addition, disruption of cardiac sympathetic influences can leave vagal tone from higher centers unopposed, resulting in bradycardia, bradyarrhythmias, and heart block. Neurogenic shock develops within 30 minutes following injury and may last up to six weeks [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anesthesia-for-adults-with-acute-spinal-cord-injury/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. Orthostatic hypotension can be severe early after injury, even in patients with SCI below T6, with loss of reflex vasoconstriction in skeletal muscle beds [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anesthesia-for-adults-with-acute-spinal-cord-injury/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Neurogenic shock is more common with complete cervical spine injury (19 to 29 percent) than with thoracolumbar and incomplete cervical injury [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anesthesia-for-adults-with-acute-spinal-cord-injury/abstract/4,6-8\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,6-8</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Maintenance of blood pressure (BP) is critical, as hypotension may result in spinal cord hypoperfusion and exacerbate secondary injury to the spinal cord.

Almost all patients with complete cervical SCI will have a resting HR &lt;60 <span class=\"nowrap\">beats/minute</span> (bpm), and approximately 70 percent will have a HR &lt;45 bpm [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anesthesia-for-adults-with-acute-spinal-cord-injury/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. Bradyarrhythmias peak on day 4 after injury, and other hemodynamic abnormalities typically resolve over two to six weeks.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Autonomic dysreflexia</strong> &ndash; Autonomic dysreflexia is a constellation of signs and symptoms of excess sympathetic activity in response to a stimulus below the level of a spinal injury of T6 or higher. It is usually defined as an increase in systolic BP (SBP) of &gt;20 percent, often accompanied by bradycardia or arrhythmias, flushing, sweating, headache, blurred vision, and nasal congestion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anesthesia-for-adults-with-acute-spinal-cord-injury/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. Autonomic dysreflexia is more common in the chronic phase after injury, but it can occur in the acute phase as well [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anesthesia-for-adults-with-acute-spinal-cord-injury/abstract/9-11\" class=\"abstract_t\">9-11</a>]. Patients with severe cervical SCI are at particular risk, with episodes related to somatic pain, abdominal distention, fecal impaction, and bladder distention.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Autonomic dysreflexia should be treated immediately with removal of the stimulus and, if necessary, vasodilating medication in order to prevent complications of severe hypertension. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=chronic-complications-of-spinal-cord-injury-and-disease#H4\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Chronic complications of spinal cord injury and disease&quot;, section on 'Autonomic dysreflexia'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=anesthesia-for-adults-with-chronic-spinal-cord-injury#H747703523\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Anesthesia for adults with chronic spinal cord injury&quot;, section on 'Management of intraoperative autonomic dysreflexia'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Deep vein thrombosis</strong> &ndash; Deep venous thrombosis (DVT) is a common complication of ASCI, and patients are typically treated with antithrombotic therapy and pneumatic compression devices. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acute-traumatic-spinal-cord-injury#H25317506\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Acute traumatic spinal cord injury&quot;, section on 'Venous thromboembolism and pulmonary embolism'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H519833494\"><span class=\"h2\">Pulmonary complications</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Pulmonary complications including ventilatory failure, pneumonia, atelectasis, mucous plugging, pulmonary edema, and pulmonary embolism constitute the most frequent category of complications during acute hospitalization after traumatic SCI and contribute substantively to early morbidity and mortality [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anesthesia-for-adults-with-acute-spinal-cord-injury/abstract/12-16\" class=\"abstract_t\">12-16</a>]. The respiratory complications following SCI vary depending on the level and completeness of injury and preexisting respiratory status.</p><p>High cervical injuries affect the diaphragm and accessory muscles of respiration. Respiratory complications have been reported in 80 percent of patients with injuries above C4 and 60 percent of patients with C5 to C8 injury. Those with complete lesions have a flaccid chest wall, often accompanied by hypoxia and hypoventilation, and usually require immediate endotracheal intubation and mechanical ventilation. Patients with complete mid- to lower-cervical lesions may initially oxygenate and ventilate adequately but often progress to respiratory failure, with the peak time for ventilatory failure at 3 to 4.5 days [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anesthesia-for-adults-with-acute-spinal-cord-injury/abstract/17,18\" class=\"abstract_t\">17,18</a>].</p><p>The sympathectomy associated with injuries above T6 can result in bronchospasm and increased pulmonary secretions, which, when combined with the inability to produce an effective cough, lead to significant mucous plugging, obstruction of bronchioles, pneumonia, increased work of breathing, and ventilator failure.</p><p>Respiratory complications in patients with thoracic SCIs are often related to direct chest trauma (eg, traumatic pneumothorax, flail chest from rib fractures, rupture of the diaphragm or a bronchus, pulmonary contusions or lacerations, or hemopericardium). A high index of suspicion for such injuries should be maintained for patients with thoracic vertebral injuries [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anesthesia-for-adults-with-acute-spinal-cord-injury/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>].</p><p>Respiratory complications following SCI, as well as their management, are discussed in detail separately.

In the acute phase of SCI above the midthoracic level, gastric dilatation with delayed gastric emptying [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anesthesia-for-adults-with-acute-spinal-cord-injury/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>], paralytic ileus [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anesthesia-for-adults-with-acute-spinal-cord-injury/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>], acute gastroduodenal ulceration and hemorrhage [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anesthesia-for-adults-with-acute-spinal-cord-injury/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>], and acute acalculous cholecystitis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anesthesia-for-adults-with-acute-spinal-cord-injury/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>] can all occur as part of spinal shock.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Electrolyte disorders</strong> &ndash; Electrolyte abnormalities have been associated with ASCI. Hyponatremia is common and may relate to disruption of the renal sympathetic pathways that regulate the renin&ndash;angiotensin response [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anesthesia-for-adults-with-acute-spinal-cord-injury/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. Glucose tolerance may be impaired by the stress response or because of administration of glucocorticoids, especially in patients with preexisting diabetes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anesthesia-for-adults-with-acute-spinal-cord-injury/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Urologic complications</strong> &ndash; Patients with SCI are at risk for urinary retention, bladder distension injury, and autonomic dysreflexia, and require bladder catheterization in the acute phase of the injury. A distended bladder is a common stimulus for autonomic dysreflexia. During surgery, the catheter output should be monitored for kinking to avoid bladder distention.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Temperature control</strong> &ndash; The sympathectomy associated with high SCI can cause vasodilation and heat loss below the level of injury. Patients with neurogenic shock are frequently warm to the touch but hypothermic centrally [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anesthesia-for-adults-with-acute-spinal-cord-injury/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. Core temperature should be monitored closely during anesthesia, with in-line fluid warmers and forced-air warming blankets used as necessary. Hyperthermia should be avoided, particularly in patients with associated traumatic brain injury (TBI).</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H519833606\"><span class=\"h1\">ANESTHETIC MANAGEMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Anesthesiologists can be involved in initial airway management for patients with acute spinal cord injury (ASCI), in resuscitation in the intensive care unit (ICU), and in the operating room (OR) for spinal or other surgical procedures.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H435353\"><span class=\"h2\">Preoperative evaluation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Preanesthesia evaluation should be as thorough as the urgency of the situation allows. When possible, the full extent of the patient's injuries, course since injury, and medical history should be reviewed, and an airway assessment and directed physical examination should be performed.</p><p>Other injuries often occur at the time of spinal cord injury (SCI). Facial fractures, TBI, thoracoabdominal trauma, and bony fractures are common and can affect anesthetic management [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anesthesia-for-adults-with-acute-spinal-cord-injury/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. As an example, patients with significantly elevated intracranial pressure (ICP) from an associated TBI may not tolerate prone positioning for instrumentation of spinal fractures until cerebral edema has been treated or has subsided. Similarly, patients who develop severe acute lung injury will also require special perioperative management. In many cases, the anesthesiologist, surgeon, and intensivist must discuss the relative risks and benefits related to the timing of surgery.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H91293164\"><span class=\"h2\">Airway evaluation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In all but the most emergent situations, an airway evaluation should be performed, including assessment of mouth opening, dentition, presence of other facial injuries, head trauma, blood in the airway, and the patient's level of cooperation. Until the cervical spine has been appropriately imaged to rule out an injury in a trauma patient, the anesthesiologist should assume that it is unstable. When possible, spinal imaging should be reviewed.</p><p>The patient may present with the cervical spine immobilized with a halo, a collar, or other devices that may affect the ability to mask ventilate or instrument the airway.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H85321076\"><span class=\"h2\">Choice of anesthetic technique</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In most cases, patients with SCI will require general anesthesia for surgical procedures. For very peripheral procedures (eg, closed reduction of distal extremity fractures, closure of superficial extremity wounds), peripheral nerve block can be utilized if it can be performed without moving the spine and is not otherwise contraindicated.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H435641\"><span class=\"h2\">Monitoring</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Standard monitors (blood pressure [BP] monitoring, pulse oximetry, electrocardiogram [ECG], end-tidal carbon dioxide [ETCO<sub>2</sub>], oxygen [O<sub>2</sub>] analysis, and temperature) are used for all patients having general anesthesia. In addition, patients with high thoracic and cervical spine injuries should usually have BP monitored continually with an intraarterial catheter, which should be placed before induction of anesthesia to allow immediate response to changes in hemodynamics. (See <a href=\"#H435655\" class=\"local\">'Induction of anesthesia'</a> below.)</p><p>In addition to continuous BP monitoring, arterial catheterization facilitates serial blood sampling for laboratory evaluation of hematocrit, coagulation parameters, electrolytes, blood gases, and serum lactate level. Pulse pressure variation of the arterial trace can provide a measure of the patient's volume status [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anesthesia-for-adults-with-acute-spinal-cord-injury/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=intraoperative-fluid-management#H254311286\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Intraoperative fluid management&quot;, section on 'Dynamic hemodynamic parameters'</a>.)</p><p>When neuromonitoring is used during spine surgery, the choice of anesthetic agents must be modified to allow optimal monitoring. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=neuromonitoring-in-surgery-and-anesthesia\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Neuromonitoring in surgery and anesthesia&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H85321105\"><span class=\"h2\">Venous access</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Adequate venous access should be obtained before positioning the patient for surgery. Spine surgery may result in massive blood loss; we place two large-bore intravenous (IV) catheters (if possible, 14- or 16-gauge) for multilevel fusion and instrumentation. We use a fluid warmer in the line connected to the largest IV. (See <a href=\"#H88228645\" class=\"local\">'Temperature management'</a> below.)</p><p>Central venous catheterization may be indicated when necessary for adequate access, and for administration of vasoactive drugs.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H435648\"><span class=\"h2\">Premedication</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Administration of anxiolytic and opioid medications should be done cautiously in ASCI patients as they may have associated TBI, pulmonary contusions, or other conditions that may predispose them to inadequate ventilation and oxygenation. The clinical circumstance and associated injuries should guide the choice of these medications administered immediately prior to surgery. Premedication should be administered in small doses or not at all, titrated to effect (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=midazolam-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">midazolam</a> 1 to 2 mg IV in divided doses).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H85321286\"><span class=\"h2\">Preoxygenation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients should be preoxygenated prior to induction of anesthesia. While a head-up position is often beneficial, particularly for patients at risk for aspiration, patients with high SCI may become hypotensive when placed head-up. If airway management is anticipated to be difficult, and facemask preoxygenation also deemed difficult (eg, facial fractures with awake fiberoptic oral intubation) or ineffective, administration of O<sub>2</sub> via nasal cannulae during airway manipulation may delay oxygen desaturation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anesthesia-for-adults-with-acute-spinal-cord-injury/abstract/28-30\" class=\"abstract_t\">28-30</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H435655\"><span class=\"h2\">Induction of anesthesia</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Induction of anesthesia with IV medication is appropriate for most adults who require general anesthesia. Rarely, induction is performed with inhalation of a volatile anesthetic. Choice of induction agents relates to the plan for airway management, as well as other patient factors. Rapid sequence induction and intubation (RSII) is often indicated for patients with ASCI, though the technique may require modification when difficult airway management is anticipated. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=rapid-sequence-induction-and-intubation-rsii-for-anesthesia\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Rapid sequence induction and intubation (RSII) for anesthesia&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-the-difficult-airway-for-general-anesthesia-in-adults#H881472485\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of the difficult airway for general anesthesia in adults&quot;, section on 'Airway Approach Algorithm'</a>.)</p><p>For patients with acute cervical SCI, we do not routinely apply cricoid pressure during RSII, to avoid cervical spine motion. (See <a href=\"#H435472\" class=\"local\">'Cervical spine motion during airway management'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Induction agents</strong> &ndash; The most common IV anesthesia induction agents are <a href=\"topic.htm?path=propofol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">propofol</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ketamine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ketamine</a>, and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=etomidate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">etomidate</a>.

(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=general-anesthesia-intravenous-induction-agents\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;General anesthesia: Intravenous induction agents&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Patients with thoracic and cervical ASCI are at high risk for hypotension with induction of anesthesia, a result of direct effects of induction agents, hypovolemia, and sympathetic denervation. Doses of induction agents should be reduced for these patients, and hypotension should be avoided to prevent secondary injury to the spinal cord. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=general-anesthesia-intravenous-induction-agents#H4070595924\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;General anesthesia: Intravenous induction agents&quot;, section on 'Dosing considerations'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">We connect a vasopressor infusion to the IV line and often start a low dose (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=phenylephrine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">phenylephrine</a> 20 to 40 <span class=\"nowrap\">mcg/min)</span> prior to or with induction as prophylaxis for hypotension if the patient is not bradycardic, as phenylephrine usually causes reflex bradycardia. For bradycardic patients, we often administer <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ephedrine-systemic-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ephedrine</a> 5 to 15 mg or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=glycopyrrolate-glycopyrronium-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">glycopyrrolate</a> 0.2 to 0.4 mg IV with or without phenylephrine to prevent hypotension.

The target threshold transfusion trigger should be made on a case-by-case basis with consideration of the rate and quantity of expected blood loss, the patient's coexisting illnesses, and the potential for postoperative bleeding into surgical drains. Setting a threshold means that a hematocrit lower than the threshold will have to occur before transfusion is triggered.

With injury above the cardioaccelerator sympathetic innervation (T1 to T4), vasopressors with inotropic and chronotropic properties in addition to vasoconstriction (ie, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dopamine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">dopamine</a>, norepinephrine, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epinephrine-adrenaline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">epinephrine</a>) are often required. Norepinephrine may slightly improve spinal cord perfusion in these patients, compared with dopamine. In a prospective crossover study including 11 patients with cervical and thoracic SCI, norepinephrine was able to maintain MAP with a lower intrathecal pressure (17 mmHg vs 20 mmHg), and a correspondingly slightly higher spinal cord perfusion pressure (67 mmHg versus 65 mmHg), compared with dopamine [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anesthesia-for-adults-with-acute-spinal-cord-injury/abstract/71\" class=\"abstract_t\">71</a>]. Neurologic recovery was not assessed.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">With lower spinal injuries, peripheral sympathectomy and vasodilation often require treatment with a pure vasoconstrictor once euvolemia is achieved (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=phenylephrine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">phenylephrine</a> ).

The surgeon may want to perform a neurologic examination as soon as possible after surgery; the timing and doses of anesthetic and analgesic medication should be tailored to accommodate this request, even if the patient is to remain intubated postoperatively. If the patient requires postoperative mechanical ventilation and the surgeon requests an immediate postoperative neurologic examination, we wean anesthetics such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sufentanil-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">sufentanil</a> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=propofol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">propofol</a> starting up to one hour prior to the end of the procedure, and use low-dose volatile anesthetic thereafter as needed. Use of an electroencephalogram&nbsp;(EEG) obtained from evoked potential monitoring or from a bispectral index (BIS) monitor may be helpful in guiding the depth of anesthetic. Once the patient moves all extremities, we reanesthetize prior to transport to the ICU.

Systemic complications of acute SCI (ASCI) can be widespread and can also include pulmonary, gastrointestinal, urologic, and electrolyte disorders. In addition, deep vein thrombosis and loss of thermoregulation are common. (See <a href=\"#H70549219\" class=\"local\">'Systemic effects of acute spinal cord injury'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>When general anesthesia is required for patients with SCI, a goal for airway and hemodynamic management should be the prevention of secondary injury to the spinal cord.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients with cervical and high thoracic SCI, movement of the cervical spine should be minimized during airway maneuvers and throughout the perioperative period. No technique for airway management has been shown to be superior to others for prevention of neurologic deterioration in the patient with an unstable cervical spine. All airway maneuvers are associated with some degree of cervical spine movement. In general, the degree of movement during careful airway management is small, but the implications of even small movements for patients with SCI are unclear. (See <a href=\"#H435472\" class=\"local\">'Cervical spine motion during airway management'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Our general strategy for airway management of patients with cervical SCI, without considerations required for other injuries, is as follows:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>We suggest the use of manual in-line stabilization (MILS), without traction, during all aspects of airway management (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). MILS reduces spine motion during airway manipulation. When a hard collar is in place for preoperative spine immobilization, MILS should be established, and then the front of the collar may be removed if more space is needed for adequate mouth opening. Once the airway is secured, the collar can be replaced. (See <a href=\"#H85321342\" class=\"local\">'Manual in-line stabilization (MILS)'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>For emergency procedures without anticipated difficulty with airway management, we perform rapid sequence induction and intubation (RSII) with direct laryngoscopy for patients with low thoracic or lumbar SCI. For patients with cervical or high thoracic SCI, we perform RSII with a videolaryngoscope to minimize spine motion and avoid cricoid pressure. (See <a href=\"#H435472\" class=\"local\">'Cervical spine motion during airway management'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>If mask ventilation is required for patients with cervical or high thoracic SCI, when necessary, we insert an oral or nasal airway using outward jaw thrust without neck extension to improve ventilation while minimizing cervical spine movement. (See <a href=\"#H435472\" class=\"local\">'Cervical spine motion during airway management'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>We avoid <a href=\"topic.htm?path=succinylcholine-suxamethonium-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">succinylcholine</a> after 48 hours after injury to avoid severe hyperkalemia. (See <a href=\"#H435655\" class=\"local\">'Induction of anesthesia'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>For nonemergent procedures, we perform RSII as indicated by the patient's clinical condition. When RSII is not required, we perform flexible scope intubation (FSI) or indirect laryngoscopy with a videolaryngoscope.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Our decision to intubate awake or asleep depends on the level of patient cooperation and the expected degree of difficulty with all aspects of airway management. (See <a href=\"#H1841501\" class=\"local\">'Awake versus asleep intubation'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Blood pressure (BP) should be carefully managed in patients with ASCI to preserve spinal cord perfusion and prevent secondary SCI. We suggest maintenance of a mean arterial pressure (MAP) of 85 to 90 mmHg for five to seven days after acute cervical SCI (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">We reduce the dose of anesthetic induction agents for these patients and often start a low-dose <a href=\"topic.htm?path=phenylephrine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">phenylephrine</a> infusion (eg, 20 to 40 <span class=\"nowrap\">mcg/min)</span> during induction for patients without bradycardia. For bradycardic patients, we often administer <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ephedrine-systemic-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ephedrine</a> 5 to 15 mg or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=glycopyrrolate-glycopyrronium-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">glycopyrrolate</a> 0.2 to 0.4 mg IV with or without phenylephrine to prevent hypotension. (See <a href=\"#H435655\" class=\"local\">'Induction of anesthesia'</a> above.) &#160;</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>All patients with ASCI require initial volume resuscitation starting with intravenous (IV) crystalloid, with addition of colloid and blood products as necessary. Many will require administration of vasopressors <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> inotropes for BP support. (See <a href=\"#H4706801\" class=\"local\">'Hemodynamic management'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The plan for postoperative care of patients with ASCI depends on the level of injury, associated injuries, the intraoperative course, and the need for immediate postoperative neurologic assessment. Many patients with severe cervical cord injuries remain intubated and require mechanical ventilation and intensive care.
