All trauma patients require a systematic approach to management to maximize outcomes and reduce the risk of undiscovered injuries.</p><p>This review will discuss the initial management of adult trauma patients. The management of pediatric trauma patients and specific injuries are reviewed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=trauma-management-approach-to-the-unstable-child\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Trauma management: Approach to the unstable child&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=trauma-management-unique-pediatric-considerations\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Trauma management: Unique pediatric considerations&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=initial-evaluation-of-shock-in-the-adult-trauma-patient-and-management-of-non-hemorrhagic-shock\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Initial evaluation of shock in the adult trauma patient and management of NON-hemorrhagic shock&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1929654\"><span class=\"h1\">EPIDEMIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Trauma is a leading cause of mortality globally [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initial-management-of-trauma-in-adults/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Worldwide, road traffic injuries are the leading cause of death between the ages of 18 and 29, while in the United States, trauma is the leading cause of death in young adults and accounts for 10 percent of all deaths among men and women [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initial-management-of-trauma-in-adults/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Over 45 million people sustain moderate to severe disability each year due to trauma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initial-management-of-trauma-in-adults/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. In the United States alone, more than 50 million patients receive some form of trauma-related medical care annually, and trauma accounts for approximately 30 percent of all intensive care unit (ICU) admissions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initial-management-of-trauma-in-adults/abstract/3,4\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,4</a>].</p><p>According to the World Health Organization (WHO), road traffic injuries accounted for 1.25 million deaths in 2014, and trauma is expected to rise to the third leading cause of disability worldwide by 2030 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initial-management-of-trauma-in-adults/abstract/1,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,5</a>]. Outside areas of armed conflict, penetrating injuries are responsible for fewer than 15 percent of traumatic deaths worldwide [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initial-management-of-trauma-in-adults/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>], but these rates vary by country. As examples, while homicide accounts for as many as 45 percent of deaths in Los Angeles, penetrating injuries account for only 13 percent of deaths in Norway [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initial-management-of-trauma-in-adults/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. Approximately half of traumatic deaths result from central nervous system (CNS) injury, while a third result from exsanguination [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initial-management-of-trauma-in-adults/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].</p><p>Patients with serious traumatic injuries have a significantly lower likelihood of mortality or morbidity (10.4 versus 13.8 percent; relative risk [RR] 0.75, 95% CI 0.60-0.95) when treated at a designated trauma center [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initial-management-of-trauma-in-adults/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. Older age, obesity, and major comorbidities are associated with worse outcomes following trauma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initial-management-of-trauma-in-adults/abstract/10-18\" class=\"abstract_t\">10-18</a>]. In trauma patients with significant hemorrhage, a lower score on the Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) and older age are both independently associated with increased mortality, according to multivariable logistic regression analysis of two large databases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initial-management-of-trauma-in-adults/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. In a large retrospective study from the United States National Trauma Data Bank, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=warfarin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">warfarin</a> use was associated with an approximately 70 percent increased risk of mortality following trauma, after adjusting for other important risk factors (odds ratio [OR] 1.72; 95% CI 1.63-1.81) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initial-management-of-trauma-in-adults/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>].</p><p>While the most common causes of mortality from trauma are hemorrhage, multiple organ dysfunction syndrome, and cardiopulmonary arrest [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initial-management-of-trauma-in-adults/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>], the most common preventable causes of morbidity are unintended extubation, technical surgical failures, missed injuries, and intravascular catheter-related complications [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initial-management-of-trauma-in-adults/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>].</p><p>Relatively few patients die after the first 24 hours following injury. Rather, the majority of deaths occur either at the scene or within the first four hours after the patient reaches a trauma center [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initial-management-of-trauma-in-adults/abstract/23,24\" class=\"abstract_t\">23,24</a>].</p><p>The &quot;golden hour&quot; concept, which emphasized the increased risk of death and the need for rapid intervention during the first hour of care following major trauma, was described in early trauma studies and has been promulgated in textbooks and instructional courses [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initial-management-of-trauma-in-adults/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. Undoubtedly, there are instances when rapid intervention improves the outcome of injured patients (eg, obstructed airway, tension pneumothorax, severe hemorrhage), especially in battlefield injuries [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initial-management-of-trauma-in-adults/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. However, the relationship between timing and mortality may be more complex than once thought. In a large study using registries from multiple trauma centers across North America, no association between emergency medical services (EMS) intervals (eg, on scene and transport times) and trauma patient mortality was found [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initial-management-of-trauma-in-adults/abstract/27,28\" class=\"abstract_t\">27,28</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1929661\"><span class=\"h1\">MECHANISM</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Particular mechanisms predispose patients to specific injuries. Common blunt trauma mechanisms and their most frequently associated injuries are described in the accompanying table (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F50454\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef50454 \">table 1</a>). In addition, certain high-risk blunt mechanisms, including pedestrians struck by automobiles, motorcycle accidents, severe motor vehicle accidents (eg, extensive damage leading to prolonged extrication time), and falls greater than 20 feet, have been associated with greater morbidity and mortality [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initial-management-of-trauma-in-adults/abstract/29-32\" class=\"abstract_t\">29-32</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1929668\"><span class=\"h1\">PREPARATION</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1929676\"><span class=\"h2\">Pre-arrival preparation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Whenever possible, emergency medical services (EMS) should notify the receiving hospital that a trauma patient is en route. This provides the receiving hospital with information and time that can be crucial to the management of the severely injured patient.</p><p>Ideally, the information provided by EMS includes:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patient age and sex</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Mechanism of injury</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Vital signs (some clinicians ask for the lowest blood pressure and highest pulse)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Apparent injuries</p><p/><p>Early notification enables emergency department (ED) staff to do the following:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Notify additional personnel (eg, ED staff, trauma surgery, obstetrics, orthopedics, radiology, interpreter services)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Assure resources are available (eg, ultrasound, CT, operating room space)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Prepare for anticipated procedures (eg, tracheal intubation, chest tube)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Prepare for blood transfusion</p><p/><p>In addition, information provided by EMS prior to arrival can help hospital-based clinicians focus on more likely injuries (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F50454\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef50454 \">table 1</a>). As an example, a description of a feet-first fall from great height raises suspicion for fractures of the calcaneus, lower extremity, and lumbar spine; similarly, report of a prolonged motor vehicle extrication due to collapse of the driver's side compartment raises concern for injuries such as rib fractures, pulmonary contusion, and lacerations of the spleen and kidney.</p><p>Universal precautions against blood and fluid borne diseases should be part of the trauma team's preparation. These include gloves, gowns, masks, and eye protection for all members of the team involved in the resuscitation. Lead shields for staff should be available if portable x-rays are to be performed during resuscitation efforts.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1929683\"><span class=\"h2\">Trauma team</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In rural hospitals, the trauma team may be limited to one physician and a nurse. In such settings, the team might enlist help from EMS personnel or other clinicians to manage critically ill or multiple patients. Teams at major trauma centers may include emergency physicians, trauma surgeons, subspecialist surgeons, emergency nurses, respiratory therapists, technicians, and social workers. Regardless of the setting, all teams must have a clearly designated leader who determines the overall management plan and assigns specific tasks. While leaders of smaller teams might find themselves having to perform procedures in order to care effectively for their patients, leaders of larger teams should avoid performing procedures. This allows the leader to remain focused on their supervisory responsibilities and on the patient and possible changes in their condition.</p><p>Regardless of setting or team composition, optimal care of a trauma patient requires effective and efficient communication and teamwork among all members [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initial-management-of-trauma-in-adults/abstract/33,34\" class=\"abstract_t\">33,34</a>]. Good care begins with a pre-arrival briefing and the assignment of general roles and specific tasks, and continues throughout the resuscitation as the team uses closed loop communication and maintains a common vision of the plan of care. Notably, it is important to include the alert patient (or health care proxy) in this communication, keeping them informed of the plan of care and any changes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initial-management-of-trauma-in-adults/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>]. </p><p>Breakdowns in the care plan and medical mismanagement typically occur due to one or more of four potential problems [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initial-management-of-trauma-in-adults/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Communication breakdowns (eg, changes in the patient's physiologic state or critical test results are not effectively communicated, overall management plan or priority of tasks is not conveyed clearly by the team leader)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Failures in situational awareness (eg, failure to recognize shock, failure to anticipate blood transfusion needs, failure to modify standard management for higher risk patients)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Staffing or workload distribution problems (eg, insufficiently trained staff conducting a procedure, inadequate staff for patient volume)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Unresolved conflicts (eg, unresolved hostility about other team members perceived to be performing inadequately, disagreement about overall management plan, disagreement among senior clinicians vying for team leadership)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1929690\"><span class=\"h1\">PRIMARY EVALUATION AND MANAGEMENT</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1929698\"><span class=\"h2\">Overview</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A clear, simple, and organized approach is needed when managing a severely injured patient. The primary survey promulgated in Advanced Trauma Life Support&trade; (ATLS&trade;) provides such an approach [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initial-management-of-trauma-in-adults/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. The primary survey is organized according to the injuries that pose the most immediate threats to life and is performed in the order described below. In settings with limited resources, the primary survey simplifies priorities and any problems identified should be managed immediately before moving on to the next step of the survey. However, at major trauma centers, many capable clinicians may be present, allowing the team to address multiple problems simultaneously.</p><p>The primary survey consists of the following steps:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>A</strong>irway assessment and protection (maintain cervical spine stabilization when appropriate)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>B</strong>reathing and ventilation assessment (maintain adequate oxygenation)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>C</strong>irculation assessment (control hemorrhage and maintain adequate end-organ perfusion)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>D</strong>isability assessment (perform basic neurologic evaluation)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>E</strong>xposure, with environmental control (undress patient and search everywhere for possible injury, while preventing hypothermia)</p><p/><p>Keep the following points in mind while performing the primary survey:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Airway obstruction is a major cause of death immediately following trauma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initial-management-of-trauma-in-adults/abstract/27,33\" class=\"abstract_t\">27,33</a>]. The airway may be obstructed by the tongue, a foreign body, aspirated material, tissue edema, or expanding hematoma.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Definitive guidelines for tracheal intubation in trauma do not exist. When in doubt, it is generally best to intubate early, particularly in patients with hemodynamic instability, or those with significant injuries to the face or neck, which may lead to swelling and distortion of the airway.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Once an airway has been established, it is important to secure it well and to ensure it is not dislodged any time the patient is moved. Unintended extubation is the most common preventable cause of morbidity in trauma patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initial-management-of-trauma-in-adults/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Unconscious patients with small pneumothoraces that are not visible or missed on the initial chest radiograph may develop tension physiology after tracheal intubation from positive pressure ventilation. It is important to reauscultate the lungs of trauma patients who develop hemodynamic instability after being intubated and to be attentive to ventilator pressure alarms.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Hemorrhage is the most common preventable cause of mortality in trauma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initial-management-of-trauma-in-adults/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. Be alert for subtle signs of hemorrhagic shock, particularly in the elderly, who may be on cardiovascular medications that blunt such signs, and young, healthy adults who may not present with obvious manifestations. Hypotension generally does not manifest until at least 30 percent of the patient's blood volume has been lost [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initial-management-of-trauma-in-adults/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>]. Such patients are at high risk of death. Elderly patients may be hypotensive relative to their baseline blood pressure but still have blood pressure measurements in the &quot;normal&quot; range. A single episode of hypotension substantially increases the likelihood that a serious injury has occurred [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initial-management-of-trauma-in-adults/abstract/37,38\" class=\"abstract_t\">37,38</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=initial-evaluation-of-shock-in-the-adult-trauma-patient-and-management-of-non-hemorrhagic-shock#H6\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Initial evaluation of shock in the adult trauma patient and management of NON-hemorrhagic shock&quot;, section on 'Recognition of shock'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=geriatric-trauma-initial-evaluation-and-management\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Geriatric trauma: Initial evaluation and management&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Brain injuries are common in patients who have sustained severe blunt trauma and even a single episode of hypotension increases their risk of death [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initial-management-of-trauma-in-adults/abstract/36,39\" class=\"abstract_t\">36,39</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1929705\"><span class=\"h2\">Airway</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Severely injured patients can develop airway obstruction or inadequate ventilation leading to hypoxia and death within minutes. Observational studies suggest that airway obstruction is a major cause of preventable death among trauma patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initial-management-of-trauma-in-adults/abstract/40,41\" class=\"abstract_t\">40,41</a>]. Therefore, airway evaluation and management remain the critical first steps in the treatment of any severely injured patient [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initial-management-of-trauma-in-adults/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>].</p><p>Several studies suggest that checklists improve the efficiency and reduce the complications associated with airway management of trauma patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initial-management-of-trauma-in-adults/abstract/42-45\" class=\"abstract_t\">42-45</a>]. In a prospective study of 141 intubated trauma patients, implementation of pre-arrival and pre-induction preparation checklists reduced intubation-related complication rates by 7.7 percent (95% CI 0.5-14.8) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initial-management-of-trauma-in-adults/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>]. A sample checklist is provided in the accompanying table (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F106208\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef106208 \">table 2</a>).</p><p>Maintaining the patient&rsquo;s stretcher at a slight angle with the head slightly elevated (reverse Trendelenburg position) or elevating just the head to about 30 degrees if cervical spine precautions are not required can help to decrease the risk of aspiration and improve lung capacity by reducing abdominal pressure on the chest. &#160;</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11715783\"><span class=\"h3\">Assessment</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In a conscious patient, initial airway assessment can be performed as follows [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initial-management-of-trauma-in-adults/abstract/46\" class=\"abstract_t\">46</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Begin by asking the patient a simple question (eg, &quot;What is your name?&quot;). A clear accurate response verifies the patient's ability to mentate, phonate, and to protect their airway, at least temporarily.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Observe the face, neck, chest, and abdomen for signs of respiratory difficulty, including tachypnea, accessory or asymmetric muscle use, abnormal patterns of respiration, and stridor.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Inspect the oropharyngeal cavity for disruption; injuries to the teeth or tongue; blood, vomitus, or pooling secretions. Note if there are obstacles to the placement of a laryngoscope and endotracheal tube.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Inspect and palpate the anterior neck for lacerations, hemorrhage, crepitus, swelling, or other signs of injury. Palpation of the neck also enables identification of the landmarks for cricothyrotomy.</p><p/><p>In the unconscious patient, the airway must be protected immediately once any obstructions (eg, foreign body, vomitus, displaced tongue) are removed. Management of the airway generally and in a patient with direct airway trauma is discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=emergency-airway-management-in-the-adult-with-direct-airway-trauma\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Emergency airway management in the adult with direct airway trauma&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=penetrating-neck-injuries-initial-evaluation-and-management\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Penetrating neck injuries: Initial evaluation and management&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=advanced-emergency-airway-management-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Advanced emergency airway management in adults&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=rapid-sequence-intubation-for-adults-outside-the-operating-room\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Rapid sequence intubation for adults outside the operating room&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Airway management in a trauma patient unable to protect his or her airway is completed in an expedient yet controlled fashion. When possible, perform a brief preintubation assessment to gauge the potential difficulty of intubation and determine basic baseline neurologic function (eg, pupillary light reflex, movement of extremities). Methods and mnemonics to assess airway difficulty are reviewed separately, but the application of the LEMON mnemonic to trauma patients is described here. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=approach-to-the-difficult-airway-in-adults-outside-the-operating-room\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Approach to the difficult airway in adults outside the operating room&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>L</strong>: LOOK: Facial and neck injuries can distort external and internal structures making it difficult to visualize the glottis or insert an endotracheal tube.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>E</strong>: EVALUATE 3-3-2: This refers to the intraoral, mandibular, and hyoid-to-thyroid notch distances (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F60507\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef60507 \">picture 1</a>). The cervical collar must be opened to make these assessments. The distances referred to can be narrowed by fracture, hematoma, or other anatomic distortions (eg, soft tissue swelling).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>M</strong>: MALLAMPATI: A standard calculation of the Mallampati score cannot be performed in many trauma patients; injured patients requiring emergent intubation often cannot open their mouths spontaneously (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F75229\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef75229 \">figure 1</a>). Nevertheless, an effort should be made to determine how much of the retropharynx can be seen and whether injuries of the oropharynx or pooled blood, vomitus, or secretions are present.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>O</strong>: <span class=\"nowrap\">OBSTRUCTION/OBESITY:</span> Either factor can interfere with visualization and management of the traumatized airway.

Once the cervical collar is removed by a second skilled provider, that provider should stabilize the spine while orotracheal intubation is performed. It is important to note that the risk of neurologic injury from hypoxemia is much greater than the risk of spinal injury due to neck extension during intubation. Judicious relaxation of immobilization may be necessary in some cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initial-management-of-trauma-in-adults/abstract/46\" class=\"abstract_t\">46</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11715776\"><span class=\"h3\">Difficult airway devices</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Devices for difficult airway management are discussed separately.

Nevertheless, many trauma patients require intubation for immediate airway protection or because of the projected disease course. Intubation improves oxygenation, thereby helping to meet increased physiologic demands, and allows for testing and procedures to be performed more easily and with less patient discomfort. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=the-decision-to-intubate\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;The decision to intubate&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Ideally, airway managers should have a predetermined back-up plan with all necessary tools at the bedside, including rescue airways and a cricothyrotomy kit, before proceeding with intubation. In crash scenarios, this may not be possible. A sample checklist to assist with airway management of the adult trauma patient is provided in the accompanying table (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F106208\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef106208 \">table 2</a>).</p><p>Clinicians should consider the expected course of disease and need for interventions when deciding to secure an airway. Patients often warrant early intubation to ensure airway protection or to allow for deeper sedation and pain control. Examples of this include: a patient who is hemodynamically stable for the moment but at risk of deterioration and who requires a complex diagnostic study that must be performed in a remote radiology suite; and a patient with significant injury in imminent need of an orthopedic or other painful procedure. Critically ill trauma patients at risk for hypotension following sedation and paralysis for intubation should be treated aggressively prior to intubation. Post-intubation hypotension should be anticipated and mitigated as much as possible. In a retrospective review of 444 patients, in-hospital mortality was nearly doubled for those who had a single episode of post-intubation hypotension compared with those who did not (29.8 versus 15.9 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initial-management-of-trauma-in-adults/abstract/51\" class=\"abstract_t\">51</a>].</p><p>The performance of rapid sequence intubation and direct laryngoscopy are discussed separately.

In unstable patients, obtain a portable chest radiograph. Tension pneumothorax, massive hemothorax, and cardiac tamponade are immediate threats to life that should be identified at this stage of the primary survey. Ultrasound can provide important information about all these diagnoses during this portion of the assessment. (See <a href=\"#H11715769\" class=\"local\">'Ultrasound (FAST exam)'</a> below and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=emergency-ultrasound-in-adults-with-abdominal-and-thoracic-trauma\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Emergency ultrasound in adults with abdominal and thoracic trauma&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Presumptively treat patients exhibiting signs of tension pneumothorax, including hypotension, dyspnea, and ipsilateral decreased breath sounds, with needle decompression before obtaining imaging. Delays to obtain a portable chest radiograph can cause significant morbidity. If confirmation is needed prior to treatment, ultrasound can be performed rapidly at the bedside, and it is more sensitive than plain radiograph for detecting pneumothorax [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initial-management-of-trauma-in-adults/abstract/59\" class=\"abstract_t\">59</a>]. Needle decompression is performed with a large bore (14 gauge or larger) angiocatheter, either in the second intercostal space in the midclavicular line or in the fifth intercostal space in the midaxillary line. If equipment is immediately available, it is appropriate to proceed directly to chest tube insertion without intervening needle decompression.</p><p>Of note, a standard 14-gauge angiocatheter cannot penetrate the chest wall and reach the pleural space in 10 to 33 percent of trauma patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initial-management-of-trauma-in-adults/abstract/60\" class=\"abstract_t\">60</a>]. A 10-gauge, 7.5 cm (3 inch) armored angiocatheter is able to penetrate the pleural space in most instances. Needle decompression is followed immediately by tube thoracostomy.

If a carotid or femoral pulse is verified and no obvious exsanguinating external injury is noted, circulation may momentarily be assumed to be intact; completion of the primary survey should not be delayed by the determination of an exact blood pressure.</p><p>While circulation is assessed, two large-bore (16 gauge or larger) intravenous (IV) catheters are placed, most often in the antecubital fossa of each arm, and blood is drawn for testing, particularly for blood typing and crossmatch. Intraosseous cannulation or central venous catheter placement (ideally under ultrasound guidance) can be performed if there is difficulty establishing peripheral IV access. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=intraosseous-infusion\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Intraosseous infusion&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Life-threatening hemorrhage must be controlled. A combination of manual pressure, proximal compression with either a tourniquet or a manual blood pressure cuff, and elevation is typically sufficient to control external arterial hemorrhage. When these are unsuccessful, hemostatic agents may be used, if available. Venous bleeding is controlled with direct pressure. Bleeding from severe pelvic injuries may require the application of a pelvic binder. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pelvic-trauma-initial-evaluation-and-management#H24\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pelvic trauma: Initial evaluation and management&quot;, section on 'Management'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=initial-management-of-moderate-to-severe-hemorrhage-in-the-adult-trauma-patient#H2547238854\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Initial management of moderate to severe hemorrhage in the adult trauma patient&quot;, section on 'Hemostatic agents'</a>.)</p><p>Emergency thoracotomy may be needed for trauma patients without femoral or carotid pulses. The procedure is most effective for victims of stab wounds to the chest who have pulses or other witnessed signs of life (eg, voluntary movement) initially. It is rarely beneficial in patients with blunt trauma or when performed in facilities without ready access to appropriate surgical care. Of note, trauma patients who require cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) within one hour of hospital arrival have a low rate of survival to hospital discharge (only 13 percent in one study [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initial-management-of-trauma-in-adults/abstract/61\" class=\"abstract_t\">61</a>]), so maintaining perfusion and the need for CPR is exceptionally important.

Use of this device is most effective to temporize patients with intra-abdominal or retroperitoneal sources of hemorrhage until more definitive therapy with surgery or angioembolization is possible, and so rapid transport to the operating room <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> angiographic suite is essential. REBOA is not appropriate for use in those with suspected thoracic sources of exsanguination or in patients in cardiac arrest, in whom EDT should be performed instead.

Initial fluid resuscitation for these patients may consist of a bolus of intravenous crystalloid (eg, 20 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/kg</span> isotonic saline). However, patients with obvious severe or ongoing blood loss should be transfused immediately with type O blood (women of childbearing age should be transfused with O negative blood). While mildly unstable patients may be treated with isotonic crystalloid in lieu of blood, unnecessary infusion of crystalloid should be avoided [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initial-management-of-trauma-in-adults/abstract/65\" class=\"abstract_t\">65</a>]. Fluid resuscitation, including the appropriate use of delayed fluid resuscitation and transfusion of the trauma patient in shock are discussed separately.

Significant hemorrhage occurs in any of five sites: external, intrathoracic, intraperitoneal, retroperitoneal, and pelvic or long bone fractures. If transfusion is required, a 1:1:1 ratio of plasma, platelets, and red cells should be targeted [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initial-management-of-trauma-in-adults/abstract/66\" class=\"abstract_t\">66</a>]. Patients requiring transfusion may benefit from treatment with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tranexamic-acid-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">tranexamic acid</a> if it is given within three hours of injury.

Furthermore, data suggest that the traditional threshold of a systolic blood pressure below 90 mmHg to define shock is inaccurate [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initial-management-of-trauma-in-adults/abstract/68-71\" class=\"abstract_t\">68-71</a>]. The appropriate systolic or mean arterial blood pressure threshold for defining shock varies by age.

This decision is based upon the patient's response to initial resuscitation measures, their probable injuries and anticipated operative intervention, and the proximity of the CT scanner to the resuscitation bay.

Criteria for transfer are based upon the patient's demographics, mechanism of injury, and clinical findings.

Often such studies must be repeated at the receiving facility.</p><p>Computed tomography (CT) imaging should only be obtained in patients who might otherwise be appropriately treated at the initial facility. If a negative CT would allow the patient to be discharged, it should be performed, but if that patient requires transfer regardless of the results, then transfer should not be delayed. Likewise, procedures and other interventions should only be performed to treat emergency conditions or prevent possible patient deterioration during transport. Endotracheal intubation, tube thoracostomy, and pelvis fracture stabilization are common examples of necessary interventions; laceration repair, unless it is performed to prevent exsanguination, is not. For hemodynamically unstable patients, blood &ndash; if available &ndash; should be transfused. Transfusion can begin at the initial facility or be performed during transport by sending units of blood with the emergency transport team.</p><p>The decision of when to transfer an unstable patient should ideally be made by the transferring and receiving physicians in collaboration. Clear communication is critical: the transmission of vital information allows receiving clinicians to mobilize needed resources while the inadvertent omission of such information can delay definitive care.
