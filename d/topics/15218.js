The gap between allograft supply and demand continues to widen despite initiatives to expand the use of nonstandard deceased-donor allografts.</p><p>The increased use of organs from living donors is one strategy that addresses the need for transplants. However, rates of living kidney donation declined 17 percent from 2004 to 2014 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/risk-of-living-kidney-donation/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. The trend of decline is predominantly due to a decline in living, related donation. Although unrelated kidney donations have increased since 2007 and living donation has increased modestly after 2014, the increase is not sufficient to compensate for the decline in living, related donation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/risk-of-living-kidney-donation/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p>Gender imbalances in rates of living donation are well described. In the US, more than half of living donors are women, and disparities are higher when considered in terms of base population rate: 30 per million population (pmp) in women versus 19 pmp in men [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/risk-of-living-kidney-donation/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. In one study, although donation declined in both men and women in lower income levels over the study period, the decline was larger among men and spanned all but the highest income levels [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/risk-of-living-kidney-donation/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>], suggesting that concern for financial impact may affect donation rates.</p><p>Recipients of allografts from living donors enjoy a significant graft survival advantage over those who receive deceased-donor grafts. In addition, living-donor transplants may be performed with minimal delay and controlled scheduling, providing opportunity for pre-emptive transplantation (transplantation prior to dialysis) or transplantation early in a recipient's course of renal failure. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=risk-factors-for-graft-failure-in-kidney-transplantation\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Risk factors for graft failure in kidney transplantation&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dialysis-issues-prior-to-and-after-renal-transplantation\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Dialysis issues prior to and after renal transplantation&quot;</a>.)</p><p>However, donor nephrectomy exposes the donor to risks associated with surgery. In addition, some studies have suggested that living kidney donation may confer small but measurable increases in the risks of hypertension, preeclampsia, gout, and end-stage renal disease (ESRD).</p><p>In February 2013, the Organ Procurement and Transplantation Network (OPTN) implemented policy requirements for all living kidney donor recovery hospitals in the United States in order to promote consistency in the informed consent, medical and psychosocial evaluation, and follow-up of living donors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/risk-of-living-kidney-donation/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. In 2014, these requirements were incorporated within global policies for living donors. These policies define the minimum general and kidney-specific requirements for the evaluation and acceptance of living kidney donor candidates. These requirements are generally expanded upon at individual transplant programs, based on local experience or clinical practice guidelines [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/risk-of-living-kidney-donation/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>], and may be tailored for individual donor characteristics.</p><p>The risks associated with living kidney donation are discussed in this topic review. The evaluation of a living kidney donor candidate, including the OPTN requirements, is discussed elsewhere (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-of-the-living-kidney-donor-candidate\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation of the living kidney donor candidate&quot;</a>). The evaluation of the renal transplant recipient is discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-of-the-potential-renal-transplant-recipient\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation of the potential renal transplant recipient&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3392735\"><span class=\"h1\">OVERVIEW</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The complications from kidney donation can be divided into those arising immediately from the nephrectomy surgery and those that may emerge many years after the kidney was donated. There are also risks associated with the evaluation itself, chiefly including the risks of discovery (such as misattributed paternity, health conditions that could have implications for insurance, and reportable infections).</p><p>The Organ Procurement and Transplant Network (OPTN) policy defines minimum requirements for elements that must be discussed and documented in the informed consent of living donors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/risk-of-living-kidney-donation/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3392772\"><span class=\"h2\">Immediate risk</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The most important perioperative risks due to donor nephrectomy include the following:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Hemorrhage</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Ileus</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pneumothorax</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pneumonia</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Urinary tract infection</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Wound complications including hernia</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Deep vein thrombosis with or without pulmonary embolism</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Death</p><p/><p>Based on integration of national US donor registry data from 2008 to 2012 with administrative records from a consortium of 98 academic hospitals, one study found that 16.8 percent of donors experienced a diagnosis or procedure for a perioperative complication, most commonly gastrointestinal (4.4 percent), bleeding (3 percent), respiratory (2.5 percent), and <span class=\"nowrap\">surgical/anesthesia-related</span> injuries (2.4 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/risk-of-living-kidney-donation/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. However, major complications affected only 2.5 percent of donors. After adjustment for demographic, clinical (including comorbidities), procedure, and center factors, compared with white donors, African Americans had a 26 percent increased risk of experiencing any complication and a 56 percent increased risk of experiencing major complications. Other significant correlates of major complications included obesity, predonation blood disorders, psychiatric conditions, and robotic nephrectomy, while greater annual hospital volume predicted lower risk.</p><p>Surgical mortality with living kidney donation is very low. In one study of over 80,000 living kidney donors, 90-day mortality was 3.1 per 10,000 donors, a rate that was unchanged over 15 years (1994 to 2009) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/risk-of-living-kidney-donation/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].</p><p>To reduce the risk for perioperative thromboembolism, some centers require women to discontinue hormonal contraception or hormone replacement therapy four to six weeks prior to donor nephrectomy. Estrogen-containing intrauterine devices and vaginal rings should be removed six weeks prior to surgery since they also carry a risk of thromboembolism. Low-dose progesterone-only (&lt;30 mcg of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=levonorgestrel-systemic-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">levonorgestrel</a>) medications or intrauterine devices may be continued since available data do not support an increased risk for thrombosis with use of these agents.</p><p>Most living-donor nephrectomies are performed laparoscopically versus an open approach. Surgical approaches to living-donor nephrectomy are discussed in detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=benefits-and-complications-of-minimally-invasive-live-donor-nephrectomy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Benefits and complications of minimally invasive live-donor nephrectomy&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3392911\"><span class=\"h2\">Long-term risk</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3392918\"><span class=\"h3\">Mortality and cardiovascular disease</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Studies suggest that, beyond the perioperative period, survival after living kidney donation is the same as for similar matched individuals who did not donate, at least over approximately 10 to 18 years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/risk-of-living-kidney-donation/abstract/8-10\" class=\"abstract_t\">8-10</a>], including one study of donors older than 55 years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/risk-of-living-kidney-donation/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. However, long-term follow-up data are limited [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/risk-of-living-kidney-donation/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. As an example, in one long-term study of more than 80,000 living kidney donors, the risk of death over a median 6.3 years of follow-up (maximum 12 years) was the same for kidney donors and demographically matched, healthy National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) III participants screened for baseline good health, including among subgroups stratified by race [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/risk-of-living-kidney-donation/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].</p><p>In a study comparing 2028 living kidney donors in Ontario, Canada (1992 to 2009) with 20,280 healthy, demographically matched nondonors, the risk of death or major cardiovascular events over a median seven years follow-up (maximum 18 years) was lower in donors than in healthy nondonors (2.8 versus 4.1 events per 1000 person-years; hazard ratio [HR] 0.66, 95% CI 0.48-0.90) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/risk-of-living-kidney-donation/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. The risk of death-censored major cardiovascular events was similar among donors and nondonors (1.7 versus 2.0 events per 1000 person-years; HR 0.85, 95% CI 0.57-1.27).</p><p>One study with longer follow-up (a median follow-up of 15 years, maximum 25 years) compared cardiovascular and all-cause mortality in 1901 kidney donors with a control group of 32,621 healthy, matched controls selected from a population-based survey carried out in Norway between 1984 and 1987 (Nord-Tr&oslash;ndelag Health Study [HUNT] I) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/risk-of-living-kidney-donation/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>].</p><p>Mortality curves were similar for donors and nondonors over the first 15 years but subsequently diverged. At 25 years after donation, the cumulative all-cause mortality was approximately 18 percent among donors and 13 percent among healthy nondonors (adjusted HR [aHR] 1.3, 95% CI 1.1&ndash;1.5). However, the absolute mortality during the observation period was low in both groups: 224 deaths among 1901 donors and 2425 deaths among 32,621 controls (or 0.12 versus 0.074 percent, respectively).</p><p>Limited data are available on the effects of donation on cardiovascular pathophysiology. The Chronic Renal Impairment in Birmingham (CRIB)-Donor study prospectively examined changes in left ventricular (LV) mass and other cardiovascular disease surrogate markers among 124 donors at two United Kingdom centers (2011 to 2014), of whom 90 percent were white, at 12 months postdonation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/risk-of-living-kidney-donation/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>].</p><p>Compared with healthy nondonors, donors had larger increases in LV mass (-3&plusmn;8 versus +7&plusmn;10 g, respectively) and LV <span class=\"nowrap\">mass/volume</span> ratio (-0.01&plusmn;0.09 versus +0.06&plusmn;0.12 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/mL)</span> but decreased aortic distensibility. Donors were also more likely than controls to develop detectable highly sensitive troponin T levels and microalbuminuria. The increase in LV mass among donors was independently associated with the magnitude of decrease in measured glomerular filtration rate (GFR). These observations warrant replication efforts in larger cohorts with longer follow-up to better define the impacts of donation on cardiovascular disease surrogates and clinical events.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3393323\"><span class=\"h3\">End-stage renal disease</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>When compared with well-matched, equally healthy controls, donor nephrectomy appears to increase the risk of end-stage renal disease (ESRD), although the absolute risk is low [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/risk-of-living-kidney-donation/abstract/1,10,16\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,10,16</a>]. Consistent with recommendations of a 2015 American Society of Transplantation (AST) consensus statement [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/risk-of-living-kidney-donation/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>] and Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) clinical practice guidelines [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/risk-of-living-kidney-donation/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>], OPTN policy requires informing donor candidates that the risk of ESRD after donation may exceed that of healthy nondonors with medical characteristics similar to living kidney donors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/risk-of-living-kidney-donation/abstract/5,17\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,17</a>].</p><p>Although 50 percent of the functioning renal mass is removed during donor nephrectomy, compensatory hypertrophy in the remaining normal kidney returns the GFR to approximately 70 percent of baseline at 10 to 14 days [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/risk-of-living-kidney-donation/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>] and approximately 75 to 85 percent of baseline at long-term follow-up [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/risk-of-living-kidney-donation/abstract/19-22\" class=\"abstract_t\">19-22</a>]. In the prospective Assessing Long-Term Outcomes in Living Kidney Donors (ALTOLD) study of 182 kidney donors (94.6 percent white race) and paired healthy nondonors, the GFR measured by <a href=\"topic.htm?path=iohexol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">iohexol</a> clearance declined 0.36 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/min</span> per year in control individuals but increased 1.47 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/min</span> per year in donors between 6 and 36 months of follow-up [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/risk-of-living-kidney-donation/abstract/23,24\" class=\"abstract_t\">23,24</a>]. The trajectory of change in GFR beyond 36 months postdonation requires characterization in larger, demographically diverse samples. In the general population, GFR declines with age, although the rate of decline appears widely variable across individuals [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/risk-of-living-kidney-donation/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>].</p><p>Studies that have looked at this issue include the following:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In one study, 1901 kidney donors were compared with 32,621 healthy, demographically matched controls from a population-based survey carried out in Norway between 1984 and 1987 (HUNT I) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/risk-of-living-kidney-donation/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. Compared with controls, the risk of ESRD was higher among donors (with HR adjusted for age, gender, systolic blood pressure, smoking, and body mass index [BMI] of 11.4, 95% CI 4.4-29.6). Among 1901 donors, 9 (0.47 percent) developed ESRD compared with 22 of 32,621 (0.07 percent) control individuals. The crude incidence of ESRD after donation was 302 per million person-years, whereas the estimated incidence of ESRD in the general population in Norway is 100 million per person-years. The median time to ESRD among donors was 18.7 years.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">ESRD among the Norwegian donors was mostly due to immunologic diseases including glomerulonephritis (three), systemic lupus erythematosus (one), antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (ANCA)-associated vasculitis (two), sarcoidosis (one), and <span class=\"nowrap\">diabetes/nephrosclerosis</span> (two). Thus, it is possible that the increase in risk of ESRD was related to genetically determined immunologic factors rather than the nephrectomy itself [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/risk-of-living-kidney-donation/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. As 84 percent of the study sample were biologically related and related donors contributed the longest observation time due to temporal patterns of donor acceptance, associations of family history with renal outcomes within the donor population remain uncertain and warrant continued study [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/risk-of-living-kidney-donation/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A US registry study compared 96,217 donors with healthy participants in NHANES III [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/risk-of-living-kidney-donation/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. Among 20,024 NHANES participants, 9364 had no identified contraindications to kidney donation (based upon patient self-report, physical examination, and radiologic and laboratory evaluation at NHANES enrollment) and were demographically matched 1:1 to donors with replacement, such that individual NHANES participants served as controls for multiple kidney donors. Sixty-eight percent of donors were biologically related to recipients.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">ESRD developed in 99 donors a mean of 8.6 years after donation. ESRD developed in 36 matched nondonors (drawn from 17 events among the unmatched nondonor cohort). Among donors who developed ESRD, 83 were biologically related to the recipient.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">The estimated cumulative incidence of ESRD at 15 years was 30.8 per 10,000 in donors compared with 3.9 per 10,000 in matched donors (absolute risk increase 26.9 per 10,000). Estimated lifetime ESRD risk based on splicing observations for donors observed at different ages was 90 per 10,000 among donors compared with 14 per 10,000 among healthy nondonors. ESRD risk was highest in the demographically matched, unscreened general population, at 326 per 10,000.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">The absolute risk of ESRD per 10,000 subjects was 74.7, 32.6, and 22.7 among black, Hispanic, and white donors compared with 23.9, 6.7, and 0.0 for black, Hispanic, and white nondonors, respectively.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">The risk of ESRD may have been underestimated in the nondonor controls for a variety of reasons [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/risk-of-living-kidney-donation/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. As noted above, the design of the study allowed individual controls to be matched to multiple donors, which may have resulted in the repeated inclusion of long, event-free survival times. In addition, donors may have had a lower competing risk of death for a given comparable decline in kidney function. Finally, whereas donors were identified as having ESRD by virtue of a requirement for dialysis, by transplantation, or by activation to the deceased-donor transplant list, ESRD in controls was identified by requirement for dialysis or elective transplantation. Since the kidney allocation policy prioritizes living donors who develop ESRD and since donors are generally closely scrutinized for decline in kidney function, it is possible that donors were transplanted earlier (ie, at a higher estimated GFR [eGFR]) compared with controls.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A meta-analysis of three studies, including the two cited above, plus one matched cohort study that compared the risk of acute dialysis among donors versus nondonors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/risk-of-living-kidney-donation/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>], showed that kidney donation was associated with a relative risk for ESRD of 8.83 compared with nondonors (95% CI 1.02-20.93) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/risk-of-living-kidney-donation/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. The absolute risk of ESRD among donors was low with an incident rate of 0.5 cases of ESRD per 1000 person-years. Another systematic review also concluded that moderate-grade evidence reveals an association between living kidney donation and greater risk of ESRD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/risk-of-living-kidney-donation/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>].</p><p/><p>A number of studies support that the risk of ESRD after kidney donation does not exceed the risk in the general population [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/risk-of-living-kidney-donation/abstract/18-22,31\" class=\"abstract_t\">18-22,31</a>]. An analysis of living kidney donors in the US between 1994 and 2003 demonstrated a rate of ESRD among living donors of 0.134 per 1000 years over an average follow-up period of 9.8 years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/risk-of-living-kidney-donation/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>], which was not higher than that of the general population.</p><p>To improve the evaluation and selection of living donor candidates, a KDIGO work group formulating guidelines for the &quot;Evaluation and Care of Living Kidney Donors&quot; collaborated with the Chronic Kidney Disease-Prognosis Consortium (CKD-PC) to conduct a meta-analysis combined with an analysis of the incidence of ESRD in a low-risk segment of the US population to produce a comprehensive risk-prediction model for ESRD in the absence of donation based on data for nearly five million healthy persons [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/risk-of-living-kidney-donation/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>]. For a 40-year-old person with health characteristics similar to those of age-matched donors, 15-year projected ESRD risk in the absence of donation varied according to race and sex: 0.24 percent among black men, 0.15 percent among black women, 0.06 percent among white men, and 0.04 percent among white women. Estimated ESRD risk was higher in the presence of a lower eGFR, higher albuminuria, hypertension, current or former smoking, diabetes, and obesity. Projected lifetime ESRD was highest among young adults, especially among young African Americans. The observed incidence of ESRD at 15 years among US kidney donors was 3.5 to 5.3 times the projected risks for healthy persons in the absence of donation by sex and race.</p><p>An <a href=\"http://www.transplantmodels.com/esrdrisk/&amp;token=h1KzgOhLuVlx/jjaQGu7d3+XYOQ8HsFrjXnwncdwNnM4W03PQrKnltIwOX3/leMmUVKCe+svwbVTUcLUbOi/dA==&amp;TOPIC_ID=103489\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">online risk tool</a> was developed to project ESRD risk (in the absence of donation) for donor candidates based on simultaneous consideration of baseline demographic and clinical factors.

In a study of 4650 US donors, postdonation depression rates did not exceed that of general population nondonors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/risk-of-living-kidney-donation/abstract/59\" class=\"abstract_t\">59</a>]. However, recipient graft failure and death were associated with increased risk of subsequent depression diagnoses and use of antidepressant medications in donors, and most of the failure events occurred beyond the first year [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/risk-of-living-kidney-donation/abstract/59\" class=\"abstract_t\">59</a>]. These data support a need to assess the psychological health of donors after adverse recipient events, even if event are late after donation.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3395043\"><span class=\"h2\">Economic considerations</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Donor candidates and actual donors incur personal direct and indirect expenses as part of the evaluation and donation procedure, even in countries where the donor's medical expenses are paid by the recipient's insurance or the health care system. Major costs include transportation, accommodation, child care, and lost income (or vacation time) from missed work [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/risk-of-living-kidney-donation/abstract/80,81\" class=\"abstract_t\">80,81</a>]. In a multicenter cohort study of 194 living donors, most reported one or more direct costs, including ground transportation (80 percent), health care (24 percent), lodging (17 percent), and air transportation (14 percent), totaling USD $101,484 (mean $523&plusmn;942) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/risk-of-living-kidney-donation/abstract/80\" class=\"abstract_t\">80</a>]. Excluding paid vacation or sick leave, donor and companion lost wages totaled USD $35,918 (mean $187&plusmn;556) and $14,378 (mean<strong> </strong>$76&plusmn;311), respectively. One-third of living kidney donors used paid vacation or sick leave to avoid incurring lost wages. Few living kidney donors reported receiving financial support from the transplant candidate (6 percent), transplant candidate's family (3 percent), a nonprofit organization (3 percent), the National Living Donor Assistance Center (7 percent), or transplant center (3 percent). Higher total costs were significantly associated with longer distance traveled to the transplant center.</p><p>In the US, some states have enacted legislation to offer tax deductions or credits, or other benefits, to living organ donors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/risk-of-living-kidney-donation/abstract/82,83\" class=\"abstract_t\">82,83</a>]. These programs vary state by state, are underused, and have not been studied with regard to impacts on financial burdens of donation.</p><p>Coordinating the timing of the donor candidate evaluation with work and dependent care schedules may minimize indirect costs. An earlier return to work may be facilitated by the use of laparoscopic compared with open donor nephrectomy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/risk-of-living-kidney-donation/abstract/84\" class=\"abstract_t\">84</a>]. By 2013, almost all living donations in the US are performed laparoscopically, and, with increasing experience with the laparoscopic procedure, few are converted to open procedures [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/risk-of-living-kidney-donation/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p>Living organ donors may encounter difficulties with insurance after donation. This was shown in a systematic review of 23 studies including 2076 living organ donors, 385 potential donors, and 239 responses from insurance companies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/risk-of-living-kidney-donation/abstract/85\" class=\"abstract_t\">85</a>]. Three to 11 percent of donors stated that they had problems obtaining insurance. In a more recent study that included 395 individuals in the United States who either changed or initiated health insurance after kidney donation, 27 (7 percent) reported difficulty; of these, 15 were denied health insurance, and 12 were charged a higher premium [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/risk-of-living-kidney-donation/abstract/86\" class=\"abstract_t\">86</a>]. Eight individuals were told they had a pre-existing condition because of kidney donation. Among 186 individuals who changed or initiated life insurance after kidney donation, 46 (25 percent) had difficulty obtaining life insurance; of these, 23 were denied insurance, and 27 were charged a higher premium. Seventeen were told they had a pre-existing condition because of kidney donation.</p><p>Living-donor candidates should receive counseling about financial costs prior to donation, education on how to access available financial supports, and the limitations of available resources. Recommendations to advance financial neutrality for donors and donor candidates include allocation of resources for standardized system of reimbursement of donation-related costs, improved tax credits, and legislation to standardize employment and insurability protections [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/risk-of-living-kidney-donation/abstract/87,88\" class=\"abstract_t\">87,88</a>]. The American Society of Transplantation Live Donor Community of practice developed a toolkit to help living-donor candidates and donors prepare for financial impacts of donation and links to resources including state tax credits and assistance-ships that may be available for cost mitigation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/risk-of-living-kidney-donation/abstract/89\" class=\"abstract_t\">89</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3395424\"><span class=\"h1\">SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The complications from kidney donation can be divided into perioperative risks and risks that may arise many years after donation. (See <a href=\"#H3389951\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Perioperative mortality after living-donor nephrectomy is 1 in 3000 at 90 days. In addition to death, the most important perioperative risks of donor nephrectomy include hemorrhage, pneumothorax, pneumonia, urinary tract infection, wound complications, and deep vein thrombosis with or without pulmonary embolism. (See <a href=\"#H3392735\" class=\"local\">'Overview'</a> above and <a href=\"#H3392772\" class=\"local\">'Immediate risk'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Living donation may cause small increases in the long-term risks of end-stage kidney disease, preeclampsia, hypertension, and metabolic diseases such as gout. These risks should be discussed with all donor candidates. (See <a href=\"#H3392911\" class=\"local\">'Long-term risk'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The risk of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) among donors is low but appears to be higher than among healthy nondonors. Estimation of projected risk of ESRD in the absence of donation according to a donor candidate's predonation demographic and health characteristics may improve consistency and transparency in the evaluation and selection of donor candidates. (See <a href=\"#H3393323\" class=\"local\">'End-stage renal disease'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The overall incidence and donation-related risks of ESRD and hypertension after kidney donation are higher among African-American compared with white donors. African-American donor candidates should be counseled regarding these higher risks. Among all African-American donor candidates, we use conservative acceptance criteria, such as for baseline glomerular filtration rate (GFR), blood pressure, body mass index (BMI), and glucose tolerance. Among African-American donor candidates, apolipoprotein L1 (<em>APOL1</em>) genotyping may be of benefit. (See <a href=\"#H3393323\" class=\"local\">'End-stage renal disease'</a> above and <a href=\"#H3394543\" class=\"local\">'Risk among African Americans and Hispanics'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We generally advise women that it is ideal to have completed planned childbearing prior to kidney donation. Living kidney donation appears to increase the risk of gestational hypertension and preeclampsia compared with experience among otherwise similar healthy women. Nevertheless, given the generally good pregnancy outcomes after donation, women should not be excluded based on plans for possible future childbearing alone, and women may value the available information differently in their donation decision. (See <a href=\"#H3393878\" class=\"local\">'Maternal and fetal outcomes'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Donor candidates can be informed that, in general, donors demonstrate good quality of life and have a low rate of donation-related regret. However, some do experience psychosocial difficulties after donation (eg, depression, anxiety, a negative change in their relationships, or more pain or slower recovery than expected). (See <a href=\"#H1723713285\" class=\"local\">'Psychosocial outcomes'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Donors candidates and actual donors incur personal direct and indirect expenses as part of the evaluation and donation procedure, even in countries where the donor's medical expenses are paid by the recipient's insurance or the health care system. Major costs include transportation, accommodation, child care, and lost income (or vacation time) from missed work. (See <a href=\"#H3395043\" class=\"local\">'Economic considerations'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3395570\"><span class=\"h1\">ACKNOWLEDGMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The editorial staff at UpToDate would like to acknowledge Emilio Ramos, MD, FACP and Anitha Vijayan, MD, who contributed to earlier versions of this topic review.</p></div><div id=\"topicAgreement\">Use of UpToDate is subject to the <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/legal/license\" class=\"licenseLink\" id=\"sla_in_page\">Subscription and License Agreement</a>.</div><div id=\"references\" class=\"headingAnchor\"><h1>REFERENCES</h1><ol id=\"reference\"><li class=\"breakAll\">Organ Procurement and Transplantation Network (OPTN)/United Network for Organ Sharing (UNOS).
