Rarely, primary infections of the mediastinum developed as a result of penetrating trauma or hematogenous spread of infection. However, in modern practice, most cases of mediastinitis are a postoperative complication of cardiovascular or other thoracic surgical procedures. </p><p>The medical management of sternal wound infection will be reviewed here. The surgical management of sternal wound complications is discussed in detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=surgical-management-of-sternal-wound-complications\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Surgical management of sternal wound complications&quot;</a>.) </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">PATHOGENESIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The pathogenesis of postoperative mediastinitis is complex and multifactorial. The most important factor is intraoperative wound contamination. Such contamination probably occurs in virtually all patients during the long time interval that large sternotomy wounds are open during cardiac surgery. It is therefore likely that the degree and type of contamination interact with host factors, such as the adequacy of local blood supply, nutrition, and immunologic status, to result in infection in small numbers of patients even if meticulous care is exercised by the surgical team.</p><p>A number of other preoperative and operative factors occasionally play a role in the pathogenesis of postoperative mediastinitis. These include preoperative skin colonization with potentially pathogenic or highly resistant organisms, disruption of the blood supply to the sternum during surgery, tissue trauma due to electrocautery, and early postoperative wound disruption (eg, from coughing).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Microbiology</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The majority of patients with postoperative mediastinitis have monomicrobial infections. In two reviews with a total of 350 patients with postoperative mediastinitis, 290 (83 percent) had a single pathogen isolated from their mediastinum or blood [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/postoperative-mediastinitis-after-cardiac-surgery/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>].</p><p>Virtually any organism can cause mediastinitis. In a prospective review of 316 patients with mediastinitis occurring less than 30 days after sternotomy, the most common microorganisms isolated were methicillin-susceptible <em>Staphylococcus aureus</em> (MSSA) (45 percent), methicillin-resistant <em>S. aureus</em> (MRSA) (16 percent), gram-negative bacilli (17 percent), coagulase-negative staphylococci (13 percent), and streptococci (5 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/postoperative-mediastinitis-after-cardiac-surgery/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p>Postoperative mediastinitis due to MSSA appears to occur more often in the setting of preoperative nasal MSSA colonization, whereas postoperative mediastinitis due to MRSA appears to occur via nosocomial transmission between patients. This was illustrated in a study of 17 cases of mediastinitis observed among 1432 cardiac surgery patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/postoperative-mediastinitis-after-cardiac-surgery/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Among the nine cases due to MSSA, seven had an identical isolate in preoperative nasal and surgical site cultures (as demonstrated by pulsed field gel electrophoresis [PFGE]). Among the eight cases due to MRSA, none had an identical isolate by PFGE, and the same MRSA clone was implicated in all of these cases.</p><p>Rarely, postoperative mediastinitis is due to unusual organisms such as fungi [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/postoperative-mediastinitis-after-cardiac-surgery/abstract/4,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,5</a>], <em>Legionella</em> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/postoperative-mediastinitis-after-cardiac-surgery/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>], <em>Mycoplasma hominis</em> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/postoperative-mediastinitis-after-cardiac-surgery/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>], or <em>Nocardia </em>[<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/postoperative-mediastinitis-after-cardiac-surgery/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>], <em>Mycobacterium chimaera</em> (associated with contaminated heater-cooler devices used in bypass surgery), and <em>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</em> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/postoperative-mediastinitis-after-cardiac-surgery/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].

However, the risk may be considerably higher in certain subsets of patients. As an example, the rates have ranged from 2.5 to 7.5 percent in patients undergoing heart transplantation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/postoperative-mediastinitis-after-cardiac-surgery/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>], and may be higher if cardiac assist devices are used [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/postoperative-mediastinitis-after-cardiac-surgery/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. </p><p>In October 2008, the Centers for Medicare Services (CMS) in the United States implemented a policy that eliminated reimbursement for mediastinitis following coronary artery bypass surgery. An analysis of billing data following 638,739 CABG procedures in over 1200 United States hospitals from 2006 to 2010 showed that this policy change was associated with a decline in billing claims for mediastinitis in the post policy implementation period [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/postoperative-mediastinitis-after-cardiac-surgery/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. However, data on rates of mediastinitis reported to the National Patient Safety Network remained unchanged during the two intervals. These findings suggest that CMS payment penalties resulted in significant changes in coding for mediastinitis as a complication of cardiac surgery but had no significant effect in the actual risk of infection.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Risk factors</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The following risk factors for postoperative sternal wound infection have been described [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/postoperative-mediastinitis-after-cardiac-surgery/abstract/11,16-25\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,16-25</a>]:</p><p>In adults:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Diabetes or perioperative hyperglycemia</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Obesity</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Peripheral artery disease</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Tobacco use</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Prior cardiac surgery</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Mobilization of the internal mammary arteries</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Prolonged surgical procedure (greater than five hours)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Return to the operating room within four days postoperatively (eg, control bleeding) </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Prolonged postoperative intensive care</p><p/><p>There is no consensus as to which risk factors are most important and whether the individual risk factors listed above are independent predictors of an increased risk of postoperative mediastinitis. It is likely that all or many of the above risk factors for infection may be clinically important in selected patients, especially when two or more are present. The risk factors for sternal wound infection in adults are discussed in further detail separately.

One compared 43 children with postoperative mediastinitis to 184 uninfected controls [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/postoperative-mediastinitis-after-cardiac-surgery/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. Risk of postoperative mediastinitis was significantly increased in patients with a known or suspected genetic syndrome, American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) score &gt;3, and presence of intracardiac pacing wires for &gt;3 days (odds ratio 4.5, 3.4, and 15.8 respectively). In the other study involving 72 cases of SSI and 144 controls, independent risk factors for a SSI included age &lt;1 and postoperative exposure to &gt;2 red blood cell transfusions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/postoperative-mediastinitis-after-cardiac-surgery/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>].</p><p>Furthermore, other traditional risk factors for surgical site infection may also be important [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/postoperative-mediastinitis-after-cardiac-surgery/abstract/10,28\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,28</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=antimicrobial-prophylaxis-for-prevention-of-surgical-site-infection-in-adults#H13\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Antimicrobial prophylaxis for prevention of surgical site infection in adults&quot;, section on 'Cardiac surgery'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Risk indices</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Several risk indices for sternal wound infections following cardiac surgery have been described [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/postoperative-mediastinitis-after-cardiac-surgery/abstract/16,17,20,29,30\" class=\"abstract_t\">16,17,20,29,30</a>]. A preoperative scoring system based on a 3-point scale evaluated in a cohort of 4987 patients may be the most useful for predicting the risk of postoperative mediastinitis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/postoperative-mediastinitis-after-cardiac-surgery/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. In this study, points were assigned for diabetes (1 point), a body mass index (BMI) &gt;29 but &lt;35 <span class=\"nowrap\">kg/m2</span> (1 point) and a BMI of 35 <span class=\"nowrap\">kg/m2</span> or greater (2 points). Each point in the scoring system approximately doubled the risk for postoperative surgical-site infection. Subsequent validation of this risk index was noted in a separate study of 269 cases of surgical site infections after coronary artery bypass surgery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/postoperative-mediastinitis-after-cardiac-surgery/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL FEATURES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Postoperative mediastinitis may follow a fulminant or subacute clinical course. Virtually all patients have fever, tachycardia, chest pain or sternal instability, signs of sternal wound infection, or purulent discharge from the mediastinal area. In one study, for example, sternal wound drainage <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> cellulitis were present in 29 of 34 patients (85 percent) with postoperative mediastinitis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/postoperative-mediastinitis-after-cardiac-surgery/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Other local findings that may be seen include crepitus and edema of the chest wall, and Hamman's sign (a crunching sound that is synchronous with the heart beat and heard by chest auscultation). Although signs of sternal wound infection can precede or follow the recognition of mediastinitis, fever and systemic symptoms appear first in most patients. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=surgical-management-of-sternal-wound-complications#H104702659\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Surgical management of sternal wound complications&quot;, section on 'Wound assessment'</a>.)</p><p>Bacteremia is common in postoperative mediastinitis, occurring in 57 percent of patients with postoperative mediastinitis in one report [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/postoperative-mediastinitis-after-cardiac-surgery/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]. In another series, mediastinitis was the underlying cause of bacteremia in 16 of 27 patients with positive blood cultures in the early postoperative period [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/postoperative-mediastinitis-after-cardiac-surgery/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>]. Bacteremia may precede or follow the recognition of mediastinitis. Because bacteremia may be the first sign of postoperative mediastinitis, the possibility of mediastinitis should be considered carefully during the evaluation of all bacteremic patients following cardiac or thoracic surgery.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Incubation period</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The majority of patients with postoperative mediastinitis show evidence of infection within 14 days of surgery; however, the onset may be delayed for months. In one report, for example, the incubation period ranged from 3 to 417 days after surgery; however, the median time of onset was seven days and began within two weeks in two-thirds of patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/postoperative-mediastinitis-after-cardiac-surgery/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]. Similar findings were noted in another series in which the onset of infection occurred more than one month after surgery in only 4 of 34 cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/postoperative-mediastinitis-after-cardiac-surgery/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h2\">Laboratory and radiologic features</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Almost all patients with postoperative mediastinitis have leukocytosis, but this is a nonspecific finding. Mediastinal widening on chest X-ray, which is a radiologic hallmark of non-postoperative mediastinitis, is rarely seen in patients with mediastinitis following cardiac surgery. Other abnormalities that are rarely seen are air fluid levels in the mediastinum or subcutaneous tissue, and mediastinal air on lateral chest radiographs. However, the last finding is of no utility in patients who are evaluated immediately after surgery.</p><p>Computed tomography (CT) is better than plain radiography in demonstrating the two hallmark findings of mediastinitis:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Localized mediastinal fluid</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pneumomediastinum</p><p/><p>These findings have increasing diagnostic significance with increasing time after surgery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/postoperative-mediastinitis-after-cardiac-surgery/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h1\">DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The diagnosis of postoperative mediastinitis is generally easy in patients who develop their infection within several weeks of surgery. Such patients usually manifest the characteristic clinical pattern of fever, leukocytosis, and sternal instability <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> sternal wound drainage, which may contain bubbles. The diagnosis is virtually assured when these findings occur in the presence of bacteremia or systemic symptoms such as fever, chills, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> signs of sepsis. Typically, such patients are taken immediately to surgery, where the diagnosis can be established definitively by the finding of pus in the mediastinum.</p><p>The diagnosis may be more difficult to establish in patients with fever and leukocytosis but no signs of sternal wound infection or drainage. In the majority of such patients, sternal wound infection becomes evident within a few days.</p><p>Another potential difficulty is distinguishing between superficial sternal wound infection and sternal wound infection associated with mediastinitis. As a general rule, patients with mediastinitis have signs of systemic infection such as fever, chills, and, as noted above, bacteremia in more than one-half of cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/postoperative-mediastinitis-after-cardiac-surgery/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>].</p><p>CT scan <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> subxiphoid aspiration may be useful in patients with systemic symptoms or bacteremia in the absence of sternal wound suppuration and in those with subacute symptoms. The later imaging is performed after surgery, the more likely the findings are to be diagnostically useful. In one study, for example, CT had a sensitivity of 100 percent but a specificity of only 33 percent for postoperative mediastinitis if performed before the postoperative day 14; however, both the specificity and sensitivity were 100 percent when CT scan was performed later [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/postoperative-mediastinitis-after-cardiac-surgery/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>].</p><p>One group reported on experience using sternal puncture to diagnose postoperative mediastinitis in patients with prior median sternotomies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/postoperative-mediastinitis-after-cardiac-surgery/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>]. A 21 gauge needle was placed through the margins of the prior sternotomy site and an aspirate was performed at an approximate depth of one centimeter. If the initial aspirate did not obtain fluid, aspirates were repeated at two other portions of the sternal wound. This approach yielded the same organism as was subsequently found during a later debridement in all 23 mediastinitis patients; cultures and Gram stain of aspirates were negative in 24 of 26 patients without mediastinitis. Although this report suggests that sternal puncture is safe and reliable, the sensitivity, specificity, and safety of this technique require validation by others.</p><p>Another study examined the utility of blood cultures in diagnosing postoperative mediastinitis in a large number of patients undergoing open heart surgery via a median sternotomy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/postoperative-mediastinitis-after-cardiac-surgery/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>]. In this cohort of 5500 patients, the detection of <em>S. aureus</em> bacteremia had a likelihood ratio (LR) of 25 for the presence of mediastinitis (95 percent CI, 14.7-44.4). Forty-six of 60 patients (77 percent) who had bacteremia due to <em>S. aureus</em> within 90 days of cardiac surgery developed mediastinitis due to the same organism. Curiously, bacteremia due to other organisms did not have the same prognostic significance: only 15 of 126 patients (12 percent) with non-<em>S. aureus</em> bacteremia developed mediastinitis (LR 1.0; 95 percent CI, 0.6-1.7). Patients with negative blood cultures were significantly less likely to have mediastinitis (LR 0.45; 95 percent CI, 0.35-0.58).</p><p>Cultures of epicardial pacing wires may be of some utility in patients who present with early-onset postoperative mediastinitis. In one report, such cultures had a sensitivity of 75 percent and a specificity of 83 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/postoperative-mediastinitis-after-cardiac-surgery/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>]. Although the positive predictive value of a single culture was only 12 percent, the negative predictive value of an individual culture was 99 percent. When <em>S. aureus</em> was isolated from such cultures, the specificity, sensitivity, and positive predictive value were even higher. In my experience, however, these cultures are rarely practical because pacing wires have often been removed by the time mediastinitis manifests or because the diagnosis is obvious from the typical clinical findings.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h1\">TREATMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Treatment of mediastinitis requires a combination of surgical debridement and antimicrobial therapy.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1080922269\"><span class=\"h2\">Surgical management</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Surgical debridement is the mainstay of therapy for postoperative mediastinitis followed by an immediate closure, or an interval of open wound care followed by delayed primary or flap closure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/postoperative-mediastinitis-after-cardiac-surgery/abstract/5,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,10</a>]. The surgical management of sternal wound complications is discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=surgical-management-of-sternal-wound-complications\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Surgical management of sternal wound complications&quot;</a>.)</p><p>For patients who have an open sternal wound following debridement for post-sternotomy mediastinitis, topical negative pressure wound therapy, or vacuum-assisted closure (VAC), is commonly used prior to subsequent delayed pectoral flap or omental flap repair. In a systematic review of studies that evaluated the outcome of negative pressure wound therapy compared to other wound management strategies for post-sternotomy mediastinitis, most studies observed that negative pressure wound therapy was associated with clinical benefits, such as decreased hospital stay, decreased rates of reinfection, and in a few studies, decreased early mortality [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/postoperative-mediastinitis-after-cardiac-surgery/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>]. The comparable efficacy of this modality versus conventional treatment (debridement followed by delayed closure with open dressings or immediate closure with closed irrigation) was also evaluated in a separate retrospective study of 90 patients who developed mediastinitis after coronary artery bypass surgery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/postoperative-mediastinitis-after-cardiac-surgery/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>]. Negative pressure wound therapy was associated with a lower ninety day mortality (8.5 versus 23.2 percent with conventional treatment) and higher overall one-year survival (91.5 versus 76.7 percent). These results should be interpreted with caution, however, as all these studies are observational (and predominantly retrospective), and there was substantial variability in the actual wound management strategies used for comparison.</p><p>The management of the open sternal wound, including the use of negative pressure wound therapy or open dressings, is discussed separately.

Initial empiric therapy should consist of broad coverage against gram-positive cocci and gram-negative bacilli. In hospitals such as ours in which there is a substantial incidence of methicillin-resistant staphylococci, we typically use a regimen consisting of intravenous <a href=\"topic.htm?path=vancomycin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">vancomycin</a> plus a third generation cephalosporin (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ceftazidime-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ceftazidime</a> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cefotaxime-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cefotaxime</a>), a quinolone (such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ciprofloxacin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ciprofloxacin</a>), or an aminoglycoside. The regimen should be adjusted as soon as the results of cultures of blood and mediastinal or deep sternal wound drainage are available.</p><p>In general, most favor 2 to 3 weeks of antibiotic therapy following sternal resection and a pectoral flap. If sternal debridement has been performed without resection, or if there is residual rib or sternal bone following surgery that may be a site of residual infection, 4 to 6 weeks of antimicrobial therapy may be required.

In one study including 83 patients with mediastinitis, the mortality during the first 90 days after surgery was 12 percent (compared with 6 percent for 6376 patients without mediastinitis) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/postoperative-mediastinitis-after-cardiac-surgery/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. In addition, the interval mortality between one and two years after surgery remained higher in the patients with mediastinitis (8 versus 2 percent). Another study suggested that the risk of death following mediastinitis remains higher than in uninfected controls for up to 10 years (49 versus 71 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/postoperative-mediastinitis-after-cardiac-surgery/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. The majority of deaths in both groups was attributed to cardiac causes, but the proportion of cardiac deaths was higher in patients who had mediastinitis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/postoperative-mediastinitis-after-cardiac-surgery/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>].</p><p>A prospective study of 316 consecutive cases of postoperative mediastinitis identified patient risk factors for intensive care unit mortality [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/postoperative-mediastinitis-after-cardiac-surgery/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Independent risk factors present on admission were age greater than 70 years, operation other than coronary artery bypass grafting alone, severity of the underlying medical condition (McCabe class <span class=\"nowrap\">2/3),</span> APACHE II score, and organ failure. After introducing day three variables into the logistic regression model, the additional independent risk factors for death were mechanical ventilation still required on day three and persistently positive blood cultures.</p><p>Another study of 183 patients with postoperative mediastinitis found that death occurred in 51 patients (33 percent); median time to death in those who died was 37 days [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/postoperative-mediastinitis-after-cardiac-surgery/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>].

This was illustrated in a series of 41 patients with mediastinitis; 15 with MRSA and 26 with MSSA [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/postoperative-mediastinitis-after-cardiac-surgery/abstract/43\" class=\"abstract_t\">43</a>]. MRSA mortality rates were higher than MSSA mortality rates at one month (40 versus 15 percent), one year (48 versus 21 percent) and three years (74 versus 21 percent).

The majority of infections are caused by a single organism. Although a wide array of bacterial, mycobacterial, and fungal organisms can cause mediastinitis, <em>Staphylococcus aureus</em> is the most commonly isolated pathogen. (See <a href=\"#H1\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above and <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Microbiology'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In adults, risk factors for the development of postoperative mediastinitis include diabetes mellitus, obesity, peripheral arterial disease, tobacco use, a history of prior cardiac surgery, and surgical complications. (See <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Risk factors'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The vast majority of patients with postoperative mediastinitis present with fever or other signs of sepsis, chest pain or sternal instability, signs of sternal wound infection, or purulent discharge. Bacteremia is common. The infection typically manifests within two weeks following the surgery, although the onset of symptoms can occasionally occur months later. Hallmark findings on computed tomography are localized mediastinal fluid and a pneumomediastinum. (See <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'Clinical features'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The diagnosis is made clinically in a patient presenting with signs and symptoms consistent with postoperative mediastinitis. Computed tomography is more useful in supporting the diagnosis when performed later than two weeks postoperatively. Finding pus in the mediastinum during subsequent surgical debridement can confirm the clinical diagnosis. (See <a href=\"#H10\" class=\"local\">'Diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The treatment of mediastinitis involves a combination of antimicrobial therapy and surgical debridement with either immediate or delayed closure. An empiric antimicrobial regimen should include broad coverage against both gram-positive cocci (including methicillin-resistant <em>S. aureus</em>, if institutionally prevalent) and gram-negative bacilli and can later be adjusted based on culture and susceptibility data. The duration of therapy generally ranges from two to six weeks and depends on the extent of surgical debridement performed. (See <a href=\"#H11\" class=\"local\">'Treatment'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Strategies to prevent postoperative mediastinitis include perioperative antibiotics, naso- and oropharyngeal <a href=\"topic.htm?path=chlorhexidine-gluconate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">chlorhexidine</a> decontamination, and surgical techniques that ensure alignment of sternal edges and meticulous hemostasis. Mediastinitis is associated with an excess postoperative mortality that can persist for years following the procedure.
