It is one of the most common skin problems in infants and children, affecting between 7 and 35 percent of infants at some point. Diaper rash occurs most commonly in infants between ages 9 and 12 months, but can occur at any time the child wears a diaper.</p><p>Fortunately, most cases of diaper rash are short-lived and resolve with home treatment. This topic review discusses the most common causes, treatment recommendations, and strategies to prevent diaper rash.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">TYPES OF DIAPER RASH</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There are two main types of diaper rash:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Rashes that are caused or worsened by a diaper</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Rashes that are not related to diaper use</p><p/><p>It is not always possible for parents to determine the type and cause of diaper rash. In most cases, it is reasonable to begin treatment at home, as described below. If the rash is severe or worsens, you should contact your child's healthcare provider. (See <a href=\"#H14\" class=\"local\">'Diaper rash treatment'</a> below and <a href=\"#H22\" class=\"local\">'When to seek help'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Diaper-related rash</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Diaper-related rashes can be caused by irritation, a yeast infection, or an allergic reaction. Diaper-related rashes may occur more frequently if a child has an episode of diarrhea or has recently taken antibiotics.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h3\">Irritant dermatitis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Irritant dermatitis is the medical term for red and inflamed skin that is caused by any irritant (usually urine or feces with diaper rash). Irritant dermatitis is the most common cause of diaper rash. It is generally seen on the buttocks, lower abdomen, genitals, and upper thighs (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F90765\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef90765 \">picture 1</a>); the skin folds are not usually affected. Symptoms can vary from mild redness to painful areas of skin that are raised, peeling, or weeping. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=contact-dermatitis-including-latex-dermatitis-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">&quot;Patient education: Contact dermatitis (including latex dermatitis) (Beyond the Basics)&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h3\">Yeast infection</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Yeast (Candida) infections can develop if irritant dermatitis is not treated for more than a few days. Signs of yeast diaper dermatitis include dark red areas of skin with or without raised yellow, fluid-filled pustules that can rupture and flake (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F59361\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef59361 \">picture 2</a>). Yeast infections are often found in the skin folds between the thigh and body, and in the folds of skin around the genitals.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h3\">Allergic reaction</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Allergic reactions or skin sensitivity to the diaper itself is a less common cause of diaper rash. Signs of allergic contact dermatitis include itchy red, raised, scaly skin in the diaper area. Areas of skin that are in contact with dyes on the diaper can become sensitive and develop an allergic reaction. Some baby wipes may contain preservatives that can also cause an allergic reaction.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Nondiaper-related rash</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Skin conditions that can affect the diaper area but are not caused by the diaper include seborrhea, atopic dermatitis, bacterial infections, psoriasis, scabies, and others.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h3\">Seborrhea</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Seborrhea is a skin condition that causes patches of redness and greasy yellow scaly skin in infants. It is commonly located in the skin folds between the thighs and body, and is often found in other areas as well, including the scalp (where it is called &quot;cradle cap&quot;), face, neck, or in other skin folds (eg, in the armpit, in front of the elbow, behind the knees). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=seborrheic-dermatitis-including-dandruff-and-cradle-cap-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">&quot;Patient education: Seborrheic dermatitis (including dandruff and cradle cap) (Beyond the Basics)&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h3\">Atopic dermatitis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Atopic dermatitis (also called eczema) is not usually found in the diaper area because moisture is trapped there by the diaper. If the diaper area is affected, there may be signs of frequent scratching (eg, scratch marks, scabs). Atopic dermatitis is discussed in more detail in a separate topic review. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=atopic-dermatitis-eczema-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">&quot;Patient education: Atopic dermatitis (eczema) (Beyond the Basics)&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h3\">Bacterial infection</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Impetigo is a bacterial infection that can develop in the diaper area, as well as other areas of the body. It is usually caused by bacteria that normally live on the skin; infection can develop when there is a break in the skin. Signs of impetigo include tiny (1 to 2 millimeter) raised yellow fluid-filled areas and honey-colored crusted lesions; the lesions may be itchy <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> painful. A healthcare provider should evaluate any child with these signs and symptoms. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=impetigo\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Impetigo&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h3\">Psoriasis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Psoriasis is a skin condition that causes reddened and silver scaly patches of skin. In the diaper area, the silver scale may be absent. Psoriasis is discussed in more detail in a separate topic review. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=psoriasis-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">&quot;Patient education: Psoriasis (Beyond the Basics)&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h3\">Scabies</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Scabies is an intensely itchy skin condition caused by mites that have burrowed under the skin. Symptoms usually begin suddenly and include widespread red, raised, itchy areas on the abdomen, web spaces of the hands and feet, armpits, and genitals. Scabies often affects multiple family members at the same time. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=scabies-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">&quot;Patient education: Scabies (Beyond the Basics)&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h1\">DIAPER RASH DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In most cases, it is possible to begin treatment for diaper rash at home without seeing a healthcare provider. However, if you are concerned that your child's rash is severe, worsening, or is associated with other signs or symptoms (eg, significant discomfort, bloody stool, fever, skin that appears infected), you should contact your child's healthcare provider immediately. (See <a href=\"#H22\" class=\"local\">'When to seek help'</a> below.)</p><p>Lab testing is not usually required. If you have been using a diaper rash treatment at home, bring this product to the appointment.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14\"><span class=\"h1\">DIAPER RASH TREATMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Treatment of diaper rash includes a combination of measures, which are most effective when used together. The letters <strong>ABCDE</strong> are a useful way to remember all of these measures [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diaper-rash-in-infants-and-children-beyond-the-basics/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A = air out the skin by allowing the child to go diaper-free</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>B = barrier; use a paste or ointment to protect the skin</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>C = clean; keep the skin clean</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>D = disposable diapers; during an episode of diaper rash, consider using disposable rather than cloth diapers</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>E = educate; educate yourself about how to prevent a recurrence of diaper rash</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15\"><span class=\"h2\">Diaper-free periods</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The most effective way to treat irritant diaper rash is to reduce skin contact with urine and feces (ie, by discontinuing or limiting the use of diapers). One way to do this is to allow the child to periodically go without a diaper, allowing the skin to be exposed directly to the air. Using a waterproof barrier under the child can minimize soiling.</p><p>When the child wears a diaper, frequent diaper changes are recommended; a suggested interval might be every two to three hours and immediately after every bowel movement.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H16\"><span class=\"h2\">Skin barrier ointments or pastes</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Skin ointments or pastes also can help to treat or prevent irritant diaper rash. The ointment or paste should be applied at every diaper change and can be covered with a thin layer of petroleum jelly to prevent sticking to the diaper. The ointment or paste should be long-lasting and should stick to irritated or broken areas of skin. It is not necessary to completely clean the ointment or paste off the skin at diaper changes.</p><p>Lotions and creams are not as effective as ointments or pastes and are not recommended. In addition, products that contain preservatives, fragrances, or other additives are not recommended because they may further irritate the skin. It is important to closely read the ingredient label of all diaper products.</p><p>Most diaper products contain ingredients such as zinc oxide and petrolatum, which form a protective skin barrier against wetness; some also contain lanolin, paraffin, or dimethicone. Sample brands that contain these ingredients include Desitin, Triple Paste, A &amp; D Ointment, and Balmex. White petrolatum (sample brand name: Vaseline) is an inexpensive option as well.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H17\"><span class=\"h2\">Powders</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Powders that contain talc or corn starch can reduce friction and moisture. However, powders are not generally recommended as a treatment for diaper rash because the child could accidentally inhale them.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H18\"><span class=\"h2\">Antifungal treatments</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>An antifungal treatment may be prescribed if the child is diagnosed with a yeast infection. This type of treatment is not recommended without consulting the child's provider first. Antifungal treatments are available as a cream, ointment, or powder. The treatment is usually applied two or three times per day and can be applied beneath a barrier skin ointment or paste, until the rash is gone.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H19\"><span class=\"h2\">Steroid ointment</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>If the child's skin becomes severely inflamed, the healthcare provider may recommend a mild, over-the-counter steroid ointment such as 1% hydrocortisone. This can be applied in a thin layer to the irritated skin twice per day for no more than one week. More potent or adult-strength steroid ointments are not recommended for children without the advice of a clinician. Steroid creams are not recommended because ingredients in the cream can be irritating.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H20\"><span class=\"h2\">Antibiotics</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>If the child develops signs or symptoms of a skin infection, a healthcare provider should evaluate the child. If needed, he or she may prescribe an antibiotic ointment or oral antibiotic. Over-the-counter antibiotic creams or ointments (sample brand names: Neosporin, Bacitracin) are not recommended because they contain ingredients such as neomycin and bacitracin, to which many children are allergic.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H21\"><span class=\"h1\">DIAPER RASH PREVENTION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>It is possible to reduce the risk of developing diaper rash by following some basic hygiene suggestions:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>It is not clear whether cloth or disposable diapers are superior in preventing diaper rash. With either choice, changing the diaper frequently can reduce contact between the skin and urine or feces.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>During an episode of diaper rash, disposable diapers are recommended because they are highly absorbent and specifically designed to minimize skin exposure to wetness.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>If cloth diapers are used, avoid using plastic pants to cover the diaper. Cloth diapers should be washed in hot water with bleach.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Clean the skin in the diaper area gently and carefully. Overzealous cleansing can cause or worsen irritation and delay skin healing. Gentle cleansing with warm water and a soft cloth is usually sufficient. If soap is desired, a mild, fragrance-free product (sample brand names: Dove sensitive or Cetaphil) is recommended.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>If baby wipes are used, choose a brand that is alcohol and fragrance-free. Baby wipes are not recommended if the skin becomes irritated or develops open sores. If a diaper rash does not seem to be improving, baby wipes should potentially be stopped, as some baby wipes can cause allergic skin reactions.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Dried feces can be loosened with mineral oil applied to a cotton ball.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Skin that is peeling or broken can be cleansed using a plastic squeeze bottle filled with warm water. Alternately, a washcloth can be soaked in warm water and squeezed out onto the skin. To avoid unnecessary friction, the skin should be patted dry with a soft towel.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H22\"><span class=\"h1\">WHEN TO SEEK HELP</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>If a child develops a fever (temperature above 100.4&deg;F or 38&deg;C) or has bloody stool, a change in the pattern of wet or dirty diapers (eg, constipation, diarrhea, frequent urination, etc), or any other worrisome signs or symptoms, the parent should contact the child's healthcare provider.</p><p>In addition, if an infant or child with diaper rash does not improve after a few days or if the child develops blisters or pus-filled sores, the parent should contact the child's healthcare provider.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H23\"><span class=\"h1\">WHERE TO GET MORE INFORMATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Your child's healthcare provider is the best source of information for questions and concerns related to your child's medical problem.</p><p>This article will be updated as needed on our website (<a href=\"http://www.uptodate.com/patients&amp;token=nygaOTnDuGxGrKiuwLIxjMIsa91xyzRx3QvmgfDh4FTTVfpiGy3XGWFyzaLmJXXU&amp;TOPIC_ID=1176\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">www.uptodate.com/patients</a>).
