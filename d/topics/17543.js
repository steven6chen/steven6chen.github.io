Flying at a high altitude can induce significant hypoxemia in patients with underlying lung disease, despite pressurization of airliner cabins. A large number of air travelers have underlying medical conditions, including pulmonary disease, and are at risk for adverse cardiopulmonary effects related to oxygen desaturation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/traveling-with-oxygen-aboard-commercial-air-carriers/abstract/2-5\" class=\"abstract_t\">2-5</a>].</p><p>The evaluation of patients for potential in-flight hypoxemia and the prescription of supplemental oxygen for air travel are reviewed here.

Changes in atmospheric pressure and oxygen tension may contribute to these events.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Physiology</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>As altitude increases, ambient air pressure decreases, leading to a decrease in the oxygen tension (also known as the partial pressure of oxygen) of inspired air. The inspired oxygen tension (PiO<sub>2</sub>) can be determined by the equation:</p><div class=\"formulaContainer\"><div class=\"formula\"><p>PiO<sub>2</sub> = FiO<sub>2</sub> x (Patm - PH<sub>2</sub>O)</p></div></div><p>where FiO<sub>2</sub> is the fraction of inspired oxygen (0.21 in atmospheric air), Patm is the atmospheric pressure (760 mmHg at sea level), and PH<sub>2</sub>O is the partial pressure of water (47 mmHg at 37&ordm;C). Reduction in the PiO<sub>2</sub> will decrease the alveolar partial pressure of oxygen (PAO<sub>2</sub>). A lower PAO<sub>2</sub> impairs oxygen diffusion by decreasing the oxygen gradient from the alveolus to the artery. The net effect is a lower arterial partial pressure of oxygen (PaO<sub>2</sub>), which may reach the level of hypoxemia (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F77616\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef77616 \">table 1</a>)&nbsp;[<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/traveling-with-oxygen-aboard-commercial-air-carriers/abstract/4,7-9\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,7-9</a>].

Regulatory government agencies, such as the Federal Aviation Administration, have requirements specifying that airliner cabins be pressurized to simulate an altitude (so-called cabin altitude) below 8000 feet (2438 m) and allow only brief diversions to a cabin altitude of 10,000 feet (3048 m) for safety (eg, to avoid adverse weather).</p><p>At cabin altitudes between 5000 and 8000 feet, the PiO<sub>2</sub> is calculated to be between 108 and 122 mmHg [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/traveling-with-oxygen-aboard-commercial-air-carriers/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. The resulting PaO<sub>2</sub> varies due to individual variation in baseline lung function and the ventilatory response to hypoxia.</p><p>Another consequence of the decrease in ambient pressure is that gas in trapped spaces (eg, paranasal sinuses, abdominal viscera, lung bullae, and pleural space) expands (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F77616\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef77616 \">table 1</a>). A potential consequence of the expansion of air within a bulla is tissue separation, causing a pneumothorax. Thus, in addition to the direct effects of decreased oxygen tension, hypoxemia may be caused by barotrauma. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Clinical</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Individuals with normal cardiorespiratory function typically experience a decrease in PaO<sub>2</sub> from above 95 mmHg to between 53 and 75 mmHg when going from sea level to a cabin altitude of 8000 feet (2438 m) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/traveling-with-oxygen-aboard-commercial-air-carriers/abstract/11,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,12</a>]. This change in PaO<sub>2</sub> is on the upper, flat portion of the oxyhemoglobin curve, so the decrease in oxygen saturation is only 3 to 4 percent.</p><p>For patients who have a PaO<sub>2</sub> below 95 mmHg at sea level, the decrease in PaO<sub>2</sub> at a cabin altitude of 8000 feet (2438 m) is on the steeper portion of the oxyhemoglobin saturation curve (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F81216\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef81216 \">figure 1</a>), so it will be associated with a greater fall in oxygen saturation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/traveling-with-oxygen-aboard-commercial-air-carriers/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. As an example, a patient with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and a PaO<sub>2</sub> of 70 mmHg at sea level would be likely to have a decrease in PaO<sub>2</sub> to 53 mmHg and a decrease in oxyhemoglobin saturation to 84 percent at a cabin altitude of 8000 feet [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/traveling-with-oxygen-aboard-commercial-air-carriers/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>].</p><p>Air travelers are usually sedentary during flight, thus reducing the likelihood of symptoms associated with a lower PaO<sub>2</sub>. However, even modest exercise under hypobaric conditions may be associated with substantial worsening of hypoxemia. In a study of 24 patients with various lung diseases, more than 80 percent experienced a decrease in PaO<sub>2</sub> to less than 50 mmHg during exercise in a chamber simulating a cabin altitude of 8000 feet [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/traveling-with-oxygen-aboard-commercial-air-carriers/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>].</p><p>Despite this degree of hypoxemia, patients with COPD who are exposed to high altitude for several days are unlikely to experience adverse clinical events [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/traveling-with-oxygen-aboard-commercial-air-carriers/abstract/2,7,14-17\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,7,14-17</a>]. Most studies suggest that medical emergencies occur in approximately one in every 19,000 to 62,500 travel episodes and deaths are 100-fold less common (about one death per 3,200,000 travel episodes) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/traveling-with-oxygen-aboard-commercial-air-carriers/abstract/2,6,14-17\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,6,14-17</a>].

Based on the algorithm, a 6MWT would also be obtained in patients with underlying lung disease and a resting SpO<sub>2</sub> &gt;95 percent; those with a 6MWT SpO<sub>2</sub> &lt;84 percent would undergo HAST. However, such patients were a minority of those tested in the study, and it is unclear what portion of patients with a resting SpO<sub>2</sub> &gt;95 percent are at risk for clinically important in-flight desaturation. For patients with underlying lung disease and dyspnea when walking on level ground, it is reasonable to monitor oxygen saturation during a 6MWT to assess the need for additional testing.

However, the predictive value of these equations has not been fully validated and this is the least accurate method for predicting in-flight hypoxemia.

The equation was developed by using a hypobaric chamber to simulate exposure to an altitude of 8000 feet (2438 m) in 17 patients with a variety of restrictive diseases, including kyphoscoliosis, pulmonary fibrosis, and sequelae of pulmonary tuberculosis.

This oxygen concentration is chosen as it simulates the oxygen concentration that an individual would breathe at an in-flight cabin altitude of 8000 feet (2438 m). An alternate method for delivering a hypoxic gas mixture is to use a 35 percent Venturi mask with nitrogen as the driving gas [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/traveling-with-oxygen-aboard-commercial-air-carriers/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. This will yield a 15 to 16 percent oxygen mixture.</p><p>At the beginning of the HAST, a sample of arterial blood for measurement of PaO<sub>2</sub> and PaCO<sub>2</sub> is obtained [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/traveling-with-oxygen-aboard-commercial-air-carriers/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>]. The patient's pulse oxygen saturation and electrocardiogram are monitored continuously during the test. Nasal cannula are in place in case supplemental oxygen is needed. A 15.1 percent oxygen mixture is administered via a tight-fitting mask or mouthpiece. The patient is monitored closely for dyspnea, chest pain, or other change in symptoms or vital signs. Dyspnea can be monitored with use of the Borg scale (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F63981\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef63981 \">table 3</a>).

If the PaO<sub>2</sub> at the end of the HAST is greater than 55 mmHg (7.4 kPa, approximately a SpO<sub>2</sub> of 88), supplemental oxygen is NOT needed for air travel. If the PaO<sub>2</sub> decreases to &lt;50 mmHg (6.6 kPa, approximately a SpO<sub>2</sub> of 85), supplemental oxygen is advised for future air travel. If the PaO<sub>2</sub> is 50 to 55 mmHg (6.6 to 7.4 kPa), the test is considered borderline and an additional arterial blood gas sample or pulse oxygen saturation is obtained during mild exertion (eg, walking) while breathing the hypoxic mixture.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h3\">Hypobaric chamber</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Some studies have used a hypobaric chamber to simulate an airline cabin altitude of 8000 feet (2438 m) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/traveling-with-oxygen-aboard-commercial-air-carriers/abstract/13,25,26,33-35\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,25,26,33-35</a>].

This discrepancy was attributed to activity during the flight.</p><p>Additional research using larger, prospective studies with comparison of the estimated in-flight PaO<sub>2</sub> to the actual value is necessary before a predictive method can be clearly recommended.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h1\">DISEASE-SPECIFIC CONSIDERATIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Most of the data on the effects of air travel on oxygenation come from studies of patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). However, patients with other lung diseases (eg, cystic fibrosis, pulmonary hypertension, pulmonary lymphangioleiomyomatosis [LAM]) may have disease-specific issues related to air travel. In addition, the accuracy of methods to predict hypoxemia in-flight has not been well studied in these patient populations.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h2\">Cystic fibrosis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients with cystic fibrosis tend to have few symptoms related to oxygen desaturation at altitude, possibly due to chronically lower oxygen saturation at sea level. An observational study evaluated oxygenation and lung function at an altitude of 8694 feet (2650 meters) in 36 patients with cystic fibrosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/traveling-with-oxygen-aboard-commercial-air-carriers/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>]. A PaO<sub>2</sub> less than 50 mmHg at rest was observed in one-third at rest and in two-thirds during low level exercise (30 watts), the equivalent of walking down the aisle. None of the patients had symptoms at rest and only one patient experienced light-headedness with exercise, despite the hypoxemia. Patients with a baseline PaO<sub>2</sub> of 60 mmHg (8 kPa) or higher tolerated several hours of exposure to an altitude of 8694 feet without symptoms. However, patients with more severe airflow obstruction tended to have a greater degree of desaturation at altitude.</p><p>The consequences of brief periods of asymptomatic hypoxemia in these relatively young patients without concomitant heart disease are not known. In the absence of clear data, the same guidelines for supplemental oxygen are used for patients with cystic fibrosis as for other patients. (See <a href=\"#H344161516\" class=\"local\">'Initial assessment with pulse oximetry'</a> above and <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'Indications for further evaluation'</a> above.)</p><p>Patients with cystic fibrosis who anticipate a long flight may also need to bring a portable, battery-powered nebulizer for administration of medication in-flight.

The combination of exertion and low in-flight oxygen tension may lead to further oxygen desaturation.</p><p>Minimal data are available to guide the clinician in determining whether air travel is safe for a patient with pulmonary hypertension. It has been suggested that patients with New York Heart Association Class III and IV disease (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F52683\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef52683 \">table 5</a>) avoid air travel and that those with less severe disease undergo hypoxia altitude simulation testing [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/traveling-with-oxygen-aboard-commercial-air-carriers/abstract/11,22\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,22</a>] (see <a href=\"#H9\" class=\"local\">'Hypoxia altitude simulation test'</a> above). A small study evaluated 34 patients with pulmonary hypertension (47 percent were Class III or IV) during commercial flights and found that 38 percent developed respiratory symptoms in-flight [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/traveling-with-oxygen-aboard-commercial-air-carriers/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>]. Desaturation was common, occurring in 26 percent, and the overall mean decline in oxygen saturation during flight was 4.9 percent.</p><p>In the absence of simulation testing, it may be reasonable to provide in-flight supplemental oxygen for those with a mean pulmonary artery (PA) pressure of 35 mmHg or higher or a systolic PA pressure of 50 mmHg or higher [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/traveling-with-oxygen-aboard-commercial-air-carriers/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15\"><span class=\"h2\">Pulmonary lymphangioleiomyomatosis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients with LAM are at risk of hypoxemia and pneumothorax during air travel.

This includes patients who require long-term oxygen therapy at baseline. Once it has been determined that the patient should have supplemental oxygen for air travel, the next step is to determine the supplemental oxygen concentration that will result in adequate protection against hypoxemia in flight.</p><p>Actual flow rate requirements can be assessed using a method for hypoxic gas inhalation, such as that used for the high altitude simulation test (HAST) described above [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/traveling-with-oxygen-aboard-commercial-air-carriers/abstract/32,40\" class=\"abstract_t\">32,40</a>]. Similar to the HAST, the patient breathes a hypoxic mixture of nitrogen with 15.1 percent oxygen, while their pulse oxygen saturation (SpO<sub>2</sub>) is monitored. Supplemental oxygen is delivered through a nasal cannula. The oxygen flow rate required to maintain adequate oxygenation during flight can then be estimated by measuring SpO<sub>2</sub> or PaO<sub>2</sub> at different flow rates. (See <a href=\"#H9\" class=\"local\">'Hypoxia altitude simulation test'</a> above.)</p><p>If hypoxia altitude testing is not available, we suggest using an oxygen flow rate of 2 <span class=\"nowrap\">L/minute,</span> based on the observation that this flow rate restored adequate oxygenation in patients whose SpO<sub>2</sub> was below 90 percent during hypoxic altitude simulation testing [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/traveling-with-oxygen-aboard-commercial-air-carriers/abstract/40,41\" class=\"abstract_t\">40,41</a>]. In one study, an oxygen flow rate of 2 <span class=\"nowrap\">L/min</span> was sufficient in 20 travelers with either obstructive or restrictive lung disease, although one patient with severe COPD required oxygen at 3 <span class=\"nowrap\">L/minute</span> to achieve a SpO<sub>2</sub> over 90 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/traveling-with-oxygen-aboard-commercial-air-carriers/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>]. Similarly, in a study that used hypoxic gas to simulate an altitude of 6700 feet, supplemental oxygen via nasal cannula at 1.2 + 0.3 <span class=\"nowrap\">L/minute</span> restored baseline oxygen saturation in 11 patients with COPD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/traveling-with-oxygen-aboard-commercial-air-carriers/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>].</p><p>No specific guidelines exist for patients who require long-term supplemental oxygen at sea level. These patients will likely need to increase their oxygen flow while at cruising altitude. Preferably, the liter flow requirements are determined by direct measurement in a hypoxia altitude simulation test, as described above [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/traveling-with-oxygen-aboard-commercial-air-carriers/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. An alternative is to increase the oxygen flow 1 to 2 <span class=\"nowrap\">L/minute</span> over baseline while in flight [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/traveling-with-oxygen-aboard-commercial-air-carriers/abstract/1,32\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,32</a>].

Most patients can use a Department of Transportation approved battery-powered portable oxygen concentrator, as airlines landing in the United States are now required to allow use of these devices throughout the flight [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/traveling-with-oxygen-aboard-commercial-air-carriers/abstract/43\" class=\"abstract_t\">43</a>]. Alternatively, some airlines provide oxygen that is supplied in an oxygen canister packaged in a flame proof &quot;super box&quot; [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/traveling-with-oxygen-aboard-commercial-air-carriers/abstract/44\" class=\"abstract_t\">44</a>].</p><p>Approved portable oxygen concentrators (eg, Inogen One, Airsep Lifestyle, Devilbiss Healthcare iGo) are generally available for rental from oxygen supply companies. The concentrators provide up to 3 <span class=\"nowrap\">L/minute</span> of continuous flow, or 6 <span class=\"nowrap\">L/minute</span> of pulsed flow [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/traveling-with-oxygen-aboard-commercial-air-carriers/abstract/43\" class=\"abstract_t\">43</a>]. Battery power is needed for operation, so patients typically need to bring enough 12-cell batteries for one and one-half times the anticipated duration of the flight. Available portable oxygen concentrators differ in their ability to raise saturation and the duration of battery charge [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/traveling-with-oxygen-aboard-commercial-air-carriers/abstract/45\" class=\"abstract_t\">45</a>].</p><p>Permission to use oxygen supplied by the airline or a portable oxygen concentrator is required in advance of travel (10 days for some airlines), which means that the evaluation of supplemental oxygen requirements must be performed at least 10 days before actual travel [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/traveling-with-oxygen-aboard-commercial-air-carriers/abstract/43\" class=\"abstract_t\">43</a>]. The traveler will require a clinician's letter specifying the underlying pulmonary condition, the prescribed liter flow, and whether supplemental oxygen is required just during flight or throughout the day (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F71862\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef71862 \">figure 2</a>).</p><p>Airline practices about the availability and cost of in&ndash;flight oxygen are not standardized throughout the airline industry, so clinicians and patients may need to consult brochures and source documents for specific carriers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/traveling-with-oxygen-aboard-commercial-air-carriers/abstract/46,47\" class=\"abstract_t\">46,47</a>]. Practical details such as the interface (eg, mask or nasal cannula) and the liter flow options are likely to vary between carriers. Prospective oxygen-using travelers are advised to seek comparative, current information when planning a trip [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/traveling-with-oxygen-aboard-commercial-air-carriers/abstract/47\" class=\"abstract_t\">47</a>].</p><p>Several web sites offer a list of current air carriers' policies regarding use of in-flight oxygen and allowable equipment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/traveling-with-oxygen-aboard-commercial-air-carriers/abstract/43,44,48,49\" class=\"abstract_t\">43,44,48,49</a>].
