Severe anemia in pregnancy requires treatment. Very severe anemia in pregnancy is a medical emergency due to the risk of maternal congestive heart failure. Hgb levels less than 10 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/dL</span> or greater than 16 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/dL</span> should prompt urgent hematologic evaluation unless the etiology is known or the abnormalities are related to a pre-existent chronic condition. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=approach-to-the-adult-with-anemia\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Approach to the adult with anemia&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-polycythemia-vera\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of polycythemia vera&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Evidence of iron deficiency (new microcytosis or iron studies consistent with iron deficiency). The demand for iron is increased in pregnancy; iron deficiency is therefore common. However, approximately one-third of pregnant women with iron deficiency do not manifest microcytosis. Furthermore, pregnant women can have iron deficiency anemia with ferritin levels in the low-normal reference range. The other major cause of microcytic anemia is thalassemia, which may not come to medical attention until pregnancy in some cases. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=causes-and-diagnosis-of-iron-deficiency-and-iron-deficiency-anemia-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Causes and diagnosis of iron deficiency and iron deficiency anemia in adults&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=approach-to-the-adult-with-anemia\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Approach to the adult with anemia&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">While oral iron supplementation in prenatal vitamins is standard, this may not be sufficient and oral iron supplements are often poorly tolerated and cause constipation. Thus parenteral iron administration should be considered in women with iron deficiency anemia who do not respond or cannot tolerate oral iron supplementation. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-iron-deficiency-anemia-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of iron deficiency anemia in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Leukocytosis or leukopenia. Leukocytosis due to an excess of neutrophils can occur in some women during pregnancy in the absence of infection or inflammatory conditions. Findings prompting urgent hematologic consultation include a white blood cell (WBC) count <span class=\"nowrap\">&gt;20,000/microL</span> or a WBC differential showing immature myeloid forms or a marked excess of lymphocytes. Leukopenia in association with an absolute neutrophil count <span class=\"nowrap\">&lt;1000/microL</span> that is unexplained requires urgent hematologic evaluation. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=approach-to-the-patient-with-neutrophilia\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Approach to the patient with neutrophilia&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=approach-to-the-adult-with-unexplained-neutropenia\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Approach to the adult with unexplained neutropenia&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Severe thrombocytopenia or thrombocytopenia with bleeding. Gestational thrombocytopenia with a reduced platelet count (typically, between 80,000 and <span class=\"nowrap\">149,000/microL)</span> is common during pregnancy. Levels below this level should prompt hematologic consultation. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=thrombocytopenia-in-pregnancy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Thrombocytopenia in pregnancy&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Thrombocytosis. The new onset of thrombocytosis is unusual during pregnancy, and platelet counts <span class=\"nowrap\">&gt;500,000/microL</span> should prompt hematologic evaluation. Platelet counts <span class=\"nowrap\">&gt;1,000,000/microL</span> require urgent evaluation. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=approach-to-the-patient-with-thrombocytosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Approach to the patient with thrombocytosis&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diagnosis-and-clinical-manifestations-of-essential-thrombocythemia\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Diagnosis and clinical manifestations of essential thrombocythemia&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p>The urgency of intervention should be determined by the treating clinician <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> the consultant hematologist. In general, the more severely abnormal the finding, the more quickly the specialty consultation is obtained.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1549271045\"><span class=\"h1\">PLASMA VOLUME</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Plasma volume increases by 10 to 15 percent at 6 to 12 weeks of gestation, expands rapidly until 30 to 34 weeks, and then plateaus or decreases slightly through term (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F61948\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef61948 \">figure 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/maternal-adaptations-to-pregnancy-hematologic-changes/abstract/1-3\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-3</a>]. The total gain at term averages 1100 to 1600 mL and results in a total plasma volume of 4700 to 5200 mL, which is 30 to 50 percent above that in nonpregnant women [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/maternal-adaptations-to-pregnancy-hematologic-changes/abstract/1,4,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,4,5</a>]. The expanded plasma volume has been hypothesized to meet the increased metabolic demands of the uterus and placenta, facilitate delivery of nutrients to the developing fetus and removal of waste, protect against the effects of impaired venous return when the mother is supine or standing, and protect the mother from excessive blood loss during delivery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/maternal-adaptations-to-pregnancy-hematologic-changes/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].</p><p>During pregnancy, plasma renin activity tends to be increased and atrial natriuretic peptide levels are slightly reduced [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/maternal-adaptations-to-pregnancy-hematologic-changes/abstract/7,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,8</a>]. These changes suggest that the rise in plasma volume is in response to an underfilled vascular system caused by systemic vasodilatation and the rise in vascular capacitance. The converse picture (low plasma renin activity and elevated natriuretic peptide, suggestive of a vascular response to expanded plasma volume) are not seen. The hypothesis that vascular changes precede expansion of the plasma volume is also supported by the observation that increasing sodium intake does not lead to further volume expansion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/maternal-adaptations-to-pregnancy-hematologic-changes/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. Of note, total plasma volume expansion is accompanied by retention of 900 to 1000 mEq of sodium and 6 to 8 L of water, which is distributed among the fetus, amniotic fluid, and extracellular and intracellular spaces [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/maternal-adaptations-to-pregnancy-hematologic-changes/abstract/9,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,10</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=maternal-adaptations-to-pregnancy-endocrine-and-metabolic-changes#H10\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Maternal adaptations to pregnancy: Endocrine and metabolic changes&quot;, section on 'Adrenal gland'</a>.)</p><p>There are no specific measures available to expand the plasma volume in pregnant women, and there is no evidence that the expansion of plasma volume would reverse or prevent associated poor pregnancy outcomes. In theory, increasing dietary protein could improve colloid oncotic pressure (COP), which would shift extravascular fluid to the intravascular space. However, recommendations for protein intake during pregnancy vary among normal and complicated pregnancies (eg, women with preeclampsia). For dehydrated women, increasing maternal hydration may also act synergistically with a higher COP to improve intravascular volume.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2012487277\"><span class=\"h1\">RED BLOOD CELLS</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2171825390\"><span class=\"h2\">Increased mass</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Red blood cell (RBC) mass begins to increase at 8 to 10 weeks of gestation, steadily rises, and reaches levels 20 to 30 percent higher than in nonpregnant women by the end of pregnancy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/maternal-adaptations-to-pregnancy-hematologic-changes/abstract/4,11-14\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,11-14</a>]. This is accompanied by a slight increase in the mean corpuscular volume (MCV) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F89214\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef89214 \">table 1</a>) in healthy pregnant women [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/maternal-adaptations-to-pregnancy-hematologic-changes/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. However, as noted above, the increase in RBC mass is smaller than the increase in plasma volume, which contributes to the physiologic anemia of pregnancy. The increase in RBC mass requires sufficient iron, folate, and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cyanocobalamin-vitamin-b12-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">vitamin B12</a>; thus, women with deficiencies of iron or these vitamins will have blunted increases in RBC mass and are likely to develop more severe anemia. (See <a href=\"#H929618389\" class=\"local\">'Dilutional anemia'</a> below.)</p><p>As an example, in a series of 69 women not receiving iron supplements, the RBC mass was estimated to increase by 15 to 20 percent and the MCV decreased to an average value of 80 to 84 fL in the third trimester [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/maternal-adaptations-to-pregnancy-hematologic-changes/abstract/16,17\" class=\"abstract_t\">16,17</a>]. Thus, a declining hemoglobin, hematocrit, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> MCV should prompt evaluation for iron deficiency. Hematologic laboratory reference ranges for nonpregnant and pregnant women (by trimester) are presented in the table (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F115338\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef115338 \">table 2</a>).</p><p>The major mediator of increased RBC mass is an increase in erythropoietin, which stimulates RBC production [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/maternal-adaptations-to-pregnancy-hematologic-changes/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. Erythropoietin levels increase by 50 percent in normal pregnancies and vary according to the presence of pregnancy complications [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/maternal-adaptations-to-pregnancy-hematologic-changes/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. RBC lifespan is also slightly decreased during normal pregnancy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/maternal-adaptations-to-pregnancy-hematologic-changes/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>].</p><p>The increased RBC mass partially supports the higher metabolic requirement for oxygen during pregnancy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/maternal-adaptations-to-pregnancy-hematologic-changes/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. In addition, levels of RBC 2,3 bisphosphoglycerate (2,3-BPG, also called 2,3-diphosphoglycerate [2,3-DPG]) remain elevated during pregnancy, which leads to a decrease in oxygen affinity (ie, a shift of the hemoglobin-oxygen dissociation curve to the right) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F81216\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef81216 \">figure 2</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/maternal-adaptations-to-pregnancy-hematologic-changes/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. This lower oxygen affinity, combined with low pCO<sub>2</sub> of the maternal blood due to increased minute ventilation, facilitates transport of oxygen across the placenta and to the fetal RBCs, which have greater oxygen affinity due to fetal hemoglobin. The function of fetal hemoglobin is reviewed elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fetal-hemoglobin-hemoglobin-f-in-health-and-disease#H359562785\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Fetal hemoglobin (hemoglobin F) in health and disease&quot;, section on 'Biology of fetal hemoglobin'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3065507296\"><span class=\"h3\">Iron requirements</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In a typical singleton gestation, maternal iron requirements average close to 1000 mg over the course of pregnancy: approximately 300 mg for the fetus and placenta and approximately 500 mg, if available, for the expansion of the maternal RBC mass [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/maternal-adaptations-to-pregnancy-hematologic-changes/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. An additional 200 mg is shed through the gut, urine, and skin. Since most women do not have adequate iron stores to meet the demands of pregnancy, iron is commonly prescribed as part of a prenatal multivitamin or as a separate supplement. In general, women taking iron supplements have a mean hemoglobin concentration that is 1 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/dL</span> greater than that of women not taking supplements. Reference ranges for iron indices in pregnancy are listed in the table (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F115338\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef115338 \">table 2</a>). Recommended iron intake and treatment of iron deficiency in pregnancy are presented in detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nutrition-in-pregnancy#H717781762\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Nutrition in pregnancy&quot;, section on 'Iron'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-iron-deficiency-anemia-in-adults#H232286611\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of iron deficiency anemia in adults&quot;, section on 'Pregnancy'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3938929706\"><span class=\"h3\">Folate requirements</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The increase in RBC production during pregnancy creates an increased demand for folate and an increased risk of folate deficiency. The increased folate demand for RBC creation is more than met by the higher daily intake (400 to 800 mcg) already recommended for prevention of neural tube defects [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/maternal-adaptations-to-pregnancy-hematologic-changes/abstract/22,23\" class=\"abstract_t\">22,23</a>].

This decrease is due to a greater expansion of plasma volume relative to the increase in RBC mass, as discussed above (see <a href=\"#H1549271045\" class=\"local\">'Plasma volume'</a> above and <a href=\"#H2171825390\" class=\"local\">'Increased mass'</a> above). The greatest disproportion between the rates at which plasma and RBCs are added to the maternal circulation occurs during the late second to early third trimester, and thus, the lowest hemoglobin concentration is typically measured at 28 to 36 weeks [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/maternal-adaptations-to-pregnancy-hematologic-changes/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. Nearer to term, hemoglobin concentration increases due to cessation of plasma expansion and continuing increase in RBC mass (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F61948\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef61948 \">figure 1</a>).</p><p>The most common cause of anemia other than physiologic change of pregnancy is iron deficiency, which is presented separately.

We advise urgent hematologic evaluation for pregnant women with a hemoglobin &lt;10 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/dL</span> or &gt;16 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/dL</span> unless the etiology is known or the abnormalities are related to a pre-existing chronic condition. (See <a href=\"#H1548795187\" class=\"local\">'Findings of concern'</a> above.) </p><p>Other organizations define anemia in pregnancy as the following:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has defined anemia in pregnant women as a hemoglobin level &lt;11 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/dL</span> (approximately equivalent to a hematocrit &lt;33 percent) in the first and third trimesters and &lt;10.5 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/dL</span> (hematocrit &lt;32 percent) in the second trimester [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/maternal-adaptations-to-pregnancy-hematologic-changes/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. Since hemoglobin and hematocrit levels are lower in African-Americans, the National Academy of Medicine (formerly the Institute of Medicine) recommends lowering the hemoglobin cut-off level by 0.8 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/dL</span> in this population [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/maternal-adaptations-to-pregnancy-hematologic-changes/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The World Health Organization defines anemia in pregnant women as a hemoglobin level &lt;110 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/L</span> (&lt;11 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/dL)</span> or a hematocrit &lt;6.83 <span class=\"nowrap\">mmol/L</span> (&lt;33 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/maternal-adaptations-to-pregnancy-hematologic-changes/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>].

Women with hemoglobin values below the expected levels warrant additional evaluation for other contributing factors to anemia and should undergo a standard evaluation (eg, review of the other parameters on the CBC, review of the peripheral blood smear, reticulocyte count, and iron studies) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/maternal-adaptations-to-pregnancy-hematologic-changes/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>].

Studies using serial platelet counts during uncomplicated pregnancies are conflicting regarding whether the mean platelet count decreases during pregnancy, and some studies suggest that a dilutional thrombocytopenia occurs in pregnancy by similar mechanisms as the dilutional anemia of pregnancy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/maternal-adaptations-to-pregnancy-hematologic-changes/abstract/35,44,45\" class=\"abstract_t\">35,44,45</a>].</p><p>Mild thrombocytopenia (eg, platelet count between 80,000 and <span class=\"nowrap\">149,000/microL)</span> occurs in approximately 5 to 7 percent of pregnancies.

The shift in the balance between the hemostatic and fibrinolytic systems serves to prevent excessive hemorrhage during placental separation. Compared with nonpregnant women, pregnant women have a marked increase in some coagulation factors, reduced fibrinolysis, and increased platelet reactivity.

While these changes increase the risk of thrombosis, they are not in and of themselves an indication for intervention.</p><p>Laboratory tests of coagulation are not routinely performed (or required) during pregnancy. However, if performed, these test results are expected to be in the normal range.
