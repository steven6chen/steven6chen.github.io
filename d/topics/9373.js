These conditions afflict 20 percent of the population of the United States, and their prevalence appears to be increasing in developed nations. The increase in atopic diseases has been recognized as a pandemic, thus emphasizing the need for effective allergy prevention [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/introducing-formula-to-infants-at-risk-for-allergic-disease/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p>Convincing studies support the existence of a critical time early in infancy during which the genetically predisposed atopic infant is at higher risk for becoming sensitized [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/introducing-formula-to-infants-at-risk-for-allergic-disease/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Thus, dietary interventions in the first year of life have been analyzed for their effects on the prevalence of allergic disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/introducing-formula-to-infants-at-risk-for-allergic-disease/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].</p><p>Studies examining the associations between the use of various infant formulas and the development of allergic diseases in infants at high risk for atopic conditions are discussed in this topic review. Associations between early or delayed introduction of complementary foods and the development of atopy are reviewed separately, as are other aspects of the primary prevention of allergic disease.

There is no evidence to support administration of hydrolyzed formula in preference to exclusive breastfeeding to prevent allergy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/introducing-formula-to-infants-at-risk-for-allergic-disease/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>], although observational data show an inverse association between early exposure to conventional cow's milk (CM) formula (exclusive or as a daily supplement to breastfeeding) and development of cow's milk allergy (CMA) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/introducing-formula-to-infants-at-risk-for-allergic-disease/abstract/11-13\" class=\"abstract_t\">11-13</a>]. There is also no convincing evidence that the use of soy formula helps prevent atopic disease in infants at high risk for allergy. The quality of data are low and inconsistent with regard to the use of hypoallergenic formula for the prevention of allergic disease in high-risk infants. Some individual studies have suggested that using a hydrolyzed formula rather than a conventional CM formula for high-risk infants who cannot be exclusively breastfed for the first four to six months of life has a protective effect for prevention of eczema. However, a 2016 meta-analysis that examined use of conventional and hydrolyzed CM formulas in high-risk infants found limited efficacy with regard to prevention of atopic disease for most measures [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/introducing-formula-to-infants-at-risk-for-allergic-disease/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>], while a 2017 meta-analysis examining only the effect of a specific partial whey hydrolysate formula (pHF-W) formula compared with CM formula found a decreased risk of eczema in high-risk infants at certain ages [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/introducing-formula-to-infants-at-risk-for-allergic-disease/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. Amino acid-based formulas have not yet been studied in the primary prevention of allergy.</p><p>We still advise that high-risk infants who cannot be exclusively breastfed for the first four to six months of life receive a partially hydrolyzed formula (pHF) or extensively hydrolyzed formula (eHF) in preference to a conventional CM or soy formula for the purpose of preventing allergic diseases, particularly eczema. However, this recommendation may change over time as data accumulate and are reviewed. The National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID); the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP); the American Academy of Allergy, Asthma, and Immunology (AAAAI); and the European Academy of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (EAACI) food allergy guidelines are undergoing revision, and the Australasia Society of Clinical Immunology and Allergy (ASCIA) no longer recommends a pHF or eHF over a conventional CM formula [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/introducing-formula-to-infants-at-risk-for-allergic-disease/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>].</p><p>This section reviews the data on the role of various infant formulas in the prevention of allergic diseases in high-risk infants [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/introducing-formula-to-infants-at-risk-for-allergic-disease/abstract/4,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,10</a>]. For infants who are <strong>not</strong> at increased risk for atopy, there is no conclusive evidence that one formula provides any advantage over another. Formula selection for infants with milk allergy is discussed separately.

However, parents may occasionally inquire about the use of a hydrolyzed formula in preference to breast milk for the prevention of allergic disease. A 2006 systematic review determined that there were no eligible long-term studies comparing prolonged use of hydrolyzed formulas with breastfeeding [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/introducing-formula-to-infants-at-risk-for-allergic-disease/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. Therefore, there are no data directly addressing this issue.</p><p>The only studies comparing hydrolyzed formulas with breast milk examined early- and short-term exposure to hydrolyzed formula, which did not appear to have any impact on the development of allergic disease. Two studies compared feeding with hydrolyzed formula or human milk during the first three days of life or while in the hospital. One followed 129 infants for signs of any allergic disease up to age 24 months [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/introducing-formula-to-infants-at-risk-for-allergic-disease/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>], and the other followed 3559 infants for the development of CMA up to a mean age of 27 months [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/introducing-formula-to-infants-at-risk-for-allergic-disease/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>].

There are a number of limitations with the available data, including a wide variation in study design and criteria for diagnosis of atopic diseases, as well as publication and methodologic biases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/introducing-formula-to-infants-at-risk-for-allergic-disease/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h3\">Cow's milk formula versus partially hydrolyzed formula</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Individual studies comparing the effects of pHF-W and CM formulas on the prevention of allergy have suggested a preventive effect of pHFs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/introducing-formula-to-infants-at-risk-for-allergic-disease/abstract/22-26\" class=\"abstract_t\">22-26</a>]. However, a 2016 meta-analysis of studies comparing pHFs with CM formula found no difference between the two formula groups with regard to the risk of eczema, recurrent wheeze, or food allergy up to 14 years of age and allergic rhinitis (AR) from 5 to 14 years of age [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/introducing-formula-to-infants-at-risk-for-allergic-disease/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. They did find a significantly reduced risk of AR at zero to four years of age in the group fed pHFs, but there were methodologic concerns with the study that dominated this part of the meta-analysis. This is in contrast to a 2017 meta-analysis comparing one specific pHF-W with CM formula that found a decreased risk of allergic disease, particularly eczema [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/introducing-formula-to-infants-at-risk-for-allergic-disease/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>].</p><p>The following studies are illustrative:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The incidence of atopic manifestations was examined in 67 high-risk infants fed either a pHF-W or a CM formula [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/introducing-formula-to-infants-at-risk-for-allergic-disease/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. Solid foods were introduced at six months. The appearance of manifestations of atopic disease within the first six months after birth was 6 and 40 percent in infants fed the pHF or CM formula, respectively. The benefit of the pHF remained statistically significant to one year of age, at which time probable atopic diseases were reported in 22 and 49 percent of the pHF-fed group and CM formula-fed group, respectively. Significantly more infants fed CM formula had CM sensitivity when compared with the pHF-fed infants. There was an overall high prevalence of CM sensitivity in the study due to less strict diagnostic criteria and possibly selection bias.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The same group performed a randomized, prospective, five-year study comparing strict use of a pHF or a CM formula for the first six months of life in 58 nonbreastfed, high-risk infants [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/introducing-formula-to-infants-at-risk-for-allergic-disease/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. At six months, the prevalence of CM protein sensitivity, as assessed by skin testing to CM, was significantly decreased in the group receiving the pHF (7 versus 43 percent). The differences remained significant at 12, 36, and 60 months (29 versus 60 percent) if calculated cumulatively. However, there was no statistically significant difference between the two groups if only new cases after the age of six months were considered, suggesting that the principal impact of the pHF occurred during the first six months of life. Similar to the previous study and probably for the same reasons, there was a very high prevalence of CM sensitivity.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A single-blind, randomized trial in 620 high-risk infants was performed to investigate allergic outcomes among those fed a CM formula, a pHF-W, or a soy formula after breastfeeding was discontinued [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/introducing-formula-to-infants-at-risk-for-allergic-disease/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. Skin testing was performed at 6, 12, and 24 months of age, and telephone interviews were performed several times through age two years and then again at six to seven years of age to assess allergic disease outcomes. Based upon both per-protocol and intention-to-treat (ITT) analyses, neither pHF-W nor soy formula reduced the risk of allergic disease, primarily eczema or food reactions, at two years of age compared with CM formula. There was also no difference between groups in rates of eczema, asthma, or AR at seven years of age.

This study found that hydrolyzed formulas (especially eHF-C), compared with conventional CM formulas, have the potential to reduce the risk of atopic disease when used as a supplement or substitute to breast milk during the first four months of life.

Only one study with approximately 20 percent losses to follow-up reported a reduction in cumulative incidence of childhood allergy, asthma, and AR with the use of a soy formula compared with a CM formula. Analysis showed no significant difference in cumulative incidence of infant allergy (one study) or childhood allergy (three studies).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H162518242\"><span class=\"h1\">SOCIETY GUIDELINE LINKS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Links to society and government-sponsored guidelines from selected countries and regions around the world are provided separately.

(See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Infants at high risk for developing allergy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For high-risk infants who cannot be exclusively breastfed for the first four to six months of life, the use of a partially or extensively hydrolyzed formula in preference to a conventional cow's milk (CM) or soy formula may be beneficial for the prevention of allergic disease, particularly eczema. Ongoing evaluations of the available data have questioned the impact of this intervention though, and this recommendation may change in the future as academic medical societies continue to review the literature.
