Epidemiologic studies first showed an association between poor glycemic control and microvascular complications [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/glycemic-control-and-vascular-complications-in-type-1-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/1-4\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-4</a>]. The causal relationship of this association was confirmed in the prospective Diabetes Control and Complications Trial (DCCT), which demonstrated that intensive therapy aimed at lower levels of glycemia results in decreased rates of retinopathy, nephropathy, and neuropathy in type 1 diabetes patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/glycemic-control-and-vascular-complications-in-type-1-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/5,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,6</a>]. Similar findings have been noted in other studies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/glycemic-control-and-vascular-complications-in-type-1-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].</p><p>The importance of tight glycemic control for protection against macrovascular disease in diabetes has also been established in the <span class=\"nowrap\">DCCT/Epidemiology</span> of Diabetes Interventions and Complications (EDIC) study for type 1 diabetes. In the EDIC follow-up study to the DCCT, intensive insulin therapy in patients with type 1 diabetes decreased fatal and nonfatal cardiovascular events [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/glycemic-control-and-vascular-complications-in-type-1-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. The effects of glycemic control on microvascular and macrovascular complications in type 1 diabetes will be reviewed here. Glycemic control and vascular complications in type 2 diabetes is discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=glycemic-control-and-vascular-complications-in-type-2-diabetes-mellitus\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Glycemic control and vascular complications in type 2 diabetes mellitus&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">PATHOGENESIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The mechanism by which lack of glycemic control predisposes to vascular disease is incompletely understood. Two proposed contributing factors are advanced glycation end products and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sorbitol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">sorbitol</a>; protein kinase C and other factors also may contribute (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEPH%2F61356\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef61356 \">algorithm 1</a>). In addition to systemic factors, organ-specific factors also appear to be important. In the kidney, for example, stimulation of mesangial matrix production by hyperglycemia, activation of protein kinase C, and an increasing degree of intraglomerular hypertension may contribute to the glomerular injury. </p><p>Genetic predisposition may be another important factor. This was illustrated in a report from the Diabetes Control and Complications Trial (DCCT) in which 372 patients and 467 first-degree relatives with diabetes were evaluated [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/glycemic-control-and-vascular-complications-in-type-1-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. Severe retinopathy was three times more frequent among the relatives of patients with retinopathy than among relatives of patients who did not have retinopathy. Familial clustering was also noted for diabetic nephropathy.</p><p>A more in-depth discussion of the pathogenesis of diabetic nephropathy, retinopathy, and neuropathy can be found elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-diabetic-nephropathy#H8\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of diabetic nephropathy&quot;, section on 'Pathogenesis'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diabetic-retinopathy-pathogenesis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Diabetic retinopathy: Pathogenesis&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pathogenesis-and-prevention-of-diabetic-polyneuropathy#H4\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pathogenesis and prevention of diabetic polyneuropathy&quot;, section on 'Pathogenesis'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">MICROVASCULAR DISEASE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>An association between glycemic control and the development and progression of the microvascular complications of diabetes (retinopathy, nephropathy, and neuropathy) has been suggested from studies in both animals and humans. As an example, epidemiologic studies suggest that nephropathy and retinopathy are more likely to occur in patients with poorer glycemic control [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/glycemic-control-and-vascular-complications-in-type-1-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/1-4\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-4</a>]. The risk is highest if the glycated hemoglobin (A1C) value is above 12 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/glycemic-control-and-vascular-complications-in-type-1-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>] but is still increased at all values above the nondiabetic range [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/glycemic-control-and-vascular-complications-in-type-1-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. The severity of hyperglycemia also is correlated with recurrent diabetic nephropathy in patients who have received a renal transplant [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/glycemic-control-and-vascular-complications-in-type-1-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>].</p><p>The causal relationship of this association was confirmed in a meta-analysis of 12 trials evaluating different glycemic targets in patients with type 1 diabetes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/glycemic-control-and-vascular-complications-in-type-1-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. Compared with conventional treatment, intensive glucose control significantly reduced the risk of developing retinopathy (6.2 versus 23.2 percent, relative risk [RR] 0.27), nephropathy (16.3 versus 28.4 percent, RR 0.56), and neuropathy (4.9 versus 13.9 percent, RR 0.35). The largest trial in the meta-analysis was the Diabetes Control and Complications Trial (DCCT) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/glycemic-control-and-vascular-complications-in-type-1-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. In this trial, patients with type 1 diabetes were randomly assigned to receive either conventional therapy or intensive insulin therapy, consisting of multiple daily injections or continuous insulin administration using an insulin pump and guided by frequent self-monitoring of blood glucose. Patients with no retinopathy or nephropathy at baseline were evaluated in the primary prevention study, while those with established disease were evaluated in the secondary intervention study.</p><p>The median A1C values during the 6.5-year study were 7.2 percent with intensive therapy as opposed to 9.1 percent with conventional therapy; the respective mean blood glucose concentrations were 155 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> (8.6 <span class=\"nowrap\">mmol/L)</span> and 235 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> (12.8 <span class=\"nowrap\">mmol/L)</span>. The DCCT provided conclusive evidence that strict glycemic control can both delay the onset of microvascular complications (primary prevention) and slow the rate of progression of already-present complications (secondary intervention).</p><p>Following completion of the DCCT in 1993, the conventional treatment group was offered intensive treatment, and 93 percent of DCCT participants (n = 1394) agreed to participate in the observational Epidemiology of Diabetes Interventions and Complications (EDIC) study [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/glycemic-control-and-vascular-complications-in-type-1-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. Eleven years of follow-up were concluded in February 2005. Differences in A1C levels between the intensive and conventional treatment groups at the end of the DCCT trial (7.4 and 9.1 percent, respectively) narrowed at the end of the 11 year follow-up EDIC (7.9 and 7.8 percent, respectively) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/glycemic-control-and-vascular-complications-in-type-1-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>].</p><p>The individual microvascular endpoints of the <span class=\"nowrap\">DCCT/EDIC</span> are discussed immediately below.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Retinopathy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Retinopathy has been chosen as the major endpoint in many of the prospective diabetes trials because it is the most common microvascular complication and is relatively easy to quantify and follow. Standard retinal photographs are taken and scored, based upon the number of microaneurysms, hemorrhages, exudates, and other abnormalities. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diabetic-retinopathy-classification-and-clinical-features\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Diabetic retinopathy: Classification and clinical features&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diabetic-retinopathy-pathogenesis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Diabetic retinopathy: Pathogenesis&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h3\">Primary prevention</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The DCCT demonstrated a substantial benefit of intensive insulin therapy in the primary prevention of diabetic retinopathy; at nine years, the incidence of new retinopathy was 12 percent in the intensive therapy group versus 54 percent in the conventional therapy group [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/glycemic-control-and-vascular-complications-in-type-1-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. There was a continuous relation between the degree of glycemic control and the incidence of retinopathy; the rate of progression increased from one per 100 patient-years at a mean A1C value of 5.5 percent up to 9.5 per 100 patient-years at a mean A1C value of 10.5 percent; progressive retinopathy was uncommon at A1C values below 7 percent (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F82664\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef82664 \">figure 1</a>).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h3\">Established retinopathy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In addition to its efficacy in primary prevention, intensive insulin therapy also slows the rate of progression of mild to moderate retinopathy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/glycemic-control-and-vascular-complications-in-type-1-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. However, during the first two years of intensive therapy, the DCCT found that retinopathy may worsen (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F61305\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef61305 \">figure 2</a>), most commonly in association with an increased number of soft exudates (due to retinal infarcts in the superficial layers) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/glycemic-control-and-vascular-complications-in-type-1-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/14,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">14,15</a>]. This probably represents the closure of small retinal blood vessels that were narrowed but patent. Correction of hyperglycemia lowers the plasma volume, which can put marginal vessels at risk. Increased availability of insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) also may contribute [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/glycemic-control-and-vascular-complications-in-type-1-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diabetic-retinopathy-pathogenesis#H8\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Diabetic retinopathy: Pathogenesis&quot;, section on 'Growth factors'</a>.)</p><p>This early worsening of retinopathy in the DCCT was transient, largely resolving after 18 to 24 months, and there was clear evidence of benefit from intensive therapy when patients with very mild to moderate nonproliferative retinopathy were followed for nine years (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F61305\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef61305 \">figure 2</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/glycemic-control-and-vascular-complications-in-type-1-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. The incidence of worsening retinopathy in intensively treated patients was higher than in those receiving conventional therapy at one year (7.4 versus 3 percent) but much lower at nine years (25 versus 53 percent).</p><p>At the end of the DCCT, the conventional treatment group was taught intensive therapy, and the diabetes care of all of the participants was returned to their own health care providers. During the subsequent observational follow-up of the DCCT cohort, in the EDIC study, the difference in the median A1C values between the original intensive and conventional therapy groups (7.2 and 9.1 percent, respectively) narrowed during follow-up (8.1 and 8.2 percent, respectively, by five years) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/glycemic-control-and-vascular-complications-in-type-1-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/17,18\" class=\"abstract_t\">17,18</a>].</p><p>However, despite the nonsignificant difference in glycemia during EDIC, the reduction in risk of retinopathy associated with intensive insulin therapy persisted for as long as 10 years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/glycemic-control-and-vascular-complications-in-type-1-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/18,19\" class=\"abstract_t\">18,19</a>]. Patients who received intensive insulin therapy during the DCCT had a lower incidence of progression of retinopathy (increase of three or more steps from baseline) during the EDIC follow-up period than those who had received conventional therapy during the DCCT (risk reduction 53 percent, 95% CI 43-61 percent). Thus, intensive insulin therapy for 6.5 years during the DCCT reduced the risk of retinopathy over at least the next 10 years compared with conventional therapy, despite an absence of a difference in A1C values during the post-DCCT trial period. This phenomenon has been called &quot;metabolic memory.&quot;</p><p>Strict glycemic control is of little or no benefit in advanced retinopathy. This has been best demonstrated in patients who have undergone pancreas transplantation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/glycemic-control-and-vascular-complications-in-type-1-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/20,21\" class=\"abstract_t\">20,21</a>]. In one study, for example, 22 transplanted patients (most of whom had advanced retinopathy) were compared with 16 nontransplanted patients with similar disease severity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/glycemic-control-and-vascular-complications-in-type-1-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. Despite the attainment and maintenance of normoglycemia in the transplant group, there was no difference between the groups in the rates of progression of retinopathy or visual loss at two years. There was some suggestion of less deterioration at three years in the transplanted patients.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1002199\"><span class=\"h2\">Ocular surgery</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In addition to the benefits of intensive insulin therapy in preventing the development and slowing the progression of retinopathy, intensive insulin therapy during the DCCT (6.5 years) resulted in a reduction in the incidence of diabetes-related ocular surgery (cataract extraction; vitrectomy, retinal-detachment surgery, or both; glaucoma-related surgery; cornea-related or lens-related surgery; or enucleation) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/glycemic-control-and-vascular-complications-in-type-1-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. Over a median total follow-up of 23 years, significantly fewer patients assigned to intensive therapy required diabetes-related ocular surgery (8.9 versus 13.4 percent of patients in the conventional group; risk reduction 48 percent, 95% CI 29-63 percent). The risk reduction with intensive therapy was eliminated after adjustment for A1C level, indicating that the difference in glycemic control explained essentially all of the benefit of intensive therapy in reducing the need for ocular surgery. Although more patients with than without established retinopathy at baseline required ocular surgeries (107 versus 52 patients in the primary prevention group), the RR reduction with intensive insulin therapy was similar for both cohorts (51 and 45 percent risk reduction for established retinopathy and primary prevention groups, respectively).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Nephropathy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Diabetic nephropathy is the most common cause of renal failure in developed countries, although the proportion of patients with type 1 diabetes who progress to end-stage renal disease has declined compared with previous estimates of 30 to 40 percent. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-diabetic-nephropathy#H3\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of diabetic nephropathy&quot;, section on 'Type 1 diabetes'</a>.)</p><p>As examples:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a Finnish cohort of 20,000 individuals diagnosed with type 1 diabetes between 1965 and 1999 and before the age of 30 years, the cumulative incidence of end-stage renal disease was 2.2 percent by 20 years and 7.7 percent by 30 years' duration of diabetes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/glycemic-control-and-vascular-complications-in-type-1-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a subsequent report of 542 individuals diagnosed with type 1 diabetes between 1965 and 1980 (mean age at diagnosis 8.6 years), the cumulative incidence of end-stage renal disease was 5.5, 14.5, and 26.5 percent by 20, 30, and 40 years' duration, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/glycemic-control-and-vascular-complications-in-type-1-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. </p><p/><p>Although the cumulative incidence of microalbuminuria and macroalbuminuria did not appear to decline in the latter study of individuals diagnosed prior to 1980 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/glycemic-control-and-vascular-complications-in-type-1-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>], subsequently, there has been a reduction in the risk of developing albuminuria and in the progression of diabetic nephropathy in general with optimal medical care for blood pressure, glycemic control, lipid management, and the use of agents that block the renin-angiotensin system. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-diabetic-nephropathy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of diabetic nephropathy&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-diabetic-nephropathy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of diabetic nephropathy&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The following discussion will review the evidence related to glycemic control for primary prevention, established microalbuminuria, and established macroalbuminuria in patients with type 1 diabetes.

At follow-up of up to nine years (mean 6.5 years), intensive therapy led to a significant reduction in the incidence of new-onset microalbuminuria (16.4 versus 23.9 percent, adjusted risk reduction 39 percent) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F73143\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef73143 \">figure 3</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/glycemic-control-and-vascular-complications-in-type-1-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>].

At this late stage, there is often marked glomerulosclerosis. Only antihypertensive therapy (preferably with an ACE inhibitor) and perhaps dietary protein restriction have been shown to slow the rate of progressive disease or reverse established lesions.

Initiation of intensive therapy led to symptomatic improvement in all patients in association with increases in vibration sense and motor (but not sensory) nerve conduction velocity. This study was uncontrolled and its findings of uncertain importance since spontaneous improvement in neuropathic symptoms can occur, particularly if the symptoms were preceded by deterioration in metabolic control [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/glycemic-control-and-vascular-complications-in-type-1-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>].</p><p>However, subsequent prospective studies have confirmed the ability of improved glycemic control to prevent or slow the progression of neuropathy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/glycemic-control-and-vascular-complications-in-type-1-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/7,37,38\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,37,38</a>].

The intensive insulin therapy group also had lower serum low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol concentrations but, due to the increase in insulin administration, some weight gain.</p><p>Following completion of the DCCT in 1993, the conventional treatment group was offered intensive treatment and 93 percent of DCCT participants (n = 1394) agreed to participate in the observational Epidemiology of Diabetes Interventions and Complications (EDIC) study [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/glycemic-control-and-vascular-complications-in-type-1-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/8,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,12</a>]. Differences in A1C levels between the intensive and conventional treatment groups at the end of the DCCT trial (7.4 and 9.1 percent, respectively) narrowed at the end of the 11-year follow-up EDIC (7.9 and 7.8 percent, respectively). The mean duration of intensive therapy during the DCCT period had been 6.5 years.</p><p>Cardiovascular outcomes for the EDIC were defined as the occurrence of nonfatal myocardial infarction (MI), stroke, cardiovascular death, documented angina, or coronary revascularization. The analysis of cardiovascular events according to original DCCT treatment assignment was predetermined to conclude when 50 patients in the original conventional treatment group had experienced a cardiovascular event.</p><p>During the entire follow-up period (mean 17 years), 46 events had occurred in 31 patients from the DCCT intensive therapy group, compared with 98 events in 52 patients from the conventional therapy group (0.38 versus 0.80 events per 100 patient-years) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/glycemic-control-and-vascular-complications-in-type-1-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. This represented a 42 percent decrease in any cardiovascular event (95% CI 9-63 percent); there was also a 57 percent reduction in a serious cardiovascular event (nonfatal MI, stroke, or cardiovascular disease [CVD] death; 95% CI 12-79 percent) comparing the original DCCT intensive therapy with the DCCT conventional treatment group.</p><p>The difference in levels of glycemic control between the treatment groups, as measured by the A1C during the DCCT, accounted for most of the difference in cardiovascular events between the two groups. Microalbuminuria and albuminuria were also independently associated with cardiovascular outcome, but differences in outcome between the two treatment groups remained after correction for these renal factors. These results indicate that a sustained period of glycemic control (6.5 years in the DCCT study) has lasting benefit in reducing cardiovascular morbidity and mortality in type 1 diabetes.</p><p>Mechanisms postulated to account for this effect include decreased exposure to advanced glycosylation end products or a secondary consequence of decreased renal disease and autonomic neuropathy that have been implicated in CVD risk. An earlier report from the EDIC study showed that progression of carotid intima-media thickness, a measure of atherosclerosis, was significantly less in those who had received intensive therapy during the DCCT compared with those who had received conventional therapy (progression of intima-media thickness of the common carotid artery 0.032 versus 0.046 mm) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/glycemic-control-and-vascular-complications-in-type-1-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>].

Compared with patients who received conventional therapy during the original Diabetes Control and Complications Trial (DCCT) (6.5 years), patients who received intensive insulin therapy had a reduction in serious cardiovascular events, including cardiovascular death, during the Epidemiology of Diabetes Interventions and Complications (EDIC) follow-up period (17 years) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/glycemic-control-and-vascular-complications-in-type-1-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. In the most recent report from <span class=\"nowrap\">DCCT/EDIC,</span> representing a mean follow-up period of 27 years (1429 patients), there was a large relative, albeit modest absolute, reduction in all-cause mortality in patients initially assigned to intensive therapy (43 deaths in the intensive therapy group versus 64 in the conventional group [hazard ratio (HR) 0.67, 95% CI 0.46-0.99]) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/glycemic-control-and-vascular-complications-in-type-1-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>]. The most common causes of death were CVD (22.4 percent), cancer (19.6 percent), acute diabetes complications (hypoglycemia and diabetic ketoacidosis; 17.8 percent), and accidents or suicide (19.6 percent). All-cause mortality was higher in patients with higher mean A1C levels and in those with renal disease. Thus, intensive insulin therapy for 6.5 years during the DCCT reduced the risk of mortality over at least the next 20 years compared with conventional therapy, despite an absence of a difference in A1C values during the post-DCCT trial period. </p><p>The results from the <span class=\"nowrap\">DCCT/EDIC</span> are supported by similar findings from observational studies. As an example, in a cohort study of 879 individuals with type 1 diabetes followed for 20 years, individuals in the highest quartile of A1C (&ge;12 percent) had increased all-cause (relative risk [RR] 2.4, 95% CI 1.5-3.8) and cardiovascular (RR 3.3, 95% CI 1.8-6.1) mortality compared with individuals in the lowest quartile (&le;9.4 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/glycemic-control-and-vascular-complications-in-type-1-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/43\" class=\"abstract_t\">43</a>]. In a study using the Swedish National Diabetes Register, 33,915 patients with and 169,249 without diabetes were followed for a mean of eight years. Compared with individuals without diabetes, the risk of mortality was higher in those with type 1 diabetes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/glycemic-control-and-vascular-complications-in-type-1-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/44\" class=\"abstract_t\">44</a>]. Although the risk was highest in those with the highest A1C values (A1C &ge;9.7 percent, HR for all-cause and cardiovascular mortality 8.51 and 10.46, respectively), patients with an A1C &le;6.9 percent also had elevated risk (HR 2.36 and 2.92 for all-cause and cardiovascular mortality, respectively). However, these findings are tempered by the incomplete assessment of A1C levels for many patients during the eight years of observation, making it difficult to determine if there is still an excess risk of death in patients with consistently good glycemic control from time of diagnosis onward.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h1\">GLYCEMIC TARGETS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The above findings provide conclusive evidence that strict glycemic control, if achieved before irreversible end-organ damage has occurred, reduces the incidence of microvascular disease, neurologic dysfunction, and cardiovascular disease (CVD) in patients with type 1 diabetes. Thus, intensive insulin therapy should be attempted in all appropriate patients with type 1 diabetes as early in the course of disease as is safely feasible. Both patient and clinician education and support are required to perform this task safely. (See <a href=\"#H16\" class=\"local\">'Hypoglycemia'</a> below.)</p><p>Additional data from the Diabetes Control and Complications Trial (DCCT) support the importance of beginning intensive therapy as early as possible after the diagnosis of type 1 diabetes:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In an analysis of 303 patients in the primary prevention cohort (one to five years of duration) who had residual beta-cell function (as evidenced by a serum C-peptide concentration of 0.20 to 0.50 <span class=\"nowrap\">pmol/mL</span> after ingestion of a standardized meal) and were randomly assigned to intensive or conventional insulin therapy, those receiving intensive therapy had lower A1C values, were less likely to lose residual beta-cell function (risk reduction 57 percent), and had a 50 percent reduction in the risk for progression of retinopathy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/glycemic-control-and-vascular-complications-in-type-1-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/45\" class=\"abstract_t\">45</a>].
