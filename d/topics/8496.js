In contrast, leukostasis (also called symptomatic hyperleukocytosis) is a medical emergency most commonly seen in patients with acute myeloid leukemia or chronic myeloid leukemia in blast crisis. It is characterized by an extremely elevated blast cell count and symptoms of decreased tissue perfusion.</p><p>Leukostasis is a pathologic diagnosis in which white cell plugs are seen in the microvasculature. Clinically, leukostasis is typically diagnosed empirically when a patient with leukemia and hyperleukocytosis presents with respiratory or neurological distress. Prompt treatment is indicated since, if left untreated, the one-week mortality rate is approximately 20 to 40 percent.</p><p>The epidemiology, clinical presentation, diagnosis, and management of hyperleukocytosis and leukostasis in hematologic malignancies will be reviewed here.

In general, symptoms of leukostasis are more common in leukemias with large, poorly deformable blasts, such as acute myeloid leukemia.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Acute myeloid leukemia &ndash; Hyperleukocytosis is present in 10 to 20 percent of patients with newly diagnosed acute myeloid leukemia (AML). It is more common in patients with myelomonocytic (FAB-M4) leukemia, monocytic (FAB-M5) leukemia, or the microgranular variant of acute promyelocytic leukemia (FAB-M3) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hyperleukocytosis-and-leukostasis-in-hematologic-malignancies/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>]. Symptoms of leukostasis occur less frequently and typically affect patients with white blood cell (WBC) counts over 100 x 10<sup>9</sup><span class=\"nowrap\">/L</span> <span class=\"nowrap\">(100,000/microL)</span>.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Acute lymphoblastic leukemia &ndash; Hyperleukocytosis is seen in 10 to 30 percent of patients with newly diagnosed acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hyperleukocytosis-and-leukostasis-in-hematologic-malignancies/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. The incidence appears to be highest in infants, patients between the ages of 10 and 20 years, males, and those with a T cell phenotype [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hyperleukocytosis-and-leukostasis-in-hematologic-malignancies/abstract/3,4\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,4</a>]. Symptoms of leukostasis are rarely seen in patients with ALL and hyperleukocytosis. Tumor lysis syndrome and disseminated intravascular coagulation are more common complications related to the elevated WBC count.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Chronic lymphocytic leukemia &ndash; A significant proportion of patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) present with hyperleukocytosis. Symptoms of leukostasis are rare unless the WBC count exceeds 400 x 10<sup>9</sup><span class=\"nowrap\">/L</span> <span class=\"nowrap\">(400,000/microL)</span>.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Chronic myeloid leukemia &ndash; Patients with chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) typically present with leukocytosis and a median WBC count of approximately 100 x 10<sup>9</sup><span class=\"nowrap\">/L</span> <span class=\"nowrap\">(100,000/microL)</span>. Most often, these are segmented neutrophils, metamyelocytes, and myelocytes. Symptoms of leukostasis are very uncommon in patients in chronic phase but can be seen occasionally in patients with myeloid blast crisis and very elevated blast counts.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">PATHOPHYSIOLOGY OF LEUKOSTASIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The pathophysiology of leukostasis is not well understood. There are two main theories, which are not mutually exclusive:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Leukostasis may be due to increased blood viscosity as a direct complication of a large population of leukemic blasts that are considerably less deformable than mature leukocytes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hyperleukocytosis-and-leukostasis-in-hematologic-malignancies/abstract/5,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,6</a>]. With increasing blast counts, plugs of these more rigid cells can develop in the microcirculation, thereby impeding blood flow (leukostasis)&nbsp;[<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hyperleukocytosis-and-leukostasis-in-hematologic-malignancies/abstract/1,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,7</a>]. This situation can be worsened by red blood cell transfusions or the use of diuretics, both of which can increase whole blood viscosity.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Local hypoxemia may be exacerbated by the high metabolic activity of the dividing blasts and the associated production of various cytokines [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hyperleukocytosis-and-leukostasis-in-hematologic-malignancies/abstract/8,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,9</a>]. These cytokines can result in endothelial damage and subsequent hemorrhage that add to the hypoxic damage already present from reduced blood flow [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hyperleukocytosis-and-leukostasis-in-hematologic-malignancies/abstract/8,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,9</a>]. Leukemic blasts can migrate into the surrounding tissues, causing additional damage [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hyperleukocytosis-and-leukostasis-in-hematologic-malignancies/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. Thus, the lower incidence of clinically significant leukostasis and vascular injury in patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) and acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) may be related to the lower metabolic and mitotic rate in the former and the lack of catabolic enzymes and cytokines in both.</p><p/><p>It is likely that both of these mechanisms, and additional yet unidentified mechanisms, are involved in the development of leukostasis. In vitro studies have demonstrated a dramatic rise in viscosity when leukocyte suspensions exceed a fractional volume of leukocytes (ie, leukocrit) of 12 to 15 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/dL</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hyperleukocytosis-and-leukostasis-in-hematologic-malignancies/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. Attainment of such a high leukocrit requires an acute myeloid leukemia (AML) blast count of approximately 300 x 10<sup>9</sup><span class=\"nowrap\">/L</span> <span class=\"nowrap\">(300,000/microL)</span> or an ALL blast count of approximately 600 x 10<sup>9</sup><span class=\"nowrap\">/L</span> <span class=\"nowrap\">(600,000/microL)</span>. This observation is consistent with the increased incidence of leukostasis in AML compared with ALL. It also suggests that factors other than white blood cell count are important in the pathogenesis of leukostasis, since symptoms of leukostasis commonly occur at blast concentrations below these predicted thresholds.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h1\">SIGNS AND SYMPTOMS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Although pathologic evidence of leukostasis can be found in most organs in patients with extremely high white blood cell (WBC) counts, the main clinical symptoms of leukostasis and causes of early death are related to involvement of the central nervous system (approximately 40 percent) and lungs (approximately 30 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hyperleukocytosis-and-leukostasis-in-hematologic-malignancies/abstract/1,3,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,3,7</a>].</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pulmonary signs and symptoms include dyspnea and hypoxia with or without diffuse interstitial or alveolar infiltrates on imaging studies. Measurement of the arterial pO2 can be falsely decreased in patients with hyperleukocytosis, since the WBCs in the test tube utilize oxygen. Pulse oximetry provides a more accurate assessment of O2 saturation in this setting. (See <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Laboratory abnormalities'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Neurological signs and symptoms include visual changes, headache, dizziness, tinnitus, gait instability, confusion, somnolence, and, occasionally, coma. In addition, patients who present with hyperleukocytosis have an increased risk of intracranial hemorrhage that persists for at least a week after the reduction of white cell count, perhaps from a reperfusion injury as areas of the brain that were ischemic from leukostasis regain blood flow. Because there can be other structural causes of central nervous system symptoms, brain imaging with noncontrasted CT or MRI is indicated in patients with neurologic abnormalities. Clinicians must be cautious about using intravenous contrast dye at a time when renal function may be compromised by leukostasis or tumor lysis syndrome, and dehydration.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Approximately 80 percent of patients with leukostasis are febrile, which may be due to inflammation associated with leukostasis or concurrent infection. Since an infectious cause cannot be easily excluded, we treat empirically for infection in all such patients.

Pulse oximetry provides a more accurate assessment of O2 saturation.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The platelet count may be overestimated by automated blood cell counters because fragments of blasts on blood smear can be mistakenly counted as platelets. A manual platelet count and careful review of the peripheral smear is appropriate in such settings. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=approach-to-the-patient-with-thrombocytosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Approach to the patient with thrombocytosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Serum potassium can be spuriously elevated due to its release from leukemic blasts during the in vitro clotting process. Potassium levels measured from heparinized plasma samples, rather than serum, can circumvent this effect.

DIC presents with various degrees of thrombin generation (eg, decreased fibrinogen) and increased fibrinolysis (eg, elevated fibrin degradation products and D-dimer).

Laboratory evidence of tumor lysis syndrome includes increased elevated serum concentrations of uric acid, potassium, and phosphate, often accompanied by hypocalcemia.

The diagnosis requires a high degree of suspicion, and some patients have pathologically proven leukostasis at WBC counts below this level.</p><p>Pathologically, leukostasis is diagnosed when a biopsy of involved tissue demonstrates white cell plugs in the microvasculature&nbsp;[<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hyperleukocytosis-and-leukostasis-in-hematologic-malignancies/abstract/1,5-7\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,5-7</a>].

In most cases, rapid cytoreduction can be achieved with induction chemotherapy, which should be administered in conjunction with prophylaxis for tumor lysis syndrome. Because clinical deterioration can sometimes occur rapidly, most clinicians also advocate prompt initiation of cytoreductive therapy in patients with asymptomatic hyperleukocytosis. Adequate fluid resuscitation to prevent dehydration and ensure good urine output is important. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tumor-lysis-syndrome-prevention-and-treatment#H21712037\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Tumor lysis syndrome: Prevention and treatment&quot;, section on 'Clinical impact of TLS'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Cytoreduction</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Twenty to 40 percent of patients with symptomatic hyperleukocytosis die within the first week of presentation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hyperleukocytosis-and-leukostasis-in-hematologic-malignancies/abstract/16-22\" class=\"abstract_t\">16-22</a>]. The mortality rate appears to be unrelated to the level of the WBC count, but patients with symptoms (eg, respiratory distress or neurological compromise) have a significantly worse prognosis when compared with patients who have hyperleukocytosis alone.</p><p>Cytoreduction can be achieved through the use of chemotherapy (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=hydroxyurea-hydroxycarbamide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">hydroxyurea</a> or remission induction chemotherapy) or leukapheresis. While both modalities rapidly decrease the circulating WBC count, chemotherapy also destroys leukemia cells in the bone marrow and is the only treatment proven to improve survival. There have been no prospective trials or large observational studies comparing these two options for the treatment of hyperleukocytosis and leukostasis.</p><p>In general, we propose the following approach to patients with hyperleukocytosis:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients with symptomatic or asymptomatic hyperleukocytosis, we suggest initial treatment with induction chemotherapy rather than <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hydroxyurea-hydroxycarbamide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">hydroxyurea</a> or leukapheresis. This should be accompanied by tumor lysis syndrome prophylaxis with aggressive hydration and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=allopurinol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">allopurinol</a>. (See <a href=\"#H9\" class=\"local\">'Induction chemotherapy'</a> below and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tumor-lysis-syndrome-prevention-and-treatment#H21712037\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Tumor lysis syndrome: Prevention and treatment&quot;, section on 'Clinical impact of TLS'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Our preference for induction chemotherapy is primarily based upon the knowledge that such therapy is also a necessary step toward the successful treatment of patients with leukemia. There is little evidence to confirm that decreasing the WBC count alone will reduce the early mortality rate [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hyperleukocytosis-and-leukostasis-in-hematologic-malignancies/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. In addition, clinical deterioration may occur even after the WBC count has been significantly reduced.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">An exception to this approach may occur in patients who cannot start induction chemotherapy immediately. Such patients include those who have poor venous access, renal insufficiency, or other severe metabolic disturbances, and those with delays in initiating prophylaxis for tumor lysis syndrome (TLS). If induction chemotherapy must be delayed, our approach to hyperleukocytosis depends on whether or not the patient is having symptoms of hyperleukocytosis (ie, leukostasis).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients without symptoms of leukostasis who must have induction chemotherapy delayed, we suggest cytoreduction with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hydroxyurea-hydroxycarbamide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">hydroxyurea</a> rather than leukapheresis. Cytoreduction with hydroxyurea can precipitate or exacerbate hyperuricemia and occasionally precipitate TLS, therefore such patients also need intravenous hydration and TLS prophylaxis. (See <a href=\"#H10\" class=\"local\">'Hydroxyurea'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients with symptoms of leukostasis who must have induction chemotherapy delayed, we suggest initial cytoreduction with leukapheresis in combination with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hydroxyurea-hydroxycarbamide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">hydroxyurea</a> to lower or stabilize the WBC count.

In the setting of hyperleukocytosis, induction chemotherapy serves to both rapidly decrease the circulating WBC count and target the leukemia cells in the bone marrow. Induction therapy typically substantially reduces the WBC count within 24 hours. Details regarding the administration of induction therapy are presented separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=induction-therapy-for-acute-myeloid-leukemia-in-younger-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Induction therapy for acute myeloid leukemia in younger adults&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acute-myeloid-leukemia-treatment-and-outcomes-in-older-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Acute myeloid leukemia: Treatment and outcomes in older adults&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=induction-therapy-for-philadelphia-chromosome-negative-acute-lymphoblastic-leukemia-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Induction therapy for Philadelphia chromosome negative acute lymphoblastic leukemia in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Patients with hyperleukocytosis are at higher risk of developing tumor lysis syndrome with induction chemotherapy. This syndrome is best prevented via appropriate treatment with intravenous hydration to ensure adequate urine flow, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=allopurinol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">allopurinol</a> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=rasburicase-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">rasburicase</a> to reduce serum uric acid levels, and correction of any electrolyte disturbances or causes of reversible renal failure.

Hydroxyurea, given at a total dose of 50 to 100 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> per day orally, reduces the WBC count by 50 to 80 percent within 24 to 48 hours [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hyperleukocytosis-and-leukostasis-in-hematologic-malignancies/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. The usual hydroxyurea dose is 2 to 4 grams orally every 12 hours, which is continued until the WBC count is below 50 x 10<sup>9</sup><span class=\"nowrap\">/L</span> <span class=\"nowrap\">(50,000/microL)</span>.</p><p>Side effects of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hydroxyurea-hydroxycarbamide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">hydroxyurea</a> are usually minimal and are typically limited to patients who are exposed to hydroxyurea for a prolonged period. Rare complications include fever and abnormal liver function tests. Hydroxyurea should <strong>not</strong> be used in pregnancy or in women who are breastfeeding.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h3\">Leukapheresis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The role of leukapheresis as an adjunct to the treatment of all patients with hyperleukocytosis is controversial. It is not clear whether survival is improved in patients treated with leukapheresis when compared with patients who receive cytoreductive chemotherapy promptly.</p><p>Although intensive leukapheresis, with procedure times often lasting many hours, has been reported to produce improvement in pulmonary and central nervous system symptoms, there are theoretical and practical limitations to its benefits. It is precisely the patient in whom leukostasis is most likely to occur, that is, the patient with a high and rapidly rising blast count, in whom the technical limitations of leukapheresis are relevant. It is often difficult, even with highly efficient cell separators, to reduce the rapidly rising count. Cycle-specific chemotherapeutic agents (eg, induction chemotherapy) are more likely to be the most rapidly effective.</p><p>Although some clinicians advocate its use for patients with asymptomatic hyperleukocytosis, we typically reserve leukapheresis for patients with symptomatic hyperleukocytosis who must have induction chemotherapy postponed. Our preference to reserve leukapheresis for this selected patient population is primarily based upon the known risks associated with leukapheresis described below and an unclear benefit. Anecdotal reports have claimed dramatic responses [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hyperleukocytosis-and-leukostasis-in-hematologic-malignancies/abstract/25-29\" class=\"abstract_t\">25-29</a>], but larger retrospective analyses have demonstrated conflicting effects on early mortality rates [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hyperleukocytosis-and-leukostasis-in-hematologic-malignancies/abstract/19,22,30\" class=\"abstract_t\">19,22,30</a>]. Given the paucity of data concerning the efficacy of leukapheresis in reducing early mortality <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> improving overall survival, leukapheresis cannot be recommended for routine therapy as a form of tumor &quot;debulking&quot; in patients with high blast counts.</p><p>However, patients with symptomatic leukocytosis have an extremely high mortality rate without immediate therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hyperleukocytosis-and-leukostasis-in-hematologic-malignancies/abstract/16-22\" class=\"abstract_t\">16-22</a>]. When both respiratory failure and neurologic compromise are present, the death rate at one week reaches 90 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hyperleukocytosis-and-leukostasis-in-hematologic-malignancies/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. Therefore, if facilities are available, we suggest leukapheresis for patients with leukemic blast counts greater than 50 to 100 x 10<sup>9</sup><span class=\"nowrap\">/L</span> (50 to <span class=\"nowrap\">100,000/microL)</span> <strong>and</strong> associated symptoms as a temporizing measure until chemotherapy can be initiated. It is difficult to predict the percent leukocyte count reduction in individual patients, but sessions are usually planned for four- to five-hour collections with repeat sessions as needed.</p><p>It is generally agreed that leukapheresis should <strong>not</strong> be used for patients with acute promyelocytic leukemia because it may worsen the intrinsic coagulopathy associated with this subtype of leukemia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hyperleukocytosis-and-leukostasis-in-hematologic-malignancies/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Placement of large intravenous leukapheresis catheters in these patients has been associated with venous thrombosis or hemorrhage.

In addition, symptomatic leukostasis can still develop after the WBC count has been lowered by leukapheresis.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h2\">Supportive care</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The following supportive care measures should be considered for all patients with hyperleukocytosis:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Symptomatic leukostasis can be precipitated by increases in whole blood viscosity following red blood cell transfusions. Such transfusions should be withheld, if possible, until the blast count is reduced. If a transfusion is necessary, it should be given slowly, administering a single unit of red blood cells over a few hours, or during the leukapheresis procedure. Hydration is encouraged and diuretics are discouraged.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients with hyperleukocytosis are at risk of tumor lysis syndrome (TLS), although this syndrome is less common in patients with AML than in those with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) or Burkitt <span class=\"nowrap\">leukemia/lymphoma</span>. TLS is best prevented with intravenous hydration to ensure adequate urine flow, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=allopurinol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">allopurinol</a> to reduce serum uric acid levels, and the correction of any electrolyte disturbances or causes of reversible renal failure. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tumor-lysis-syndrome-prevention-and-treatment#H21712037\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Tumor lysis syndrome: Prevention and treatment&quot;, section on 'Clinical impact of TLS'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Although intravenous hydration is recommended for the management and prevention of tumor lysis syndrome, care should be taken to avoid overhydration and hypervolemia which could exacerbate pulmonary symptoms.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Coagulation abnormalities, including disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), further increase the risk of local hemorrhage. Specific treatment aimed at the DIC should be considered. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-features-diagnosis-and-treatment-of-disseminated-intravascular-coagulation-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical features, diagnosis, and treatment of disseminated intravascular coagulation in adults&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=initial-treatment-of-acute-promyelocytic-leukemia-in-adults#H18\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Initial treatment of acute promyelocytic leukemia in adults&quot;, section on 'Control of coagulopathy'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients should also receive prophylactic platelet transfusions to maintain a count of greater than 20 to <span class=\"nowrap\">30,000/microL</span> until the WBC count has been reduced and the clinical situation has been stabilized. The risk of intracranial hemorrhage is greatest after the WBC count has been markedly reduced, suggesting that a reperfusion injury may occur when the circulation is restored to previously hypoxemic or ischemic capillary beds. Thus, aggressive platelet support and correction of coagulopathy should continue for several days during the remission induction period.</p><p/><p>In addition, patients with leukostasis often require specialized, symptom-directed supportive care including mechanical ventilation for respiratory failure <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> stroke.

However, there are no comparative studies to determine whether the results with cranial irradiation are superior to those with chemotherapy alone, and we do not advocate the routine use of cranial irradiation in this setting. Nevertheless, it could be considered for patients with serious central nervous system symptoms related to leukostasis.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14\"><span class=\"h1\">PROGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The prognostic impact of hyperleukocytosis and leukostasis (symptomatic hyperleukocytosis) depends on the type of leukemia (acute myeloid leukemia or acute lymphoblastic leukemia) and the presence of symptoms.</p><p>The initial mortality rate for patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and leukostasis has been estimated at 20 to 40 percent and appears to be unrelated to the severity of the hyperleukocytosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hyperleukocytosis-and-leukostasis-in-hematologic-malignancies/abstract/16-19,22\" class=\"abstract_t\">16-19,22</a>].
