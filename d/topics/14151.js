Additionally, as long as the CGG region contains &le;44 repeats, the region remains stable, passing from generation to generation without significant alteration. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3639896243\"><span class=\"h2\">Pathogenesis of fragile X syndrome</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Fragile X syndrome is primarily caused by expansion in the number of CGG repeats within the <em>FMR1</em> gene; deletions or point mutations within <em>FMR1</em> account for only 1 percent of cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prenatal-screening-and-diagnosis-for-fragile-x-syndrome/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Expansion of CGG repeats allows hypermethylation of <em>FMR1</em>, resulting in impaired transcription and reduced production of FMRP, which adversely impacts prenatal and postnatal brain development. </p><p>As repeat size increases, stability decreases, and further increases in the number of repeats in the <em>FMR1</em> region become likely. The lower and upper boundaries of repeat length are variably defined, but generally described as:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Normal -- 5 to 44 CGG repeats</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Intermediate expansion -- 45 to 54 CGG repeats</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Premutation &mdash; 55 to 200 CGG repeats </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Full mutation -- &gt;200 CGG repeats</p><p/><p>The appropriate distinction between intermediate and premutation length is uncertain, but clinically relevant because intermediate expansion does not have a clinical phenotype and does not expand directly to a full mutation, whereas women (but not men) with a premutation are at risk of having offspring with a full mutation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prenatal-screening-and-diagnosis-for-fragile-x-syndrome/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H882526095\"><span class=\"h2\">Risk for FMR1 gene expansion during gametogenesis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The risk for <em>FMR1</em> expansion when the gene is passed from parent to child depends on the repeat size, sex of the parent, and frequency of adenine-guanine-guanine (AGG) trinucleotide interspersion. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2357149998\"><span class=\"h3\">Oocytes</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The <em>FMR1</em> region is unstable, having the ability to expand or contract during both meiosis and mitosis. In women, meiotic expansion during meiosis is supported by the finding of full <em>FMR1</em> expansions (not just premutation expansion) in the ovaries. The distinction of whether it is meiosis 1 or 2 remains unresolved [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prenatal-screening-and-diagnosis-for-fragile-x-syndrome/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].</p><p>Expansion in the number of CGG repeats within the <em>FMR1</em> gene may be as few as one repeat or over 100 repeats. While some contraction of CGG repeats within the <em>FMR1</em> gene have been documented in women, the majority of women with a premutation are at risk of expansion to a full mutation during meiosis.</p><p>Conservatively, the upper limit of the intermediate range may be considered 54 repeats, where 55 is a &quot;potential&quot; premutation and 56 to 200 is a premutation. In one study, women with 45 to 54 repeats had a 6.6 percent risk of expansion, but none expanded to a full mutation in one generation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prenatal-screening-and-diagnosis-for-fragile-x-syndrome/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. There have been rare reports of expansion to a full mutation among women with repeats of 56 CGG (one case) and 59 CGG (two cases) (see <a href=\"#H860752557\" class=\"local\">'Post-test counseling'</a> below). </p><p>When a premutation expands to &gt;90 CGG repeats, the likelihood of further expansion to a full mutation (ie, over 200 repeats) during oocyte meiosis is at least 80 percent (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F64429\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef64429 \">table 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prenatal-screening-and-diagnosis-for-fragile-x-syndrome/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. Expansion to a full mutation is more likely in women who are from families with full mutations in the pedigree; the risk is lower when the family history is negative (ie, women who are newly identified premutation carriers as a result of routine screening) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prenatal-screening-and-diagnosis-for-fragile-x-syndrome/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. </p><p>The frequency of adenine-guanine-guanine (AGG) trinucleotide interspersion is also a factor in predicting expansion to a full mutation. AGG interspersed in the variable region acts as a stabilizer for the region; therefore, fewer AGG interspersions permits destabilization of the region and increases the likelihood of expansion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prenatal-screening-and-diagnosis-for-fragile-x-syndrome/abstract/8-12\" class=\"abstract_t\">8-12</a>]. In one study, 53 percent of full mutation expansions occurred from maternal alleles with no AGG interruptions, 43 percent occurred from maternal alleles with one AGG, and only 4 percent occurred from maternal alleles with two AGGs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prenatal-screening-and-diagnosis-for-fragile-x-syndrome/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. </p><p>Contraction from a premutation to a normal allele is rare, but has been reported in mother-to-daughter transmission. The role of AGG regions, which mitigate the expansion risk of the <em>FMR1, </em>do not appear to affect contraction rates [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prenatal-screening-and-diagnosis-for-fragile-x-syndrome/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. Postzygotic mitotic CGG length changes have also been reported; discordance for CGG repeat number between identical twins is assumed to be due to this mechanism [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prenatal-screening-and-diagnosis-for-fragile-x-syndrome/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3579761059\"><span class=\"h3\">Sperm</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In males, sperm cells only carry premutation alleles, even when the male has a full mutation. The reason for this is unclear. In contrast to oocytes, expansion of a premutation to a full mutation does not occur in sperm [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prenatal-screening-and-diagnosis-for-fragile-x-syndrome/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. Men with a premutation (&quot;transmitting males&quot;) or full mutation pass sperm with the premutation to all of their daughters (who always inherit their father's X chromosome) and to none of their sons (who never inherit their father's X chromosome). In contrast to mother-to-daughter transmission where contraction of the premutation is rare, one-third of daughters who inherit a premutation from their father have contraction in the size of the expansion.</p><p>The molecular processes behind contraction of CGG repeats within the <em>FMR1</em> gene remains unclear. Strand mismatch and DNA polymerase slippage are considered two likely contenders, and other molecular changes may play a role. The timing of these changes remains unknown but evidence suggests the contraction can occur during both meiosis and mitosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prenatal-screening-and-diagnosis-for-fragile-x-syndrome/abstract/4,15-17\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,15-17</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3784361128\"><span class=\"h2\">Factors affecting phenotype</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The phenotype depends on several factors, including number of CGG repeats, somatic cell mosaicism, <em>FMR1</em> methylation, and sex (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F73067\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef73067 \">table 2</a>). Each of these factors can alter the transcription of the fragile X site and result in lower levels of FMRP and, in turn, a more severe phenotype. </p><p>Sex is important factor because men have only one X chromosome and thus have the expanded CGG region in each of their cells. Women have two X chromosomes and the expanded CGG region is on only one of their two X chromosomes. Since one of their X chromosomes is randomly inactivated, the overall number and distribution of cells with an expanded region is variable in women and results in a wide range of effects (no discernable effects to classic fragile X characteristics). It is theoretically possible for a woman to have an expanded CGG region on each of her X chromosomes if both of her parents carried a premutation or full mutation. Such women would at most carry a full mutation and premutation since men with full mutations only have premutations in their sperm. </p><p>The spectrum of clinical features of fragile X syndrome are described in detail separately.

When this information is available before pregnancy, carriers have an opportunity to seek interventions for avoiding pregnancy with an affected fetus. (See <a href=\"#H860753060\" class=\"local\">'Preconception reproductive options'</a> below.). </p><p>After pregnancy is established, carriers may choose to undergo prenatal diagnosis for fetal fragile X premutations and full mutations so they can prepare for the birth of an affected child or terminate a pregnancy with an affected fetus. (See <a href=\"#H16\" class=\"local\">'Prenatal (fetal) diagnosis'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15\"><span class=\"h2\">Candidates for screening</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics (ACMG) and the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) guidelines for screening for fragile X syndrome differ slightly and are described in the tables (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F50931%7EOBGYN%2F65747\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef50931 graphicRef65747 \">table 3A-B</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prenatal-screening-and-diagnosis-for-fragile-x-syndrome/abstract/18,19\" class=\"abstract_t\">18,19</a>].</p><p>A careful assessment of the family history is performed to identify individuals with sufficient likelihood of premutation or full mutation carrier status to warrant screening. We use the following criteria for offering fragile X screening or referral for diagnostic testing:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Individuals seeking reproductive counseling who have a family history of fragile X syndrome (confirmed premutation or full mutation of <em>FMR1</em> gene) or undiagnosed intellectual disability.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Individuals of either sex with intellectual disability, developmental delay, or autism.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Young women with elevated levels of follicle-stimulating hormone, especially with a family history of premature ovarian insufficiency (menopause before age 40), fragile X syndrome, or a relative of either sex with undiagnosed intellectual disability.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Individuals with late-onset intention tremor or ataxia (usually after age 50), especially with a history of infertility, family history of movement disorders, fragile X, or undiagnosed intellectual disability.</p><p/><p>Some authors suggest routinely offering fragile X carrier laboratory screening to all women, given the high test sensitivity (99 percent), the potential impact of the full mutation in offspring, and the relatively high premutation carrier rate (in one study, 1 in 154 for women with a negative family history of intellectual disability, developmental problems, or autism, and 1 in 128 women with a positive family history [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prenatal-screening-and-diagnosis-for-fragile-x-syndrome/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]), [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prenatal-screening-and-diagnosis-for-fragile-x-syndrome/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. However, this is not common practice due, in part, to the difficulty in predicting phenotype in offspring of low-risk women (women with a negative personal and family history) with a premutation. For example, the risk that a low-risk woman with a premutation will pass a full mutation to her offspring is less than that in high-risk women [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prenatal-screening-and-diagnosis-for-fragile-x-syndrome/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. In one study, the rates of allele expansion from maternal premutation to fetal full mutation in patients with and without a family history of mental retardation, developmental problems, or autism, were 50 percent and 10 percent, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prenatal-screening-and-diagnosis-for-fragile-x-syndrome/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. The reason women with a positive family history have greater premutation instability and expansion risk is not completely understood, but may be related to the presence and number of AGG interspersions.</p><p>Universal fragile X carrier laboratory screening is not recommended for men. Low-risk men (negative personal and family history of intellectual disability, developmental problems, or autism) are not screened since their sons will not inherit their X chromosome and, if they carry a premutation, their daughters will be no worse than premutation carriers since CGG expansion does not occur in sperm and some evidence suggests premutations become smaller when passed from a father to his daughter [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prenatal-screening-and-diagnosis-for-fragile-x-syndrome/abstract/15,16\" class=\"abstract_t\">15,16</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3989881798\"><span class=\"h2\">Laboratory testing</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Laboratory testing may involve three sequential steps: </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The first step is to determine the size of the CGG region. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>If large premutations or full mutations are identified, the second step is to determine the state of methylation. Two techniques are used: Fluorescent polymerase chain reaction (PCR) identifies normal alleles and the small differences that distinguish intermediate expansions from premutations; Southern blot analysis distinguishes large premutations from full mutations and, importantly, measures the degree of methylation. The sensitivity of this combination of tests approaches 99 percent for detection of fragile X syndrome. Southern blot analysis has the advantage of methylation determination, but is limited in its ability to distinguish normal from premutation allele sizes. Advantages of PCR are that it requires less DNA, provides a more sensitive determination of normal and premutation allele size, and is less costly, but PCR is limited in its ability to assess full mutations since PCR itself may selectively amplify shorter DNA segments. However, some laboratories utilize advances in PCR technology that enable determination of methylation. These laboratories can apply a more individualized approach to fragile X analysis, reserving Southern blot analysis for specific cases rather than as a routine reflex evaluation.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>AGG trinucleotide genotyping may be performed as a third step, as it may be useful for counseling women with intermediate and premutation expansions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prenatal-screening-and-diagnosis-for-fragile-x-syndrome/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. As discussed above, no AGG interspersion permits destabilization and increases the likelihood of expansion, whereas two to four AGG interspersions appears to decrease the risk [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prenatal-screening-and-diagnosis-for-fragile-x-syndrome/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H882526095\" class=\"local\">'Risk for FMR1 gene expansion during gametogenesis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H860752557\"><span class=\"h2\">Post-test counseling</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Referral to a genetic counselor and other clinicians with expertise in the genetics and clinical findings in fragile X syndrome is appropriate. Women with a premutation are informed of the risk of expansion to a full mutation in offspring. Women with an intermediate number of repeats may have a 6.6 percent risk for expansion to a premutation in offspring [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prenatal-screening-and-diagnosis-for-fragile-x-syndrome/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>] and expansion to a full mutation has been described in two cases where the mothers had CGG repeat length of 59 and one case where the CGG repeat length was 56 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prenatal-screening-and-diagnosis-for-fragile-x-syndrome/abstract/5,6,22\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,6,22</a>]. </p><p>For women with intermediate or premutations, AGG determination may further refine the risk of disease in offspring. However, even the maximum number of AGG repeats does not eliminate the risk a premutation will to expand to a full mutation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prenatal-screening-and-diagnosis-for-fragile-x-syndrome/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>].</p><p>A conservative recommendation is to offer prenatal (fetal) diagnosis to individuals with &gt;55 CGG repeats since at least three cases of expansions to full mutations arising from repeats at this level in women have been reported. (See <a href=\"#H3461670741\" class=\"local\">'Candidates for prenatal (fetal) diagnosis'</a> below.)</p><p>Women with a premutation or full mutation are informed of the potential phenotypes of their male and female offspring (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F73067\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef73067 \">table 2</a>) and potential sequelae in future generations. These phenotypes depend on whether the fetus inherits a premutation or full mutation, the sex of the fetus, and methylation status of the <em>FMR1</em> gene. Rarely, the number of repeats and the methylation status are discordant, which makes prediction of the phenotype difficult. </p><p>Men are informed that they will transmit their X chromosome only to their daughters. No expansion of a premutation toa full mutation is expected in the daughter, and contraction may occur. A full mutation is passed on as a premutation. While a daughter with a full expansion is not anticipated, essentially all daughters are expected to have a premutation and thus are at increased risk for developing premature ovarian insufficiency and tremor-ataxia syndrome as adults. They are also at risk for CTG repeat expansion in their offspring.</p><p>Men and women with a premutation are also informed of their own risk for developing tremor-ataxia syndrome in late adult life (usually after age 50) and, in women, premature ovarian insufficiency (menopause before age 40). In addition, implications for family members should be discussed as they are also at risk of being carriers.

As discussed above, the degree of risk in offspring depends on several factors, including the absolute CGG repeat size, the number and dispersion of AGG repeats, whether the mother or father is the carrier, and the sex of the offspring. (See <a href=\"#H16\" class=\"local\">'Prenatal (fetal) diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p>There are potential clinical sequelae to offspring and future generations when either parent is a carrier, although the most severe phenotype only occurs when the mother is the carrier. Prenatal (fetal) diagnosis when the father is a premutation carrier is rarely performed since, as discussed above, his sons will not inherit his X chromosome. His daughters will be premutation carriers since CGG expansion does not occur in sperm and evidence suggests premutations become smaller when passed from a father to his daughter.</p><p>The ACMG recommends offering prenatal (fetal) diagnosis of fragile X when the mother has a premutation or full mutation, whereas ACOG recommends offering prenatal (fetal) diagnosis to known carriers of the fragile X full mutation or premutation (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F50931%7EOBGYN%2F65747\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef50931 graphicRef65747 \">table 3A-B</a>).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H926919897\"><span class=\"h2\">Procedure</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Molecular diagnostics of fragile X can be applied to fetal DNA, whether obtained from chorionic villus samples (CVS) at 11 to 13 weeks of gestation or amniocytes obtained by amniocentesis at &ge;15 weeks of gestation.

Couples in whom the woman carries a premutation or a full mutation can undergo preimplantation genetic diagnosis (PGD) to avoid having an affected child, but PGD for this condition has numerous technical challenges and is not always informative [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prenatal-screening-and-diagnosis-for-fragile-x-syndrome/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. In addition, female carriers may have impaired ovarian reserve, which hinders the ability to harvest an adequate number of oocytes for in vitro fertilization and subsequent embryo transfer, all of which are necessary components of PGD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prenatal-screening-and-diagnosis-for-fragile-x-syndrome/abstract/25,26\" class=\"abstract_t\">25,26</a>].

For example, in male offspring of maternal carriers, the mother has passed one of her two X chromosomes to her son.

(See <a href=\"#H1\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Changes in a region of the X chromosome, known as the fragile X mental retardation-1 (<em>FMR1</em>) gene, lead to the characteristic clinical features of fragile X syndrome. (See <a href=\"#H2137054540\" class=\"local\">'FMR1 gene and protein'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Fragile X syndrome is primarily caused by expansion in the number of CGG repeats within the <em>FMR1</em> gene; deletions or point mutations within <em>FMR1</em> account for only 1 percent of cases. Expansion of CGG repeats allows hypermethylation of <em>FMR1</em>, resulting in impaired transcription and reduced production of the fragile X mental retardation protein (FMRP), which adversely impacts prenatal and postnatal brain development. (See <a href=\"#H3639896243\" class=\"local\">'Pathogenesis of fragile X syndrome'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The lower and upper boundaries of repeat length are variably defined, but generally described as (see <a href=\"#H3639896243\" class=\"local\">'Pathogenesis of fragile X syndrome'</a> above):</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Normal &ndash; 5 to 44 CGG repeats</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Intermediate expansion &ndash; 45 to 54 CGG repeats</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Premutation &ndash; 55 to 200 CGG repeats </p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Full mutation &ndash; &gt;200 CGG repeats</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>As repeat size increases above the normal range, stability decreases and further increases in the number of repeats in the <em>FMR1</em> region become likely. The risk for <em>FMR1</em> expansion when the gene is passed from parent to child depends on the repeat size (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F64429\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef64429 \">table 1</a>), sex of the parent (expansion only occurs from mother to child transmission), and frequency of adenine-guanine-guanine (AGG) trinucleotide interspersion. (See <a href=\"#H882526095\" class=\"local\">'Risk for FMR1 gene expansion during gametogenesis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Fragile X syndrome is associated with a variety of physical, behavioral, and cognitive abnormalities that vary according to the patient's age, sex, degree of CGG elongation, mosaicism, and <em>FMR1</em> methylation (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F73067\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef73067 \">table 2</a>). (See <a href=\"#H3784361128\" class=\"local\">'Factors affecting phenotype'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We suggest offering preconception or prenatal screening for fragile X syndrome to individuals at increased risk of carrying a premutation or full mutation, rather than universal screening (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). (See <a href=\"#H15\" class=\"local\">'Candidates for screening'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Individuals at increased risk of an abnormality of the <em>FMR1</em> gene include (see <a href=\"#H15\" class=\"local\">'Candidates for screening'</a> above):</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Individuals of either sex with intellectual disability, developmental delay, or autism.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Individuals seeking reproductive counseling who have a family history of fragile X syndrome (confirmed premutation or full mutation of <em>FMR1</em> gene) or undiagnosed intellectual disability.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Young women with elevated levels of follicle-stimulating hormone, especially with a family history of premature ovarian insufficiency, fragile X syndrome, or a relative of either sex with undiagnosed intellectual disability.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Individuals with late-onset intention tremor or ataxia, especially with a family history of movement disorders, fragile X, or undiagnosed intellectual disability.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>After screening, referral to a genetic counselor or another clinician with expertise in the genetics and clinical findings in fragile X syndrome is appropriate. Women with a premutation are informed of the risk of expansion to a full mutation in offspring. This risk may be altered by the presence of adenine-guanine-guanine (AGG) regions interspersed within the expanded region. Men with a premutation or full mutation are informed that their daughters will have a premutation.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Men and women with a premutation or full mutation are informed of the potential phenotypes of their male and female offspring (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F73067\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef73067 \">table 2</a>) and potential sequelae in future generations. Men and women with a premutation are also informed of their own risk for developing tremor-ataxia syndrome in late adult life (usually after age 50) and, in women, premature ovarian insufficiency (menopause before age 40). In addition, implications for family members should be discussed as they are also at risk of being carriers. (See <a href=\"#H860752557\" class=\"local\">'Post-test counseling'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We offer prenatal (fetal) diagnosis for fragile X when the mother has a premutation or full mutation. Fetal testing is performed on cells obtained by chorionic villus sampling or amniocentesis. For males with either a premutation or full mutation, fetal testing is rarely done as all daughters are expected to be premutation carriers. (See <a href=\"#H3461670741\" class=\"local\">'Candidates for prenatal (fetal) diagnosis'</a> above and <a href=\"#H16\" class=\"local\">'Prenatal (fetal) diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The results of fetal testing and offspring prognosis should be provided to parents in consultation with a genetic counselor.
