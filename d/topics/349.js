Such infections lack signs or symptoms that suggest an infection extending beyond the bladder. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Complicated UTI</strong> &ndash; We use the term complicated urinary tract infection (UTI) to refer to an acute UTI with any of the following features, which suggest that the infection extends beyond the bladder:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Fever (&gt;99.<span class=\"nowrap\">9&deg;F/37</span>.7&deg;C) &ndash; This temperature threshold is not well defined and should be individualized, taking into account baseline temperature, other potential contributors to an elevated temperature, and the risk of poor outcomes should empiric antimicrobial therapy be inappropriate.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Other signs or symptoms of systemic illness (including chills or rigors).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Flank pain.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Costovertebral angle tenderness. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Pelvic or perineal pain, which can suggest accompanying prostatitis. </p><p/><p>By this definition, pyelonephritis is a complicated UTI, regardless of patient characteristics. Risk factors for infection with drug-resistant organisms do not, on their own, indicate a complicated UTI.</p><p>The distinction between uncomplicated cystitis and complicated UTI is important because the treatment approach differs. Complicated UTI is a more serious infection than uncomplicated cystitis. Therefore, expected efficacy of an antimicrobial agent is of greater importance than concern about ecological adverse effects (selection of drug-resistant organisms and the development of colonization or infection with multidrug-resistant organisms), which are a higher priority in the setting of uncomplicated cystitis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-uncomplicated-cystitis-in-men/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Furthermore, certain agents used for uncomplicated cystitis should not be used for complicated UTI because they do not achieve adequate levels in tissue, which may be important for cure.</p><p>Classically, uncomplicated versus complicated cystitis and pyelonephritis have been defined by patient features, such as poorly controlled diabetes mellitus, renal failure, urologic abnormalities, or immunocompromising conditions. </p><p>It has also been conventional to consider all UTIs in males as complicated, since the majority occur in infants or the elderly in association with urologic abnormalities, such as bladder outlet obstruction (eg, due to prostatic hyperplasia) or instrumentation. In addition, it is not always possible to rule out prostate infection. However, our clinical approach to managing UTI is based more on the apparent extent of infection, which informs the risk of severe infection as well as the risk of drug resistance, rather than the classic &quot;complicating&quot; patient features, which do not consistently predict either of these factors. Thus, we favor distinguishing between uncomplicated cystitis and complicated UTI as defined above. </p><p>Complicated UTI is discussed in detail elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acute-complicated-urinary-tract-infection-including-pyelonephritis-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Acute complicated urinary tract infection (including pyelonephritis) in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The approach to UTI is specific for certain populations, such as renal transplant recipients. These are discussed elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=urinary-tract-infection-in-renal-transplant-recipients\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Urinary tract infection in renal transplant recipients&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">EPIDEMIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Acute uncomplicated cystitis occurs in a small proportion of men between 15 and 50 years of age. The incidence is approximately five to eight urinary tract infections (UTIs) per year per 10,000 young to middle-aged men [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-uncomplicated-cystitis-in-men/abstract/2,3\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,3</a>].</p><p>Symptomatic UTI is much less common in men than in women. This is due to longer urethral length, drier periurethral environment (with less frequent colonization around the urethra), and antibacterial substances in prostatic fluid. </p><p>Risk factors associated with acute uncomplicated cystitis in men include insertive anal intercourse and lack of circumcision [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-uncomplicated-cystitis-in-men/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL MANIFESTATIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Clinical manifestations of cystitis consist of dysuria, urinary frequency, urgency, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> suprapubic pain. </p><p>Prostatitis should be considered in men presenting with cystitis symptoms that are recurrent or are accompanied by pelvic or perineal pain or fever. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acute-bacterial-prostatitis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Acute bacterial prostatitis&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=chronic-bacterial-prostatitis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Chronic bacterial prostatitis&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Fever, chills, rigors, and other signs of systemic illness are not compatible with a diagnosis of acute uncomplicated cystitis and raise the possibility of pyelonephritis, prostatitis, or other complication of UTI.

Men should be asked about fevers, chills, and other systemic symptoms, as well as flank, pelvic, or perineal pain. If symptoms are suggestive of extension of infection outside of the bladder, physical examination should include assessment for fever, costovertebral angle tenderness, abdominal examination, and, if pelvic or perineal pain are present, a cautious digital rectal examination to evaluate for a tender prostate.</p><p>Laboratory diagnostic tools consist of urinalysis (either by microscopy or by dipstick) and urine culture with susceptibility data. A urine Gram stain may be helpful in guiding the choice of empiric therapy pending culture results. A urine culture should be performed in all men with symptoms suggestive of cystitis. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12809514\"><span class=\"h3\">Urinalysis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Urinalysis for evaluation of pyuria is the most valuable laboratory diagnostic test for UTI. Pyuria is present in almost all men with acute cystitis; its absence strongly suggests an alternative diagnosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-uncomplicated-cystitis-in-men/abstract/5,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,6</a>].</p><p>The most accurate method for assessing pyuria is to examine an unspun, voided midstream urine specimen with a hemocytometer; an abnormal result is &ge;10 <span class=\"nowrap\">leukocytes/microL</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-uncomplicated-cystitis-in-men/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. White blood cell casts in the urine are diagnostic of upper tract infection, which would indicate a complicated UTI. </p><p>Urinalysis is discussed further separately.

In women, when coliform bacteria (eg, <em>Escherichia coli</em>) are isolated, lower colony counts are also likely to represent significant bacteriuria [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-uncomplicated-cystitis-in-men/abstract/8,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,9</a>]. It is unknown if the same is true for men. </p><p>The spectrum of isolates causing uncomplicated cystitis in men is not well defined but is likely similar to that in women, which consists mainly of <em>E. coli</em> (75 to 95 percent), with occasional other species of Enterobacteriaceae, such as<em> Klebsiella pneumoniae </em>and <em>Proteus mirabilis </em>[<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-uncomplicated-cystitis-in-men/abstract/10,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,11</a>].

Men with recurrent cystitis should be evaluated for predisposing features or causative factors (such as prostatic hypertrophy or other urinary tract obstruction). In particular, recurrent infection with the same strain of bacteria should prompt evaluation for chronic prostatitis. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-urinary-tract-obstruction-and-hydronephrosis#H8\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of urinary tract obstruction and hydronephrosis&quot;, section on 'Diagnosis'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=chronic-bacterial-prostatitis#H14689261\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Chronic bacterial prostatitis&quot;, section on 'Diagnosis'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h1\">DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Dysuria, urinary frequency and urgency, and pyuria can also be seen with acute bacterial prostatitis. The presence of fever, chills, malaise, myalgias, pelvic or perineal pain, or obstructive symptoms such as dribbling and hesitancy (due to acute urinary retention) in a man with symptoms of cystitis suggests acute bacterial prostatitis. Pain radiating to the tip of the penis has also been described in patients with acute prostatitis, but the sensitivity and specificity of this symptom has not been validated. Any of these signs and symptoms should prompt performance of gentle digital rectal examination, and the finding of an edematous and tender prostate helps to confirm this alternate diagnosis. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acute-bacterial-prostatitis#H23323217\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Acute bacterial prostatitis&quot;, section on 'Diagnosis'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acute-bacterial-prostatitis#H172458394\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Acute bacterial prostatitis&quot;, section on 'Differential diagnosis'</a>.)</p><p>Underlying chronic prostatitis should be considered in men with cystitis, particularly in those men who have recurrent UTIs caused by the same strain of bacteria.

Our approach to management is based on indirect evidence from trials in women and more limited data in men. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acute-uncomplicated-cystitis-in-women#H899949213\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Acute uncomplicated cystitis in women&quot;, section on 'Management'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H94493812\"><span class=\"h2\">Antimicrobial selection</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Although cystitis in men is generally classified in the literature as a complicated urinary tract infection (UTI), it is reasonable to consider a healthy man without a neurogenic bladder who has mild to moderate dysuria, urinary frequency <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> urgency, with no symptoms or signs of infection outside the bladder, as having uncomplicated cystitis. For empiric antimicrobial treatment of such men, we use one of the first-line regimens recommended for women:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><a href=\"topic.htm?path=nitrofurantoin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Nitrofurantoin</a> <span class=\"nowrap\">monohydrate/macrocrystals</span> (100 mg orally twice daily)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><a href=\"topic.htm?path=trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole-co-trimoxazole-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole</a> (TMP-SMX, one double-strength tablet [160 mg <span class=\"nowrap\">TMP/800</span> mg SMX] orally twice daily)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><a href=\"topic.htm?path=fosfomycin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Fosfomycin</a> (3 grams of powder mixed in water as a single dose)</p><p/><p>The choice among them should be individualized based on patient circumstances (allergy, tolerability, expected adherence), local community resistance prevalence, availability, and cost. If the patient has taken one of the agents in the preceding three months, a different one should be selected. Based on data on UTI in women, empiric TMP-SMX should be avoided if the regional prevalence of resistance is known to exceed 20 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-uncomplicated-cystitis-in-men/abstract/15,16\" class=\"abstract_t\">15,16</a>]. <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nitrofurantoin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Nitrofurantoin</a> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fosfomycin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">fosfomycin</a> are particularly useful if multidrug resistance is documented or suspected (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F114310\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef114310 \">table 1</a>). Beta-lactams can be used cautiously if other options are not appropriate because of <span class=\"nowrap\">allergy/intolerance</span> or concerns about resistance. </p><p>However, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nitrofurantoin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">nitrofurantoin</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fosfomycin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">fosfomycin</a>, and beta-lactams do not achieve reliable tissue concentrations in the prostate and may not adequately treat subclinical prostatitis. Thus, for men who have more severe cystitis symptoms or concern about early involvement of the prostate, we use a fluoroquinolone (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=ciprofloxacin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ciprofloxacin</a> 500 mg orally twice daily or 1000 mg extended release once daily, or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=levofloxacin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">levofloxacin</a> 750 mg orally once daily) for empiric therapy since they achieve more reliable tissue concentrations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-uncomplicated-cystitis-in-men/abstract/2,4\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,4</a>]. Because of concerns about the adverse effects of fluoroquinolones, they should only be used if there is concern about subclinical prostatitis or more severe illness [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-uncomplicated-cystitis-in-men/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. If a fluoroquinolone is used, patients should be advised about the uncommon but potentially serious musculoskeletal and neurologic adverse effects. </p><p>Once susceptibility testing results are available, subsequent therapy should be tailored as appropriate. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H94493819\"><span class=\"h2\">Duration of therapy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There are no studies that have evaluated the optimal duration of antimicrobial therapy in men with cystitis.

In a large retrospective study of 33,336 male veterans who received antimicrobial therapy for a UTI, as identified through billing codes (and not necessarily specified as uncomplicated), there was no difference in the risk of early (less than 30 days after a prior UTI) or late (30 days or longer after a prior UTI) recurrence between those who received a short (seven days or less) or long (more than seven days) course of antimicrobials [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-uncomplicated-cystitis-in-men/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. Moreover, in a multivariate analysis, there was a nonsignificant trend toward an increased risk in the incidence of <em>Clostridium difficile</em> infection among patients who received a longer course of therapy. Because of the inherent limitations in interpretation of retrospective studies, prospective studies are warranted to further elucidate the benefits and harms of shorter- versus longer-duration treatment for UTIs in men.</p><p>When fluoroquinolones specifically are used, a course as short as five days is likely effective, as illustrated by a trial of patients with complicated cystitis or pyelonephritis, in which five days of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=levofloxacin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">levofloxacin</a> was equivalent to ten days of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ciprofloxacin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ciprofloxacin</a> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-uncomplicated-cystitis-in-men/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12810275\"><span class=\"h1\">FOLLOW-UP</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Follow-up urine cultures are not needed in patients with acute uncomplicated cystitis whose symptoms resolve on antimicrobials. </p><p>Patients who have worsening or persistent symptoms after 48 to 72 hours of appropriate antimicrobial therapy or have recurrent symptoms within a few weeks of treatment should have additional evaluation for other potential conditions that may be causing those symptoms and for factors that might be compromising clinical response.

Symptomatic urinary tract infection (UTI) is much less common in men than in women. This is due to longer urethral length, drier periurethral environment (with less frequent colonization around the urethra), and antibacterial substances in prostatic fluid. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Epidemiology'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The classic clinical manifestations of cystitis consist of dysuria, urinary frequency, urinary urgency, and suprapubic pain. Laboratory diagnostic tools for cystitis consist of urinalysis (either by microscopy or by dipstick) and urine culture with susceptibility data. A urine culture should be performed in all men with symptoms suggestive of cystitis. (See <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Clinical manifestations'</a> above and <a href=\"#H463320305\" class=\"local\">'Initial evaluation'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The diagnosis of acute uncomplicated cystitis can be made in a man who presents with typical urinary symptoms, pyuria, and bacteriuria on urine culture in the absence of fever or other systemic symptoms, pelvic or perineal pain, costovertebral angle tenderness, and other features suggestive of pyelonephritis or acute prostatitis. (See <a href=\"#H3374330708\" class=\"local\">'Diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Men with recurrent cystitis should undergo evaluation for prostatitis. Urologic evaluation is probably not necessary in young healthy men with no obvious complicating factors who have a single episode of cystitis that responds promptly to antimicrobial treatment. (See <a href=\"#H5464722\" class=\"local\">'Additional evaluation'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Fever, chills, malaise, or myalgias suggest a complicated UTI (including pyelonephritis) or bacterial prostatitis. In particular, pelvic or perineal pain, pain radiating to the tip of the penis, or obstructive symptoms such as dribbling and hesitancy (due to acute urinary retention) in a man with symptoms of cystitis suggest bacterial prostatitis. Chronic prostatitis should be considered in all men with cystitis, particularly in those men who have recurrent infections. Urethritis must be considered in sexually active men, and diagnostic tests for <em>Neisseria gonorrhoeae</em> and <em>Chlamydia trachomatis</em> are warranted. (See <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'Differential diagnosis'</a> above and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acute-complicated-urinary-tract-infection-including-pyelonephritis-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Acute complicated urinary tract infection (including pyelonephritis) in adults&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acute-bacterial-prostatitis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Acute bacterial prostatitis&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=chronic-bacterial-prostatitis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Chronic bacterial prostatitis&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=urethritis-in-adult-men\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Urethritis in adult men&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For empiric antimicrobial therapy of men with acute uncomplicated cystitis, we suggest <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nitrofurantoin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">nitrofurantoin</a> <span class=\"nowrap\">monohydrate/macrocrystals,</span> <a href=\"topic.htm?path=trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole-co-trimoxazole-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole</a> (TMP-SMX), or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fosfomycin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">fosfomycin</a> (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). Beta-lactams are an alternative. However, if there are severe cystitis symptoms or concern about early involvement of the prostate, a fluoroquinolone is preferred. Once susceptibility testing results are available, subsequent therapy should be tailored as appropriate. The duration depends on the agent used (fluoroquinolones are given for five days, fosfomycin is given as a single dose, and other agents are given for seven days).
