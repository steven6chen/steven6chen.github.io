Differing definitions for a chronic cough have been proposed that require symptoms for varying times from two weeks to three months [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-subacute-and-chronic-cough-in-adults/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>]. Guidelines from the American College of Chest Physicians distinguish three categories of cough based upon duration [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-subacute-and-chronic-cough-in-adults/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Acute cough, lasting less than three weeks</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Subacute cough, lasting between three and eight weeks</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Chronic cough, lasting more than eight weeks</p><p/><p>The initial priorities for patients with cough lasting more than three weeks (subacute or chronic cough) are to identify a precipitant or etiology, and then to eliminate the precipitant or treat the underlying cause [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-subacute-and-chronic-cough-in-adults/abstract/3-6\" class=\"abstract_t\">3-6</a>].</p><p>Specific therapy for the most common causes of subacute and chronic cough and nonspecific suppressive therapy for refractory cough will be reviewed here. The causes, evaluation, and complications of subacute and chronic cough are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-of-subacute-and-chronic-cough-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation of subacute and chronic cough in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">OVERVIEW</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Several older studies that used a systematic approach to the evaluation and treatment of persistent cough reported that treatment aimed at the underlying disorder was successful in more than 90 percent of patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-subacute-and-chronic-cough-in-adults/abstract/7-9\" class=\"abstract_t\">7-9</a>]. More recent studies and reviews of chronic cough, however, have found the number of patients responding fully to specific therapy to be substantially fewer [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-subacute-and-chronic-cough-in-adults/abstract/10-12\" class=\"abstract_t\">10-12</a>]. There remains widespread agreement, nonetheless, that the initial approach to a patient with chronic cough should follow a systematic algorithmic approach to treatment aimed at the most common causes or triggers (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F67147\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef67147 \">algorithm 1</a>).</p><p>The initial step in the algorithm identifies patients who are immunosuppressed, smoke cigarettes, or have purulent sputum. Immunosuppressed patients should have a diligent and rapid evaluation for infection. Smokers need counseling to quit smoking and often a chest radiograph to exclude bronchogenic carcinoma. Patients with significant production of purulent sputum need evaluation for pulmonary and possibly sinus infection, and treatment of identified infections, prior to proceeding with the algorithm.</p><p>The algorithm uses a sequential approach to using specific empiric therapies for the most common causes of cough. These therapies are described in the following sections. Using an algorithm with a sequential, empiric approach to therapy is of diagnostic as well as therapeutic usefulness. Therefore, it is usually best to follow one avenue of treatment at a time rather than several branches of treatment simultaneously. If there is partial but incomplete resolution of the cough with one line of therapy, then it is reasonable to add therapy for the next most likely diagnostic possibility.</p><p>On the other hand, some patients have more than one cause for chronic cough, particularly those seen in a referral clinic. Among such individuals, cough only resolves when all causes are successfully treated at the same time [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-subacute-and-chronic-cough-in-adults/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. When more than one etiology is suspected at the time of the initial evaluation and the cough is particularly disabling, empiric treatment or evaluation of likely causes can be pursued simultaneously. Once cough has resolved, treatments can be stopped sequentially, starting with the least likely to have been helpful, observing the patient for any return of cough.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">SPECIFIC TREATMENT</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Upper airway cough syndrome</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Upper airway cough syndrome (UACS; previously known as postnasal drip syndrome but revised to include all upper airway abnormalities causing cough) has a number of different etiologies, including allergic, nonallergic, and vasomotor rhinitis, acute nasopharyngitis, and sinusitis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-subacute-and-chronic-cough-in-adults/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. When an environmental precipitant for allergic rhinitis can be identified, exposure to this precipitant should be eliminated if at all possible. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=allergic-rhinitis-clinical-manifestations-epidemiology-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Allergic rhinitis: Clinical manifestations, epidemiology, and diagnosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Practice parameters for the diagnosis and management of rhinitis have been published [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-subacute-and-chronic-cough-in-adults/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. These guidelines describe high-quality evidence that intranasal glucocorticoids are the most effective therapy for symptoms of allergic rhinitis (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F55833\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef55833 \">table 1</a>). In addition, intranasal glucocorticoids are effective for several types of nonallergic rhinitis, including nonallergic rhinitis with eosinophilia (NARES) and vasomotor rhinitis. For patients with cough due to allergic rhinitis, intranasal glucocorticoids are generally effective in reducing cough within the first few days, but may take up to two weeks to achieve maximal effect. If the patient responds, therapy is continued for approximately three months [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-subacute-and-chronic-cough-in-adults/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].</p><p>Additional therapies for allergic rhinitis include oral and nasal antihistamines, oral decongestants, oral leukotriene receptor antagonists, and other agents. The use of these agents for allergic and nonallergic rhinitis is reviewed in detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pharmacotherapy-of-allergic-rhinitis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pharmacotherapy of allergic rhinitis&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=chronic-nonallergic-rhinitis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Chronic nonallergic rhinitis&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Among patients without evidence for allergic rhinitis in whom nonallergic rhinitis may be more likely, our approach is to perform a diagnostic trial with an oral first generation antihistamine (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=brompheniramine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">brompheniramine</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=chlorpheniramine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">chlorpheniramine</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clemastine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">clemastine</a>) or a combined antihistamine-decongestant (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=brompheniramine-and-pseudoephedrine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">brompheniramine-pseudoephedrine</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-subacute-and-chronic-cough-in-adults/abstract/1,4,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,4,15</a>]. First generation antihistamines are preferred over second generation ones (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cetirizine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cetirizine</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fexofenadine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">fexofenadine</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=loratadine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">loratadine</a>) due to the stronger anticholinergic effect, but concern over the sedating effects may limit their use [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-subacute-and-chronic-cough-in-adults/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. Improvement in the cough should lead to further evaluation for the cause of the rhinitis (eg, allergic, nonallergic, or rhinosinusitis) and optimization of the long-term treatment. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pharmacotherapy-of-allergic-rhinitis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pharmacotherapy of allergic rhinitis&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=chronic-nonallergic-rhinitis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Chronic nonallergic rhinitis&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acute-sinusitis-and-rhinosinusitis-in-adults-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Acute sinusitis and rhinosinusitis in adults: Clinical manifestations and diagnosis&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=chronic-rhinosinusitis-management\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Chronic rhinosinusitis: Management&quot;</a>.)</p><p>For patients with suspected nonallergic UACS who are not candidates for use of an oral first generation antihistamine (eg, due to excess somnolence), other options include intranasal administration of one of the following: <a href=\"topic.htm?path=azelastine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">azelastine</a>, glucocorticoid, and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ipratropium-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ipratropium</a> bromide [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-subacute-and-chronic-cough-in-adults/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. However, azelastine may cause somnolence even with intranasal use. Intranasal ipratropium bromide significantly reduces the rhinorrhea associated with perennial nonallergic rhinitis and has few side effects [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-subacute-and-chronic-cough-in-adults/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=chronic-nonallergic-rhinitis#H17\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Chronic nonallergic rhinitis&quot;, section on 'Topical antihistamine sprays'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=chronic-nonallergic-rhinitis#H18\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Chronic nonallergic rhinitis&quot;, section on 'Prominent rhinorrhea without other symptoms'</a>.)</p><p>Lack of improvement in cough after one to two weeks of empiric therapy for UACS is evidence that UACS is not the cause of the cough. However, in the presence of nasal symptoms or signs, a sinus CT scan should be performed before completely excluding the possibility of UACS as a cause of cough.</p><p>When sinusitis is documented by plain radiograph or sinus CT scan, treatment is guided by whether the patient has acute (less than 12 weeks) or chronic sinusitis. The treatment of these entities is discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acute-sinusitis-and-rhinosinusitis-in-adults-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Acute sinusitis and rhinosinusitis in adults: Clinical manifestations and diagnosis&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=chronic-rhinosinusitis-management\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Chronic rhinosinusitis: Management&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Cough variant asthma</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Cough variant asthma may be suspected based on the presence of reversible airflow obstruction or a positive test for bronchial hyperresponsiveness (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methacholine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">methacholine</a> or histamine challenge test). However, confirmation that cough is due to asthma requires a beneficial response to therapy for asthma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-subacute-and-chronic-cough-in-adults/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. Therapy for cough variant asthma follows the same general principles as standard therapy for asthma. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=an-overview-of-asthma-management\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;An overview of asthma management&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Similar to therapy for moderate or severe asthma, the mainstays of therapy for cough variant asthma are regular use of inhaled glucocorticoids (GC) and as-needed use of inhaled bronchodilators [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-subacute-and-chronic-cough-in-adults/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. In a case series, for example, 10 patients with cough variant asthma were treated with inhaled GCs; all were free of disabling cough at a mean follow up of 28 months [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-subacute-and-chronic-cough-in-adults/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>].</p><p>The leukotriene receptor antagonists (LTRA) have also been shown to improve cough in patients with cough variant asthma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-subacute-and-chronic-cough-in-adults/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. In a small, randomized trial of 13 patients with cough variant asthma who were refractory to treatment with inhaled bronchodilators and inhaled glucocorticoids, therapy with an LTRA resulted in decreased cough scores compared with placebo [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-subacute-and-chronic-cough-in-adults/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. LTRAs are an alternative among patients who wish to avoid or who have not responded to glucocorticoids. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=antileukotriene-agents-in-the-management-of-asthma\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Antileukotriene agents in the management of asthma&quot;</a>.)</p><p>For patients who are disabled by their cough, a short (one to two week) course of oral <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prednisone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">prednisone</a> can be given, generally with excellent results [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-subacute-and-chronic-cough-in-adults/abstract/17,18\" class=\"abstract_t\">17,18</a>]. Once the patient has improved, prednisone is discontinued and maintenance therapy with inhaled GCs is continued.</p><p>Sputum eosinophil cell count and exhaled nitric oxide measurement have been used in patients with asthma as measures of airway inflammation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-subacute-and-chronic-cough-in-adults/abstract/21-23\" class=\"abstract_t\">21-23</a>]. This has led some to suggest that such tests can be used by the clinician in evaluating whether patients with a suboptimal response to therapy for cough variant asthma would benefit from an escalation in their anti-inflammatory asthma treatment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-subacute-and-chronic-cough-in-adults/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. Further study of this approach is needed before widespread implementation.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Nonasthmatic eosinophilic bronchitis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The usual treatment for nonasthmatic eosinophilic bronchitis (NAEB) is an inhaled glucocorticoid. This choice is based on observational studies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-subacute-and-chronic-cough-in-adults/abstract/24,25\" class=\"abstract_t\">24,25</a>]. As an example, 11 patients with NAEB received open-label treatment with inhaled <a href=\"topic.htm?path=budesonide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">budesonide</a> 400 mcg per day for four weeks [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-subacute-and-chronic-cough-in-adults/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. Severity of cough and sensitivity to capsaicin-induced cough both improved. The optimal dose and duration of therapy have not been determined.</p><p>When an inciting agent (eg, occupational allergen) is identified, further exposure should be avoided. Rarely, oral glucocorticoids are needed for refractory symptoms.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Gastroesophageal reflux</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Cough due to gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) generally responds to a regimen that includes lifestyle modifications and acid suppression medication [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-subacute-and-chronic-cough-in-adults/abstract/8,26-28\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,26-28</a>]:</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h3\">Lifestyle modifications</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The evidence in favor of lifestyle modifications to reduce or prevent GERD and thereby treat cough is limited [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-subacute-and-chronic-cough-in-adults/abstract/8,28\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,28</a>]. The following interventions are based on the lifestyle modifications that are suggested for the routine management of GERD:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Weight loss for patients who are overweight</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Elevation of the head of the bed three to four inches</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Cessation of smoking</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Avoidance of reflux-inducing foods (eg, fatty foods, chocolate, excess alcohol)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Avoidance of very acidic beverages (eg, colas, red wine, orange juice)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Avoidance of meals for two to three hours before lying down (except for medications)</p><p/><p>Lifestyle modification in the management of GERD is discussed separately.

However, regimens proven effective in the management of GERD may not necessarily be the optimum regimen for cough due to GERD. A meta-analysis of randomized trials of medical GERD interventions for cough showed that while such therapy indeed has some effect in adults, the effect is less universal than often suggested in consensus guidelines [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-subacute-and-chronic-cough-in-adults/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. A possible explanation for failure to improve despite acid suppression is that of nonacidic reflux [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-subacute-and-chronic-cough-in-adults/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>].</p><p>We suggest using an empiric trial of a proton pump inhibitor at a moderate dose (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=omeprazole-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">omeprazole</a> 40 mg once daily in the morning). This is based on the evidence that therapy with a PPI is more effective than H<sub>2</sub> antagonist treatment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-subacute-and-chronic-cough-in-adults/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. In addition, as it may take up to eight weeks, and sometimes several months, to yield optimal improvement in cough, it seems reasonable to start with the more effective choice [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-subacute-and-chronic-cough-in-adults/abstract/8,28\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,28</a>].</p><p>For patients whose cough does not improve after one to two months of empiric therapy, we proceed to 24 hour esophageal pH probe monitoring. Results suggestive of cough due to GERD include an abnormal amount of time with an esophageal pH less than four and cough occurring within a few minutes of reflux events. Multichannel intraluminal impedance (MII) monitoring, which is increasingly available, may help identify patients with cough from nonacidic reflux. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-gastroesophageal-reflux-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of gastroesophageal reflux in adults&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=esophageal-multichannel-intraluminal-impedance-testing\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Esophageal multichannel intraluminal impedance testing&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h3\">Other therapies</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The addition of prokinetic therapy such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=metoclopramide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">metoclopramide</a> may be beneficial in patients with nonacidic reflux or may add to the effectiveness of acid suppression therapy in cough due to acidic reflux. However, supportive data are weak and patients placed on metoclopramide should be followed for the possible development of extrapyramidal side effects (eg, rigidity, bradykinesia, tremor, and restlessness).</p><p>The role of anti-reflux surgery to relieve extra-esophageal symptoms related to GERD is unclear [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-subacute-and-chronic-cough-in-adults/abstract/31-33\" class=\"abstract_t\">31-33</a>]. We reserve laparoscopic or open Nissen fundoplication for the small number of patients with chronic cough who have objectively documented gastroesophageal or laryngopharyngeal reflux disease that is refractory to medical measures. In a meta-analysis of 25 studies, a variable portion of patients (15 to 95 percent) experienced improvement in extra-esophageal symptoms (including but not limited to cough) after surgical fundoplication [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-subacute-and-chronic-cough-in-adults/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>]. The studies were all nonrandomized and used variable selection criteria.

The best approach is to use a systematic combination of empiric therapy and objective testing. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-of-subacute-and-chronic-cough-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation of subacute and chronic cough in adults&quot;</a> and <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Specific treatment'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In patients with upper airway cough syndrome (UACS) who have a personal or family history suggestive of atopy, we recommend treatment with an intranasal glucocorticoid, rather than an oral antihistamine (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=2\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1B</a>). Combination therapy with an intranasal glucocorticoid and an oral antihistamine is an acceptable alternative, particularly in a patient with severe symptoms. (See <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Upper airway cough syndrome'</a> above and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pharmacotherapy-of-allergic-rhinitis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pharmacotherapy of allergic rhinitis&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In patients with suspected upper airway cough syndrome, but no features to suggest atopy, we suggest empiric treatment with a first generation oral antihistamine, rather than a second generation antihistamine (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=5\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2B</a>). A first generation intranasal antihistamine is an acceptable alternative. Addition of an oral decongestant medication may provide additional benefit. (See <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Upper airway cough syndrome'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In patients with subacute or chronic cough due to suspected cough variant asthma, we recommend regular use of an inhaled glucocorticoid and as-needed use of an inhaled bronchodilator, rather than use of an inhaled bronchodilator alone (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=2\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1B</a>). Combination therapy with a leukotriene receptor antagonist and an as-needed, short-acting inhaled bronchodilator is a reasonable alternative. (See <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Cough variant asthma'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>All patients suspected of having a cough due to gastroesophageal reflux should be advised regarding lifestyle modifications. In addition, we recommend using an empiric trial of acid suppression medication therapy, rather than direct testing for gastroesophageal reflux (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=2\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1B</a>). Proton pump inhibitors appear to be more effective than H<sub>2</sub> antagonists in this setting. (See <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'Gastroesophageal reflux'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A small number of patients have cough due to nonacid gastroesophageal or laryngopharyngeal reflux and may be helped by antireflux surgery, although further studies are needed. (See <a href=\"#H10\" class=\"local\">'Other therapies'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients with cough following an upper respiratory infection and clinical features suggestive of UACS, we suggest treatment with an oral first generation antihistamine, rather than a second generation antihistamine (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=5\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2B</a>). The addition of on oral or intranasal decongestant may be beneficial to some patients. (See <a href=\"#H11\" class=\"local\">'Following an upper respiratory tract infection'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients with cough following an upper respiratory infection, but few or no features of UACS, we treat bronchial hyperreactivity, as described above for cough variant asthma. (See <a href=\"#H11\" class=\"local\">'Following an upper respiratory tract infection'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients who develop a chronic cough while taking angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEI), we recommend stopping the ACEI rather than trying to suppress the cough with other agents (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=3\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1C</a>). The cough will usually resolve within a couple of weeks, although it will occasionally last up to four months. (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Specific treatment'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H21\"><span class=\"h2\">Nonspecific therapy</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>There are patients for whom the etiology of the cough cannot be identified, no specific therapy exists, or specific therapy has failed. For such patients, we suggest treatment with the non-opioid agent, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dextromethorphan-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">dextromethorphan</a>, rather than using an opioid (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). <a href=\"topic.htm?path=benzonatate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Benzonatate</a> can be added if the cough persists despite dextromethorphan. (See <a href=\"#H13\" class=\"local\">'Nonspecific treatment'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients who have a cough due to an unrelenting cause or a persistent cough despite both specific therapy and nonspecific therapy with non-opioid agents, we suggest a trial of an opioid antitussive (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=5\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2B</a>). <a href=\"topic.htm?path=codeine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Codeine</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=morphine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">morphine</a> are commonly used opioid antitussives.
