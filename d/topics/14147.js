It is a common congenital malformation, typically discovered at the time of birth as an isolated anomaly in an otherwise normal neonate.</p><p>Clubfoot can be classified as congenital, syndromic, or positional. The congenital foot deformity affects the bones, muscles, tendons, and blood vessels of one or both feet. Syndromic cases are associated with additional anatomic malformations <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> chromosomal or genetic abnormalities. A positional clubfoot results from the baby's position in the uterus, and is often associated with a restrictive uterine environment (oligohydramnios, uterine anomalies). A positional clubfoot is flexible, rather than rigid, and can be positioned into a neutral position easily by hand.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">PREVALENCE AND EPIDEMIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The prevalence of clubfoot is 1 to 3 per 1000 live births in Caucasians [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prenatal-diagnosis-of-talipes-equinovarus-clubfoot/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Male fetuses are predominately affected, with a 2-to-1 male to female ratio. The birth prevalence varies among different ethnic groups; the highest rates are seen in individuals of Polynesian ancestry (7 per 1000 live births) and the lowest in Asian populations (0.57 per 1000 live births) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prenatal-diagnosis-of-talipes-equinovarus-clubfoot/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. </p><p>Clubfoot is bilateral in 30 to 60 percent of cases.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">EMBRYOLOGY OF FOOT DEVELOPMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The foot sequentially assumes three different positions during embryonic and early fetal life: at the 15-mm stage (about 8 weeks of gestation), the foot is in a straight line with the leg; by the 30-mm stage (about 10 weeks of gestation), the foot rotates to a marked equinovarus-adductus position; and then by the 50-mm stage (about 11.5 weeks), it changes to a slightly equinovarus adductus position, which remains throughout fetal life [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prenatal-diagnosis-of-talipes-equinovarus-clubfoot/abstract/3,4\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,4</a>]. These positional changes result from the growth of the distal ends of the fibula and the skeletal elements of the lateral foot during the &quot;fibular phase&quot; of rapid growth.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h1\">ANATOMY OF CLUBFOOT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The main anatomic abnormality is a mild to severe deformity of the talus, which is small and abnormal in all of its relationships. There is subluxation of the talo-calcaneo-navicular joint with under-development of the soft tissues on the medial side of the foot, and frequently of the calf and peroneal muscles. Shortening and fibrosis in the gastrocsoleus and its tendon, as well as in the posterior tibial muscle and tendon, also occur. The ligaments of the forefoot are normal, but the forefoot is adducted and supinated. Bony malposition and secondary contractures cause the foot to be held in a relatively fixed position, which is resistant to realignment. The clubfoot, calf, and leg are smaller and shorter than the normal limb.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h1\">PATHOGENESIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Most cases are idiopathic (80 percent) or isolated, with the remainder associated with additional structural and chromosomal or genetic anomalies (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F78890\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef78890 \">table 1</a>). Clubfoot, and other types of joint contracture, can be secondary to factors intrinsic or extrinsic to the fetus. Depending upon the etiology, the prognosis varies widely.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Intrinsic causes</strong> &mdash; Fetal abnormalities from intrinsic etiologies tend to be symmetric (eg, bilateral clubfoot) and associated with multiple other findings. Intrinsic causes of clubfoot may reflect early fetal onset of neurologic, muscular, vascular, or connective tissue disease with long-term implications for the neonate, as well as for its siblings, especially if an underlying genetic disorder is identified. Spina bifida is the most common intrinsic cause of clubfoot.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">The genetics of clubfoot have not been clearly established, <span class=\"nowrap\">multifactorial/polygenic</span> inheritance likely plays a role in many cases, but pedigrees with Mendelian inheritance have also been described. Pedigree analyses have suggested a single gene may be involved; recessive patterns (autosomal and x-linked) and, less commonly, variably penetrant autosomal dominant patterns have been described [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prenatal-diagnosis-of-talipes-equinovarus-clubfoot/abstract/5-8\" class=\"abstract_t\">5-8</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">The sibling of an affected dizygotic twin has a 2-fold increased risk of being affected, while the risk in a monozygotic twin is 10-fold higher (concordance rate 3 versus 33 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prenatal-diagnosis-of-talipes-equinovarus-clubfoot/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. A missense mutation in PITX1 and duplications and deletions in chromosome 17q23 result in abnormalities in the PITX1-TBX4 transcriptional pathway, which is responsible for early limb development [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prenatal-diagnosis-of-talipes-equinovarus-clubfoot/abstract/10,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,11</a>]. These genetic abnormalities have been implicated in a small proportion of familial isolated clubfoot.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Extrinsic causes</strong> &mdash; Extrinsic causes of clubfoot are related to factors external to the fetus that impede the normal sequential growth and position of the foot. The resulting deformation can be secondary to restriction to movement from multiple gestations, malpresentation, uterine cavity abnormalities (eg, fibroids, synechiae, amniotic bands), breech position, or oligohydramnios. Abnormalities tend to be asymmetric, and are not necessarily isolated, particularly if the cause is long-standing. These infants may be born with other &quot;packaging&quot; problems such as developmental dysplasia of the hip since this condition may also be related to abnormal positioning <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> limited fetal mobility.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">There is no strong evidence that maternal use of any medication increases the risk of isolated clubfoot [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prenatal-diagnosis-of-talipes-equinovarus-clubfoot/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h1\">RISK FACTORS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The major risk factors for clubfoot are a family history of the defect and the presence of a condition that restricts fetal foot movement, such as crowding in a multiple gestation, oligohydramnios, uterine abnormality, and fetal neuromuscular disorders. These risk factors are generally not modifiable.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h1\">PRENATAL DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Transvaginal ultrasound can detect the abnormality as early as 12 to 13 weeks of gestation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prenatal-diagnosis-of-talipes-equinovarus-clubfoot/abstract/2,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,13</a>]. The sonographic diagnosis is based upon visualization of the plantar surface of the fetal foot in the same sagittal plane as both lower extremity bones (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F52044\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef52044 \">image 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F79257%7EOBGYN%2F59703%7EOBGYN%2F72507\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef79257 graphicRef59703 graphicRef72507 \">image 2A-C</a>). The abnormal position should persist over time and despite motion of the foot, since a fetus can temporarily turn its foot into a position simulating clubfoot. In addition, the foot should be visualized away from the uterine wall. Three-dimensional ultrasound, if available, can provide a clear image, but is not essential for diagnosis (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F78391\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef78391 \">image 3</a>).</p><p>When clubfoot is suspected, the sonographer should perform a complete anatomic survey, fetal echocardiogram, and evaluate the intrauterine environment specifically looking for fetal compression or crowding by fibroids, amniotic bands, or synechiae. The presence of both polyhydramnios and clubfoot suggests a central neurologic abnormality that has affected lower limb movement and swallowing.</p><p>Prenatal detection of clubfoot is higher when the condition is bilateral or associated with other anomalies. As an example, in a series of children with isolated clubfoot, accurate prenatal diagnosis was twice as likely when the condition was bilateral <span class=\"nowrap\">(34/74)</span> compared to unilateral <span class=\"nowrap\">(17/73)</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prenatal-diagnosis-of-talipes-equinovarus-clubfoot/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. In another study, no fetus with clubfoot was missed when there were associated congenital abnormalities (see below) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prenatal-diagnosis-of-talipes-equinovarus-clubfoot/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>].</p><p>Prenatal detection of clubfoot has improved in the past decade, up to 80 percent of cases are detected prenatally [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prenatal-diagnosis-of-talipes-equinovarus-clubfoot/abstract/15,16\" class=\"abstract_t\">15,16</a>]. This is related to better equipment, expertise, and increased sonographic screening throughout pregnancy. Imperfect midtrimester prenatal diagnosis does not necessarily represent poor sensitivity of ultrasound; instead, it can be due to disease progression during the second half of pregnancy in conditions that affect fetal neuromuscular development or the progressive effect of long-term immobility on the flexibility of the joint. False positive rates as high as 40 percent have been reported for diagnosis of isolated clubfoot [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prenatal-diagnosis-of-talipes-equinovarus-clubfoot/abstract/2,17\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,17</a>]. This is typically due to the ability and inclination of a normal fetus to adduct its foot.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Associated abnormalities</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Associated abnormalities are observed in at least 10 percent of live born cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prenatal-diagnosis-of-talipes-equinovarus-clubfoot/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>], which is expected since clubfoot often occurs as part of a syndrome. Over 50 syndromes include clubfoot as a frequent or occasional finding. The prevalence of associated abnormalities is higher in prenatally ascertained cases. As an example, review of a large database of over 14,000 patients who underwent prenatal ultrasonography found 67 percent of fetuses with clubfoot had associated anomalies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prenatal-diagnosis-of-talipes-equinovarus-clubfoot/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. Others have reported associated anomaly rates of 33 to 80 percent; the wide range may be related to the population studied (community versus tertiary care hospital) or advances in ultrasound equipment over time [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prenatal-diagnosis-of-talipes-equinovarus-clubfoot/abstract/15,19-22\" class=\"abstract_t\">15,19-22</a>].</p><p>Bilateral clubfoot is not associated with a greater risk of associated anomalies than unilateral clubfoot [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prenatal-diagnosis-of-talipes-equinovarus-clubfoot/abstract/20,23\" class=\"abstract_t\">20,23</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h1\">OBSTETRICAL MANAGEMENT</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h2\">Counseling</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Findings on ultrasound examination and their significance should be discussed with the patient, including information on treatment options (eg, surgical procedures, serial casting, observation) and prognosis. Referral to a genetic counselor and pediatrician or orthopedist who can discuss postnatal management issues can be useful. However, the severity of clubfoot and the need for postnatal surgery are difficult to predict prenatally [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prenatal-diagnosis-of-talipes-equinovarus-clubfoot/abstract/22,24,25\" class=\"abstract_t\">22,24,25</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h2\">Fetal genetic studies</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Determination of fetal karyotype is recommended if there are additional anatomic abnormalities or other indications for invasive prenatal diagnoses (eg, suspected open neural tube defect) since these pregnancies are considered at higher risk of fetal karyotype abnormality. In one large series, aneuploidy was detected prenatally in 15 of 49 fetuses with clubfoot associated with other structural anomalies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prenatal-diagnosis-of-talipes-equinovarus-clubfoot/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=congenital-cytogenetic-abnormalities#H7\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Congenital cytogenetic abnormalities&quot;, section on 'Fetuses with congenital anomalies'</a>.)</p><p>There is no consensus as to whether amniocentesis should be offered when the only indication for karyotyping is an isolated clubfoot (unilateral or bilateral). The argument against routine karyotyping of fetuses with isolated clubfoot is that the risks associated with amniocentesis may be greater than the risk of an abnormal karyotype, and cost. A literature review including 13 studies found 8 cases of aneuploidy among 463 cases of isolated clubfoot (1.7 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prenatal-diagnosis-of-talipes-equinovarus-clubfoot/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. The karyotype abnormalities were 47 XXY (two cases), trisomy 21 (two cases), 47 XYY (two cases), trisomy 18 (one case), 47 XXX (1 case). The fact that the largest of the studies consisted of only 68 fetuses with isolated clubfoot limits our ability to make a confident assessment of the risk of karyotypic abnormalities in these cases and suggests the underlying risk of chromosome anomalies among isolated clubfoot remains to be determined.</p><p>Though mutations in PITX1 are not a common cause of isolated clubfoot, recurrent chromosome 17q23 copy number variants (CNV) involving TBX4, are responsible for about 5 percent of all patients with familial isolated clubfoot [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prenatal-diagnosis-of-talipes-equinovarus-clubfoot/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. Chromosomal microarray (CMA) can detect chromosome 17q23 CNV, which can be clinically significant for their possible association with both severe, treatment-refractory clubfoot and hip dysplasia.<strong> </strong>Emerging data support use of whole exome sequencing (WES) for evaluation of isolated anomalies, such as clubfoot, on ultrasound [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prenatal-diagnosis-of-talipes-equinovarus-clubfoot/abstract/26,27\" class=\"abstract_t\">26,27</a>]. Few data support the use of whole genome sequencing (WGS) in isolated clubfoot as WGS is more time consuming, uncovers more variants of unknown significance, and is generally only available in research settings. A case report described use of whole genome sequencing to identify mutations in familial club foot [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prenatal-diagnosis-of-talipes-equinovarus-clubfoot/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>].</p><p>In our practice, we offer prenatal karyotyping and CMA for isolated clubfoot because there have been numerous reports of karyotypically abnormal infants who were not suspected prenatally because ultrasound failed to detect associated abnormalities that were present. In one such report, 19 percent of fetuses with isolated clubfoot at 18 to 23 weeks of gestation were found to have associated anomalies on a subsequent ultrasound examination [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prenatal-diagnosis-of-talipes-equinovarus-clubfoot/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. In other reports, 6 of 142 infants (4.2 percent) and 7 of 63 infants (11.1 percent) believed to have isolated clubfoot prenatally were found to have associated malformations at birth [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prenatal-diagnosis-of-talipes-equinovarus-clubfoot/abstract/23,29\" class=\"abstract_t\">23,29</a>]. In addition, the reliability of the low estimate of risk of chromosomal abnormality is limited by the small number of cases in the reports.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h2\">Antenatal and intrapartum care</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The prenatal diagnosis of isolated clubfoot does not alter antenatal or intrapartum maternal care.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h1\">TREATMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There are no prenatal treatments.
