Subacute invasive pulmonary aspergillosis (formerly known as chronic necrotizing pulmonary aspergillosis) is on the spectrum between chronic and acute forms of pulmonary aspergillosis (see <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Definitions'</a> below). A duration of disease longer than three months distinguishes chronic pulmonary aspergillosis from acute and subacute invasive pulmonary aspergillosis.</p><p>The treatment of chronic pulmonary aspergillosis will be reviewed here. The pathophysiology, clinical manifestations, and diagnosis of chronic pulmonary aspergillosis are discussed separately; the treatment of allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis and invasive aspergillosis are also reviewed elsewhere.

However, the terminology that has been developed can be difficult to apply to a spectrum of disease entities that have considerable overlap and variation in severity. The following terminology will be used to describe the spectrum of disease; each entity is characterized by specific radiographic findings [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-chronic-pulmonary-aspergillosis/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Aspergilloma</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>An aspergilloma is a fungus ball composed of <em>Aspergillus</em> hyphae, fibrin, mucus, and cellular debris found within a pulmonary cavity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-chronic-pulmonary-aspergillosis/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Aspergillomas arise in preexisting pulmonary cavities that have become colonized with <em>Aspergillus</em> spp or develop in chronic cavitary pulmonary aspergillosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-chronic-pulmonary-aspergillosis/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p>If the aspergilloma is single, the cavity stable over months, and the patient has few symptoms (ie, a mild cough only) and little evidence of systemic inflammation, a simple aspergilloma may be diagnosed. We will use the term &quot;simple aspergilloma&quot; to distinguish this entity from the more complex forms of chronic pulmonary aspergillosis. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diagnosis-of-invasive-aspergillosis#H1064486416\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Diagnosis of invasive aspergillosis&quot;, section on 'Diagnostic modalities'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1776139\"><span class=\"h2\">Aspergillus nodule</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span><em>Aspergillus</em> nodules occur in immunocompetent hosts, may be single or multiple, and may or may not have cavitation within them [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-chronic-pulmonary-aspergillosis/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. The differential diagnosis includes lung cancer and coccidioidal nodules. Patients are usually asymptomatic or have a new minor pulmonary symptom such as cough or may have an incidental chest infection or an exacerbation of asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Using positron emission tomography (PET) scanning, <em>Aspergillus</em> nodules are fluorodeoxyglucose avid to variable degrees [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-chronic-pulmonary-aspergillosis/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>] and are usually accompanied by a raised <em>Aspergillus</em> immunoglobulin (Ig)G titer. On histopathology, necrosis is surrounded by granulomatous inflammation with occasional multinucleate giant cells [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-chronic-pulmonary-aspergillosis/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. The center of the necrotic material contains fungal hyphae.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Chronic cavitary pulmonary aspergillosis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The term &quot;chronic cavitary pulmonary aspergillosis&quot; describes a pattern of disease in immunocompetent patients in whom there is formation and expansion of one or more pulmonary cavities over months (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F54038\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef54038 \">image 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F65409\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef65409 \">image 2</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F77208\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef77208 \">image 3</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F56179\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef56179 \">image 4</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-chronic-pulmonary-aspergillosis/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. This term is preferred over the older term &quot;complex aspergilloma&quot; because more than 70 percent of such patients don't have an aspergilloma visible radiographically. Approximately 90 percent of patients with chronic cavitary pulmonary aspergillosis have <em>Aspergillus</em> IgG antibodies in the blood. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-chronic-pulmonary-aspergillosis#H15\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of chronic pulmonary aspergillosis&quot;, section on 'Radiographic features'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-chronic-pulmonary-aspergillosis#H16\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of chronic pulmonary aspergillosis&quot;, section on 'Laboratory findings'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Chronic fibrosing pulmonary aspergillosis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Chronic fibrosing pulmonary aspergillosis is a late-stage manifestation of chronic cavitary pulmonary aspergillosis in which progression to marked and extensive lung fibrosis has occurred, sometimes called &quot;destroyed lung&quot; [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-chronic-pulmonary-aspergillosis/abstract/1,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,6</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Subacute invasive pulmonary aspergillosis (chronic necrotizing pulmonary aspergillosis)</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients with some degree of immunocompromise who present with progressive features over one to three months have subacute invasive pulmonary aspergillosis. Hyphal invasion of tissue is observed histologically or can be inferred based upon radiographic findings, including cavitation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-chronic-pulmonary-aspergillosis/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Such patients usually have a single thin-walled cavity or area of cavitating <span class=\"nowrap\">pneumonia/consolidation</span> and may have detectable <em>Aspergillus</em> antigen (galactomannan) or <em>Aspergillus</em> IgG antibodies (precipitins) in blood.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h1\">APPROACH TO THERAPY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Since chronic pulmonary aspergillosis represents a spectrum of disease, and the risks and benefits of medical and surgical therapy vary with the manifestations of disease and the patient's pulmonary status, the approach to therapy must be individualized. These recommendations generally follow those of the 2016 European Society of Clinical Microbiology and Infectious Diseases and European Respiratory Society guidelines on chronic pulmonary aspergillosis and the 2016 Infectious Diseases Society of America aspergillosis guidelines [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-chronic-pulmonary-aspergillosis/abstract/7,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,8</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Aspergilloma</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Data regarding the treatment of a simple aspergilloma are limited to extensive case series over decades and case reports [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-chronic-pulmonary-aspergillosis/abstract/7-10\" class=\"abstract_t\">7-10</a>]. Surgical resection is offered in order to prevent or treat potentially life-threatening hemoptysis and is usually curative [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-chronic-pulmonary-aspergillosis/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. In patients with good respiratory function, no other significant contraindications to thoracotomy, and disease limited to one lobe, the 30-day operative mortality is &lt;5 percent and, in recent series, &lt;1 percent at centers that have substantial experience with this disease. Recurrent infection, inability to take azole therapy, azole resistance, and concurrent infection or tumor represent additional indications for surgical resection but carry greater risk. Embolization is appropriate in selected patients and may be used before surgery to stabilize the patient. Pre- and postoperative antifungal therapy (usually <a href=\"topic.htm?path=voriconazole-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">voriconazole</a>) is appropriate to minimize the risk of postoperative pleural aspergillosis, in case the cavity is opened inadvertently during surgery, leading to spillage. (See <a href=\"#H18\" class=\"local\">'Surgery'</a> below and <a href=\"#H19\" class=\"local\">'Embolization'</a> below.)</p><p>Antifungal therapy provides limited benefit for the treatment of a simple aspergilloma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-chronic-pulmonary-aspergillosis/abstract/12-15\" class=\"abstract_t\">12-15</a>]. As an example, in a study that included 14 patients with aspergilloma who were treated with oral <a href=\"topic.htm?path=itraconazole-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">itraconazole</a> for an average of 7 months (range 2 to 13 months), two patients were considered to be cured based upon the absence of symptoms and the development of scarring of the initial radiographic abnormalities; eight patients had significant clinical improvement despite a lack of radiographic improvement [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-chronic-pulmonary-aspergillosis/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. However, two patients had no clinical or radiographic response, and two patients had clinical and radiographic worsening. Instillation of amphotericin B into a cavity has sometimes been effective. (See <a href=\"#H20\" class=\"local\">'Investigational approaches'</a> below.)</p><p>Many patients, such as those who are asymptomatic and have stable radiographic findings over many months, require no therapy. However, progression to chronic cavitary pulmonary aspergillosis, sometimes with extensive fibrosis, is common and can occur silently, so continued observation is required. Spontaneous resolution of the aspergilloma occurs in fewer than 10 percent of patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-chronic-pulmonary-aspergillosis/abstract/16,17\" class=\"abstract_t\">16,17</a>]. Antifungal therapy for a single aspergilloma is reserved for patients who are unable to undergo surgery but require therapy for symptoms or radiologic progression or because they are immunocompromised. The choice of antifungal agent is similar to that for chronic cavitary pulmonary aspergillosis, which is discussed below.</p><p>Low-dose computed tomography is the imaging mode of choice and has the benefit of minimizing the radiation dose. There is no agreed-upon frequency of repeat imaging, but every 6 to 12 months is reasonable in immunocompromised patients and less often in immunocompetent patients. New symptoms, especially hemoptysis, are an indication for additional imaging and a search for other infectious agents. A persistently rising <em>Aspergillus</em> immunoglobulin (Ig)G titer suggests treatment failure.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1776169\"><span class=\"h2\">Aspergillus nodule</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients with incidentally resected <em>Aspergillus</em> nodules, initially thought to be carcinoma of the lung [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-chronic-pulmonary-aspergillosis/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>], should not receive antifungal therapy unless symptomatic but should be followed up with appropriate imaging and <em>Aspergillus</em> antibody titers for months or years to detect relapse of active infection. Patients with nodules that develop in the context of allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis (ABPA) or severe asthma may derive improvement of their asthma control with antifungal therapy. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-allergic-bronchopulmonary-aspergillosis#H1410588810\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis&quot;, section on 'Antifungal therapy'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h2\">Chronic cavitary pulmonary aspergillosis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In contrast with patients with a simple aspergilloma, the vast majority of patients with chronic cavitary pulmonary aspergillosis and chronic fibrosing pulmonary aspergillosis require antifungal therapy. Only asymptomatic patients with radiographically and serologically stable disease, as determined over many months, do not require therapy. Embolization is indicated to prevent or treat hemoptysis. Surgical outcomes are not as good as those for single aspergillomas.

Among 17 patients with chronic pulmonary aspergillosis, the majority of whom had chronic cavitary pulmonary aspergillosis, initial therapy with itraconazole resulted in improvement or stabilization of disease in 12 patients (71 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-chronic-pulmonary-aspergillosis/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. The duration of therapy ranged from 12 days to over 10 years. In a three-center prospective series of 29 patients, 44 percent responded [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-chronic-pulmonary-aspergillosis/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. In a trial that included 31 patients with chronic cavitary pulmonary aspergillosis, patients were randomly assigned to receive either itraconazole 400 mg daily plus supportive therapy or supportive therapy alone for six months [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-chronic-pulmonary-aspergillosis/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. Compared with patients who received supportive care only, patients who received itraconazole plus supportive care had a greater likelihood of clinical improvement (35 versus 7 percent) or stabilization (41 versus 29 percent) and a lower likelihood of clinical worsening (24 versus 64 percent). Using the St George's Respiratory Questionnaire, quality of life in patients with chronic cavitary pulmonary aspergillosis receiving itraconazole was improved in 56 percent at 3 months but in only 40 percent by 12 months [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-chronic-pulmonary-aspergillosis/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>].</p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=voriconazole-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Voriconazole</a> has been studied in three prospective studies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-chronic-pulmonary-aspergillosis/abstract/27-29\" class=\"abstract_t\">27-29</a>], involving a total of 165 patients, as well as in other collected series [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-chronic-pulmonary-aspergillosis/abstract/18-20,22,25\" class=\"abstract_t\">18-20,22,25</a>].

The overall response rate at six months was 32 percent, with better responses in patients with subacute invasive pulmonary aspergillosis (formerly known as chronic necrotizing pulmonary aspergillosis) than in those with chronic cavitary pulmonary aspergillosis. In a multicenter study in Japan, 61 percent responded well, with only two patients stopping therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-chronic-pulmonary-aspergillosis/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. In another study of over 12 months of observation, quality of life in patients treated with voriconazole was improved in 30 percent at 3 months and in 43 percent by 12 months [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-chronic-pulmonary-aspergillosis/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. In a study in Italy, 6 of 21 patients could not tolerate voriconazole, and 9 (42.9 percent) had improved significantly at 12 months [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-chronic-pulmonary-aspergillosis/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>].

The decision as to which agent to use should be based on tolerability, costs, and possible drug interactions. The efficacy of these agents is discussed above.

The guidelines also state that, in those with progressive disease, long-term, even lifelong, antifungal therapy may be necessary. In our experience, many patients with chronic cavitary or chronic fibrosing pulmonary aspergillosis require lifelong antifungal therapy, whereas <em>Aspergillus</em> nodules may or may not need to be treated indefinitely. Six months of antifungal therapy is often adequate for patients with subacute invasive pulmonary aspergillosis, but a longer duration is necessary in those with ongoing immunosuppression or a poor response to therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-chronic-pulmonary-aspergillosis/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].</p><p>Data are limited, but relapse is common if treatment is discontinued in patients with chronic cavitary or chronic fibrosing pulmonary aspergillosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-chronic-pulmonary-aspergillosis/abstract/1,38\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,38</a>]; 14 of 39 (36 percent) patients relapsed in one series [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-chronic-pulmonary-aspergillosis/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>] and 30 percent relapsed in another [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-chronic-pulmonary-aspergillosis/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>].

Fungal cultures should be obtained during surgery and susceptibility testing performed on isolates (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=antifungal-susceptibility-testing\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Antifungal susceptibility testing&quot;</a>).</p><p>Spillage of the contents of a cavity containing <em>Aspergillus</em> is a risk factor for development of an <em>Aspergillus</em> empyema; local washout of the pleura with amphotericin B or taurolidine 2% may be useful when this occurs, although the efficacy of this approach remains unproven [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-chronic-pulmonary-aspergillosis/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H19\"><span class=\"h2\">Embolization</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In patients with moderate or severe hemoptysis who are too ill to undergo surgery or who have extensive disease, embolization may be appropriate. Most instances of hemoptysis are caused by abnormal and novel vascular connections to the systemic circulation in proximity to the affected area (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F54038\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef54038 \">image 1</a>). Usually this is the bronchial circulation, but it may be any of the other arteries supplying the chest (eg, intercostal, subclavian, or internal mammary arteries). Otherwise, asymptomatic patients with aspergillomas may have an extensive network of small vessels and can develop hemoptysis. Several abnormal connections may exist in a single patient. The objective of embolization is to permanently occlude these vessels.</p><p>Patients with a communication between an intercostal and the anterior spinal artery can undergo embolization safely only if the catheter is introduced well past the anterior spinal artery. These patients require a skilled interventional radiologist, and the patient has to lie supine for two to four hours during the procedure.</p><p>Depending on the radiologist, approximately 50 to 90 percent of embolization procedures are successful [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-chronic-pulmonary-aspergillosis/abstract/62-64\" class=\"abstract_t\">62-64</a>]. However, rebleeding occurs in 30 to 50 percent of patients over three years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-chronic-pulmonary-aspergillosis/abstract/65,66\" class=\"abstract_t\">65,66</a>]; relapse can be minimized with successful long-term antifungal therapy. Complications include local pain, stroke, and chest wall or spinal cord infarction as well as reactions to the contrast dye.

It is widely used throughout the United Kingdom for hemoptysis. Tranexamic acid increases infarction potential, and a low rate of strokes has been reported after its use. It is sometimes not well tolerated, with gastrointestinal upset being the most common adverse effect.</p><p>The use of computed tomography&ndash;guided intracavitary instillation of amphotericin B has been attempted in some patients with inoperable aspergillomas. In one report, this procedure was performed in 40 inoperable cases of hemoptysis due to aspergilloma; the aspergilloma disappeared in 23 cases, and the cavity also disappeared in three [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-chronic-pulmonary-aspergillosis/abstract/67\" class=\"abstract_t\">67</a>]. Daily instillation of amphotericin B (50 mg in 20 mL dextrose) into a cavity through a catheter benefited some patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-chronic-pulmonary-aspergillosis/abstract/68\" class=\"abstract_t\">68</a>]. Spillage of amphotericin B into the bronchial tree can be problematic for patients with poor respiratory reserve.

In such patients, adequate nutrition to maintain weight, avoidance or treatment of depression, and oxygen for hypoxic patients are helpful. In those with recurrent or continuous infection (bronchiectasis), intermittent or long-term antibiotic therapy is often helpful.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2916263914\"><span class=\"h2\">Glucocorticoids</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients who are not doing well may benefit from glucocorticoids. There are no data on dose or duration for this indication.

Subacute invasive pulmonary aspergillosis (formerly known as chronic necrotizing aspergillosis) is on the spectrum between chronic and acute forms of pulmonary aspergillosis. A duration of disease longer than three months distinguishes chronic pulmonary aspergillosis from acute and subacute pulmonary aspergillosis. (See <a href=\"#H1\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above and <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Definitions'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Chronic pulmonary aspergillosis represents a spectrum of disease; the risks and benefits of medical and surgical therapy vary with the manifestations of disease and the patient's pulmonary status, and, thus, the approach to therapy must be individualized.

We suggest antifungal therapy for patients who have progressive radiographic findings <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> symptoms and who are unable to undergo surgery (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). We also suggest antifungal agents for adjunctive therapy following surgical resection, particularly if there is concern about concomitant tissue invasion by <em>Aspergillus</em> spp (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>).

Voriconazole should be administered as 200 mg twice daily. Itraconazole should be administered as 200 mg orally twice daily. Serum drug concentrations should be monitored initially to optimize dose and preparation. For those who are severely ill, intravenous therapy may be needed initially. Voriconazole (4 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> twice daily), <a href=\"topic.htm?path=micafungin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">micafungin</a> (150 mg daily), or amphotericin B (3 to 5 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> daily for a lipid formulation or 1 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> daily for the deoxycholate formulation) can be used.

For those with progressive disease, long-term, even lifelong antifungal therapy may be necessary. In our experience, many patients with chronic cavitary or chronic fibrosing pulmonary aspergillosis require lifelong antifungal therapy, whereas <em>Aspergillus</em> nodules and subacute invasive pulmonary aspergillosis may or may not need to be treated indefinitely. Six months of antifungal therapy is often adequate for patients with subacute invasive pulmonary aspergillosis, but a longer duration is necessary in those with ongoing immunosuppression or progression of disease.
