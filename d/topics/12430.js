These disorders were previously thought to be unrelated [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-igg4-related-disease/abstract/3-5\" class=\"abstract_t\">3-5</a>]. The commonly shared features include tumor-like swelling of involved organs, a lymphoplasmacytic infiltrate enriched in IgG4-positive plasma cells, and a variable degree of fibrosis that has a characteristic &ldquo;storiform&rdquo; pattern (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RHEUM%2F76767\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef76767 \">picture 1</a>). In addition, elevated serum concentrations of IgG4 are found in 60 to 70 percent of patients with IgG4-RD.</p><p>The majority of patients respond to glucocorticoids, particularly in early stages of disease. In some subsets of organ disease (eg, pancreatitis), glucocorticoid responsiveness has been considered one diagnostic criterion for the disorder. However, many patients experience recurrent disease during or after glucocorticoid tapers, and the morbidity from glucocorticoids is substantial.</p><p>Major presentations of this protean condition, which often affects more than one organ, include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Type 1 (IgG4-related) autoimmune pancreatitis (AIP).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Salivary gland disease, which can present as major salivary gland enlargement or as sclerosing sialadenitis. The constellation of lacrimal, parotid, and submandibular gland enlargement was formerly termed Mikulicz disease (or Mikulicz syndrome). Isolated submandibular gland swelling was termed K&uuml;ttner&rsquo;s tumor.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Orbital disease, often complicated by proptosis because of lacrimal gland enlargement, involvement of the extraocular muscles, or other orbital pseudotumor.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Retroperitoneal fibrosis, which frequently occurs in the larger context of chronic periaortitis and can often affect the ureters, leading to hydronephrosis and renal injury.</p><p/><p>The preferred name for the overall condition is IgG4-related disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-igg4-related-disease/abstract/6,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,7</a>]. However, multiple names have been employed to describe this entity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-igg4-related-disease/abstract/4,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,5</a>].

Type 1 autoimmune pancreatitis (AIP, IgG4-related pancreatitis) and IgG4-related sclerosing cholangitis are discussed in detail separately (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=autoimmune-pancreatitis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Autoimmune pancreatitis&quot;</a>), as are several of the other conditions associated with this disorder. (See appropriate topic reviews.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4739538\"><span class=\"h1\">DEFINITION AND HISTOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The hallmarks of immunoglobulin G4-related disease (IgG4-RD) are dense lymphoplasmacytic infiltrations with a predominance of IgG4-positive plasma cells in the affected tissue, usually accompanied by fibrosis and most of the time by obliterative phlebitis and increased number of eosinophils [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-igg4-related-disease/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. Serum IgG4 levels are elevated (&gt;135 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL)</span> in about two-thirds of the patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-igg4-related-disease/abstract/9,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,10</a>], while a sizeable minority of patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-igg4-related-disease/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>] have normal serum IgG4 concentrations even before treatment, despite the presence of the typical histopathological changes in tissue [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-igg4-related-disease/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. A good initial therapeutic response to glucocorticoids is characteristic, particularly if excessive tissue fibrosis has not supervened [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-igg4-related-disease/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>].</p><p>The fibrosis associated with IgG4-RD has a characteristic &ldquo;storiform&rdquo; pattern, typified by a cartwheel appearance of the arranged fibroblasts and inflammatory cells (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RHEUM%2F76767\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef76767 \">picture 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RHEUM%2F93427\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef93427 \">picture 2</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-igg4-related-disease/abstract/9,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,14</a>]. Modest tissue eosinophilia is also common (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RHEUM%2F93429\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef93429 \">image 1</a>).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11899448\"><span class=\"h1\">EPIDEMIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Immunoglobulin G4-related disease (IgG4-RD) generally occurs most commonly in middle-aged and older men. This is certainly true for conditions such as type 1 (IgG4-related) autoimmune pancreatitis (AIP), retroperitoneal fibrosis, IgG4-related tubulointerstitial nephritis (TIN), and many other organ manifestations. However, the sex distribution differs somewhat with regard to patients with involvement of organs of the head and neck. As examples, in patients with IgG4-related sialadenitis and IgG4-related ophthalmic disease, males and females appear to be affected more equally [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-igg4-related-disease/abstract/4,15,16\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,15,16</a>].</p><p>In a study of 114 patients with IgG4-RD, those with involvement limited to one of several regions (head and neck, thoracic, hepatopancreatobiliary, and retroperitoneal) and those with systemic involvement (more than one region) were compared with respect to various demographic and clinical features; the ages of patients in all groups were similar, with means from 59 to 68 years (ranges 42 to 79) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-igg4-related-disease/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. All the groups, other than the patients with head and neck involvement, were predominantly men (75 to 86 percent), but the group with only head and neck disease was nearly equally divided (48 percent men).</p><p>Beyond these general statements, the epidemiology of IgG4-RD requires further definition. Initially, study of the condition suffered from a lack of definitions, incomplete nomenclature, and underrecognition among clinicians and pathologists. These deficits are gradually being overcome and should facilitate more complete understanding of the disease epidemiology.</p><p>Although the disease occurs more commonly in men, disease extent and severity appear to be similar in men and women. In a series of 125 patients with biopsy-proven IgG4-RD, the number of organs involved, the degree of serum IgG4 elevation, and damage from IgG4-RD did not differ between male and female patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-igg4-related-disease/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H365938\"><span class=\"h1\">PATHOGENESIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The pathogenesis of immunoglobulin G4-related disease (IgG4-RD) is poorly understood; findings consistent with both an autoimmune disorder and an allergic disorder are present [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-igg4-related-disease/abstract/9,17-23\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,17-23</a>]. IgG4 has been postulated to have a role in tolerance to allergens and in responses to certain infectious agents, but its physiologic role is poorly understood. A specific autoantigenic target has not been identified, and it is not clear whether the IgG4 antibodies are pathogenic [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-igg4-related-disease/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. An emerging consensus holds that the IgG4 antibodies in this disease are not pathogenic, but rather represent a down-regulatory response to another primary process(es) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-igg4-related-disease/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. Elevations in serum and tissue IgG4 concentrations are not specific to IgG4-RD; they are also found in disorders such as multicentric Castleman&rsquo;s disease, allergic disorders, eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis (Churg-Strauss), sarcoidosis, and a large number of other conditions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-igg4-related-disease/abstract/26,27\" class=\"abstract_t\">26,27</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=igg-subclass-deficiency#H9\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;IgG subclass deficiency&quot;, section on 'IgG4 deficiency'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=igg-subclasses-physical-properties-genetics-and-biologic-functions#H2\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;IgG subclasses: Physical properties, genetics, and biologic functions&quot;, section on 'Properties of IgG subclasses'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diagnostic-evaluation-of-food-allergy#H17\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Diagnostic evaluation of food allergy&quot;, section on 'Unvalidated methods'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=igg-subclasses-physical-properties-genetics-and-biologic-functions#H3397374\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;IgG subclasses: Physical properties, genetics, and biologic functions&quot;, section on 'Disorders with elevated subclass levels'</a>.)</p><p>Findings in IgG4-RD suggesting autoimmunity have been particularly evident in patients with type 1 (IgG4-related) autoimmune pancreatitis (AIP), the prototypic IgG4-related disorder, including an association with a specific class II histocompatibility antigen genotype [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-igg4-related-disease/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. Antinuclear antibodies and rheumatoid factors are sometimes present [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-igg4-related-disease/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>], and autoantibodies have been described against lactoferrin and carbonic anhydrase II. Some studies have suggested a possible role for molecular mimicry involving <em>Helicobacter pylori</em> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-igg4-related-disease/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. Immune complex deposition in the pancreas, kidneys, and certain other affected tissues has been reported [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-igg4-related-disease/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. However, autoantibody studies have been inconsistent, and there is no definitive evidence for a role of autoimmunity in this disease. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=autoimmune-pancreatitis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Autoimmune pancreatitis&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Evidence for an allergic response includes elevated levels of Th2 cytokines in affected tissues and increased amounts of serum IgE [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-igg4-related-disease/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. In addition, patients with IgG4-RD have an increased prevalence of allergic rhinitis and bronchial asthma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-igg4-related-disease/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. There are increased numbers of T regulatory cells (Tregs) in peripheral blood and increased levels of cytokines produced by Tregs, including interleukin (IL)-10 and transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta in affected tissues [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-igg4-related-disease/abstract/20,21\" class=\"abstract_t\">20,21</a>]. The Th2 cytokines, Tregs, and IL-10 help support IgG4 production [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-igg4-related-disease/abstract/21,29\" class=\"abstract_t\">21,29</a>]. Up to 40 percent of patients with IgG4-RD have a peripheral eosinophilia. However, two studies have demonstrated that circulating Th2 memory cells in IgG4-RD are restricted to a defined subset of subjects who have concomitant atopy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-igg4-related-disease/abstract/30,31\" class=\"abstract_t\">30,31</a>].</p><p>The identification of a CD4+ cytotoxic T cell in IgG4-RD appears to be an important step forward in understanding disease pathophysiology. CD4+ T-cells, the most abundant cells within affected tissues, are dispersed throughout IgG4-RD lesions. A clonally expanded population of CD4<sup>+</sup> cytotoxic T lymphocytes in both the peripheral blood and fibrotic lesions of IgG4-RD patients suggest that these cells are central to the disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-igg4-related-disease/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>]. These cytotoxic T cells make products such as granzyme B and perforin. Moreover, the IL-1, TGF-beta, and interferon-gamma elaborated by these cells are all potentially important mediators of the fibrosis that forms such a dominant part of histopathology in IgG4-RD. The CD4+ cytotoxic T cells have SLAMF7, a molecule not previously described on T cells, on their surface. The SLAMF7 molecule has previously been described only on cells of the B-cell lineage. </p><p>Taken together, this information suggests the hypothesis that the CD4+ cytotoxic T cells orchestrating the disease are sustained by continuous antigen presentation by B cells and plasmablasts [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-igg4-related-disease/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>]. A T-follicular helper cell response that is separate from the CD4+ cytotoxic T lymphocytes is likely to be responsible for the development of germinal centers within lymph nodes (and involved organs) and the production of cytokines (eg, IL-4) that drive the IgG4 class-switch, culminating in the creation of IgG4-secreting plasmablasts and long-lived plasma cells. B-cell depletion often does not lead to the complete normalization of serum IgG4 concentrations even after clinical remission, implying that long-lived plasma cells continue to make this immunoglobulin (and supporting the argument, furthermore, that IgG4 itself does not drive the disease).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H16601923\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL MANIFESTATIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Immunoglobulin G4-related disease (IgG4-RD) can involve one or multiple organs. Patients often present with subacute development of a mass in the affected organ (eg, an orbital pseudotumor, a renal mass resembling renal cell carcinoma, nodular lesions in the lung) or diffuse enlargement of an organ (eg, the pancreas) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-igg4-related-disease/abstract/1,4,33\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,4,33</a>]. Multiple organs are affected in 60 to 90 percent of patients with IgG4-RD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-igg4-related-disease/abstract/5,34\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,34</a>]. The affected tissues share particular pathologic features, although some of them, such as storiform fibrosis, are not so commonly encountered in tissues like salivary glands and lymph nodes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-igg4-related-disease/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].</p><p>Lymphadenopathy is common, and symptoms of asthma or allergy are present in approximately 40 percent of patients. Patients often feel well at the time of diagnosis and generally lack fever [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-igg4-related-disease/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. However, patients with multiorgan disease often lose substantial amounts of weight&mdash;20 to 30 pounds (about 9 to 14 kg) over months&mdash;before the correct diagnosis is identified. Clinicians should also be alert to the possibility that IgG4-RD can mimic autoimmune rheumatic diseases such as systemic lupus erythematosus, Sj&ouml;gren&rsquo;s syndrome (SS), or granulomatosis with polyangiitis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-igg4-related-disease/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>]. IgG4-RD is often recognized incidentally based upon a radiologic finding or histopathologic examination of a tissue specimen.</p><p>IgG4-RD has been viewed as uncommon, but manifestations of this disease are now increasingly recognized in nearly every organ system [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-igg4-related-disease/abstract/1,2,11,36\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2,11,36</a>]. Many of the initial observations regarding this condition were made in patients with autoimmune pancreatitis (AIP), which often presents as a pancreatic mass or as painless obstructive jaundice, and can be mistaken for pancreatic cancer. Additional reports have focused on patients with lacrimal and salivary gland involvement, formerly termed Mikulicz disease (or Mikulicz syndrome), which was once thought to be a subset of SS (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RHEUM%2F56827\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef56827 \">picture 3</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-igg4-related-disease/abstract/4,33\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,33</a>]. Such patients may present, for example, with prominent parotid or submandibular gland enlargement. The terms IgG4-related dacryoadenitis and IgG4-related sialadenitis are now used in place of Mikulicz disease. IgG4-related dacryoadenitis and sialadenitis do not invariably occur together.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H250672027\"><span class=\"h2\">IgG4-RD associated disorders</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Previously described conditions that represent manifestations of IgG4-RD and the nomenclature, when not otherwise indicated, include [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-igg4-related-disease/abstract/4-6\" class=\"abstract_t\">4-6</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Type 1 (IgG4-related) AIP </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>IgG4-related sclerosing cholangitis</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Mikulicz disease (IgG4-related dacryoadenitis and sialadenitis)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Sclerosing sialadenitis (K&uuml;ttner&rsquo;s tumor, IgG4-related submandibular gland disease)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Inflammatory orbital pseudotumor (IgG4-related orbital inflammation or orbital inflammatory pseudotumor)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Chronic sclerosing dacryoadenitis (lacrimal gland enlargement, IgG4-related dacryoadenitis)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A subset of patients with &ldquo;idiopathic&rdquo; retroperitoneal fibrosis (Ormond&rsquo;s disease) and related disorders (IgG4-related retroperitoneal fibrosis, IgG4-related mesenteritis)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Chronic sclerosing aortitis and periaortitis (IgG4-related aortitis or periaortitis)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Riedel&rsquo;s thyroiditis (IgG4-related thyroid disease)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>IgG4-related interstitial pneumonitis and pulmonary inflammatory pseudotumors (IgG4-related respiratory disease)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>IgG4-related kidney disease (including tubulointerstitial nephritis [TIN] and membranous glomerulonephritis [GN] secondary to IgG4-RD)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>IgG4-related hypophysitis</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>IgG4-related pachymeningitis</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>IgG4-related midline destructive disease</p><p/><p>Estimates of the relative frequency of different manifestations depend upon the particular perspective of the index illness being studied. As an example, a study of patients with AIP found frequent extrapancreatic involvement, including hilar lymphadenopathy (80 percent), extrapancreatic bile duct lesions (74 percent), lacrimal and salivary gland lesions (39 percent), hypothyroidism (22 percent), and retroperitoneal fibrosis (13 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-igg4-related-disease/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>]. By contrast, AIP was found in only 17 percent of patients studied with IgG4-related lacrimal, parotid, or submandibular gland disease, and interstitial nephritis (17 percent) and interstitial pneumonitis (9 percent) were also seen among this group [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-igg4-related-disease/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H250672034\"><span class=\"h3\">Lymphadenopathy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Asymptomatic IgG4-related lymphadenopathy is common, occurring in 80 percent of patients with AIP [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-igg4-related-disease/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>]. Lymphadenopathy is usually observed together with other clinical or laboratory manifestations of the syndrome, but may be the initial or only manifestation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-igg4-related-disease/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>]. Biopsies of lymph nodes are often problematic to interpret with regard to the diagnosis of IgG4-RD because they seldom undergo the storiform fibrosis that is so highly characteristic of IgG4-RD, and large numbers of IgG4+ plasma cells can be found in multiple diseases in which IgG4-RD is not the diagnosis. Whenever possible, biopsy should be performed in organs other than lymph nodes for the purpose of establishing the diagnosis of IgG4-RD. (See <a href=\"#H447315093\" class=\"local\">'Diagnostic studies'</a> below.)</p><p>In a study of 114 patients with varied organ involvement, lymphadenopathy was present in 41 percent of patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-igg4-related-disease/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. Symptoms occasionally occur due to mass effect of the enlarging nodes; individual nodes are typically no more than 2 centimeters in diameter but may range up to 5 centimeters [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-igg4-related-disease/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>]. Multiple groups of lymph nodes are usually involved; the mediastinal, hilar, intraabdominal, and axillary are most common and can be readily seen upon scanning with gallium-67 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-igg4-related-disease/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>]. The lymphadenopathy is generally non-tender and the nodes themselves are rubbery rather than hard.</p><p>Five histologic patterns may be seen, which all feature abundant IgG4-positive cells; the majority have eosinophil infiltration [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-igg4-related-disease/abstract/9,40-42\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,40-42</a>].

IgG4-related lymphadenopathy is distinguished from these conditions by the modest lymph node enlargement, histologic distinctions on biopsy, lack of constitutional features, and the usually striking clinical response to glucocorticoids [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-igg4-related-disease/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].

The prevalence of this condition in Japan has been estimated to be 0.82 per 100,000 persons, but this is likely to be an underestimate as clinical recognition of this disorder is growing [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-igg4-related-disease/abstract/43,44\" class=\"abstract_t\">43,44</a>]. Two types of AIP have been distinguished; the form associated with IgG4-RD is type 1 AIP, also denoted as lymphoplasmacytic sclerosing pancreatitis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-igg4-related-disease/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>]. AIP is discussed in detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=autoimmune-pancreatitis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Autoimmune pancreatitis&quot;</a>.)</p><p>AIP has been estimated to account for 2 percent of patients with chronic pancreatitis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-igg4-related-disease/abstract/43\" class=\"abstract_t\">43</a>]. It often presents as a pancreatic mass or as painless obstructive jaundice and can be mistaken for pancreatic cancer. Some patients with type 1 AIP exhibit acute, recurrent, or chronic pancreatitis, and AIP is frequently associated with diabetes mellitus. Most patients have another concomitant IgG4-related condition, such as IgG4-related sclerosing cholangitis, lymphadenopathy, or salivary or lacrimal gland involvement. (See <a href=\"#H16601923\" class=\"local\">'Clinical manifestations'</a> above and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=autoimmune-pancreatitis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Autoimmune pancreatitis&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The differentiation of AIP from adenocarcinoma of the pancreas is sometimes difficult on the basis of clinical presentations. Painless jaundice, for example, is common to both. Many patients have undergone Whipple procedures out of concern for pancreatic cancer. IgG4-positive plasma cells can also be found in the diseased pancreatic tissue in these conditions, although to a lesser degree than in AIP. Elevated serum IgG4 levels (&gt;135 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL)</span> can also be seen in some patients with pancreatic cancer, although they are usually less than twice the upper limit of normal; thus, increased IgG4 serum levels alone cannot be used to exclude a diagnosis of pancreatic malignancy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-igg4-related-disease/abstract/45\" class=\"abstract_t\">45</a>]. Radiologic features of type I AIP include diffuse enlargement of the pancreas, leading to the descriptor &ldquo;sausage-shaped&rdquo; pancreas, and a halo of edema surrounding the organ. Both of these features are appreciated most readily on abdominal computerized tomographic (CT) scanning.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H16601937\"><span class=\"h2\">IgG4-related sclerosing cholangitis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A form of sclerosing cholangitis that is clinically distinct from primary sclerosing cholangitis may occur as part of the IgG4-RD. IgG4-related sclerosing cholangitis is the most frequent extrapancreatic manifestation of type 1 AIP (IgG4-related), present in over 70 percent of such patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-igg4-related-disease/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. It also rarely occurs in the absence of pancreatitis. Distinctions between primary sclerosing cholangitis and IgG4-related sclerosing cholangitis are crucial because of the drastically different prognoses in these conditions. Unfortunately, the clinical distinction between primary sclerosing cholangitis <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> cholangiocarcinoma and IgG4-related sclerosing cholangitis can be difficult because biopsies performed via endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) are seldom deep enough to define the histopathological features of IgG4-RD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-igg4-related-disease/abstract/21,46\" class=\"abstract_t\">21,46</a>]. Although clearly defined diagnostic criteria for IgG4-related sclerosing cholangitis are lacking, differentiation from primary sclerosing cholangitis is based upon tissue biopsy with infiltrates of IgG4+ plasma cells and severe interstitial fibrosis, increased IgG4 serum levels, and characteristic responsiveness to glucocorticoids. The presence of clinical manifestations of IgG4-RD in extra-biliary organs can also be an important clue to the presence of IgG4-RD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-igg4-related-disease/abstract/47,48\" class=\"abstract_t\">47,48</a>].</p><p>One study suggests that patients with cholangiocarcinoma, as opposed to IgG4-related sclerosing cholangitis, are more likely to present with obstructive jaundice, an enlarged pancreas, and lymphadenopathy. Cholangiocarcinoma patients also generally have higher serum bilirubin concentrations, higher levels of CA 19-9, and complete obstruction of the hilar or bile ducts as demonstrated by ERCP. A cutoff higher than the standard upper limit of normal for serum IgG4 concentrations (ie, &gt;135 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL)</span> may also be useful in distinguishing IgG4-RD from cholangiocarcinoma; the higher the serum IgG4 concentration, the greater the likelihood that the patient has IgG4-RD rather than a biliary tract malignancy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-igg4-related-disease/abstract/49\" class=\"abstract_t\">49</a>].

Conversely, AIP is detected in approximately 17 percent of patients presenting with sialadenitis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-igg4-related-disease/abstract/15,37\" class=\"abstract_t\">15,37</a>]. Sialadenitis often presents prior to AIP in patients who develop both conditions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-igg4-related-disease/abstract/57\" class=\"abstract_t\">57</a>]. Unlike AIP and other forms of IgG4-RD, patients with salivary and lacrimal involvement include comparable numbers of both men and women [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-igg4-related-disease/abstract/15,16\" class=\"abstract_t\">15,16</a>]. The pathologic findings in IgG4-related sialoadenitis and dacryoadenitis are typical of those in other patients with IgG4-RD, including the lymphoplasmacytic infiltrate with IgG4-positive cells. Fibrosis and obliterative phlebitis are sometimes present in tissue samples derived from submandibular glands and uncommon in those derived from labial minor salivary glands (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RHEUM%2F76311\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef76311 \">picture 4</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RHEUM%2F67582\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef67582 \">picture 5</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RHEUM%2F93430\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef93430 \">image 2</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RHEUM%2F93431\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef93431 \">image 3</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RHEUM%2F93432\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef93432 \">image 4</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RHEUM%2F93433\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef93433 \">image 5</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-igg4-related-disease/abstract/16,58\" class=\"abstract_t\">16,58</a>]. Increased IgG4 and IgE serum levels are also present. These histopathologic and laboratory findings distinguish IgG4-related sialadenitis from SS. Low complement levels may be seen in either condition and are particularly common among patients with concomitant renal involvement in IgG4-RD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-igg4-related-disease/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>].</p><p>Patients who fulfill criteria for both SS and IgG4-RD have been identified. Increased IgG4 serum levels <span class=\"nowrap\">(&gt;135mg/dL)</span> were present in 7.5 percent of a cohort of 133 patients with well-defined primary SS [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-igg4-related-disease/abstract/59\" class=\"abstract_t\">59</a>]. The patients with elevated levels of IgG4 displayed a higher frequency of IgG4-RD clinical features (autoimmune pancreatitis, autoimmune cholangitis, and interstitial nephritis) and lower rates of antinuclear, <span class=\"nowrap\">anti-Ro/SSA,</span> and <span class=\"nowrap\">anti-La/SSB</span> autoantibodies. In addition, 2.3 percent of patients studied had increased numbers of IgG4 (+) plasmacytes in labial minor salivary gland biopsies. Most of these patients probably represent IgG4-RD patients misclassified as having SS.</p><p>The clinical and laboratory features that characterize IgG4-related sialadenitis and also help to distinguish it from SS include [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-igg4-related-disease/abstract/52\" class=\"abstract_t\">52</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Fewer patients with dry mouth, dry eyes, or arthralgias (38, 33, and 16 percent versus 87, 94, and 48 percent, respectively).

Bilateral lacrimal gland involvement is typical, even though the onset of clinical disease in the two glands may be asynchronous. Concurrent salivary gland involvement is common. Histologic and serologic findings are similar to those seen in patients with sialadenitis and in other tissues.</p><p>IgG4-RD also appears to account for 25 to 50 percent of orbital pseudotumors, including those originally diagnosed, before recognition of IgG4-RD, as orbital benign lymphoid hyperplasia. Depending upon the diagnostic criteria used, IgG4-RD accounts for between about 5 and 25 percent of cases originally diagnosed as nongranulomatous idiopathic orbital inflammation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-igg4-related-disease/abstract/62\" class=\"abstract_t\">62</a>]. IgG4-RD is also recognized as a cause of orbital myositis (IgG4-related orbital myositis) and it is orbital myositis that leads most often to proptosis among patients with this disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-igg4-related-disease/abstract/63,64\" class=\"abstract_t\">63,64</a>]. </p><p>It is not certain whether IgG4-RD predisposes to the development of ocular adnexal mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT) lymphomas or other lymphomas.

IgG4-related retroperitoneal fibrosis is particularly likely to involve the infrarenal aorta and to simultaneously affect the iliac arteries. Chronic inflammatory and fibrotic change may be present and can involve regional tissues, such as the ureters, leading to obstructive uropathy.

However, identification and measurement of plasmablasts, particularly IgG4 plasmablasts are not widely available routinely. Patients with IgG4-RD who were untreated at the time their blood was sampled were found to have dramatic elevations of blood plasmablast concentrations.

Well-defined diagnostic criteria had previously been proposed only for autoimmune pancreatitis (AIP). The histopathological findings of a dense lymphoplasmacytic infiltrate, storiform fibrosis, and obliterative phlebitis are critical features for establishing the diagnosis (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RHEUM%2F76767\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef76767 \">picture 1</a>). The presence of these findings, often together with mild tissue eosinophilia, is strongly suggestive if accompanied by increased numbers of IgG4-positive plasma cells.

This disagreement largely reflected different practice styles between countries, with 80 percent (16 of 20) of experts from Japan disagreeing with early use of a second agent in addition to the glucocorticoid therapy, while 76 percent (13 of 17) of the experts from all other regions (North America, Europe, Korea, and China) agreed. </p><p>Most patients respond to glucocorticoids within several weeks, typically with symptomatic improvement, reductions in the size of masses or organ enlargement, improvement in organ function, and often a decrease in serum levels of IgG4. However, some require a few months to respond, and there are some patients who relapse and others who respond less well or not at all initially. Those who respond poorly may include patients with more advanced fibrotic changes, but these patients have not been well-defined. An IgG4-RD Responder Index has been developed and employed in clinical investigations and in laboratory-based biomarker studies using clinical data [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-igg4-related-disease/abstract/126\" class=\"abstract_t\">126</a>].

B cell depletion leads to the targeted reduction, often swiftly, of serum IgG4 concentrations, with relative preservation of the concentrations of other immunoglobulins and immunoglobulin subclasses. This suggests that B cell depletion achieves its effects at least in part by interfering with the repletion of short-lived plasma cells that are producing IgG4. Once these IgG4-producing cells disappear, they are not repleted following the anti-CD20 therapy because the pool of circulating B cells has been depleted.

Causes of significant morbidity and mortality in untreated patients include cirrhosis and portal hypertension; retroperitoneal fibrosis; complications from aortic aneurysms, including dissection; biliary obstruction; diabetes mellitus; and others [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-igg4-related-disease/abstract/47,70,78,123,127\" class=\"abstract_t\">47,70,78,123,127</a>]. A subset of patients have subacute constitutional symptoms marked by fatigue and weight loss that may be substantial over months, on the order of 20 or 30 pounds. Sustained benefit may be observed in treated patients, but relapses are common after discontinuation of therapy. In a retrospective cohort study, relapse was observed in about one-third of patients treated with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=rituximab-intravenous-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">rituximab</a> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-igg4-related-disease/abstract/128\" class=\"abstract_t\">128</a>]. B-cell depletion is not a cure for IgG4-RD, and it is likely that the majority of patients will experience disease recurrences over time. Baseline levels of serum IgG4, IgE, and circulating eosinophils served as markers for relapse prediction. Additional organs and tissues may become involved over time, sometimes despite apparently effective treatment. Additional studies of long-term prognosis are needed.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H447315657\"><span class=\"h2\">Risk of malignancy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Some studies have suggested that the presence of IgG4-RD is associated with an increased risk of malignancy, which may involve a variety of organs and tissues, and that the risk may be particularly increased in the year after diagnosis of IgG4-RD. However, other studies have not found such risk, and this issue remains controversial [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-igg4-related-disease/abstract/129,130\" class=\"abstract_t\">129,130</a>]. On the other hand, it has been shown that a history of malignancy is associated with subsequent development of IgG4-RD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-igg4-related-disease/abstract/68\" class=\"abstract_t\">68</a>].</p><p>In a series of 158 patients in Japan with IgG4-RD who were diagnosed between 1992 and 2012, 109 of whom had type 1 autoimmune pancreatitis (most with extrapancreatic lesions), and who were followed for a mean of six years, there was an increase in the incidence of malignancy compared with the expected rate [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-igg4-related-disease/abstract/131\" class=\"abstract_t\">131</a>]. The overall malignancy risk and the risk in the first year after diagnosis of IgG4-RD, in particular, were both significantly increased (standardized incidence ratio [SIR] 2.01, 95% CI 1.34-2.69, and SIR 3.53, 95% CI 1.23-5.83, respectively). The total number of malignancies was 34, most often affecting the lung, colon, prostate, stomach, and pancreas. At the time of diagnosis with IgG4-RD, IgG4-RD patients with malignancies had increased levels of several serum markers of disease activity, including IgG, IgG4, and soluble interleukin (IL)-2 receptor. The majority of malignancies occurred in organs other than those affected by the IgG4-RD inflammation.</p><p>In one series of 108 Japanese patients with IgG4-related pancreatitis, 18 cancers were found in 15 patients (14 percent); the median follow-up was 3.3 years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-igg4-related-disease/abstract/132\" class=\"abstract_t\">132</a>]. At the time of diagnosis of the pancreatitis, the relative risk (RR) of cancer was significantly increased compared with age- and sex-matched controls (RR 4.9, 95% CI 1.7-14.9); the risk was highest in the year following diagnosis. Gastric cancers were the most common; other sites included lung, prostate, colon, non-Hodgkin lymphoma, bile duct, and thyroid. In six of eight patients whose cancer was assessed histologically before treatment with glucocorticoids for the pancreatitis, IgG4-positive plasma cell infiltrates were found in the cancer tissue. Thus, it is of note that the presence of IgG4-positive plasma cell infiltrates does not exclude malignancy, and certain cutoff limits have been defined in order to maximize diagnostic accuracy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-igg4-related-disease/abstract/133\" class=\"abstract_t\">133</a>]. None of these patients experienced relapse of their IgG4-related pancreatitis after successful treatment of their cancers, raising the question of whether IgG4-RD may occur as a paraneoplastic syndrome in some patients.</p><p>Several sporadic cases of pancreatic cancer and cases of salivary duct carcinoma, pulmonary adenocarcinoma, small cell carcinoma of the lung, and gastrointestinal clear cell sarcoma have also been reported [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-igg4-related-disease/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. Large-scale multicenter studies are required to determine the degree, if any, of increased risk for these and other malignancies in affected patients or whether the reported results are due to intensive screening that these patients undergo.</p><p>Several types of lymphoma have been reported in patients with IgG4-RD, both in Japan and in North America [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-igg4-related-disease/abstract/9,60,65,134,135\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,60,65,134,135</a>]. In the study in North America, which involved 111 patients with IgG4-RD (91 percent with autoimmune pancreatitis [AIP]), three cases of non-Hodgkin lymphoma were found three to five years after the diagnosis of IgG4-RD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-igg4-related-disease/abstract/65\" class=\"abstract_t\">65</a>]. The standardized incidence ratio was 16.0 (95% CI 3.3-45.5), suggesting an increased risk of non-Hodgkin lymphoma among this group of patients referred to an academic medical center with special interest in this disorder. On the other hand, studies have failed to demonstrate a monoclonal plasma cell population in IgG4-RD patients, while it seems that the circulating plasmablasts are most probably derived from oligoclonal expansion of B-cell clones that are somatically hyper-mutated in germinal centers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-igg4-related-disease/abstract/133\" class=\"abstract_t\">133</a>]. Further studies are required to better define the degree of risk and the effect of treatment upon such risk, if present.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H43795036\"><span class=\"h1\">SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Immunoglobulin G4-related systemic disease (IgG4-RD) is an increasingly recognized syndrome of unknown etiology, most often occurring in middle-aged and older men, which is comprised of a collection of disorders that share specific pathologic, serologic, and clinical features.

Patients often present with subacute development of a mass in the affected organ or diffuse enlargement of an organ. Lymphadenopathy is common, and symptoms of asthma or allergy may be present. A good initial therapeutic response to glucocorticoids is also characteristic. (See <a href=\"#H4739538\" class=\"local\">'Definition and histology'</a> above and <a href=\"#H365938\" class=\"local\">'Pathogenesis'</a> above and <a href=\"#H250672034\" class=\"local\">'Lymphadenopathy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The diagnosis of IgG4-RD is based upon biopsy findings demonstrating the characteristic histopathology. Serum IgG4 levels should be measured, and isolated elevated levels are a significant aid in diagnosis, although they are not diagnostic. Additional organ involvement may be identified through a careful history, physical examination, routine laboratory testing, and selected imaging studies. (See <a href=\"#H34249877\" class=\"local\">'Diagnosis'</a> above and <a href=\"#H447315085\" class=\"local\">'Indications for diagnostic evaluation'</a> above and <a href=\"#H447315093\" class=\"local\">'Diagnostic studies'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We suggest beginning treatment with glucocorticoids (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=5\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2B</a>). We generally initiate therapy with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prednisone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">prednisone</a> (40 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day),</span> which is then tapered to discontinuation over a two-month period. Responses are characterized by symptomatic improvement, reductions in the size of masses or organ enlargement, improvement in organ function, and often a decrease in serum levels of IgG4. We use <a href=\"topic.htm?path=rituximab-intravenous-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">rituximab</a> in patients who do not respond to up to 40 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day</span> of prednisone or cannot be tapered to &lt;5 mg daily, and in patients who have strong relative contraindications to glucocorticoid therapy in these doses.

Spontaneous improvement can be seen, but disease often recurs without treatment. Most patients respond initially to therapy with glucocorticoids, but relapses are common following discontinuation of therapy. Significant organ dysfunction may arise from uncontrolled and progressive inflammatory and fibrotic changes in affected tissues. The possibility of increased risk of malignancy in patients with IgG4-RD requires further study.
