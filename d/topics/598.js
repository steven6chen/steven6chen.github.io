Adverse reactions to LAs are not uncommon, and most are nonallergic in etiology. However, allergic reactions to LAs can occur, and the evaluation and management of patients with these reactions will be reviewed here.

Vesiculation, blistering, or weeping can occur. The area affected is limited to tissue that was in direct contact with the causal agent. LAs may also cause delayed-onset swelling, with or without overlying dermatitis, at sites of injection. Mucosal reactions may blister and progress to sloughing [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/allergic-reactions-to-local-anesthetics/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].

A small number of case reports have described local reactions attributed to sulfite sensitivity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/allergic-reactions-to-local-anesthetics/abstract/15-17\" class=\"abstract_t\">15-17</a>]. One case described a woman with severe edema of the face and neck after receiving an LA for dental work, with a positive patch test to both the LA and metabisulfite [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/allergic-reactions-to-local-anesthetics/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Sulfite-sensitive asthmatics are not known to be at increased risk for reactions to sulfites in LAs. One study found that doses of metabisulfite of up to 10 times the amount usually found in LA preparations did not cause symptoms when injected subcutaneously in a group of known sulfite-sensitive asthmatic patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/allergic-reactions-to-local-anesthetics/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Parabens (either methyl- or propyl-) are added to many commercial preparations of LAs as preservatives [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/allergic-reactions-to-local-anesthetics/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. Parabens are an uncommon cause of contact dermatitis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/allergic-reactions-to-local-anesthetics/abstract/20,21\" class=\"abstract_t\">20,21</a>].

The patient should not have applied topical glucocorticoids to the tested skin for at least one week and should not have taken systemic glucocorticoids for at least one to two weeks prior to testing [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/allergic-reactions-to-local-anesthetics/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=patch-testing\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Patch testing&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p>The optimal concentration of LAs for use in patch testing has not been determined. In published studies, concentrations of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lidocaine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">lidocaine</a> (in a petroleum vehicle) used for testing have ranged from 5 to 15 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/allergic-reactions-to-local-anesthetics/abstract/3,6,7,23,24\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,6,7,23,24</a>]. Testing can be performed using 10 mm Finn Chambers on Scanpor tape (or equivalent products) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/allergic-reactions-to-local-anesthetics/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. In addition, the standard T.R.U.E.

At the same time, patch testing with an alternative LA could be performed or the evaluation could be done in steps.</p><p>Information about cross-reactivity (based upon patch testing) among LAs is limited, although there is evidence for cross-reactivity within each group of agents [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/allergic-reactions-to-local-anesthetics/abstract/26-28\" class=\"abstract_t\">26-28</a>] and minimal evidence for cross-reactivity between the two groups [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/allergic-reactions-to-local-anesthetics/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. Thus, we suggest choosing one or more drugs from the other LA group as an alternative agent for patch testing. A case report described a patient with delayed hypersensitivity to several amide LAs (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=lidocaine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">lidocaine</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=mepivacaine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">mepivacaine</a>, and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=bupivacaine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">bupivacaine</a>), which all contain a meta-xylene entity, but not to articaine, which is a thiophene derivative. The authors hypothesized that the meta-xylene entity could be the eliciting epitope in amide LA allergy and that in such cases, articaine could be an alternative [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/allergic-reactions-to-local-anesthetics/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. However, a subsequent report describes a patient with delayed-type hypersensitivity to articaine with cross-reactivity with bupivacaine and lidocaine but tolerance of mepivacaine [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/allergic-reactions-to-local-anesthetics/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>].</p><p>Patches are removed at 48 hours, readings are taken at 48 and 72 hours, and reactions are scored as detailed by the manufacturer [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/allergic-reactions-to-local-anesthetics/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]. A positive result varies from mild erythema and induration to severe vesiculation.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h2\">Diagnosis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A clinical history consistent with a delayed cutaneous reaction to an LA, combined with a positive patch test result, is sufficient for diagnosis.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h2\">Management</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients who have demonstrated type IV allergic reactions to one LA may tolerate other LAs. Management consists of identifying other agents that the patient tolerates. When evaluating patients for tolerance to other LAs, we suggest choosing an agent from the other chemical group (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F57120\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef57120 \">table 1</a>).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h1\">URTICARIA AND ANAPHYLAXIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>LAs have been implicated in immunoglobulin E (IgE)-mediated, type I hypersensitivity reactions (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F80466\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef80466 \">table 2</a>). These are also called immediate hypersensitivity reactions. Clinical manifestations of immediate allergic reactions include pruritus, urticaria, bronchospasm, angioedema of noncontiguous tissues, and anaphylaxis, typically occurring <strong>within one hour</strong> of an LA injection. However, the evidence for the existence of these reactions consists of a small number of case reports in which positive skin tests were demonstrated. These reports describe reactions to <a href=\"topic.htm?path=mepivacaine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">mepivacaine</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lidocaine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">lidocaine</a> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/allergic-reactions-to-local-anesthetics/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>], articaine [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/allergic-reactions-to-local-anesthetics/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>], lidocaine [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/allergic-reactions-to-local-anesthetics/abstract/34-38\" class=\"abstract_t\">34-38</a>], levobupivacaine and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ropivacaine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ropivacaine</a> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/allergic-reactions-to-local-anesthetics/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>], mepivacaine, lidocaine, and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=bupivacaine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">bupivacaine</a> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/allergic-reactions-to-local-anesthetics/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>], and epidural lidocaine and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=chloroprocaine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">chloroprocaine</a> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/allergic-reactions-to-local-anesthetics/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>]. In all of these cases, alternative anesthetics were identified through skin tests and challenge. Drug-specific IgE has not been demonstrated in vitro.</p><p>Despite these reports, true local anesthetic allergy is rare. In the period of 2004 to 2013, a total of 409 patients were evaluated in the Danish Anaesthesia Allergy Center for suspected allergy associated with anesthesia and surgery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/allergic-reactions-to-local-anesthetics/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>]. Of those, 162 patients were exposed to one or more local anesthetics, none of whom reacted on subcutaneous challenge with the relevant LA. More specifically, in a report from a Danish allergy clinic describing five years of provocation testing in patients evaluated for a suspected immediate reaction to an LA, a total of 164 patients underwent 189 provocations, all of which were negative [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/allergic-reactions-to-local-anesthetics/abstract/43\" class=\"abstract_t\">43</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8361454\"><span class=\"h2\">Cross-reactivity</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Based on available case reports of immediate reactions to LAs (reviewed above), there is evidence for inconsistent cross-reactivity among group II agents and lack of cross-reactivity between group I and II agents [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/allergic-reactions-to-local-anesthetics/abstract/32,33,38,39\" class=\"abstract_t\">32,33,38,39</a>].

These pseudoallergic reactions include psychomotor or anxiety-related reactions, vasovagal syncope, sympathetic stimulation, and systemic toxic effects related to the pharmacologic properties of these agents.</p><p>The clinical manifestations of nonallergic reactions can resemble aspects of allergic reactions. As examples, dyspnea, hypotension, lightheadedness, and syncope are signs and symptoms that can be seen in both allergic and nonallergic reactions. However, the presence of wheezing, pruritus, urticaria, or angioedema strongly suggests true allergy.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15\"><span class=\"h3\">Psychomotor reactions</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Psychomotor reactions or anxiety-related symptoms include hyperventilation (manifested by dyspnea and tachypnea), paresthesias in the fingers or perioral area, dizziness, palpitations, tachycardia, nausea, or simply &quot;not feeling good&quot; [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/allergic-reactions-to-local-anesthetics/abstract/44,45\" class=\"abstract_t\">44,45</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H16\"><span class=\"h3\">Vasovagal syncope</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Vasovagal syncope is usually associated with bradycardia (rather than tachycardia) and pallor (rather than flushing).

In addition, the vasoconstrictor <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epinephrine-adrenaline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">epinephrine</a> is sometimes added to LA solutions for the purposes of reducing bleeding, potentiating the degree of local anesthesia achieved, limiting the total dose required, and minimizing systemic absorption of the LA [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/allergic-reactions-to-local-anesthetics/abstract/46,47\" class=\"abstract_t\">46,47</a>]. The amount of epinephrine in these preparations is too small to induce significant systemic responses in most normal subjects, as well as in those with heart disease, high blood pressure, hyperthyroidism, or on tricyclic antidepressants [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/allergic-reactions-to-local-anesthetics/abstract/46-48\" class=\"abstract_t\">46-48</a>].

(See <a href=\"#H4877719\" class=\"local\">'Referral'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>LAs have been divided into two groups based upon their chemical structure (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F57120\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef57120 \">table 1</a>). (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Categories of local anesthetics'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Typical nonallergic reactions include psychomotor responses related to anxiety, sympathetic stimulation from pain, or toxic effects attributable to heightened sensitivity to known properties of the drug. Several strategies are proposed for minimizing the recurrence of these reactions. (See <a href=\"#H14\" class=\"local\">'Mimics of allergic reactions'</a> above and <a href=\"#H26\" class=\"local\">'Patients with past nonallergic reactions'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Contact dermatitis and delayed-onset localized swelling are examples of type IV, delayed-type hypersensitivity reactions. Symptoms develop one to three days after drug administration and can be evaluated with patch testing. (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Contact dermatitis or delayed local swelling'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Anaphylaxis and immediate allergic reactions, which typically begin within one hour of drug administration, have been attributed to LAs in only a handful of case reports.
