It is the predominant form of autoimmune hepatitis seen in adults and adolescents (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F65135\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef65135 \">table 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/autoimmune-hepatitis-treatment/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Type 2 autoimmune hepatitis is defined by the presence of antibodies to <span class=\"nowrap\">liver/kidney</span> microsomes (ALKM-1) <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> to a liver cytosol antigen (ALC-1). It is typically diagnosed in infants, girls, and young women.

Treatment recommendations have also been outlined in 2010 guidelines from the <a href=\"http://www.aasld.org/practiceguidelines/Pages/default.aspx&amp;token=qdIedhK2+WLdeLxoDUwctICVWUP3SdyvHEyzNxuBFzwik5s/U2nZBeaeZW2BLwdvw4K4vC2WLUAyv8dPj3sVnQ==&amp;TOPIC_ID=3659\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases</a><u> </u>[<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/autoimmune-hepatitis-treatment/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>] and in 2011 guidelines from the <a href=\"http://www.bsg.org.uk/clinical/general/guidelines.html&amp;token=S28gEfVOUxLyVGN/xn0wqreyKNLE6/mQlhkY3NaQRZjXNYvaD/Xaz/PkAYFUAS7TJU53P0mkK6LDPr9hmRbQSg==&amp;TOPIC_ID=3659\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">British Society of Gastroenterology</a><u> </u>[<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/autoimmune-hepatitis-treatment/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. Our approach and the approaches in the two guidelines are similar, but they do vary in some areas such as what level of aminotransferase elevation is required to initiate treatment and the specific approaches to treatment (eg, whether to initiate treatment with a glucocorticoid alone or in combination with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=azathioprine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">azathioprine</a> and when to recommend maintenance therapy).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H79576825\"><span class=\"h1\">REFERRAL TO A SPECIALIST</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Many patients with autoimmune hepatitis are under the care of a hepatologist when the diagnosis is made, and we generally encourage management by a hepatologist. However, treatment by a primary care clinician who is familiar with the treatment of autoimmune hepatitis is reasonable. Referral to a hepatologist should be considered for patients who fail to go into remission with glucocorticoid therapy, who worsen despite therapy, or who have cirrhosis at the time of diagnosis. Patients presenting with acute liver failure should immediately be admitted to a hospital, preferably one with a liver transplantation program. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acute-liver-failure-in-adults-etiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Acute liver failure in adults: Etiology, clinical manifestations, and diagnosis&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acute-liver-failure-in-adults-management-and-prognosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Acute liver failure in adults: Management and prognosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">INDICATIONS FOR TREATMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The decision to treat a patient with autoimmune hepatitis is based on the severity of symptoms, the magnitude of the serum aminotransferase and gamma globulin elevations, histologic findings, and the potential for side effects. </p><p>We treat patients who fulfill any of the following criteria:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Serum aminotransferase levels greater than 10-fold the upper limit of normal</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Serum gamma globulin level greater than twice the upper limit of normal </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Serum aminotransferase levels greater than twice the upper limit of normal along with:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Symptoms </p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>An elevated gamma globulin level, even if less than twice the upper limit of normal</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>An elevated conjugated bilirubin level</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Interface hepatitis on biopsy</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Histologic features of bridging necrosis or multiacinar necrosis</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Cirrhosis with any degree of inflammation on biopsy (see <a href=\"#H703222\" class=\"local\">'Cirrhosis'</a> below)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Children (see <a href=\"#H703016\" class=\"local\">'Children'</a> below)</p><p/><p>Our approach is generally consistent with guidelines from American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases (AASLD) and the British Society of Gastroenterology (BSG). However, it does differ in a few ways. The AASLD guideline only recommends treatment for patients with gamma globulin levels greater than twice the upper limit of normal if the aminotransferases are at least fivefold the upper limit of normal, and does not recommend treatment for patients with gamma globulin levels less than twice the upper limit of normal unless the aminotransferases are greater than 10-fold the upper limit of normal. Our concern with the AASLD approach is that the level of serum aminotransferase or gamma globulin elevation does not correlate perfectly with the degree of histologic injury. In many cases, we have found that therapy may be required when serum aminotransferases or gamma globulin levels are elevated to a lesser degree than suggested by the AASLD guideline. Our approach also differs from the BSG guideline, which recommends treating if the serum aminotransferase levels are greater than fivefold the upper limit of normal, regardless of other criteria for treatment.</p><p>Treatment may not be required in asymptomatic patients with normal or near-normal serum aminotransferase and gamma globulin levels who have minimal necroinflammatory activity on liver biopsy. Such patients are at a relatively low risk of disease progression. However, it is reasonable to offer treatment to a patient with histologic evidence of interface hepatitis without bridging necrosis or multiacinar necrosis, particularly if the patient is young (age less than 50 years) and is unlikely to have severe side effects related to therapy. Patients who are not treated should be monitored for signs of disease progression. If symptoms develop, if the aminotransferase or gamma globulin levels increase, or if histologic evidence of active disease is seen on follow-up biopsies, treatment should be reconsidered using the above criteria. (See <a href=\"#H757413\" class=\"local\">'Glucocorticoid monotherapy'</a> below and <a href=\"#H144999398\" class=\"local\">'Monitoring and follow-up'</a> below.)</p><p>Treatment is not recommended for patients with cirrhosis and inactive disease (characterized by the absence of inflammatory cells on liver biopsy and normal or near-normal serum aminotransferases) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/autoimmune-hepatitis-treatment/abstract/3,4\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,4</a>]. Such patients may be at increased risk for the development of glucocorticoid-related side effects, and the benefit of treatment is uncertain. On the other hand, treatment generally is recommended for patients with cirrhosis and active inflammation.

(See <a href=\"#H10\" class=\"local\">'Induction therapy'</a> below.)</p><p>The American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases recommends initial therapy with either glucocorticoid monotherapy or a combination of a glucocorticoid and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=azathioprine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">azathioprine</a> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/autoimmune-hepatitis-treatment/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>], whereas the British Society of Gastroenterology and European Association for the Study of the Liver recommend initial treatment with a glucocorticoid and azathioprine rather than glucocorticoid monotherapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/autoimmune-hepatitis-treatment/abstract/4,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,5</a>]. For patients at high risk for glucocorticoid side effects, combination therapy permits administration of lower doses of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prednisone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">prednisone</a>. <a href=\"topic.htm?path=budesonide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Budesonide</a> may be an alternative to prednisone in these patients, though long-term data on safety and efficacy are lacking.

We obtain TPMT phenotyping prior to initiating treatment. This approach is consistent with recommendations from the US Food and Drug Administration for patients being treated with these drugs. Other adverse effects of azathioprine include gastrointestinal disturbances, lesser degrees of bone marrow suppression (in those with decreased TPMT activity), infection, pancreatitis, and malignancy. The side effects of these drugs are discussed in detail elsewhere.

Prior to initiating treatment with azathioprine or 6-mercaptopurine, patients should undergo thiopurine methyltransferase (TPMT) phenotyping. Testing for latent tuberculosis should also be considered for patients who are likely to need long-term glucocorticoid therapy. Patients should also be vaccinated against hepatitis A and B if not already immune (preferably before starting immunosuppressive therapy). Patients with fulminant hepatitis and acute liver failure require hospitalization for management of their liver failure (which may include liver transplantation). (See <a href=\"#H255454215\" class=\"local\">'Testing for TPMT enzyme activity and drug metabolite levels'</a> above and <a href=\"#H8058952\" class=\"local\">'Fulminant hepatitis and acute liver failure'</a> below and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acute-liver-failure-in-adults-etiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Acute liver failure in adults: Etiology, clinical manifestations, and diagnosis&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acute-liver-failure-in-adults-management-and-prognosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Acute liver failure in adults: Management and prognosis&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=approach-to-diagnosis-of-latent-tuberculosis-infection-tuberculosis-screening-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Approach to diagnosis of latent tuberculosis infection (tuberculosis screening) in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p>While glucocorticoid monotherapy has not been directly compared with combination therapy (a glucocorticoid plus <a href=\"topic.htm?path=azathioprine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">azathioprine</a>) in large trials with long-term follow-up, limited data and clinical experience suggest that the two approaches have similar efficacy as induction therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/autoimmune-hepatitis-treatment/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. Azathioprine monotherapy can be used for maintenance therapy, but is not effective for induction therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/autoimmune-hepatitis-treatment/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].</p><p>In the United States, the glucocorticoid used is typically <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prednisone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">prednisone</a>, whereas in Europe it is <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prednisolone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">prednisolone</a> (which is given at the same dose as prednisone). If 6-mercaptopurine, is used, it is given at half the dose recommended for treatment with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=azathioprine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">azathioprine</a>. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H757413\"><span class=\"h2\">Glucocorticoid monotherapy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>We prefer <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prednisone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">prednisone</a> monotherapy (60 mg daily) for the initial treatment of most patients with autoimmune hepatitis because doing so avoids potential confusion if there are subsequent elevations in the serum aminotransferases or if additional symptoms develop after starting treatment (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F77509\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef77509 \">table 2</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F99038\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef99038 \">algorithm 1</a>). For patients with mild disease (eg, asymptomatic patients with aminotransferase levels &lt;10 times the upper limit of normal), lower dose prednisone monotherapy (20 mg per day) is a reasonable alternative. In patients with moderate to severe disease who are at increased risk for glucocorticoid side effects, we will use a lower dose of prednisone (30 mg daily), with or without <a href=\"topic.htm?path=azathioprine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">azathioprine</a> (50 mg daily). A possible alternative to prednisone is <a href=\"topic.htm?path=budesonide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">budesonide</a> (9 mg per day) in combination with azathioprine, particularly for patients at increased risk for glucocorticoid side effects, though its role in treatment requires additional study. In addition, budesonide should not be used in patients with cirrhosis because it undergoes extensive first-pass hepatic metabolism. (See <a href=\"#H757420\" class=\"local\">'Glucocorticoid plus azathioprine'</a> below and <a href=\"#H704992\" class=\"local\">'Investigational treatments'</a> below.)</p><p>After a week of treatment, we typically start a four-week taper of the <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prednisone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">prednisone</a> to a maintenance dose (20 mg daily if being used as monotherapy and 10 mg daily if being used with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=azathioprine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">azathioprine</a>) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F99196\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef99196 \">algorithm 2</a>). The dose of azathioprine (if used) is held constant. Serum aminotransferase, bilirubin, or gamma globulin levels are checked weekly during the taper. If the patient develops recurrent symptoms or worsening laboratory values during the prednisone taper, we maintain the patient at the lowest dose that controls symptoms and is associated with improvements in laboratory values. This may require increasing the dose of prednisone again to 40 to 60 mg daily, and tapering according to the clinical response and side effects. Further treatment decisions will depend on the patient's response to initial treatment. (See <a href=\"#H61501703\" class=\"local\">'Subsequent management'</a> below.)</p><p>Approximately 90 percent of patients have improvement in serum aminotransferases, bilirubin, and gamma globulin within two weeks. However, histologic improvement lags behind biochemical improvement by three to eight months. Importantly, in adults, serum levels of autoantibodies do not appear to parallel disease activity and should not be used to monitor activity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/autoimmune-hepatitis-treatment/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].</p><p>The side effects of glucocorticoids include the development of Cushingoid features, diabetes, fatty liver, hypertension, psychiatric problems, cataracts, glaucoma, osteoporosis, and compression fractures. The risk of glucocorticoid-related side effects is increased in patients with brittle diabetes, osteoporosis, emotional lability, a history of psychosis, or poorly controlled hypertension. Patients with these conditions require special precautions <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> monitoring. In such patients, consideration should be given to the use of combination therapy as part of the initial treatment regimen in order to use a lower dose of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prednisone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">prednisone</a>. <a href=\"topic.htm?path=budesonide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Budesonide</a> plus <a href=\"topic.htm?path=azathioprine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">azathioprine</a> may also be an option in such patients, though the role of budesonide is not yet clear.

Some clinicians attempt to withdraw treatment at least once when a sustained remission has been achieved on treatment. We will typically attempt to withdraw treatment if a patient is in remission, but we first discuss the advantages and disadvantages of both approaches with our patients prior to making a treatment recommendation. In particular, we inform patients that 50 to 90 percent of patients relapse within 12 months of drug withdrawal [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/autoimmune-hepatitis-treatment/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>].

The British Society of Gastroenterology guidelines recommend routine maintenance therapy in younger patients and in patients who are <span class=\"nowrap\">liver/kidney</span> microsomes (ALKM-1)-positive or soluble liver antigen-positive [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/autoimmune-hepatitis-treatment/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H154152947\" class=\"local\">'Conventional maintenance therapy'</a> below.)</p><p>A liver biopsy may help predict which patients are likely to have successful drug withdrawal, but it is not required prior to withdrawing treatment. However, our preference is to obtain a biopsy prior to withdrawing treatment and to continue treatment if there is significant interface hepatitis or other histologic evidence of active disease. The importance of histologic findings was examined in a study with 120 patients who were in remission (defined by normal serum ALT and globulin) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/autoimmune-hepatitis-treatment/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. Patients with persistent histologic activity on liver biopsy (Ishak histologic activity index [HAI] &ge;4) were less likely than patients with histologic remission (HAI &lt;4) to have regression of fibrosis (32 versus 60 percent) and had excess mortality (standardized mortality ratio 1.4 versus 0.7). Persistent histologic activity was also associated with all-cause <span class=\"nowrap\">death/transplantation</span> (hazard ratio 3.1, 95% CI 1.2 to 8.1).</p><p>Alanine aminotransferase (ALT) levels prior to drug withdrawal may also help predict which patients are more likely to relapse following drug withdrawal. This was examined in a series of 28 patients who had been in remission for at least 24 months (defined as repeatedly normal serum aminotransferase levels and normal immunoglobin G [IgG] levels) prior to withdrawal of immunosuppression [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/autoimmune-hepatitis-treatment/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. After a median of 28 months follow-up, 15 patients (54 percent) were in remission and 13 patients (46 percent) had relapsed. Of the patients in long-term remission, all had ALT levels at the time of drug withdrawal that were &lt;2 times the upper limit of normal and IgG levels &lt;12 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/L</span>. Among the patients who relapsed, only three had ALT levels &lt;2 times the upper limit of normal and IgG levels &lt;12 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/L</span>. On multivariable analysis, higher levels of ALT were associated with the risk of relapse (hazard ratio 4.4; 95% CI 1.1-17). </p><p>If therapy is being withdrawn, the first step is typically tapering the glucocorticoid. The dose of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prednisone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">prednisone</a> can be decreased by 10 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day</span> every week until a dose of 20 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day</span> is reached. Tapering should then be by increments of 5 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day</span> each week until a dose of 10 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day</span> is reached. At that point, tapering should be done in increments of 2.5 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day</span> every week until the drug is withdrawn. We monitor the serum aminotransferases, total bilirubin, and gamma globulin levels every three weeks during withdrawal and for three months after withdrawal. We then monitor the levels every six months for one year, and yearly thereafter.</p><p>For patients who are also being treated with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=azathioprine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">azathioprine</a>, we generally withdraw it after the glucocorticoid has been discontinued. For patients taking 50 mg daily, we simply stop the azathioprine. For patients taking higher doses, we reduce the dose by 50 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day</span> every three months with serologic monitoring every three months. In some cases, azathioprine cannot be successfully withdrawn and patients may need maintenance therapy.

The risk of relapse can be predicted based on histologic findings prior to withdrawing treatment.

Relapse was also more common in those with a human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-A1, HLA-B8, or HLA-DR3 phenotype.

However, if relapse occurs, the patient is counseled that there is a likelihood of life-long therapy and that any further attempts to withdraw immunosuppression would again require liver biopsy to confirm there is no significant interface hepatitis or other histologic evidence of active disease.

The decision to use azathioprine either as a steroid-sparing agent or as monotherapy involves weighing the risks of long-term steroid-induced side effects (eg, osteoporosis) against those of azathioprine (eg, a low risk of malignancy).

The lowest maintenance dose we use is 3 mg per day.

In addition, some patients with prednisone-responsive extrahepatic disease will have exacerbations when switched from prednisone to budesonide [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/autoimmune-hepatitis-treatment/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. </p><p>For patients with multiple relapses who cannot be maintained on <a href=\"topic.htm?path=azathioprine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">azathioprine</a> alone, an alternative is partial suppression.

(See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Indications for treatment'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Without treatment, the survival rate in patients with symptomatic autoimmune hepatitis at five years is approximately 50 percent. However, with treatment, the 10-year survival rate is approximately 90 percent. (See <a href=\"#H8057806\" class=\"local\">'Prognosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In adult patients with autoimmune hepatitis, we suggest treatment, rather than expectant management, if any of the following criteria are fulfilled (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=5\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2B</a>) (see <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Indications for treatment'</a> above):</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Serum aminotransferase levels greater than 10-fold the upper limit of normal</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Serum gamma globulin level greater than twice the upper limit of normal </p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Histologic features of bridging necrosis or multiacinar necrosis</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">In adult patients who lack the above indications for treatment, we suggest treatment if the serum aminotransferase level is greater than twice the upper limit of normal along with (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>):</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Symptoms </p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>An elevated gamma globulin level, even if less than twice the upper limit of normal</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>An elevated conjugated bilirubin</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Interface hepatitis on biopsy</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">In our experience, many of these patients will have disease progression if not treated. Finally, it is reasonable to offer treatment to a patient with histologic evidence of interface hepatitis who does not meet other criteria, particularly if the patient is young (age less than 50 years) and is unlikely to have severe side effects related to therapy.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In adults, we suggest initial treatment with glucocorticoid monotherapy rather than combination therapy with a glucocorticoid and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=azathioprine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">azathioprine</a> (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F77509\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef77509 \">table 2</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F99038\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef99038 \">algorithm 1</a>) (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). In the United States, the preferred glucocorticoid is often <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prednisone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">prednisone</a>, whereas in Europe it is <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prednisolone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">prednisolone</a>. (See <a href=\"#H757413\" class=\"local\">'Glucocorticoid monotherapy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">We prefer glucocorticoid monotherapy for the initial treatment of most patients because doing so avoids potential confusion if there are elevations in the serum aminotransferases or if additional symptoms develop after starting treatment. When used as monotherapy, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prednisone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">prednisone</a> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prednisolone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">prednisolone</a> is usually given at a dose of 60 mg, followed by a taper. For patients with mild disease (eg, asymptomatic patients with aminotransferase levels &lt;10 times the upper limit of normal), lower dose prednisone monotherapy (20 mg per day) is an alternative. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">In patients with moderate or severe disease who are at increased risk for side effects from glucocorticoids (eg, those with brittle diabetes, osteoporosis, emotional lability, a history of psychosis, or poorly controlled hypertension), using a lower-dose glucocorticoid (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prednisone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">prednisone</a> 30 mg per day) for monotherapy or in combination with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=azathioprine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">azathioprine</a> (50 mg per day) for initial treatment is a reasonable alternative. An alternative to azathioprine is 6-mercaptopurine, which is given at half the dose of azathioprine. Treatment with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=budesonide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">budesonide</a> and azathioprine may also be an alternative in these patients, provided the patients do not have cirrhosis, though the long-term safety and efficacy of this approach is unclear. (See <a href=\"#H757420\" class=\"local\">'Glucocorticoid plus azathioprine'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We recommend treatment for all children with autoimmune hepatitis, rather than reserving treatment for children who meet the above criteria (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=2\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1B</a>). Autoimmune hepatitis tends to be more severe in children compared with adults possibly because of a delay in diagnosis, and up to one-half have cirrhosis at the time of diagnosis. (See <a href=\"#H703016\" class=\"local\">'Children'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">In children, we suggest initial treatment with a glucocorticoid (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). Some groups recommend treating with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=azathioprine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">azathioprine</a> from the onset. We introduce azathioprine early to abrogate against the more severe consequences of glucocorticoid use in children (bone disease, linear growth stunting, acne, and impacts on puberty). <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prednisone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Prednisone</a> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prednisolone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">prednisolone</a> is given as 1 to 2 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> daily (maximum of 60 mg daily) and is then tapered. Azathioprine is given as 0.5 to 2 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> daily (maximum 200 mg daily). (See <a href=\"#H703016\" class=\"local\">'Children'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Thiopurine methyltransferase (TPMT) enzyme activity should be determined before starting <a href=\"topic.htm?path=azathioprine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">azathioprine</a> or 6-mercaptopurine. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=6-mercaptopurine-6-mp-metabolite-monitoring-and-tpmt-testing-in-patients-with-inflammatory-bowel-disease#H2\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;6-mercaptopurine (6-MP) metabolite monitoring and TPMT testing in patients with inflammatory bowel disease&quot;, section on 'TPMT enzyme determination'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Subsequent management in both adults and children will depend on how the patient responds to the initial treatment (remission, incomplete response, failed treatment, drug intolerance) and whether the patient relapses if treatment is withdrawn (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F99038\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef99038 \">algorithm 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F99196\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef99196 \">algorithm 2</a>).
