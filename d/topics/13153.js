It most often results from immunologic reactions to foods, medications, and insect stings, although it can also be induced through nonimmunologic mechanisms by any agent capable of producing a sudden, systemic degranulation of mast cells or basophils [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-of-anaphylaxis/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p>The phenomenon of anaphylaxis was first described in the modern medical literature in 1902 in a study involving protocols for immunizing dogs with jellyfish toxin. The injection of small amounts of toxin in some animals rather than generating protection precipitated the rapid onset of fatal or near-fatal symptoms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-of-anaphylaxis/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. The authors named this response &quot;l'anaphylaxie,&quot; which is derived from the Greek words a- (against) and phylaxis (immunity or protection).</p><p>The pathophysiology of anaphylaxis will be reviewed here. The clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and management of anaphylaxis and the epidemiology and etiology of fatal anaphylaxis are discussed separately.

The World Allergy Organization (WAO), an international umbrella organization representing a large number of regional and national professional societies dedicated to allergy and clinical immunology, has proposed discarding this nomenclature. The WAO categorizes anaphylaxis as either immunologic or nonimmunologic, and this is the terminology used in this review [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-of-anaphylaxis/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Immunologic anaphylaxis &ndash; Immunologic anaphylaxis includes the following:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>IgE-mediated reactions</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Immunoglobulin G (IgG)-mediated reactions (which have not been identified in humans)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Immune <span class=\"nowrap\">complex/complement-mediated</span> reactions</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Nonimmunologic anaphylaxis &ndash; Nonimmunologic anaphylaxis is caused by agents or events that induce sudden, massive mast cell or basophil degranulation in the absence of immunoglobulins.

In brief, B cells are driven to differentiate into IgE-producing cells via the activity of the type 2 subset of CD4-bearing helper T cells (Th2 cells). This process largely takes place in the peripheral lymphoid tissues. The cytokines interleukin-4 (IL-4) and its receptors <span class=\"nowrap\">(IL-4R-alpha/gamma-c</span> and <span class=\"nowrap\">IL-4R-alpha/IL-13R-alpha-1)</span> and interleukin-13 (IL-13) and its receptor <span class=\"nowrap\">(IL-4R-alpha/IL-13R-alpha-1)</span> contribute to IgE responses in humans.</p><p>Once produced, allergen-specific IgE diffuses through the tissues and vasculature and constitutively occupies high-affinity IgE receptors (Fc-epsilon-RI) on mast cells and basophils (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F55328\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef55328 \">figure 1</a>). The generation of allergen-specific IgE is reviewed in more detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=the-biology-of-ige\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;The biology of IgE&quot;</a>.)</p><p>When allergen diffuses into the proximity of a mast cell or basophil, it interacts with any surface-bound IgE that is specific for that allergen. Certain allergens are able to interact with IgE molecules on two or more receptors of the cell surface to cause cross-linking, which in turn causes the receptors to become aggregated and initiate intracellular signaling. Allergens that are capable of cross-linking are either multivalent (having multiple identical sites for IgE antibody binding) or univalent (having multiple different sites for IgE antibody binding). If signaling is sufficiently robust, the mast cell (or basophil) becomes activated and degranulates, releasing preformed mediators, enzymes, and cytokines (such as histamine, tryptase, and tumor necrosis factor [TNF], respectively) and initiating additional mediator, cytokine, and enzyme production. Mast cell biology is discussed in more depth elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=mast-cells-surface-receptors-and-signal-transduction\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Mast cells: Surface receptors and signal transduction&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=mast-cell-derived-mediators\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Mast cell-derived mediators&quot;</a>.)</p><p>These mediators either act directly on tissues to cause allergic symptoms or recruit and activate additional inflammatory cells, particularly eosinophils [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-of-anaphylaxis/abstract/5,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,6</a>]. The recruited cells, in turn, release more mediators and propagate a fulminant &quot;chain reaction&quot; of allergic inflammation. The various mediators and cytokines involved are reviewed below. (See <a href=\"#H11\" class=\"local\">'Chemical mediators of anaphylaxis'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h3\">IgG-mediated (in animal models)</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Animal models that appear analogous to human anaphylaxis have been established in mice, pigs, and dogs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-of-anaphylaxis/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Clinically, each has some distinctive signs and symptoms. As an example, murine anaphylaxis is characterized by dramatic reductions in core body temperature and subtle cardiopulmonary differences, compared with human anaphylaxis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-of-anaphylaxis/abstract/7,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,8</a>].</p><p>In mouse models, at least two immunoglobulin G (IgG)-mediated pathways have been identified:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In one model, allergen interacts with allergen-specific IgG bound to Fc-gamma-RIII on macrophages and basophils (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F81752\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef81752 \">figure 2</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-of-anaphylaxis/abstract/5-7,9-11\" class=\"abstract_t\">5-7,9-11</a>]. This IgG-dependent pathway requires proportionately more antibody and antigen than the murine IgE-mediated pathway, and macrophage activation results primarily in the release of platelet-activating factor (PAF), rather than histamine [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-of-anaphylaxis/abstract/5,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,6</a>]. PAF causes platelet aggregation and the release of the potent vasoconstrictors thromboxane A2 and serotonin and can act directly on vascular endothelial cells to increase vascular permeability [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-of-anaphylaxis/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">There is evidence in mice that pathways of IgG- and IgE-mediated anaphylaxis are interrelated. When low doses of allergen are administered, IgG antibody can block IgE-dependent anaphylaxis by intercepting the antigen before it can cross-link mast cell- and basophil-associated IgE and by activating the inhibitory receptor, Fc-gamma-RIIb. Low doses of IgG are insufficient to induce IgG-mediated anaphylaxis, presumably because Fc-gamma-RIII has a much lower affinity than Fc-epsilon-RI [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-of-anaphylaxis/abstract/5,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,6</a>]. In comparison, high doses of allergen can precipitate IgG-dependent anaphylaxis by forming complexes that activate macrophages and basophils through Fc-gamma-RIII.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Another mouse model found evidence of the above mechanism in concert with activation of neutrophils resulting from the interaction of allergen-specific IgG2 with Fc-gamma-RIV on those cells [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-of-anaphylaxis/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. PAF was the predominant mediator in this model also.</p><p/><p>IgG-dependent anaphylaxis has not been demonstrated in humans. However, human IgG receptors are capable of activating macrophages and neutrophils to secrete PAF [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-of-anaphylaxis/abstract/5,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,14</a>], and PAF can activate mast cells in vitro [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-of-anaphylaxis/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>], so PAF potentially may contribute to human anaphylaxis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-of-anaphylaxis/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. Additionally, anaphylaxis has been reported to be more severe in individuals who catabolize PAF slowly.</p><p>Rare individuals have experienced anaphylaxis after receiving therapeutic preparations of IgG anti-IgE antibodies (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=omalizumab-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">omalizumab</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-of-anaphylaxis/abstract/17,18\" class=\"abstract_t\">17,18</a>]. Omalizumab blocks the binding of IgE to Fc-epsilon-RI receptors and does not bind Fc-epsilon-RI-associated IgE (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F59320\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef59320 \">figure 3</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-of-anaphylaxis/abstract/5,19\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,19</a>]. These anaphylactic reactions could conceivably be IgG-mediated, with the patient's IgE acting as the antigen and the IgG of the drug acting as the causative antibody [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-of-anaphylaxis/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. IgE-independent anaphylaxis has also been reported in some patients receiving another monoclonal antibody preparation, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=infliximab-including-biosimilars-of-infliximab-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">infliximab</a> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-of-anaphylaxis/abstract/20,21\" class=\"abstract_t\">20,21</a>]. More human data are needed to clarify the mechanism underlying these clinical events. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=anti-ige-therapy#H16\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Anti-IgE therapy&quot;, section on 'Adverse effects'</a>.)</p><p>On the basis of previous observations and preliminary studies, one group of investigators has hypothesized that decreased blood neutrophil Fc-gamma-RIII expression without increased IL-4R-alpha expression by T lymphocytes might be used in humans to distinguish IgG- from IgE-dependent anaphylaxis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-of-anaphylaxis/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. If observed, decreased neutrophil Fc-gamma-RIII expression would be associated with IgG-dependent anaphylaxis, whereas increased IL-4R-alpha expression would be associated with IgE-dependent events.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h3\">Immune complex/complement-mediated</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Several drugs have been implicated in immediate life-threatening reactions that are clinically similar to anaphylaxis except that drug-specific IgE could not be identified. Activation of complement by immune complexes composed of the culprit drug and IgG or other isotypes has been proposed for some of these drugs, such as protamine [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-of-anaphylaxis/abstract/23,24\" class=\"abstract_t\">23,24</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h3\">Other proposed mechanisms</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A number of non-IgE-mediated mechanisms have been proposed to explain anaphylaxis caused by radiocontrast media (RCM). One of these involves the interaction of RCM molecules with the Fc portions of IgE or IgG already bound to the mast cell or basophil surface, causing cross-linking and activation. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=immediate-hypersensitivity-reactions-to-radiocontrast-media-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-treatment\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Immediate hypersensitivity reactions to radiocontrast media: Clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and treatment&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h2\">Nonimmunologic anaphylaxis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Anaphylactic reactions to various drugs have revealed potential mechanisms by which mast cells and basophils could be activated without evidence of involvement of IgE, other antibodies, or immune complexes.</p><p>These potential mechanisms include the following:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Activation of complement, in the absence of immune complex formation, has been proposed to account for reactions to drugs that were solubilized in the diluent Cremophor EL, such as older preparations of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=propofol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">propofol</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=paclitaxel-conventional-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">paclitaxel</a> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-of-anaphylaxis/abstract/25-27\" class=\"abstract_t\">25-27</a>]. It has been proposed that under physiologic conditions, Cremophor EL formed large micelles with serum lipids and cholesterol, stimulating complement activation. Some human mast cells express receptors for the &quot;anaphylatoxins&quot; C3a and C5a and release histamine in response to exposure to these complement fragments. Macrophages and basophils also have C3a receptors and can produce PAF in response to their activation. This mechanism has been implicated in peanut-induced anaphylaxis in mice, although the significance of this in human anaphylaxis has not been demonstrated.

In a retrospective review of 10 prehospital anaphylactic fatalities in the United Kingdom, 4 of the 10 fatalities were associated with the assumption of an upright or sitting posture [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-of-anaphylaxis/abstract/96\" class=\"abstract_t\">96</a>]. Postmortem findings were consistent with pulseless electrical activity and an &quot;empty ventricle&quot; attributed to inadequate venous return secondary to vasodilation and loss of intravascular volume. This is discussed further elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fatal-anaphylaxis#H26\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Fatal anaphylaxis&quot;, section on 'Upright posture during anaphylaxis'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H27\"><span class=\"h3\">Bradycardia</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Tachycardia is the most common arrhythmia observed during anaphylaxis and is believed to develop in response to decreasing blood pressure, intravascular depletion, and endogenous catecholamines, as in other forms of shock. However, some patients present with bradycardia or with relative bradycardia (ie, initial tachycardia followed by a reduction in heart rate despite worsening hypotension). This has been reported in the setting of experimentally-induced insect sting anaphylaxis, as well as in trauma patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-of-anaphylaxis/abstract/36,97-99\" class=\"abstract_t\">36,97-99</a>].</p><p>The etiology of this bradycardia has been studied in animal models of hypovolemia. Two distinct phases of physiologic response are apparent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-of-anaphylaxis/abstract/100\" class=\"abstract_t\">100</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The initial response to hypovolemia is a baroreceptor-mediated increase in cardiac sympathetic drive and concomitant withdrawal of resting vagal drive, which together produce tachycardia and peripheral vasoconstriction.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A second phase follows when the effective arterial blood volume falls by 20 to 30 percent, which is characterized by withdrawal of vasoconstrictor drive, relative or absolute bradycardia, increased vasopressin, further catecholamine release as the adrenal axis becomes more active, and hypotension. Hypotension in this setting is independent of the bradycardia, since it persists even if the bradycardia is reversed with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=atropine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">atropine</a>.</p><p/><p>Bradycardia has also been observed in porcine anaphylaxis precipitated experimentally by various liposomal medications [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-of-anaphylaxis/abstract/101\" class=\"abstract_t\">101</a>]. In this setting, release of the anaphylatoxin C5a and adenosine acting via A1 adenosine receptors are believed to be responsible.</p><p>Conduction defects and sympatholytic medications, such as beta-blockers, may also produce bradycardia in patients with anaphylaxis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-of-anaphylaxis/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Excessive venous pooling with decreased venous return (also seen in vasodepressor reactions) may activate tension-sensitive sensory receptors in the inferoposterior portions of the left ventricle, thus resulting in a cardioinhibitory (Bezold-Jarisch) reflex that stimulates the vagus nerve and causes bradycardia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-of-anaphylaxis/abstract/90\" class=\"abstract_t\">90</a>].</p><p>The implications of relative or absolute bradycardia in human anaphylaxis and hypovolemic shock have not been studied, although one retrospective review of approximately 11,000 trauma patients found that 29 percent of hypotensive patients were bradycardic, and mortality was lower in this group compared with those who were tachycardic after adjustment for other mortality factors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-of-anaphylaxis/abstract/99\" class=\"abstract_t\">99</a>]. Thus, there may be a specific compensatory role of bradycardia in these settings.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H28\"><span class=\"h3\">Exacerbation of underlying cardiac disease</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The concurrence of acute coronary events and anaphylaxis has been noted, although the causal relationship between them is unclear [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-of-anaphylaxis/abstract/87\" class=\"abstract_t\">87</a>]. Mast cells accumulate at sites of coronary atherosclerotic plaques, and mast cell degranulation may promote plaque rupture during both acute myocardial events and anaphylaxis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-of-anaphylaxis/abstract/87,102\" class=\"abstract_t\">87,102</a>]. Coronary artery vasoconstriction and decreased intravascular volume could conceivably also precipitate an acute coronary syndrome in a patient who already had atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease. PAF induction of platelet aggregation and activation of coagulation pathways might additionally predispose to coronary artery thrombosis.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H29\"><span class=\"h2\">Respiratory system</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Anaphylaxis may have adverse effects on any part of the respiratory tract. Upper airway symptoms include sneezing, rhinorrhea, dysphonia, laryngeal edema, laryngeal obstruction, or oropharyngeal angioedema. Lower airway manifestations of anaphylaxis include cough, wheeze, pulmonary hyperinflation, edema, hemorrhage, petechiae, mucus plugging, respiratory failure, or respiratory arrest (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F66333\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef66333 \">table 1</a>).</p><p>In retrospective series of acute nonfatal anaphylaxis, respiratory signs and symptoms were observed in 40 to 60 percent of subjects, with rhinitis, <span class=\"nowrap\">dyspnea/wheeze,</span> and upper airway angioedema in up to 20, 50, and 60 percent, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-of-anaphylaxis/abstract/90\" class=\"abstract_t\">90</a>].</p><p>Similar observations have been made in cases of fatal anaphylaxis:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>One report examined 214 anaphylactic fatalities, among which the mode of death could be surmised in 196 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-of-anaphylaxis/abstract/74\" class=\"abstract_t\">74</a>]. Asphyxia was the cause of death in approximately one-half (98 cases), with involvement of the lower airways (bronchospasm) in 49, upper airway angioedema in 23, and both upper and lower airway involvement in 26. The fatalities from acute bronchospasm during anaphylaxis occurred almost exclusively in those with pre-existing asthma.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Another postmortem analysis of 23 unselected cases of fatal anaphylaxis determined that 16 of 20 &quot;immediate&quot; deaths (deaths occurring within one hour of symptom onset) were due to upper airway edema [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-of-anaphylaxis/abstract/103\" class=\"abstract_t\">103</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H31\"><span class=\"h2\">Anaerobic metabolism</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Anaerobic metabolism complicates anaphylaxis. Blood flow to the periphery is decreased to preserve perfusion of central organs, such as the brain, heart, and kidneys.</p><p>Preliminary evidence suggests that anaerobic metabolism occurs within the peripheral tissues during anaphylaxis, similar to other forms of distributive shock, although the mechanism may be distinct. In septic shock, the paradigm of distributive shock, hypotension results from decreased systemic vascular resistance. Oxygen consumption by skeletal muscle is impaired despite an increased partial pressure of oxygen, leading to anaerobic metabolism. This impairment in cellular respiration has been attributed to an unregulated inflammatory process called &quot;cytopathic hypoxia&quot; [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-of-anaphylaxis/abstract/104\" class=\"abstract_t\">104</a>].</p><p>One study compared rats with ovalbumin-induced anaphylaxis with a parallel group with severe hypotension induced experimentally by <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nicardipine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">nicardipine</a> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-of-anaphylaxis/abstract/105\" class=\"abstract_t\">105</a>]. The time course and magnitude of hypotension were similar, and both groups experienced decreased perfusion of skeletal muscle. There were metabolic differences, however:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The anaphylactic animals showed greater activation of the sympathetic nervous system, with higher plasma catecholamine levels beginning at 20 minutes, which were maintained throughout the 60-minute protocol.

This latter finding was not observed in the rats with nicardipine-induced hypotension.</p><p/><p>These findings suggest that skeletal muscle maintains high rates of oxygen utilization during anaphylaxis compared with other forms of distributive shock and that this combined with decreased perfusion leads rapidly to anaerobic metabolism [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-of-anaphylaxis/abstract/105\" class=\"abstract_t\">105</a>]. This may partly explain why end-organ injury and irreversible shock can develop so quickly.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4759211\"><span class=\"h1\">AUTOPSY FINDINGS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Victims of fatal anaphylaxis may show no distinguishing gross pathologic features at autopsy, possibly because anaphylaxis can progress to death so rapidly.

This is in keeping with the clinical observation that in patients in whom shock develops rapidly, there may be essentially no other physical signs or symptoms.</p><p>When present however, other findings include upper airway edema and petechial hemorrhages in airway mucosa, mucus plugging and hyperinflation of the lungs, and cerebral edema. Cutaneous findings, such as urticaria or angioedema, are present in only a minority of fatal cases. Autopsy findings are described in more detail elsewhere.
