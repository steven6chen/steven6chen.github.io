PUV is the most common etiology of urinary tract obstruction in the newborn male, occurring in 1 in 5000 to 8000 pregnancies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-posterior-urethral-valves/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. PUV are also the most common cause of chronic kidney disease (CKD) due to urinary tract obstruction in children [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-posterior-urethral-valves/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p>The management of PUV will be reviewed here. The clinical presentation and diagnosis of PUV are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-presentation-and-diagnosis-of-posterior-urethral-valves\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical presentation and diagnosis of posterior urethral valves&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">PRENATAL INTERVENTION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>With prenatal detection of PUV and technological advances in surgical equipment, the management of PUV has evolved to include prenatal surgical intervention. However, this remains investigational, and the vast majority of affected infants should be treated soon after birth [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-posterior-urethral-valves/abstract/3,4\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,4</a>].</p><p>The first case of prenatal surgery to relieve obstructive uropathy was performed in 1981 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-posterior-urethral-valves/abstract/5,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,6</a>]. Surgical intervention, primarily vesicoamniotic shunt placement, was based upon the rationale that restoring amniotic fluid to normal levels by shunting fetal urine from the obstructed urinary system to the amniotic space would prevent lung hypoplasia and, thus, improve neonatal survival. In addition, relief of the obstruction would also reduce back pressure and reduce injury to the developing nephron, thus improving long-term renal function postnatally. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-presentation-and-diagnosis-of-posterior-urethral-valves#H10\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical presentation and diagnosis of posterior urethral valves&quot;, section on 'Renal and urologic manifestations'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-fetal-hydronephrosis#H13\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of fetal hydronephrosis&quot;, section on 'Management'</a>.)</p><p>However, over the past three decades since the introduction of fetal intervention for obstructive uropathy, data on outcome of fetal surgery for PUV suggest that it is associated with a risk of fetal and maternal morbidity without proven benefit for long-term renal outcome.</p><p>This was illustrated in a case series from 1988 to 1991 of 40 fetuses cared for at one of the most active tertiary centers for fetal intervention [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-posterior-urethral-valves/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. Criteria for fetal intervention included normal karyotype, favorable fetal urinary electrolytes with beta-microglobulin levels predictive of normal renal function, and a detailed prenatal renal ultrasound that did not show evidence of renal cystic disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-posterior-urethral-valves/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. Of the 40 eligible fetuses, 36 underwent surgical intervention, including 14 with PUV at a mean gestational age of 22.5 weeks. In the 14 patients with PUV, procedures included placement of a vesicoamniotic shunt in nine cases, ablation of PUV in two cases, and fetal bladder marsupialization (ie, bladder was surgically opened and secured to the abdominal wall) in two cases, plus creation of a ureterostomy in one case. The following findings were noted in the 14 PUV cases:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Five deaths occurred in infants who were born prematurely and had respiratory failure.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>One pregnancy was terminated because of evidence of shunt failure and findings indicative of poor lung and renal development and function.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Eight patients were alive at a mean follow-up of 11.6 years. Five patients had chronic kidney disease (CKD) demonstrated by an elevated serum creatinine, of whom two had undergone renal transplantation, and another patient was awaiting organ donation.</p><p/><p>Similar results were seen in a case series from a single fetal treatment center of 20 fetuses with lower urinary tract obstruction, including seven with posterior urethral valves [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-posterior-urethral-valves/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. The mean gestational age was 34.6 weeks with a mean birth weight of 2.57 kg. There were two neonatal deaths due to pulmonary hypoplasia. Among the survivors, six developed end-stage renal disease (ESRD) requiring either dialysis or renal transplantation, and four had minor renal insufficiency at a mean age of 5.83 years.</p><p>In a multicenter retrospective report of 50 fetal cystoscopies performed from 2004 to 2013, laser fulguration of PUV was performed in 30fetuses [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-posterior-urethral-valves/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. Four pregnancies were terminated, and 24 live-born infants were delivered at a mean gestational age (GA) of 35 weeks. Seven infants died in the neonatal period. All infants who survived the neonatal period were alive at one year of age, including 13 with normal renal function; and at two years of life, there were 15 survivors, including 11 with normal renal function. Two patients were receiving dialysis within two years of life.</p><p>These results demonstrated a significant mortality and morbidity rate of prenatal intervention for PUV. Ongoing efforts to develop new technology and increased training and experience of the surgeon hopefully will result in improved mortality and morbidity outcome. But until that time, fetal surgery for PUV should be considered only for fetuses who have a high risk of in utero or neonatal death due to midtrimester severe oligohydramnios, and who have both a normal karyotype and evidence of good renal function based upon fetal urinary evaluation. Fetal urine evaluation is performed by urine sampling from the bladder by catheter placement under ultrasound guidance on more than one occasion. The urine from the initial drainage is discarded and a urine sample obtained after bladder refilling is sent for analysis. A favorable urine sample indicating good renal function has a urine sodium of less than 100 <span class=\"nowrap\">mmol/L,</span> chloride less than 90 <span class=\"nowrap\">mmol/L,</span> osmolality less than 210 <span class=\"nowrap\">mOsm/L,</span> and a beta-2 microglobulin less than 6 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/L</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-posterior-urethral-valves/abstract/10,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,11</a>]. If fetal surgery is being considered, it should only be performed in fetal treatment centers with considerable experience and expertise due to the risks to the mother and fetus.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">POSTNATAL MANAGEMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In patients without fetal intervention, once the diagnosis of PUV is suspected or diagnosed, initial postnatal management includes stabilization of the patient and drainage of the urinary tract.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Medical management includes correction of electrolyte abnormalities, particularly hyperkalemia, and intervention to treat respiratory distress and urosepsis. In addition, renal function is monitored before, during temporary bladder drainage, and after PUV ablation. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fluid-and-electrolyte-therapy-in-newborns\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Fluid and electrolyte therapy in newborns&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-the-management-of-chronic-kidney-disease-in-children\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of the management of chronic kidney disease in children&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-neonatal-respiratory-distress-disorders-of-transition#H15\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of neonatal respiratory distress: Disorders of transition&quot;, section on 'Management'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Temporary drainage of the urinary tract &minus; Drainage of the bladder should be done once the patient is stabilized. In most instances, temporary drainage is performed by placement of a catheter in the bladder. In some centers, primary ablation is used without initial drainage [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-posterior-urethral-valves/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].</p><p/><p>In general, we use a soft feeding tube rather than a Foley catheter with a balloon to drain the bladder. The feeding tube has a larger internal diameter, allowing for better drainage, and the inflated balloon of the Foley catheter may occlude the ureteral orifices. We typically use an 8 French or greater feeding tube depending upon the size of the urethral meatus. Ultrasonography can be used to document the correct placement of the catheter into the bladder. It is common for any type of urethral catheters to coil in the dilated posterior urethra. If urethral catheter drainage cannot be established, then emergent consultation with a pediatric urologist is necessary for cystoscopic evaluation.</p><p>Once drainage is established, the patient may have large urinary water and solute losses because of tubular dysfunction, resulting in an inability to concentrate the urine or normally absorb solutes (eg, sodium and potassium) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-posterior-urethral-valves/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. In addition, some patients with PUV due to urinary obstruction may have type IV renal tubular acidosis. As a result, careful monitoring of serum electrolyte including serum bicarbonate, and fluid status is required with timely replacement of fluid and electrolytes as needed.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Cystoscopy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Cystoscopy confirms the diagnosis with direct visualization of the PUV. In addition to advances in surgical technique and instruments, primary ablation during cystoscopy is the preferred initial surgical treatment of PUV because it is a less invasive procedure that may preserve bladder function, and it decreases the need for subsequent surgical intervention [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-posterior-urethral-valves/abstract/3,6,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,6,13</a>]. The ability to perform this procedure is determined by whether the size of the male urethra can accommodate the neonatal cystoscope. The timing of this procedure is dependent on the overall health status of the neonate and issues with general anesthesia.</p><p>Although primary ablation is not generally performed in premature infants, in one small case series of 17 low birth weight infants (median birth weight 2100 g, range 1760 to 2690 g), a Fogarty catheter under direct visual guidance of a neonatal cystoscope was used to disrupt PUV [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-posterior-urethral-valves/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. In 14 of the surviving infants (three died of causes unrelated to the procedure), voiding cystourethrography demonstrated effective ablation and adequate bladder drainage. The advantage of this technique is that it avoided long-term catheterization and the need for vesicostomy. However, the use of this technique has been very limited, and it should only be performed by an experienced pediatric urologist for the rare premature infant with obstructive uropathy due to PUV.</p><p>Valve ablation relieves the urethral obstruction in most patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-posterior-urethral-valves/abstract/3,4,15,16\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,4,15,16</a>]. With relief of bladder pressure in those patients with vesicoureteral reflux (VUR), resolution of VUR will occur in one-third of the patients after ablation.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Other procedures</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h3\">Vesicostomy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>If primary valve ablation cannot be done, generally for technical reasons, vesicostomy is the next preferred procedure as it allows good drainage of the urinary tract, which relieves back pressure, and is a reversible procedure. It also allows for the normal cyclical filling and emptying of the bladder at low vesical pressure. Vesicostomy is performed in very preterm infants in whom safe visualization or ablation of the valves is not possible.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h3\">Higher diversions</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Higher diversions with cutaneous ureterostomies and pyelostomies are rarely indicated and do not improve outcomes compared with vesicostomy. They commit a patient to subsequent major upper tract reconstruction. In addition, higher diversions disrupt the filling and emptying of the bladder, which may further impact bladder function [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-posterior-urethral-valves/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h1\">POST-PROCEDURE MANAGEMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>After a successful procedure that relieves or bypasses the intervention, management includes detecting and treating bladder dysfunction, monitoring renal function, and, if necessary, managing the consequences of chronic kidney disease (CKD).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H286558330\"><span class=\"h2\">Bladder function</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Bladder function should be evaluated by imaging and urodynamic studies. The use of clean intermittent catheterization (CIC) and anticholinergic medications lowers bladder pressures in patients with severe bladder dysfunction (ie, low capacity, poorly compliant bladders with high filling pressure). It may reduce the rate of vesicoureteral reflux, if present, post-ablation. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-presentation-and-diagnosis-of-posterior-urethral-valves#H13\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical presentation and diagnosis of posterior urethral valves&quot;, section on 'Bladder dysfunction'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-and-diagnosis-of-bladder-dysfunction-in-children\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation and diagnosis of bladder dysfunction in children&quot;</a>.)</p><p>After PUV ablation, persistent hydronephrosis <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> hydroureteronephrosis may reflect abnormal bladder function. In these patients, urodynamic studies are indicated with therapy (ie, CIC <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> anticholinergic therapy) directed towards improved bladder compliance and complete emptying [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-posterior-urethral-valves/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. The use of nocturnal bladder emptying with indwelling Foley catheter may be helpful in those patients who have persistent hydroureteronephrosis. A series of 18 boys who had successful ablation of valves showed marked improvement in hydroureteronephrosis when nighttime drainage was implemented [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-posterior-urethral-valves/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>].</p><p>In one series of 119 patients with PUV who were almost all treated with initial early bladder drainage and cystoscopy with primary ablation, one-third of patients had severe bladder dysfunction and required clean intermittent catheterization (CIC) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-posterior-urethral-valves/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. In another study, although 27 of 65 patients had symptoms of bladder dysfunction, continence was achieved in 42 of 55 toilet-trained children, and only 3 required CIC [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-posterior-urethral-valves/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. In both reports, pharmacologic treatment using anticholinergic and alpha-blocker medications was used in children depending upon the results of urodynamic testing. In a small case series of 18 patients with high voiding pressures <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> small bladder capacity, early administration of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=oxybutynin-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">oxybutynin</a> (anticholinergic agent) after PUV ablation was associated with improved bladder function on urodynamic testing prior to toilet training [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-posterior-urethral-valves/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H286558340\"><span class=\"h2\">Renal function</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Because there is a high risk of CKD in these patients, ongoing monitoring of the renal function of these patients is important. In patients with CKD, management is directed at caring for the associated complications of CKD and is discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-the-management-of-chronic-kidney-disease-in-children\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of the management of chronic kidney disease in children&quot;</a> and <a href=\"#H9\" class=\"local\">'Outcome'</a> below.)</p><p>Patients with CKD may have a urinary concentrating defect resulting in excessive urinary losses. This may overwhelm the carrying capacity of the urinary tract, resulting in an enlarged and poorly functioning bladder and persistent hydronephrosis. In these patients, nighttime catheter drainage to completely decompress the urinary tract may be an effective intervention [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-posterior-urethral-valves/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h1\">OUTCOME</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H763666\"><span class=\"h2\">Renal function</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Despite prenatal diagnosis and early intervention, a significant number of patients with PUV will develop end-stage renal disease (ESRD) as illustrated by the following case series [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-posterior-urethral-valves/abstract/3,4,22\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,4,22</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a series of 65 patients identified prenatally with PUV who were mostly treated with primary ablation as neonates between 1987 and 2004, 11 had ESRD at a median follow-up of 6.8 years (range 1 to 14.3 years) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-posterior-urethral-valves/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Six patients had undergone renal transplantation. In this report, risk factors associated with poor renal outcome included gestational age before 24 weeks at first diagnosis and the presence of oligohydramnios. The presence of renal parenchymal changes was not predictive of renal failure.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a series of 142 patients, half of whom presented as neonates, ESRD developed in 15 of 119 patients at a mean follow-up of 7.2 years. In a multivariate analysis, a nadir serum creatinine greater than 1 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> (88.4 <span class=\"nowrap\">micromol/L)</span> was most predictive of renal failure (odds ratio [OR] 71, 95% CI 10-482) followed by bladder dysfunction (OR 8.9, 95% CI 1.1-73) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-posterior-urethral-valves/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a series of 116 patients, at the end of a mean follow-up of 10.3 years, 35 had significant renal impairment with 14 requiring renal replacement therapy (renal transplantation in eight and dialysis therapy in six) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-posterior-urethral-valves/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>].</p><p/><p>Although it has been speculated that patients who present later in life might have milder disease, it remains unclear whether or not a later presentation is associated with a better outcome [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-posterior-urethral-valves/abstract/23-26\" class=\"abstract_t\">23-26</a>].</p><p>In a large case series of 315 patients from two centers treated between 1990 and 2010, patients who were prenatally diagnosed (median age of valve ablation one month, range one day to three months) compared with those diagnosed postnatally (median age of valve ablation three years, range 1 month to 15 years) were less likely to have developed chronic kidney disease (CKD) at the end of a median follow-up of 5.5 years (19 versus 40 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-posterior-urethral-valves/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. Mean serum creatinine values for the two groups were similar at diagnosis, but were lower for the prenatally diagnosed group at the end of follow-up (0.96 versus 1.75 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL)</span>. In contrast, results from two other smaller case series suggest that patients who present before one year of life were more likely to have poorer renal outcome [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-posterior-urethral-valves/abstract/27,28\" class=\"abstract_t\">27,28</a>].</p><p>These results demonstrate that a significant number of patients with PUV will have renal impairment, and some will progress to ESRD and require renal replacement therapy. Persistently elevated serum creatinine after relief of the obstruction is a risk factor for ESRD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-posterior-urethral-valves/abstract/4,23,29\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,23,29</a>]. As discussed above, the impact of the age at presentation on the risk of renal impairment remains uncertain.</p><p>Ongoing monitoring of renal function is important in this group of patients in order to anticipate associated CKD medical conditions that may require intervention, and to provide counseling to patients at risk for ESRD and their families regarding options for renal replacement therapy.
