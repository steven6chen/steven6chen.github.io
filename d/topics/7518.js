It is caused by a type of germ called a &quot;fungus.&quot;</p><p>Fungal infections happen in the toenails more often than the fingernails. They usually start on the big toe, and can affect 1 or more nails. People who have a toenail infection might also have a condition known as &quot;athlete's foot&quot; (a fungal infection of the skin on the foot). That's because certain types of fungi (plural of fungus) can cause both of these problems.</p><p>Fungi like to grow in warm and wet places. People who swim or whose feet sweat a lot might have a higher chance of getting a fungal nail infection.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H20278055\"><span class=\"h1\">What are the symptoms of a fungal nail infection?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A fungal infection can cause a nail to:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Turn white, yellow, or brown (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F66584\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef66584 \">picture 1</a>)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Get thick, change shape, or lift up</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Break off easily</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Hurt</p><p/><p>Fungal nail infections don't usually lead to serious long-term problems. But in some people they can. In people who have diabetes or whose bodies have trouble fighting infections, the nail infection can make them more likely to get other infections.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H20278070\"><span class=\"h1\">Is there a test for a fungal nail infection?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Yes. Usually, your doctor or nurse can tell if you have a fungal nail infection by talking with you and doing an exam. But to make sure, he or she might take a small sample of the nail. He or she might look at it under a microscope, or send it to a lab for another doctor to look at. Your doctor might also send the sample to a lab for a test called a &quot;culture&quot; that can show which germs are causing the infection.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H20278085\"><span class=\"h1\">Can I treat my fungal nail infection on my own?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>You can buy over-the-counter creams or products, but they usually don't work.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H20278100\"><span class=\"h1\">How are fungal nail infections treated?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Treatment depends, in part, on how severe the infection is, and how much it bothers you. If your infection is mild or doesn't bother you very much, you might choose not to treat it. An untreated nail infection probably won't go away, but it probably won't cause any long-term problems either.</p><p>When people need or choose to have treatment, it usually involves &quot;antifungal&quot; medicines that you get with a prescription from your doctor. These medicines are taken by mouth or put on the nail.</p><p>Treatment with pills usually lasts a few months. Some people who take these medicines need to have blood tests. That's because these medicines can affect the liver.</p><p>If you don't want to or can't take antifungal pills, your doctor will talk with you about other treatment options. These might include using an antifungal medicine on the nail or having surgery to remove your nail.</p><p>Before starting any of these treatments, you should know that:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>It can take many months for your nail to look normal again.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>There is a chance that the treatment won't work. The infection might not get better, or it might come back. If either of these things happen, your doctor can try another treatment or send you to a specialist.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H20278115\"><span class=\"h1\">Can fungal nail infections be prevented?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Sometimes. To reduce your chance of getting one, you can:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Keep your feet clean and dry.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Avoid sharing nail tools, such as clippers and scissors.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Wear flip-flops or other footwear in a gym shower or locker room.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H20278130\"><span class=\"h1\">What if I want to get pregnant?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>If you want to get pregnant, let your doctor or nurse know. He or she might recommend that you not take certain antifungal medicines during pregnancy.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H20278145\"><span class=\"h1\">More on this topic</span></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=reducing-the-costs-of-medicines-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Reducing the costs of medicines (The Basics)</a></p></div><div id=\"reviewProcess\"><span>All topics are updated as new evidence becomes available and our <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/home/editorial-policy\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"policy policy_editorialpolicy\">peer review process</a> is complete.</span></div><div id=\"topicRetrievedDate\"><span class=\"emphasis\">This topic retrieved from UpToDate on: </span>Apr 03, 2018.</div><div id=\"disclaimer\">The content on the UpToDate website is not intended nor recommended as a substitute for medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.
