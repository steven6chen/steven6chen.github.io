Failure of enteral supplements, dietary counseling, and appetite stimulation frequently leads to a decision about the use of tube feeding [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gastrostomy-tubes-uses-patient-selection-and-efficacy-in-adults/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p>Enteral access must be obtained for tube feeding to begin. Temporary access can be achieved with a nasogastric or nasoenteric feeding tube. These tubes are easily placed at the bedside and can also be easily removed. Unfortunately, they often fail secondary to clogging or inadvertent dislodgement, and do not provide a secure access route for the provision of nutrition, medications, or fluids [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gastrostomy-tubes-uses-patient-selection-and-efficacy-in-adults/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. More permanent enteral access can be obtained either endoscopically, surgically, or with interventional radiology, resulting in either a gastrostomy or jejunostomy. Percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) tube placement has developed into a common procedure to obtain gastric access. The development of the PEG procedure and standardized PEG kits was an important technological advance in the enteral access field. </p><p>This topic will review conditions for which gastrostomy tubes are placed, the selection of patients for gastrostomy tube placement, and the available evidence on effectiveness of gastrostomy tubes. The placement, care, and complications of endoscopically placed gastrostomy tubes are discussed separately.

Commonly, PEG tubes are used to provide a route for enteral feeding, hydration, and medication administration in patients who are likely to have prolonged inadequate or absent oral intake. The decision to place a gastrostomy tube in a given patient must take into account the indication for the gastrostomy tube, the patient's prognosis, the goals of treatment, and the patient and family's beliefs and desires.

In patients with significant regurgitation, a jejunal extension should be placed if possible.</p><p/><p>Among patients in long-term care facilities, the decision to place a gastrostomy tube often relies on the opinions of health care workers and patients' families regarding the appropriateness of gastrostomy tube insertion and nutrition. The opinion of the family appears to weigh heavily in the overall decision-making process. This was illustrated by a study of 180 clinicians who were interviewed regarding their decision to start tube feedings in a hypothetical patient population [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gastrostomy-tubes-uses-patient-selection-and-efficacy-in-adults/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. The majority of clinicians (90 percent) felt that initiating tube feedings was the right decision if family members were in agreement with the decision. On the other hand, only 50 percent of clinicians still believed that initiating tube feedings was the right decision when the family members or the patient were not in agreement with the decision. Clinicians concerned with the legal aspects of nutrition were more inclined to believe that tube feedings should be initiated, while those clinicians more concerned with health care costs were more likely not to initiate tube feeding.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H256117121\"><span class=\"h1\">EFFICACY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Placing a gastrostomy tube provides enteral access for the administration of nutrition, hydration, and medications. However, whether the establishment of enteral access with a gastrostomy tube is beneficial for many patients is unclear. Gastrostomy tube placement appears to be beneficial in patients with dysphagic stroke, brain injury, neurodegenerative diseases, and obstruction due to head, neck, and esophageal cancer. The benefits are less clear in patients with dementia. In patients at risk for aspiration, gastrostomy tubes may be superior to nasogastric tubes for the delivery of enteral nutrition. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h2\">Mixed patient populations</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Whether gastrostomy tube placement improves outcomes such as survival, functional status, and quality of life in patients overall is unclear, since randomized trials comparing gastrostomy tube placement with alternative care strategies are lacking. Gastrostomy tube placement is associated with high short-term survival but low long-term survival, since patients often die from their underlying illnesses. Studies suggest that gastrostomy tube placement may not improve outcomes such as functional and nutritional status, though it may be associated with improved quality of life.

Short-term mortality is mostly related to the underlying disease process rather than to the gastrostomy tube itself [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gastrostomy-tubes-uses-patient-selection-and-efficacy-in-adults/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. The high long-term mortality rates following gastrostomy tube placement reflect the severe disability and comorbidities of the patients in whom gastrostomy tubes are most commonly placed.</p><p>One study examined 136 patients whose indications for percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) were cancer (49 percent) or non cancer diagnoses (51 percent), the majority of which were stroke or amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gastrostomy-tubes-uses-patient-selection-and-efficacy-in-adults/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. Survival was 90 percent at one month. A similar one-month survival rate (83 percent) was observed in a series of 317 patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gastrostomy-tubes-uses-patient-selection-and-efficacy-in-adults/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>].

The in-hospital mortality rate was 11 percent. Factors associated with an increased risk of death included increasing age, presence of comorbid illnesses such as heart failure and renal failure, and PEG tube placement for an indication other than head and neck cancer. Factors associated with lower mortality rates included female sex, diabetes mellitus, and paralysis.</p><p>A few studies have described the survival rate with long-term follow-up. The available data suggest that long-term survival rates are low (approximately 40 percent at 12 to 18 months, and as low as 20 percent at three years) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gastrostomy-tubes-uses-patient-selection-and-efficacy-in-adults/abstract/5,8,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,8,15</a>]: </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The largest report focused on 80,000 Medicare patients who had undergone PEG or surgical gastrostomy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gastrostomy-tubes-uses-patient-selection-and-efficacy-in-adults/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. The majority (75 percent) were more than 75 years of age. The most common indications for gastrostomy tube placement were cerebrovascular disease, neoplasms, fluid and electrolyte disorders, and aspiration pneumonia.

Survival was better for women, for patients without diabetes, and for patients undergoing gastrostomy tube placement for conditions or diseases of the central nervous system (CNS). The most common CNS indication was hemispheric stroke. The majority of patients (65 percent) were discharged to a nursing home, while 6 percent were discharged to other local hospitals; only a minority were discharged to home.</p><p/><p>Mortality rates have also been compared between patients who undergo gastrostomy tube placement and patients who decline the intervention. In a series of 1327 patients for whom gastrostomy tube placement was recommended, 304 patients (23 percent) declined to undergo the procedure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gastrostomy-tubes-uses-patient-selection-and-efficacy-in-adults/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. The primary indications for gastrostomy tube placement were oropharyngeal malignancy and progressive neurologic conditions. Compared with patients who underwent gastrostomy tube placement, the patients who did not had higher mortality rates at 30 days (36 versus 11 percent) and at one year (74 versus 41 percent). </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h3\">Functional and nutritional status</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In addition to increasing survival, goals of gastrostomy tube placement for enteral feeding include improving functional and nutritional status [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gastrostomy-tubes-uses-patient-selection-and-efficacy-in-adults/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. However, observational studies suggest that gastrostomy tube placement may not lead to significant improvements in these outcomes.</p><p>An illustrative series included 150 patients who underwent gastrostomy tube placement in a community setting during a 14-month period [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gastrostomy-tubes-uses-patient-selection-and-efficacy-in-adults/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. Indications for gastrostomy tube placement included cerebral vascular accident (41 percent), neurodegenerative disorders (35 percent), and cancer (13 percent). The neurodegenerative class was not defined but was presumed to be dementia. Subjective ratings on health and performance were collected before and after gastrostomy tube placement. Survival was 78 percent at one month and 40 percent at one year, and was similar in all three groups. In patients surviving at least 60 days, 70 percent had <strong>no</strong> improvement in functional status, subjective health status, or nutritional status. In addition, the majority of the patients required assistance with many activities of daily living and were incapable of communicating verbally.</p><p>A limitation of this study is that it did not include a control group. As a result, it could not make definitive conclusions regarding the outcomes in patients who underwent gastrostomy tube placement versus those who did not, and it is possible that functional status would have deteriorated further without the benefit of nutritional supplementation. It also may have been unrealistic to expect significant improvements in functional or health status based on the severity of the patients' debilitation from their primary disease processes. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h3\">Quality of life</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The effect of gastrostomy tube placement on quality of life is unclear.

An overall positive effect on quality of life was reported by 55 percent of patients and 80 percent of caregivers. Improvement in quality of life did not necessarily correlate with an improvement in nutritional status.

However, the effects of gastrostomy tube placement on outcomes such as functional status and quality of life are unclear, in part because assessing quality-of-life is difficult in patients with dementia or other types of central nervous system impairment. In addition, the value of gastrostomy tubes in the subset of patients with dementia is unclear. (See <a href=\"#H256117485\" class=\"local\">'Dementia'</a> below.)</p><p>Much of the published clinical experience with gastrostomy tubes has been limited to the acute care setting. Long-term care facilities (LTCFs) account for a large proportion of patients who have undergone gastrostomy tube placement. LTCFs frequently prefer gastrostomy tubes to nasogastric tubes because of their reliability [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gastrostomy-tubes-uses-patient-selection-and-efficacy-in-adults/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. In addition, a gastrostomy tube can provide for reliable delivery of calories to patients who have partial swallowing function and require supervised, labor-intensive feedings.

Nasogastric tubes are appropriate if enteral nutrition is likely to be needed for less than four weeks [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gastrostomy-tubes-uses-patient-selection-and-efficacy-in-adults/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]. However, if long-term enteral access is required (typically in patients with dysphagic stroke), a gastrostomy tube can be placed. Gastrostomy tube placement can be deferred for two to three weeks to determine whether spontaneous recovery will develop and to allow time to discuss the risks and benefits of gastrostomy tube insertion. A meta-analysis found that, compared with nasogastric tubes, gastrostomy tubes were associated with fewer treatment failures, fewer gastrointestinal bleeding episodes, higher feed delivery, and improvements in mid-arm circumference and pressures sores [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gastrostomy-tubes-uses-patient-selection-and-efficacy-in-adults/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>]. However, they were not associated with improved survival.</p><p>A systematic review evaluated observational studies of enteral feeding in patients with ALS [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gastrostomy-tubes-uses-patient-selection-and-efficacy-in-adults/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>]. A benefit with gastrostomy tube placement with regard to improved nutritional indices and survival was seen in studies that included a control group. PEG tube placement has been shown to be safe in patients with ALS who have a forced vital capacity &lt;50 percent (severely impaired) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gastrostomy-tubes-uses-patient-selection-and-efficacy-in-adults/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H256117485\"><span class=\"h3\">Dementia</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Dementia frequently leads to anorexia, dysphagia, and weight loss. As a result, it is a common reason for referring patients for gastrostomy tube placement (approximately 36,000 are placed each year in the United States) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gastrostomy-tubes-uses-patient-selection-and-efficacy-in-adults/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>]. The role of gastrostomy tubes in patients with dementia is controversial because patients with dementia are usually severely impaired and frequently near death [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gastrostomy-tubes-uses-patient-selection-and-efficacy-in-adults/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>], and the American Geriatric Society recommends careful hand feeding be offered as an alternative to tube feeding for patients with advanced dementia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gastrostomy-tubes-uses-patient-selection-and-efficacy-in-adults/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>]. The benefit of providing enteral nutrition to patients with dementia is unclear, a situation similar to that of patients with terminal malignancies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gastrostomy-tubes-uses-patient-selection-and-efficacy-in-adults/abstract/38,39\" class=\"abstract_t\">38,39</a>]. In addition, observational studies have not consistently shown that enteral tube feeding in patients with dementia leads to improvements in survival or quality of life [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gastrostomy-tubes-uses-patient-selection-and-efficacy-in-adults/abstract/40,41\" class=\"abstract_t\">40,41</a>], though the studies are limited because variations in the severity of the patients' illnesses may have influenced the decision to place a gastrostomy tube [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gastrostomy-tubes-uses-patient-selection-and-efficacy-in-adults/abstract/42-44\" class=\"abstract_t\">42-44</a>].

Similarly, a subsequent large database study that looked at a cohort of more than 36,000 patients with dementia found no survival benefit with tube feeding compared with no tube feeding [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gastrostomy-tubes-uses-patient-selection-and-efficacy-in-adults/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>].</p><p>However, the use of survival as the primary outcome marker for the effectiveness of gastrostomy tube placement in patients with dementia may not be justified. Other issues related to quality of life, such as providing a means to deliver medications, maintaining hydration, and relieving pain and suffering may be important for these individuals. However, it is difficult if not impossible to measure quality of life in patients with advanced dementia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gastrostomy-tubes-uses-patient-selection-and-efficacy-in-adults/abstract/23,35\" class=\"abstract_t\">23,35</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H60580446\"><span class=\"h2\">Patients with cancer</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients with cancer may require gastrostomy tube placement either because of weight loss and malnutrition or because of oropharyngeal or esophageal obstruction.

There may be a reduction in aspiration events in patients who are fed with a gastrostomy tube compared with those fed through a nasogastric tube. In addition, patients with gastrostomy tubes and regurgitation who are fed directly into the small bowel may have a lower risk of aspiration compared with those fed via the stomach. If a gastrostomy tube is being considered to decrease the risk of aspiration in a patient with regurgitation, we suggest placing a tube with a jejunal extension if there is local expertise in the placement and maintenance of the these tubes. Elevating the head of the bed to about 30 degrees may also reduce the risk of aspiration in patients receiving continuous tube feeds [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gastrostomy-tubes-uses-patient-selection-and-efficacy-in-adults/abstract/45\" class=\"abstract_t\">45</a>].</p><p>Studies are lacking that compare the incidence of aspiration among patients with dementia who are hand fed, those who are fed with a nasogastric tube, and those who are fed through a gastrostomy tube. Some data are available for patients with dysphagia following a stroke. In a study of 126 patients who underwent gastrostomy tube placement after suffering a dysphagic stroke, aspiration pneumonia occurred in 22 patients (18 percent) during 77 patient-years of follow-up [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gastrostomy-tubes-uses-patient-selection-and-efficacy-in-adults/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>].

However, jejunostomy feeding has been shown to prevent aspiration of nutrient solutions, leading most experts and professional societies to recommend feeding deep into the small bowel in patients with regurgitation and aspiration of feeding solutions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gastrostomy-tubes-uses-patient-selection-and-efficacy-in-adults/abstract/52,53\" class=\"abstract_t\">52,53</a>]. Options for long-term jejunal feeding include gastrostomy tube placement with a jejunal extension tube (J-tube), surgical insertion of a feeding tube into the small bowel, or percutaneous endoscopic jejunostomy (PEJ). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=enteral-feeding-gastric-versus-post-pyloric\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Enteral feeding: Gastric versus post-pyloric&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The most common approach to long-term jejunal feeding is placement of a gastrostomy tube with a J-tube extension (gastrojejunostomy tube). However, the tubes frequently become displaced into the stomach and, due to their smaller diameter, the tubes are more prone to clogging. Overall, tube dysfunction is reported in 27 to 84 percent of cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gastrostomy-tubes-uses-patient-selection-and-efficacy-in-adults/abstract/54\" class=\"abstract_t\">54</a>].

Gastrostomy tube placement appears to be beneficial in patients with dysphagic stroke, brain injury, neurodegenerative diseases, and obstruction due to head, neck, and esophageal cancer. The benefits are less clear in patients with dementia. In patients at risk for aspiration, gastrostomy tubes may be superior to nasogastric tubes for the delivery of enteral nutrition.
