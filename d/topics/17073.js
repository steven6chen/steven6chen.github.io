It is the most frequent acute illness in the United States and throughout the industrialized world [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-common-cold-in-adults-treatment-and-prevention/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. The term &quot;common cold&quot; refers to a mild upper respiratory viral infection involving, to variable degrees, nasal congestion and discharge (rhinorrhea), sneezing, sore throat, cough, low-grade fever, headache, and malaise. The common cold is a separate and distinct entity, distinguishable from influenza, bacterial pharyngitis, acute bronchitis, acute bacterial sinusitis, allergic rhinitis, and pertussis.</p><p>Treatment and prevention for the common cold are reviewed here. The epidemiology and clinical manifestations of colds are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=the-common-cold-in-adults-diagnosis-and-clinical-features\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;The common cold in adults: Diagnosis and clinical features&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H122950470\"><span class=\"h1\">PROGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>For most people and most colds, symptoms are self-limited. The common cold is usually an uncomplicated illness; however, occasionally, patients may develop complications (eg, sinusitis, lower respiratory tract disease, asthma exacerbations, acute otitis media). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=the-common-cold-in-adults-diagnosis-and-clinical-features#H11414490\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;The common cold in adults: Diagnosis and clinical features&quot;, section on 'Incubation period and symptom duration'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=the-common-cold-in-adults-diagnosis-and-clinical-features#H9\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;The common cold in adults: Diagnosis and clinical features&quot;, section on 'Complications'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">MILD SYMPTOMS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Most patients with mild symptoms do not require any symptomatic therapies. Such patients should be advised to return for review if their condition worsens or exceeds the expected time for recovery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-common-cold-in-adults-treatment-and-prevention/abstract/2,3\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,3</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=the-common-cold-in-adults-diagnosis-and-clinical-features#H11414490\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;The common cold in adults: Diagnosis and clinical features&quot;, section on 'Incubation period and symptom duration'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H122950502\"><span class=\"h1\">MODERATE TO SEVERE SYMPTOMS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Symptomatic therapy remains the mainstay of common cold treatment. Patients with moderate to severe symptoms may use a variety of therapies to relieve symptoms.</p><p>Although extensive, published reports on treatment of the common cold often suffer from methodological flaws: inconsistent definitions of disease, different measured symptom outcomes, mixing of subjective and objective findings, and variable age ranges. Furthermore, most trials are complicated by the underlying (and generally incorrect) assumption that the &quot;common cold&quot; is a single entity rather than a collection of widely varying viral etiologies, each with its own pathophysiologic idiosyncrasies. Together, these often result in important inconsistencies in reported findings. Commonly considered interventions with sufficient data available for evaluation are discussed below.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3247441674\"><span class=\"h2\">Therapies that may be effective</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The following therapies may be effective and are options for patients with moderate to severe symptoms. Choice of therapy will depend on what symptoms predominate, and we do not favor any one of the following treatments over others:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Analgesics may be used to relieve associated symptoms (eg, headache, ear pain, muscle and joint pains, malaise, and sneezing).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Symptomatic treatments for nasal symptoms that have moderate evidence of efficacy include a combination product containing an antihistamine and a decongestant, <span class=\"nowrap\">intranasal/inhaled</span> <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cromolyn-sodium-cromoglicate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cromolyn</a> sodium, or intranasal <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ipratropium-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ipratropium</a> bromide.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Cough associated with the common cold may be caused by nasal obstruction or postnasal drip. We suggest symptomatic treatment for cough suppression with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dextromethorphan-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">dextromethorphan</a>. Treatment for postnasal drip is discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-subacute-and-chronic-cough-in-adults#H4\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of subacute and chronic cough in adults&quot;, section on 'Upper airway cough syndrome'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2112854611\"><span class=\"h3\">Analgesics</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Available data suggest that <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acetaminophen-paracetamol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">acetaminophen</a> and nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are roughly equivalent at relieving some symptoms (eg, headache, ear pain, muscle and joint pains, malaise, and sneezing) associated with common cold, and that short courses of standard doses in this setting are generally safe and well-tolerated [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-common-cold-in-adults-treatment-and-prevention/abstract/4-6\" class=\"abstract_t\">4-6</a>]. In one randomized trial involving nearly 400 patients with upper respiratory tract infections, acetaminophen and NSAIDs were more effective than placebo in reducing headache, achiness, and feverish discomfort [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-common-cold-in-adults-treatment-and-prevention/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. NSAIDs may be helpful in decreasing some cold symptoms (headache, ear pain, muscle and joint pain), but a meta-analysis found that NSAIDS did not improve cough or nasal discharge and did not significantly reduce the total symptom score or duration of colds [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-common-cold-in-adults-treatment-and-prevention/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2676209899\"><span class=\"h3\">Antihistamine/decongestant combinations</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The combination of antihistamines and decongestants may be more beneficial than either component alone. Antihistamine use alone in patients with the common cold, however, is of minimal benefit and frequently results in troublesome side effects. (See <a href=\"#H427160986\" class=\"local\">'Antihistamines'</a> below.)</p><p>In a systematic review of combination products, the number needed to treat for symptom benefit compared with placebo was four (95% CI 3-5.6) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-common-cold-in-adults-treatment-and-prevention/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. For antihistamine-analgesic-decongestant products, the number needed to treat for benefit was 5.6 (CI 3.8-10.2). Patients experienced more adverse effects (drowsiness, dry mouth, insomnia, and dizziness) with combination products than control interventions, but the difference was not significant.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2530680479\"><span class=\"h3\">Dextromethorphan</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>We suggest symptomatic treatment for cough suppression with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dextromethorphan-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">dextromethorphan</a>. Antitussive therapy is rarely needed during the initial stages of illness and is of variable efficacy later in the course of infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-common-cold-in-adults-treatment-and-prevention/abstract/8,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,9</a>]. When needed, dextromethorphan may provide symptom relief with cough suppression. A meta-analysis including six randomized trials comparing dextromethorphan with placebo concluded that dextromethorphan 30 mg was effective for cough suppression, with an average treatment difference of 12 to 17 percent favoring dextromethorphan [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-common-cold-in-adults-treatment-and-prevention/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h3\">Intranasal/inhaled cromolyn sodium</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Various formulations of intranasal or inhalational <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cromolyn-sodium-cromoglicate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cromolyn</a> sodium are available over the counter. Cromolyn sodium administered intranasally <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> by inhalation may improve cold symptoms. A randomized study of 118 adult patients with symptoms of rhinorrhea, throat pain, or cough for less than 24 hours compared the use of sodium cromoglycate dry powder (20 mg per inhalation in spincaps), sodium cromoglycate aqueous nasal spray (5.2 mg per dose), or matching placebos every two hours during waking hours on days 1 and 2, and four times daily on days 3 to 7 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-common-cold-in-adults-treatment-and-prevention/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. Symptoms resolved faster in patients treated with sodium cromoglycate than with placebo. Side effects were mild and did not differ among the three treatment groups.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1006178088\"><span class=\"h3\">Intranasal ipratropium bromide</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Symptoms of rhinorrhea and sneezing may be improved by the use of intranasal <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ipratropium-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ipratropium</a> bromide, though nasal congestion is not affected. A systematic review of seven trials comparing ipratropium and placebo (2144 participants) found improvement in rhinorrhea with ipratropium, although the possibility of inadequate blinding raises the potential for bias [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-common-cold-in-adults-treatment-and-prevention/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. The systematic review found a twofold increase in side effects (nasal dryness, blood-tinged mucus, and epistaxis) in patients assigned to ipratropium.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3295158614\"><span class=\"h2\">Therapies with minimal or uncertain benefits</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>We generally start treatment with therapies that may be effective. Decongestants, saline nasal spray, and expectorants are of minimal or uncertain benefit. They may be reasonable options in some patients who are not able to tolerate the more effective therapies. Although <a href=\"topic.htm?path=zinc-sulfate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">zinc sulfate</a> lozenges and syrup may decrease cold symptom severity and duration, we suggest not using zinc preparations because of uncertain benefits and known toxicities, including irreversible anosmia, for some preparations. (See <a href=\"#H3247441674\" class=\"local\">'Therapies that may be effective'</a> above.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3146296627\"><span class=\"h3\">Decongestants</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Topical and oral decongestants, such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pseudoephedrine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">pseudoephedrine</a>, may offer mild relief of nasal congestion associated with the common cold when used alone [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-common-cold-in-adults-treatment-and-prevention/abstract/7,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,13</a>]. A 2007 meta-analysis suggested a net 6 percent decrease in subjective symptoms after a single dose of decongestant compared with use of a placebo [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-common-cold-in-adults-treatment-and-prevention/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. Repeated doses of nasal decongestants produced a small and probably clinically insignificant benefit (approximately 4 percent) over three to five days.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Oral</strong> &ndash; <a href=\"topic.htm?path=phenylephrine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Phenylephrine</a> is less effective than <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pseudoephedrine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">pseudoephedrine</a> for treatment of rhinitis symptoms. Most studies suggest that 10 mg of phenylephrine (the dose commonly used in most cold products) is not more effective than placebo [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-common-cold-in-adults-treatment-and-prevention/abstract/14,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">14,15</a>]. In the United States, the sale of medications containing pseudoephedrine is restricted, as it can be used to manufacture amphetamine drugs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-common-cold-in-adults-treatment-and-prevention/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Topical</strong> &ndash; Topical decongestant use should be limited to two to three days because rebound rhinitis can occur after 72 hours of use. The use of topical decongestants may occasionally be complicated by nosebleeds, agitation, insomnia, and worsened hypertensive control in patients with preexisting hypertension. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=an-overview-of-rhinitis#H7\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;An overview of rhinitis&quot;, section on 'Nasal decongestant sprays'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4013162813\"><span class=\"h3\">Saline nasal spray</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Saline nasal sprays may help nasal symptoms of the common cold. A 2015 systematic review of saline nasal irrigation for acute upper respiratory infections concluded that there may be symptomatic benefits, but there was limited evidence to support this conclusion, as the available trials were small and had a high risk of bias [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-common-cold-in-adults-treatment-and-prevention/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2721543170\"><span class=\"h3\">Expectorants</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The expectorant <a href=\"topic.htm?path=guaifenesin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">guaifenesin</a> had a marginal effect compared with placebo in one randomized trial [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-common-cold-in-adults-treatment-and-prevention/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. However, a 2014 systematic review concluded that there was no good evidence for or against the effectiveness of over-the-counter medications (including guaifenesin, mucolytics, and combination medications) for acute cough [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-common-cold-in-adults-treatment-and-prevention/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H857850594\"><span class=\"h3\">Herbal products</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>An herbal preparation derived from the roots of <em>Pelargonium sidoides</em> (EPs 7630) has been evaluated in two randomized trials and reported to reduce symptom severity in the common cold [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-common-cold-in-adults-treatment-and-prevention/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>], as well as in acute bronchitis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-common-cold-in-adults-treatment-and-prevention/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>].

Systematic reviews have found that zinc intake is associated with a reduction in the duration and severity of cold symptoms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-common-cold-in-adults-treatment-and-prevention/abstract/21-23\" class=\"abstract_t\">21-23</a>]. In one review that included 16 therapeutic trials (five included only children and the remainder both adults and children), various zinc preparations were taken every 1.5 to 2.0 hours while awake for a minimum of five days [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-common-cold-in-adults-treatment-and-prevention/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. Zinc administered within 24 hours of onset of cold symptoms, compared with placebo, resulted in a decrease in the proportion of participants who had symptoms after seven days of treatment (odds ratio [OR] 0.45, 95% CI 0.2-1.00). The trials used a variety of zinc formulations (syrup, tablets, lozenges) and doses, and no firm conclusions could be drawn about specific treatment recommendations. Another review found that zinc doses greater than 75 mg daily were effective in reducing the duration of symptoms, but lower doses were not [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-common-cold-in-adults-treatment-and-prevention/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. Another systematic review of 17 trials found that zinc reduced symptom duration (mean difference -1.65 days, 95% CI -2.5 to -0.8) in adults; there was significant heterogeneity among trials [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-common-cold-in-adults-treatment-and-prevention/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. Adverse effects, including bad taste and nausea, were common in the zinc group in all reviews.</p><p>The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) issued a public health advisory advising that over-the-counter zinc-containing intranasal products (Zicam) should not be used because of multiple reports of permanent anosmia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-common-cold-in-adults-treatment-and-prevention/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. Zinc is also available in a homeopathic preparation as intranasal <a href=\"topic.htm?path=zinc-gluconate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">zinc gluconate</a> for the treatment and prevention for colds.

Treatment with antibiotics for uncomplicated upper respiratory tract infections causes more harm than benefit [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-common-cold-in-adults-treatment-and-prevention/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. A systematic review of randomized trials in patients (including children) with upper respiratory symptoms for fewer than seven days found that the persistence of symptoms was identical in groups who received antibiotics or placebo (risk ratio [RR] 0.95, 95% CI 0.59-1.51) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-common-cold-in-adults-treatment-and-prevention/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>].

First-generation antihistamines, such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diphenhydramine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">diphenhydramine</a>, may alleviate rhinorrhea and sneezing, but their use is limited by side effects such as sedation and drying of the eyes, nose, and mouth [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-common-cold-in-adults-treatment-and-prevention/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. A systematic review of 18 trials concluded that antihistamines improved the severity of symptoms slightly more often than placebo for the first one to two days of treatment but offered no benefit after 6 to 10 days of treatment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-common-cold-in-adults-treatment-and-prevention/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. The sedating antihistamines may have small symptomatic benefits, but these were clinically non-significant and outweighed by the frequency of side effects.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1671286297\"><span class=\"h3\">Antiviral therapies</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Antiviral and NSAIDs have been studied for the treatment of the common cold, with some evidence of effectiveness. However, the results cannot be directly applied to patients with naturally occurring colds until the efficacy, safety, and practicality of treatment with antiviral therapy has been demonstrated, and they are not generalizable to the majority of colds. Directed antiviral therapy for the common cold is complicated by the wide array of potential viral etiologies, rarity with which an etiologic agent is identified, and paucity of agents with proven efficacy.</p><p>The combination of antiviral and NSAIDs was tested in a randomized clinical trial involving 150 healthy adults experimentally inoculated with rhinovirus, where patients were randomly assigned to treatment with intranasal interferon (IFN)-alpha-2b (active against rhinovirus) plus <a href=\"topic.htm?path=chlorpheniramine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">chlorpheniramine</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ibuprofen-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ibuprofen</a>, intranasal placebo plus chlorpheniramine and ibuprofen, or intranasal and oral placebos [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-common-cold-in-adults-treatment-and-prevention/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]. Subjects receiving the regimen containing intranasal IFN had a 33 to 73 percent reduction in symptom scores as well as significantly reduced volumes of nasal mucus production and reduced virus concentrations in their nasal mucus. The incidence of nasal dryness, nasal irritation, and blood-tinged nasal mucus was similar in all three study groups. Although this study showed benefit of antiviral therapy with rhinovirus infections, these results are not generalizable to the majority of colds, which are non-rhinovirus in origin.

A 2015 meta-analysis of 12 randomized trials including both children and adults comparing placebo with probiotics (various strains of lactobacilli and <em>Bifidobacterium</em>) found that probiotics decreased the number of individuals experiencing at least one episode of acute respiratory infection (odds ratio [OR] 0.53, 95% CI 0.37-0.76) and mean duration of illness (mean difference -1.89, 95% CI -2.03 to -1.75) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-common-cold-in-adults-treatment-and-prevention/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>].

A 2015 systematic review and meta-analysis found four randomized trials that evaluated the effect of exercise on the number of acute respiratory infections per year [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-common-cold-in-adults-treatment-and-prevention/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>].

The meta-analysis found no differences in the number of acute respiratory infection episodes between exercise and nonexercise groups. The two randomized trials that were included had disparate results. One randomized trial of 115 overweight, sedentary, postmenopausal women found that moderate intensity exercise sustained over one year appeared to decrease the incidence of self-reported colds [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-common-cold-in-adults-treatment-and-prevention/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]. The risk of cold was three times higher in the control group (once weekly stretching) compared with the intervention group (exercising five times a week). Several factors may have influenced these results: the diagnosis of cold was based on self-reporting, the overall incidence of upper respiratory infections was not different between groups, and the rate of influenza vaccine usage was higher among controls. A subsequent randomized trial, compared no intervention with exercise (45 minutes daily at home plus 2.5 hours per week of group sessions) or mindfulness meditation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-common-cold-in-adults-treatment-and-prevention/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>].

The generalizability of this finding to adults, in whom colds occur less frequently, is not known.

However, there was a 50 percent decrease in the incidence of colds in a subset of patients exposed to vigorous activity, especially in extreme conditions (marathon runners, skiers, and soldiers in sub-arctic). The reasons for the apparent benefit in this subset of patients are uncertain.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Vitamin D</strong> &ndash; A role for vitamin D in the prevention of upper respiratory infections was suggested by data from a United States survey population (3<sup>rd</sup> NHANES) that found a relationship between higher serum levels of 25-hydroxyvitamin D and fewer reported respiratory infections [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-common-cold-in-adults-treatment-and-prevention/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>].

Although vitamin E did not have a statistically significant positive effect on the overall risk of lower respiratory infections, a post hoc analysis suggested a modest reduction in the incidence of the common cold (0.67 versus 0.81 per person per year, relative risk [RR] 0.83, 95% CI.68-1.01) in patients receiving vitamin E. In addition, fewer patients treated with vitamin E had multiple colds (40 versus 48 percent). Findings from such post hoc analyses should be viewed with skepticism unless further studies confirm a benefit. In addition, studies have shown that higher-dose vitamin E (400 international <span class=\"nowrap\">units/day</span> or greater) may increase all-cause mortality and should be avoided [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-common-cold-in-adults-treatment-and-prevention/abstract/45\" class=\"abstract_t\">45</a>].
