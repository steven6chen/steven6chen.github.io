These changes are critical to successful breastfeeding.</p><p>The physiology of lactation is reviewed here. The stages of breast development and breast anatomy are discussed elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=breast-development-and-morphology\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Breast development and morphology&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">ANATOMIC CHANGES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The breast is composed of a stroma consisting of fat and connective tissue that supports a tubuloalveolar parenchyma (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F88523\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef88523 \">figure 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/physiology-of-lactation/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. The normal breast tissue of adult women contains three types of lobules, known as types 1, 2, and 3. Formation of type 1 lobules (Lob 1) begins with puberty (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F52636\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef52636 \">picture 1</a>). The changing levels of estrogen and progesterone during menstrual cycles stimulate Lob 1 to sprout new alveolar buds and evolve to more mature structures called type 2 and type 3 lobules (Lob 2 and 3) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F76317\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef76317 \">picture 2</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F64382\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef64382 \">picture 3</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F72142\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef72142 \">picture 4</a>). After puberty is completed, further maturation of the breast does not occur except during pregnancy. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=breast-development-and-morphology\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Breast development and morphology&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Pregnancy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The alveolar development and maturation of the epithelium that occurs in response to the hormonal changes of pregnancy is known as stage II mammogenesis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/physiology-of-lactation/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Progesterone plays an important role in stimulating alveolar development during this phase [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/physiology-of-lactation/abstract/2,3\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,3</a>].</p><p>The maximum branching capability of the breast is expressed during this period. The secretory acinus that is formed represents a terminal outgrowth that marks the full extent of glandular differentiation.</p><p>The increased volume of breast tissue during pregnancy results from the development and proliferation of secretory tissue. Normal postpartum mammary function is therefore associated with some increase in the size of the breast during pregnancy.</p><p>The development of the breast during pregnancy occurs in two distinct phases, with characteristic early and late stages. Ductular sprouting predominates in the first trimester, while lobular formation exceeds ductal sprouting in the second trimester (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F76317\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef76317 \">picture 2</a>).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h3\">Early pregnancy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Under the influence of chorionic gonadotropin, many secretory glands develop from each bud, forming the type 3 lobule (Lob 3). Further proliferation of the distal elements of the ductal tree marks the progression from Lob 3 to a type 4 lobule (Lob 4) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F72142\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef72142 \">picture 4</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F51142\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef51142 \">picture 5</a>). In these newly formed lobules, the epithelial cells composing each acinus not only increase greatly in number due to active cell division, but also increase in cellular size [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/physiology-of-lactation/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].</p><p>In mid-pregnancy, the lobules continue to enlarge and increase in number. They surround the ducts so thickly that the chief duct, the terminal or intralobular terminal duct, can no longer be recognized. The transition between the terminal ducts and the budding acini is gradual, making the histological distinction between the two of them difficult. Both also show evidence of early secretory activity.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h3\">Later pregnancy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The mammary changes that characterize the second half of pregnancy are chiefly continuation and accentuation of secretory activity. Progressive branching continues with less prominent bud formation. The formation of fully differentiated secretory units or acini becomes increasingly evident. Proliferation of new acini is reduced, and the lumen of already formed units becomes distended by the accumulation of secretory material or colostrum.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Labor and lactation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Just before and during labor, there is a new wave of mitotic activity within the mammary gland. During labor and lactation, further growth and differentiation may be observed in the lobule along with milk secretion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/physiology-of-lactation/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. At this time, the glandular component of the breast has increased to the point where the breast is composed primarily of epithelial elements, with very little stroma (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F76317\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef76317 \">picture 2</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F51142\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef51142 \">picture 5</a>). These changes persist throughout lactation.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Involution</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Following lactation, the mammary gland undergoes involution (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F76317\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef76317 \">picture 2</a>). The process requires a combination of lactogenic hormone deprivation and local autocrine signals, and is characterized by apoptotic cell death and tissue remodeling. The factors that trigger the cell death pathway have not been clearly defined. The potential of the glands to produce milk in response to regular stimulation is permanently enhanced following a single gestation. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=breast-development-and-morphology\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Breast development and morphology&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h1\">MILK PRODUCTION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Lactogenesis refers to development of the ability to secrete milk and entails activation of the mature alveolar cells.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h2\">Lactogenesis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Lactogenesis takes place in two stages, secretory initiation and secretory activation.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h3\">Secretory initiation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Stage I lactogenesis occurs during the second half of pregnancy. High levels of circulating progesterone supplied by the placenta inhibit further differentiation. Small amounts of milk containing lactose and casein may be secreted after about 16 weeks' gestation, and lactose derived from the breast begins to appear in maternal urine. During late pregnancy, many women are able to express colostrum.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h3\">Secretory activation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Stage II lactogenesis or secretory activation is marked by the onset of copious milk production after delivery. This stage is triggered by the rapid decline in progesterone that follows delivery of the placenta and requires the presence of elevated levels of prolactin and cortisol as well as insulin.</p><p>Onset of copious milk production is accompanied by swelling of the breasts. For most women, this occurs two to three days postpartum but may be earlier or as late as seven days or longer after delivery. In primiparous compared with multiparous women, secretory activation is slightly delayed, and early milk volume is lower. In a population based study of all single term infants, delayed secretory activation was observed in women who had cesarean births compared with those who delivered vaginally, but this delay was not accompanied with a decline in milk volume [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/physiology-of-lactation/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. Late onset of milk production has also been reported in women with placental retention, diabetes, and stressful vaginal parturition [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/physiology-of-lactation/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. Women with retained placental fragments may experience inhibition of lactogenesis II that fails to resolve until the fragments (which continue to secrete progesterone) are removed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/physiology-of-lactation/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h2\">Maintenance of lactation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Lactation or galactopoiesis is the process of continued secretion of copious milk. It requires regular removal of milk and stimulation of the nipple, which triggers prolactin release from the anterior pituitary gland and oxytocin from the posterior pituitary gland. In the absence of milk removal, elevated intramammary pressure and accumulation of a feedback inhibitor of lactation (FIL) reduce milk production and trigger mammary involution. (See <a href=\"#H23\" class=\"local\">'Feedback inhibition'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h1\">MILK COMPOSITION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Milk is a complex fluid that is comprised of a variety of chemical and cellular components. The major macronutrients in milk are [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/physiology-of-lactation/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Lactose and oligosaccharides (see <a href=\"#H24\" class=\"local\">'Lactose synthesis'</a> below)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Milk fat, including triglycerides, cholesterol, phospholipids, and steroid hormones</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Proteins, including several caseins, alpha-lactalbumin, lactoferrin, secretory IgA, and lysozyme</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Minerals, including sodium, potassium, chloride, calcium, magnesium, and phosphate</p><p/><p>The nutritional composition of human milk is discussed in greater detail separately for both term and preterm infants. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nutritional-composition-of-human-milk-for-full-term-infants\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Nutritional composition of human milk for full-term infants&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nutritional-composition-of-human-milk-and-preterm-formula-for-the-premature-infant\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Nutritional composition of human milk and preterm formula for the premature infant&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The majority of the nutritional components of human milk are multifunctional. They include the following properties:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Bacteriostatic and immune modulating properties, which are activated prior to <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> during the process of digestion</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Anti-inflammatory</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Growth promotion of crypt cells in the infant's gut or other cells in the body</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Aid in digestion</p><p/><p>Cellular components of human milk vary in cell numbers and type over time. Cell counts in colostrum are approximately 10(6) per mL dropping to 10(5) per ml by six months. Cells include macrophages, lymphocytes, neutrophil, and epithelial cells. Living leukocytes are present in human milk in approximately the same order of magnitude as seen in peripheral blood, but the predominant leukocyte is the macrophage rather than the neutrophil. The number of leukocytes declines sharply after the first two to three months, and thereafter, epithelial cells make up a larger portion of the total cell population.</p><p>Human milk macrophages are capable of chemotaxis, phagocytosis, and secretion of complement, lysozyme and lactoferrin. Both B and T lymphocytes are in human milk and aid in protecting the infant's intestinal tract from invading organisms. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=infant-benefits-of-breastfeeding#H4\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Infant benefits of breastfeeding&quot;, section on 'Anti-microbial components'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14\"><span class=\"h1\">SYNTHESIS AND SECRETION OF MILK COMPONENTS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Milk components are secreted into the alveolar lumen by the combination of five distinct mechanisms. These pathways work in parallel to form <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> transport the milk constituents from the blood, interstitial fluid, or the mammary epithelial cell.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15\"><span class=\"h2\">Exocytosis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Exocytosis is thought to be the primary mechanism for determining the aqueous composition of milk. In this process, proteins and lactose are synthesized, then transported in vesicles formed by the Golgi complex and secreted into the alveolar lumen. As lactose accumulates with the vesicles, both water and electrolytes enter into the vesicles and are also secreted into the lumen. (See <a href=\"#H24\" class=\"local\">'Lactose synthesis'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H16\"><span class=\"h2\">Reverse pinocytosis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Fat is secreted into the milk by reverse pinocytosis, a process unique to the mammary gland. Lipid formed in the smooth endoplasmic reticulum (ER) coalesces into large droplets. These droplets push against and gradually become enveloped in the apical plasma membrane, finally budding from the cell as a milk-fat globule. A crescent of cytoplasm is often included within the globule and may contain cellular elements such as ER, ribosomes, and mitochondria. Both the lipid droplets and the cellular components (membrane and cytoplasm) contribute to the lipid composition of milk. The membrane fragments are the primary dietary source of phospholipids for breastfed infants [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/physiology-of-lactation/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H17\"><span class=\"h2\">Transcytosis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Intact proteins (eg, immunoglobulins, albumin, and hormones) are secreted into the milk by transcytosis. In this process, interstitial proteins bind to receptors at the basal membrane of the alveolar cell are transported across the cell and released at the apical membrane. The prototype for transcytosis is secretory IgA, which is synthesized by plasma cells in the interstitial spaces of the mammary gland. This mechanism is thought to apply to other proteins as well. [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/physiology-of-lactation/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H18\"><span class=\"h2\">Apical transport</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Transport across the apical membrane is not a major mechanism of milk secretion and is poorly understood. It is limited to a small number of small molecules, including sodium, potassium, chlorides, some monosaccharides, and water [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/physiology-of-lactation/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H19\"><span class=\"h2\">Paracellular movement</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Some components of interstitial fluid enter the lumen by moving between the alveolar cells in a process known as paracellular movement. During normal lactation, passage of even low molecular weight molecules is impeded by a structure called the tight junction that joins the epithelial cells tightly together.</p><p>However, immune cells can enter the milk through a process called diapedesis or extravasation. In this process, paracellular movement occurs across a transiently open tight junction that seals tightly behind the cell, leaving no permanent gap and no further movement across the junction.</p><p>Increased paracellular movement due to increased leakiness of the tight junctions occurs in specific physiologic states (pregnancy, the immediate postpartum period, and mammary involution) and during mastitis. Components of the interstitial fluid (such as sodium and chloride) pass unimpeded into the milk, resulting in elevated milk sodium concentrations.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H20\"><span class=\"h1\">REGULATION OF MILK PRODUCTION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Milk production is regulated by the interaction of a number of physical and biochemical forces. In most circumstances, emptying of the breast by the infant's suckling is the most important factor.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H21\"><span class=\"h2\">Breast emptying</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Following secretory activation, maintenance of milk production depends upon the removal of milk on a regular basis. Failure to remove milk results in excessive and prolonged accumulation of milk within the alveolar lumen, leading to alveolar distension and elevation of intramammary pressure. This may impede blood flow through the mammary capillaries, reducing the supply of nutrients and stimulatory hormones and decreasing milk production. In addition, increased intramammary pressure disrupts connections between cells and their attachment to the basement membrane, disrupting the synthesis and secretion of milk components [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/physiology-of-lactation/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. Thus, distension of the mammary gland due to abnormally prolonged interfeeding intervals (such as what might occur when a mother returns to the workforce) reduces milk production. Continued failure to remove milk triggers involution of the gland.</p><p>Changes in infant demand affect breast emptying and regulate milk production. This is illustrated by a study of the association of lipid content and milk volume [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/physiology-of-lactation/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. Lipid content was reduced in the milk of nursing mothers with little body fat, so that caloric density was approximately 15 percent lower than milk from well-nourished mothers. Increased suckling of the hungry infant, leading to increased emptying of the breast, was associated with an increased milk volume of 5 to 15 percent.</p><p>The frequency of stimulation and degree of emptying required for adequate milk production vary with maternal and infant characteristics. Premature infants and infants with abnormal or poorly developed oral-motor musculature or coordination are less able to modulate breast emptying and milk volume. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=neonatal-oral-feeding-difficulties-due-to-sucking-and-swallowing-disorders\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Neonatal oral feeding difficulties due to sucking and swallowing disorders&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=breast-milk-expression-for-the-preterm-infant\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Breast milk expression for the preterm infant&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H22\"><span class=\"h2\">Prolactin</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The plasma prolactin concentration increases rapidly during suckling [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/physiology-of-lactation/abstract/3,11,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,11,12</a>] and is mediated through stimulation of nerve endings in the nipple-areolar complex. Plasma prolactin concentrations do not correlate with the volume of milk produced [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/physiology-of-lactation/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>] and does not appear to regulate milk production. However, the hormone level in the lactocyte may play a role in regulating milk production. In a full breast, there is reduced uptake of plasma prolactin into the lactocyte, whereas, when the breast is emptied, prolactin levels in milk are higher, suggesting higher levels within the lactocyte.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H23\"><span class=\"h2\">Feedback inhibition</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Another mechanism that limits milk production is feedback inhibition by a milk protein known as feedback inhibitor of lactation (FIL) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/physiology-of-lactation/abstract/13,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,14</a>]. FIL is synthesized by mammary epithelial cells in response to increased intramammary pressure and has been isolated from goat, bovine, and human milk. The mechanism of inhibition is reversible blockade of the secretory pathway by down regulation of cell-surface prolactin receptors. In addition to acutely decreasing secretion of milk, FIL may modulate mammary cell differentiation so that a sustained change in milk removal results in a sustained secretory response.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H24\"><span class=\"h2\">Lactose synthesis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Lactose, the disaccharide unique to milk, is the primary determinant of volume, as it is the major osmotic component of milk [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/physiology-of-lactation/abstract/1,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,6</a>]. Lactose is formed by lactose synthetase within the Golgi complex from glucose and UDP-galactose and is placed within the Golgi-derived secretory vesicle. The Golgi membrane and the vesicle are both impermeable to lactose. As lactose accumulates within the vesicle, water is drawn into the vesicle to maintain osmotic equilibrium. Contents of the vesicles are released into the milk compartment by exocytosis.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H25\"><span class=\"h1\">MILK EJECTION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The alveoli are surrounded by a basket-like network of blood vessels and myoepithelial cells. The alveolar lumen serves as a temporary milk-holding reservoir. The lumens empty through a series of increasingly larger ducts within each lobe. The final large central collecting duct from the lobe opens into a nipple pore through which milk leaves the breast (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F88523\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef88523 \">figure 1</a>).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H26\"><span class=\"h2\">Oxytocin</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Tactile stimulation of the nipple-areolar complex by the suckling infant leads to afferent signals to the hypothalamus that trigger release of oxytocin. Oxytocin delivered via the blood stream to the mammary gland interacts with its receptor on the myoepithelial cells [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/physiology-of-lactation/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. This results in contraction of the myoepithelial cells, forcing milk into the ducts from the alveolar lumens and out through the nipple. At the same time, the ducts expand rapidly to facilitate milk flow. If the breasts are sufficiently engorged to restrict blood flow to the alveoli, normal milk ejection is blocked. If milk is not removed through the nipple pore, backflow of milk toward the lumen can occur [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/physiology-of-lactation/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>].</p><p>In the first several days postpartum, oxytocin release also triggers uterine contractions. These reduce maternal blood loss and promote uterine involution, although they may be painful. In a randomized controlled trial, mothers who initiated frequent feedings immediately after delivery of the placenta experienced less blood loss than those who initiated breastfeeding two hours or more after delivery due to oxytocin release [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/physiology-of-lactation/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=maternal-and-economic-benefits-of-breastfeeding#H3\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Maternal and economic benefits of breastfeeding&quot;, section on 'Benefits during lactation'</a>.)</p><p>Oxytocin also binds to receptors within the brain functioning as a neurotransmitter. A variety of physiological and behavioral effects have been reported, including an animal study that suggested oxytocin's central effects may be important for the initiation of maternal and sexual behaviors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/physiology-of-lactation/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. However, species differ in the behavioral effects of oxytocin, perhaps related to differences in the location of oxytocin receptors in the brain [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/physiology-of-lactation/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. Little data are available regarding the role of oxytocin in human behavior.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"PATIENT_INFORMATION\"><span class=\"h1\">INFORMATION FOR PATIENTS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>UpToDate offers two types of patient education materials, &quot;The Basics&quot; and &quot;Beyond the Basics.&quot; The Basics patient education pieces are written in plain language, at the 5<sup>th</sup> to 6<sup>th</sup> grade reading level, and they answer the four or five key questions a patient might have about a given condition.

(See <a href=\"#H13\" class=\"local\">'Milk composition'</a> above and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nutritional-composition-of-human-milk-for-full-term-infants\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Nutritional composition of human milk for full-term infants&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nutritional-composition-of-human-milk-and-preterm-formula-for-the-premature-infant\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Nutritional composition of human milk and preterm formula for the premature infant&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The synthesis and secretion of components that make up breast milk are carried out by the following five processes: exocytosis, reverse pinocytosis, transcytosis, apical transport, and paracellular movement. (See <a href=\"#H14\" class=\"local\">'Synthesis and secretion of milk components'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Milk production is primarily regulated by the emptying of the breast. Other important factors include prolactin levels, feedback inhibition, and lactose synthesis. (See <a href=\"#H20\" class=\"local\">'Regulation of milk production'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Myoepithelial cell contraction, under the influence of oxytocin, forces milk into the ducts from the alveolar lumens.
