In general, arterial partial pressure of oxygen (PaO<sub>2</sub>) values of 50 to 80 mmHg are adequate to meet metabolic demands of the neonate.

Approximately 87 percent of the PaO<sub>2</sub> values were between 40 and 80 mmHg, 9 percent were below 40 mmHg, and 5 percent were greater than 80 mmHg.

For example, at saturations above 96 percent, PaO<sub>2</sub> values can continue to increase with little or no further corresponding change in SpO<sub>2</sub>. In addition, the increased concentration of HbF and its increased affinity for oxygen is another factor to consider in establishing target SpO<sub>2</sub> values in the neonate. HbF will shift the oxygen dissociation curve to the left due to its high affinity for oxygen, which may result in high oxygen saturation (eg, 85 percent) at PaO<sub>2</sub> levels below 40 mmHg (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F81216\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef81216 \">figure 1</a>). The proportion of HbF increases with decreasing gestational age (GA) so that the concentration of HbF in an infant born at 28 weeks gestation is approximately 90 percent.</p><p>Because of these complex interactions, preterm infants at high risk for hyperoxemia or severe hypoxemia, as well as those with rapidly changing cardiopulmonary status, require periodic ABG determination.

Nevertheless, based on the available evidence, we believe the most prudent target range for SpO<sub>2</sub> in preterm infants is between 90 and 95 percent. This range minimizes both the low and high extreme oxygenation levels that have been associated with adverse outcomes.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3392517234\"><span class=\"h3\">Clinical trials</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The initial clinical trial published in 2000, Supplemental Therapeutic Oxygen for Prethreshold Retinopathy of Prematurity (STOP-ROP) trial, demonstrated that an oxygen target goal of SpO<sub>2</sub> between 96 to 99 percent in preterm infants was associated with greater morbidity (eg, greater risk of BPD and longer duration of hospitalization) than those assigned to a lower target range of 89 to 94 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neonatal-target-oxygen-levels-for-preterm-infants/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].</p><p>Based on these results, subsequent trials using lower oxygen target goals were conducted to determine the optimal SpO<sub>2</sub> target range for <strong>extremely preterm infants (gestational age [GA] &lt;28 weeks)</strong> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neonatal-target-oxygen-levels-for-preterm-infants/abstract/6-8\" class=\"abstract_t\">6-8</a>]. Although these trials (Canadian Oxygen Trial [COT]; Surfactant, Positive Pressure, and Oxygenation Randomized Trial [SUPPORT] study; and Benefits of Oxygen Saturation Targeting trial [BOOST]-II study), which have recruited thousands of infants, had similar protocols comparing target saturation ranges between high SpO<sub>2</sub> target range (91 to 95 percent) and low SpO<sub>2</sub> target range (85 to 89 percent), the optimal range remains elusive. This was best illustrated by systematic reviews of these trials that reported the following findings [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neonatal-target-oxygen-levels-for-preterm-infants/abstract/9-11\" class=\"abstract_t\">9-11</a>].</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>There was a higher rate of mortality at 18 to 24 months corrected age associated with the low SpO<sub>2</sub> target range (typical relative risk [RR] 1.16, 95% CI 1.03-1.31) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neonatal-target-oxygen-levels-for-preterm-infants/abstract/9,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,11</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>There was a higher incidence of necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) associated with the low SpO<sub>2</sub> target range (typical RR 1.24, 95% CI 1.05-1.47) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neonatal-target-oxygen-levels-for-preterm-infants/abstract/9,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,10</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>There was no difference in the combined outcome of death and major disability at 24 months corrected age [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neonatal-target-oxygen-levels-for-preterm-infants/abstract/9,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,10</a>].

In addition, these data were obtained in a research setting, and it may be challenging to implement targeted oxygen saturation goals in a non-research setting, as it often is difficult to maintain an infant requiring oxygen within a narrow saturation range. (See <a href=\"#H170466838\" class=\"local\">'Adherence to oxygen target goals'</a> below.)</p><p>There have been several follow-up publications of these trials that include the following:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A post-hoc analysis of the COT showed prolonged hypoxemic episodes (defined as SpO<sub>2</sub> &lt;80 percent for &ge;1 minute) during the first two to three months after birth were associated with late mortality or neurodevelopmental impairment at 18 months corrected age [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neonatal-target-oxygen-levels-for-preterm-infants/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. Of note, the association between exposure to prolonged hypoxemic episodes and the primary outcome of death and neurodevelopmental impairment was stronger for infants randomly assigned to the high oxygen saturation target range (91 to 95 percent) than for those assigned to the low target range (85 to 89 percent). The authors speculated that these episodes of prolonged hypoxemia in infants assigned to the high oxygen target levels represented greater drops of saturations from baseline values resulting in more severe disturbance of oxygen homeostasis.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A post-hoc unadjusted analysis of the BOOST-II study that combined data from trials in Australia and the United Kingdom showed the low target oxygen (85 to 89 percent) group had higher rates of death than the high target oxygen (91 to 95 percent) group (21 versus 18 percent, RR 1.2, 95% CI 1.01-1.43) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neonatal-target-oxygen-levels-for-preterm-infants/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. During the United Kingdom trial, oximeters were revised to correct a calibration-algorithm artifact. An analysis, which only used data from revised oximeters, reported the risk of death remained higher in the low oxygen target group (25 versus 17 percent, RR 1.45, 95% CI 1.16-1.82). Pooled data from the two cohorts demonstrated an increased risk of the combined outcome of death or disability at two years of age in the low target oxygen group (48 versus 43 percent, 95% CI 1.01-1.23).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A post-hoc analysis of the SUPPORT study reported increased mortality before discharge for small for gestational age (SGA) compared with appropriate for gestational age (AGA) infants (38.5 versus 16.4 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neonatal-target-oxygen-levels-for-preterm-infants/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. There was no difference in mortality between the low and high target oxygen groups for AGA infants (17.6 versus 15.2). However, for SGA infants, mortality was greater for the infants assigned to a low target oxygen level (56.1 versus 25.5 percent). In a follow-up study, a higher mortality rate was observed for infants with the lowest oxygen saturation during the first three days of life [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neonatal-target-oxygen-levels-for-preterm-infants/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. Of note, SGA infants in the lower target group were more likely to have lower oxygen saturation than AGA infants.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a follow-up study of the SUPPORT cohort, there was no difference in growth between the low and high target oxygen groups during hospitalization (birth to 36 weeks postmenstrual age [PMA]), and at 18 to 22 months corrected age [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neonatal-target-oxygen-levels-for-preterm-infants/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3509839887\"><span class=\"h3\">Our approach</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Data regarding target oxygen ranges are from clinical trials conducted in extremely preterm infants (GA &lt;28 weeks) who are the most vulnerable to the effects of both high and low oxygenation levels. Based on the available evidence, we recommend a target oxygen range from 90 to 95 percent resulting in minimizing extreme oxygenation levels for all preterm infants [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neonatal-target-oxygen-levels-for-preterm-infants/abstract/17,18\" class=\"abstract_t\">17,18</a>]. Although data are lacking in more mature infants, this target range appears to be safe for preterm infants &ge;28 weeks gestation. In the most mature preterm infants (gestational age &gt;34 weeks), the risk of ROP decreases, and the upper limit can be increased to 97 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neonatal-target-oxygen-levels-for-preterm-infants/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>].</p><p>There is also a paucity of data regarding oxygen target ranges as the preterm infant advances in age. However, by two to three weeks postnatal age, the risk of intermittent hypoxia increases, which may aggravate ROP by enhancing retinal proliferation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neonatal-target-oxygen-levels-for-preterm-infants/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. As a result, with advancing age, we typically raise target saturation to &gt;95 percent if the infant still needs supplemental oxygen when the corrected PMA is &gt;32 weeks.</p><p>Targeted SpO<sub>2</sub> levels of infants with congenital heart disease, BPD, or pulmonary hypertension are individualized based upon the clinical status of the neonate due to the paucity of data regarding optimal oxygenation for these disorders.
