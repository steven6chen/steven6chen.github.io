Darier's sign may not be present in patients taking antihistamines. It may also be more difficult to elicit urtication from older, brown-colored, lesions.

Degranulated mast cell can be difficult to identify without these specialized stains. Techniques for identifying mast cells in tissues are presented in more detail separately.

Mast cells in lesions of UP may have irregular shapes, sometimes with bilobed nuclei, which may be seen on light microscopy. Infiltrating eosinophils may also be present.</p><p>Mast cells may form small or large clusters or appear in sheets. There are four patterns of mast cell infiltrates that are observed in cutaneous mastocytosis, which only partially correlate with the type of clinical lesion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mastocytosis-cutaneous-and-systemic-evaluation-and-diagnosis-in-adults/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Perivascular infiltrates in the papillary and upper dermis</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Sheet-like infiltrates in the papillary body and upper reticular dermis</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Interstitial infiltrates</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Nodular infiltrates</p><p/><p>CD25 (interleukin-2 [IL-2] receptor alpha chain) may be aberrantly expressed by a subset of skin mast cells in those with systemic disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mastocytosis-cutaneous-and-systemic-evaluation-and-diagnosis-in-adults/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1095899112\"><span class=\"h3\">Interpretation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Abnormal skin biopsy findings in the context of the morphologic lesion are diagnostic of cutaneous mastocytosis (CM) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F82827\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef82827 \">table 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mastocytosis-cutaneous-and-systemic-evaluation-and-diagnosis-in-adults/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. However, CM should not be diagnosed based upon biopsy findings alone, without the characteristic skin lesions, because mast cells can be found around blood vessels and in telangiectasias in otherwise healthy skin. In addition, mast cell numbers may be increased in inflammatory or neoplastic skin diseases, such as psoriasis, urticaria, eczema, and dermatofibromas. There is no specific cut-off value for numbers of mast cells in the skin that is considered abnormal. In addition, skin biopsy does not provide information about systemic involvement.</p><p>Analysis of cutaneous mast cells for the presence of mutations in <em>KIT</em> does not fulfill the diagnostic criteria and is not a standard part of the evaluation of skin biopsies, but it has been performed in investigational protocols [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mastocytosis-cutaneous-and-systemic-evaluation-and-diagnosis-in-adults/abstract/6-8\" class=\"abstract_t\">6-8</a>]. Instead, <em>KIT</em> mutational analysis is usually performed on peripheral blood or bone marrow. (See <a href=\"#H1445477476\" class=\"local\">'KIT mutational analysis of peripheral blood'</a> below and <a href=\"#H578992945\" class=\"local\">'Mutational analysis'</a> below.)</p><p>Activating mutations of <em>KIT</em> have been implicated in the pathogenesis of both cutaneous and systemic mastocytosis, although no consistent correlation between the type of mutation and either phenotype or prognosis has been recognized. The significance of <em>KIT</em> mutations is reviewed separately.

The presence of elevated serum concentrations of tryptase &gt;20 <span class=\"nowrap\">ng/mL</span> is one of the minor criteria for the diagnosis of systemic mastocytosis (SM) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mastocytosis-cutaneous-and-systemic-evaluation-and-diagnosis-in-adults/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H25\" class=\"local\">'Diagnosis'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Of note, serum tryptase should be assayed when the patient is in a baseline state (ie, not immediately following an episode of symptoms) for the purposes of diagnosing mastocytosis, because elevations in mediators obtained immediately after a symptomatic episode (such as flushing or syncope) indicate mast cell activation, but do not distinguish between anaphylaxis and mastocytosis. (See <a href=\"#H30\" class=\"local\">'Differential diagnosis'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Total serum tryptase can be measured with a commercially available assay (ImmunoCAP tryptase), which is performed at many clinical laboratories. Normal levels are between 1 and 11.4 <span class=\"nowrap\">ng/mL</span> (some laboratories consider 15 <span class=\"nowrap\">ng/mL</span> to be the upper limit of normal). However, the value must be &gt;20 <span class=\"nowrap\">ng/mL</span> to fulfill the World Health Organization's (WHO) criterion. Tryptase is usually normal in cutaneous mastocytosis (CM) and elevated in the majority of patients with systemic mastocytosis (SM). However, up to 10 percent of patients with SM (with or without urticaria pigmentosa [UP]) have tryptase levels &lt;20 <span class=\"nowrap\">ng/mL</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mastocytosis-cutaneous-and-systemic-evaluation-and-diagnosis-in-adults/abstract/10,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,11</a>]. Intermediate values are sometimes seen in patients with indolent systemic mastocytosis (ISM) with a low mast cell burden and in those with mast cell activation disorders, which are discussed elsewhere.

Liver function tests should be normal.

Baseline tryptase is usually elevated. SM should be strongly suspected in patients with adult-onset skin lesions or baseline levels of total tryptase &gt;20 <span class=\"nowrap\">ng/mL</span> on at least two occasions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mastocytosis-cutaneous-and-systemic-evaluation-and-diagnosis-in-adults/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. The absolute level of total tryptase does <strong>not</strong> predict the category of SM [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mastocytosis-cutaneous-and-systemic-evaluation-and-diagnosis-in-adults/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. Aggressive mastocytosis and mastocytosis associated with hematologic malignancies can have similar elevations of tryptase as indolent systemic mastocytosis. However, mast cell leukemia (MCL) is generally associated with extremely elevated tryptase levels, sometimes &gt;1000 <span class=\"nowrap\">ng/mL</span>. Other laboratory abnormalities are variable. The laboratory abnormalities that may be present in different systemic forms of mastocytosis are discussed elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=systemic-mastocytosis-determining-the-subtype-of-disease#H3171582\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Systemic mastocytosis: Determining the subtype of disease&quot;, section on 'C findings'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1445477476\"><span class=\"h2\">KIT mutational analysis of peripheral blood</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The presence of a mutation in the <em>KIT</em> gene (which codes the receptor for stem cell factor) is one of the minor criteria for SM (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F82827\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef82827 \">table 1</a>). All adults suspected of having SM should undergo a mutational analysis of <em>KIT</em>, which can be performed on peripheral blood or bone marrow (and occasionally on other tissues) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mastocytosis-cutaneous-and-systemic-evaluation-and-diagnosis-in-adults/abstract/17,18\" class=\"abstract_t\">17,18</a>]. Bone marrow lesional tissue has the highest sensitivity for detection of somatic <em>KIT</em> mutations due to the higher concentration of mast cell precursors and mature mast cells, and a bone marrow evaluation is the most useful means of evaluating for <em>KIT</em> mutations. However, analysis of peripheral white blood cells is convenient and available through at least two commercial laboratories (in the United States, Quest Diagnostics and Mayo Clinic Laboratories) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mastocytosis-cutaneous-and-systemic-evaluation-and-diagnosis-in-adults/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. One situation in which the peripheral blood <em>KIT</em> analysis can be helpful is the evaluation of a patient with normal or slightly elevated serum tryptase, no suggestive skin lesions, and persistent clinical suspicion for SM, as a positive result would further argue for the need for bone marrow biopsy, although a negative peripheral blood result would not necessarily rule out SM [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mastocytosis-cutaneous-and-systemic-evaluation-and-diagnosis-in-adults/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. Peripheral blood <em>KIT</em> testing is also useful in the evaluation of monoclonal and idiopathic mast cell activation syndromes. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=mast-cell-disorders-an-overview\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Mast cell disorders: An overview&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The tests performed by commercial laboratories for diagnosis of mastocytosis detect the most common <em>KIT</em> mutation (D816V) only and will miss less common mutations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mastocytosis-cutaneous-and-systemic-evaluation-and-diagnosis-in-adults/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. It is our experience that <em>KIT</em> mutations can be detected in peripheral blood in 30 to 50 percent of patients with SM, with the available commercial tests, while approximately 90 percent of patients with SM have detectable mutations if bone marrow is analyzed with a sensitive assay. Mutational assays using D816V-specific polymerase chain reaction (PCR) primers have the highest sensitivity of detection and usually can detect less than 1 percent of the mutated allele in a sample, whereas sequencing-based techniques have poor sensitivity and should not be used for routine mutational analysis. However, sequencing of the entire <em>KIT</em> gene is recommended in patients with advanced forms of SM when <em>KIT</em> D816V-specific testing is negative, as this information can also inform treatment with targeting therapies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mastocytosis-cutaneous-and-systemic-evaluation-and-diagnosis-in-adults/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>].</p><p>If the <em>KIT </em>D816V mutation is detected in peripheral blood in the evaluation of an adult who presents without skin lesions, then bone marrow should be performed to evaluate for additional diagnostic criteria. If the mutation is not detected in peripheral blood (which is common in patients with low mast cell burden) and there is a high index of suspicion due to compatible clinical symptoms, then a bone marrow biopsy should be performed to obtain material for the evaluation of the <em>KIT</em> D816V and to look for other diagnostic criteria.

SM should be strongly suspected in patients with baseline levels of total tryptase greater than 20 <span class=\"nowrap\">ng/mL</span> on at least two occasions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mastocytosis-cutaneous-and-systemic-evaluation-and-diagnosis-in-adults/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Beta tryptase</strong> &ndash; Measurement of beta tryptase is not required to make the diagnosis of mastocytosis, although it allows for an estimate of the total (alpha + beta) to beta ratio, which is sometimes helpful in confirming anaphylaxis (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F79722\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef79722 \">table 5</a>). Beta tryptase is stored in mast cell granules and is elevated in serum in mast cell activation. An assay for beta tryptase is performed at Virginia Commonwealth University (Richmond, Virginia) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mastocytosis-cutaneous-and-systemic-evaluation-and-diagnosis-in-adults/abstract/46\" class=\"abstract_t\">46</a>]. The serum level of beta tryptase in healthy blood donors is less than 1 <span class=\"nowrap\">ng/mL</span>. During mast cell activation and systemic anaphylaxis, levels of beta tryptase rise above 1 <span class=\"nowrap\">ng/mL,</span> reaching a peak approximately one hour after the event and generally returning to baseline after four hours. Beta tryptase levels are usually normal in patients with SM, unless they have just experienced an episode of massive mast cell activation.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Ratio of total to beta tryptase</strong> &ndash; If both measurements are available, the ratio of total to beta tryptase can be calculated [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mastocytosis-cutaneous-and-systemic-evaluation-and-diagnosis-in-adults/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. In patients with SM this ratio is &gt;20, whereas it is often &lt;10 in systemic anaphylaxis (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F79722\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef79722 \">table 5</a>).</p><p/><p>The next group of disorders described below, which can have some clinical features similar to mastocytosis, do <strong>not</strong> involve mast cell activation. Therefore, serum tryptase and urinary histamine are not elevated:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong><span class=\"nowrap\">Hereditary/acquired</span> angioedema</strong> &ndash; Patients with hereditary or acquired angioedema due to deficiency of C1 inhibitor present with episodes of angioedema (generally painful) affecting the skin, larynx, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> walls of the bowel. In contrast, laryngeal edema is unusual in mastocytosis, and C1 inhibitor and complement studies are typically within normal range in mastocytosis. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=an-overview-of-angioedema-clinical-features-diagnosis-and-management\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;An overview of angioedema: Clinical features, diagnosis, and management&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Carcinoid syndrome</strong> &ndash; The presence of episodic flushing and diarrhea may raise suspicion for mastocytosis among patients with the carcinoid syndrome. Elevation of 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid (5-HIAA), a breakdown product of serotonin, in a 24-hour urine sample is indicative of carcinoid syndrome, whereas this mediator is normal in mastocytosis. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diagnosis-of-the-carcinoid-syndrome-and-tumor-localization\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Diagnosis of the carcinoid syndrome and tumor localization&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Pheochromocytoma</strong> &ndash; Patients with pheochromocytoma may present with flushing and paroxysmal episodes of hypertension, whereas patients with mastocytosis generally develop hypotension during an acute mast cell degranulation episode. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-presentation-and-diagnosis-of-pheochromocytoma\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical presentation and diagnosis of pheochromocytoma&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Metastatic disease to bone</strong> &ndash; Bone lesions of SM are frequently misinterpreted radiographically as metastatic lesions to bone. However, elevated serum tryptase and urinary histamine are absent in most malignancies. Thus, histopathologic diagnosis is required to differentiate between these two disorders.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Vasoactive intestinal peptide-secreting tumors</strong> &ndash; Symptoms found in both SM and vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP)-secreting tumors include flushing episodes and particularly diarrhea. VIP-secreting tumors are associated with increased levels of VIP. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=vipoma-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-management\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;VIPoma: Clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and management&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Zollinger-Ellison syndrome</strong> &ndash; A significant number of patients with the Zollinger-Ellison syndrome present with diarrhea. Some affected individuals may also have metastatic disease to bone. However, Zollinger-Ellison syndrome is not associated with elevated levels of histamine or tryptase. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=zollinger-ellison-syndrome-gastrinoma-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Zollinger-Ellison syndrome (gastrinoma): Clinical manifestations and diagnosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Medullary thyroid cancer</strong> &ndash; This neuroendocrine tumor of the thyroid parafollicular or C cells can present with recurrent flushing and diarrhea. Most patients also have a solitary thyroid nodule. Serum calcitonin levels may be elevated. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=medullary-thyroid-cancer-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-staging\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Medullary thyroid cancer: Clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and staging&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H32\"><span class=\"h2\">Disorders with similar bone marrow manifestations</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A few disorders have increased <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> aberrantly shaped mast cells in the bone marrow, similar to those observed in patients with SM. These include myeloproliferative disorders, especially chronic eosinophilic leukemia (CEL), primary myelofibrosis, and reactive mastocytosis, which are distinguished from mastocytosis by differences on bone marrow biopsy as well as the presence or absence of characteristic clinical and laboratory features.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Chronic eosinophilic leukemia or myeloproliferative variant of hypereosinophilic syndrome</strong> &ndash; These disorders are characterized by a modest elevation in serum tryptase and atypical spindle-shaped mast cells expressing surface CD25. However, molecular diagnostic studies reveal the presence of abnormalities in the genes for Fip1-like1 (<em>FIP1L1</em>) and platelet-derived growth factor receptor alpha (<em>PDGFRA),</em> instead of a D816V <em>KIT</em> mutation. The typical patient is a male without MPCM skin lesions and with a hypercellular (myeloproliferative) bone marrow with elevated serum vitamin B12 levels. This is a stem cell disorder affecting multiple hematopoietic lineages, including the mast cell, but the clinical disease manifestations are due to eosinophil-related pathology rather than increased mast cells. Some patients may meet the diagnostic criteria of both disorders (SM associated with CEL). These patients respond well to <a href=\"topic.htm?path=imatinib-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">imatinib</a>, whereas patients with typical mastocytosis and D816V KIT mutations do not.

These findings can also be observed with mastocytosis in the setting of extensive mast cell infiltration. However, the mast cell increase in myelofibrosis is usually diffuse and interstitial rather than forming clusters. Also, mast cells in myelofibrosis lack pathologic CD25 expression and the <em>KIT </em>D816V mutation. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-primary-myelofibrosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of primary myelofibrosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Reactive mastocytosis</strong> &ndash; Reactive mastocytosis in tissues and bone marrow can be seen in patients with solid tumors, such as breast cancer, Hodgkin lymphoma, and in diseases variably associated with increased expression of stem cell factor (eg, aplastic anemia and some hematologic, soft tissue, and gastrointestinal neoplasms). Reactive mast cells generally have a mature appearance (round in shape and fully granulated) and lack significant clustering, aberrant surface expression of CD2 and CD25, or <em>KIT</em> mutations.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1998462304\"><span class=\"h2\">Disorders with similar skin biopsy findings</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Increased mast cell numbers can be found in other inflammatory and neoplastic conditions of the skin, such as dermatofibromas, psoriasis, atopic dermatitis, and nevi.

These diseases can be limited to the skin (cutaneous mastocytosis [CM]) or involve extracutaneous tissues (systemic mastocytosis [SM]). Mastocytosis is diagnosed according to the World Health Organization&rsquo;s (WHO) published diagnostic criteria for cutaneous and systemic forms of mastocytosis (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F82827\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef82827 \">table 1</a>). (See <a href=\"#H89732267\" class=\"local\">'Overview'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The most characteristic presentations in adults are skin lesions of urticaria pigmentosa, also called maculopapular cutaneous mastocytosis (MPCM) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F105580\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef105580 \">picture 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F97908\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef97908 \">picture 3</a>), episodic signs and symptoms of mast cell-mediator release (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F91167\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef91167 \">table 2</a>), or recurrent, unexplained allergic or anaphylactic reactions. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Indications for evaluation'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Initial evaluation involves laboratory studies to detect systemic involvement <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> organ infiltration, and a serum total tryptase level, which is usually normal in CM and elevated (&gt;20 <span class=\"nowrap\">ng/mL)</span> in SM. If there is uncertainty about the skin lesions, skin biopsy should be performed. A test to detect mutations in the <em>KIT</em> (the gene coding for the receptor for stem cell factor, an essential mast cell growth factor) can be obtained on a sample of peripheral blood, although there are limited clinical scenarios in which this test is useful. (See <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Laboratory studies'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In most cases, referral to an <span class=\"nowrap\">allergy/immunology,</span> dermatology, or hematology expert with knowledge of mast cell disorders will be needed for definitive diagnosis. (See <a href=\"#H19185617\" class=\"local\">'When to refer'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Bone marrow biopsy and aspiration is indicated in adult patients with MPCM<strong>, </strong>an elevated serum tryptase level, or signs and symptoms of systemic involvement. Most adult patients require bone marrow evaluation. Bone marrow sections should be stained for tryptase, CD117 and CD25, and aspirate analyzed for D816V KIT mutation. (See <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Bone marrow examination'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In CM, laboratory studies are typically normal and the diagnosis is confirmed by skin biopsy findings (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F82827\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef82827 \">table 1</a>). Bone marrow studies are normal. (See <a href=\"#H26\" class=\"local\">'Cutaneous mastocytosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In SM, abnormalities include a persistently elevated total tryptase (&gt;20 <span class=\"nowrap\">ng/mL),</span> characteristic bone marrow findings, and variable other findings of systemic involvement. The diagnosis of SM requires either the presence of the major criterion and one of the minor criteria, OR three of the minor criteria (in the absence of the major criterion) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F82827\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef82827 \">table 1</a>). (See <a href=\"#H27\" class=\"local\">'Systemic mastocytosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The differential diagnosis of mastocytosis is broad. Disorders that can mimic mastocytosis may be divided into those with similar clinical manifestations, those with similar bone marrow findings, and other causes of elevated tryptase.
