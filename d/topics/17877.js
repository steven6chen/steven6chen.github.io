Patients with longstanding goiters (cervical or substernal) may develop symptoms of obstruction due to progressive compression of the trachea or sudden enlargement (usually accompanied by pain) secondary to hemorrhage into a nodule. The most common obstructive symptom is exertional dyspnea, which is present in 30 to 60 percent of cases, and usually occurs when the tracheal diameter is under 8 mm. Substernal goiter may be detected incidentally on chest radiograph or computed tomography (CT) scan or found because of obstructive symptoms such as dyspnea, wheezing, or cough.</p><p>The treatment of obstructive and substernal goiters will be reviewed here. The clinical manifestations and evaluation of goiter and the management of benign nonobstructive goiter are reviewed separately.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-presentation-and-evaluation-of-goiter-in-adults#H6514229\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical presentation and evaluation of goiter in adults&quot;, section on 'Goiter with obstructive symptoms or suspected substernal goiter'</a>.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-nontoxic-nonobstructive-goiter\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of nontoxic, nonobstructive goiter&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-toxic-adenoma-and-toxic-multinodular-goiter\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of toxic adenoma and toxic multinodular goiter&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=thyroid-hormone-suppressive-therapy-for-thyroid-nodules-and-benign-goiter\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Thyroid hormone suppressive therapy for thyroid nodules and benign goiter&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">ANATOMIC RELATIONSHIPS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Enlarging thyroid lobes usually grow outward because of their location in the anterior neck in front of the trachea, covered only by thin muscles, subcutaneous tissue, and skin. In patients with substantial enlargement of one lobe or asymmetric enlargement of both lobes, the trachea, esophagus, or blood vessels may be displaced or, less often, compressed. Bilateral lobar enlargement, especially if the goiter extends posterior to the trachea, may cause either compression or concentric narrowing of the trachea or compression of the esophagus or jugular veins. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=surgical-anatomy-of-the-thyroid-gland\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Surgical anatomy of the thyroid gland&quot;</a>.)</p><p>With some goiters, there is growth of one or both lobes through the thoracic inlet into the thoracic cavity, which can result in obstruction of any of the structures in the inlet (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F101836%7EENDO%2F101835\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef101836 graphicRef101835 \">image 1A-B</a>). Such goiters are referred to as substernal.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7830040\"><span class=\"h1\">GOALS OF THERAPY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Once goiter is detected (on physical exam or incidentally during a radiologic procedure performed for other purposes), an evaluation is performed to assess thyroid function and to identify the underlying cause, presence of obstructive symptoms, and presence of suspicious sonographic features in nodules within the goiter. These factors determine management. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-presentation-and-evaluation-of-goiter-in-adults#H6509061\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical presentation and evaluation of goiter in adults&quot;, section on 'Approach to evaluation'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-presentation-and-evaluation-of-goiter-in-adults#H6514229\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical presentation and evaluation of goiter in adults&quot;, section on 'Goiter with obstructive symptoms or suspected substernal goiter'</a>.)</p><p>For patients with obstructive goiter (cervical or substernal), the goal of management is to relieve the obstructive symptoms by resecting or ablating the thyroid gland. For patients with asymptomatic substernal goiter, the goal is to prevent growth and subsequent development of obstructive symptoms.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7830201\"><span class=\"h1\">OUR APPROACH</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7830154\"><span class=\"h2\">Obstructive symptoms</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients with obstructive symptoms from a cervical or substernal goiter require removal or ablation of the thyroid. Once obstructive symptoms are present, there is risk of further thyroid growth and progressive tracheal compression, which in some instances (eg, hemorrhage) may be rapid and fatal. For the treatment of obstructive goiter, we suggest surgery rather than radioiodine (see <a href=\"#H7830085\" class=\"local\">'Surgery'</a> below). For patients with obstructive symptoms who are unable or unwilling to go undergo surgery, radioiodine therapy is an alternative option. (See <a href=\"#H7830232\" class=\"local\">'Poor operative candidates'</a> below.)</p><p>However, the reduction in thyroid volume with radioiodine is only moderate, and there are theoretical concerns that radioiodine could acutely worsen obstruction or a missed malignancy. Most obstructive cervical or substernal goiters are benign. However, patients with nodules within a goiter that are malignant or suspicious for malignancy on fine-needle aspiration (FNA) biopsy require surgery.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7830161\"><span class=\"h2\">Asymptomatic substernal goiter</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The main treatment options for patients with asymptomatic substernal goiter are surgery or observation with monitoring. The choice of therapy depends upon the extent of substernal extension and patient characteristics.</p><p>The author of this topic and others suggest surgery for most patients with asymptomatic substernal goiters that extend below the level of the brachiocephalic vein, assuming they are good surgical candidates (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F101835\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef101835 \">image 1B</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-obstructive-or-substernal-goiter/abstract/1-6\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-6</a>].

We monitor such patients with serial computed tomography (CT) scans, initially after one year and, if stable, at increasing intervals (eg, two years later, then three years, then five years). Other asymptomatic patients with substernal goiter who may be followed with serial CT scans, rather than undergo surgery, include the following:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Older patients who are poor operative candidates.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients without thyroid enlargement whose glands extend slightly substernally due to kyphosis.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients whose goiters extend only slightly substernally on a CT scan obtained without neck extension may not be substernal when the neck is extended.

In a randomized trial, thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH)-suppressive doses of levothyroxine reduced goiter size in approximately two-thirds of patients with sporadic, multinodular goiters [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-obstructive-or-substernal-goiter/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. However, most large goiters do not shrink sufficiently to alleviate symptoms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-obstructive-or-substernal-goiter/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>], any reduction in size is not rapid, and levothyroxine is not effective in those patients who already have low serum TSH concentrations (ie, subclinical hyperthyroidism). Additionally, growth of the goiter may resume as soon as levothyroxine treatment is stopped.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7830085\"><span class=\"h1\">SURGERY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>For the treatment of obstructive goiter, we suggest surgery rather than radioiodine. In addition, patients with nodules within a goiter that are malignant or suspicious for malignancy on fine-needle aspiration (FNA) biopsy require surgery. The author of this topic and others also suggest surgery for most patients with asymptomatic, substernal goiters that extend below the level of the brachiocephalic vein, assuming they are good surgical candidates [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-obstructive-or-substernal-goiter/abstract/1-6\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-6</a>]. Patients with substernal goiter should be referred to an experienced thyroid surgeon as complication rates appear to be lower in high-volume centers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-obstructive-or-substernal-goiter/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. Patients who may require sternotomy should be referred to an experienced thoracic surgeon.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Preoperative assessment</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The initial evaluation of substernal goiter is discussed in detail separately and includes serum TSH to evaluate for subclinical or overt hyperthyroidism, imaging studies (noncontrast computed tomography [CT] or magnetic resonance imaging [MRI]) to evaluate the extent of the goiter and its effect upon surrounding structures, a flow-volume loop study if there is uncertainty if the goiter is causing upper airway obstruction, and FNA biopsy if malignancy is suspected. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-presentation-and-evaluation-of-goiter-in-adults#H6514229\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical presentation and evaluation of goiter in adults&quot;, section on 'Goiter with obstructive symptoms or suspected substernal goiter'</a>.)</p><p>The decision to proceed with surgery is usually made on the basis of symptoms, anatomic studies, and the results of a flow-volume loop study. Most nodules within goiters have benign thyroid aspirates.</p><p>Once the decision to proceed with surgery has been made, other preoperative assessment of substernal goiter should include laryngoscopy to assess the tracheal lumen and vocal cord function. If the patient is hyperthyroid and surgery is elective, an antithyroid drug and, if not contraindicated, a beta blocker should be given for several weeks before surgery (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=surgical-management-of-hyperthyroidism#H6\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Surgical management of hyperthyroidism&quot;, section on 'Preoperative preparation'</a>). Patients with subclinical hyperthyroidism do not need to be prepared with an antithyroid drug.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Surgical approach</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The majority of obstructive and substernal goiters can be excised through a standard cervical incision, while partial or complete sternotomy or even thoracotomy may be required in patients with previous cervical thyroidectomy, very large substernal goiters, or invasive cancer [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-obstructive-or-substernal-goiter/abstract/13-15\" class=\"abstract_t\">13-15</a>]. In an Italian study of 19,662 patients undergoing total thyroidectomy at six centers, 1055 had substernal goiters and only 69 (6.5 percent) required sternotomy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-obstructive-or-substernal-goiter/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. Patients requiring sternotomy were more likely to have a malignancy: 36 percent compared with 22 percent of those excised through a cervical incision. Similar results were noted in two single-center studies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-obstructive-or-substernal-goiter/abstract/6,17\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,17</a>] and in a systematic review [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-obstructive-or-substernal-goiter/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]; recurrent or ectopic goiter in addition to malignancy were associated with the need for sternotomy.</p><p>The extent of surgery for benign goiter depends upon the expertise of the surgeon, the extent of the goiter, and whether the patient has obstructive symptoms and signs. Because of the risk of recurrent goiter, a total or near-total thyroidectomy should be performed unless during the procedure the surgeon feels that a less extensive operation is prudent because of an increased risk of recurrent laryngeal nerve injury or hypoparathyroidism due to anatomic considerations. If a more limited operation is done, we suggest:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients with large, relatively symmetric goiters should have a bilateral subtotal thyroidectomy.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients with asymmetric goiters should have a hemithyroidectomy on the more involved side and a subtotal thyroidectomy on the contralateral side. If the patient already has vocal cord paralysis on the one side and the contralateral thyroid lobe is not very large, we suggest doing only a hemithyroidectomy and isthmusectomy.</p><p/><p>In patients with chronic autoimmune thyroiditis who have concentric tracheal compression, excision of the isthmus alone may be sufficient to alleviate the compression. These fibrous glands may be difficult to dissect free from nerves and parathyroid glands, and more extensive surgery may result in complications.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Complications</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The major complications of surgery for large goiters and substernal goiters are injury to the recurrent laryngeal nerves, trachea, and parathyroid glands [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-obstructive-or-substernal-goiter/abstract/1-4,6,13,15,18\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-4,6,13,15,18</a>].</p><p>Surgery for substernal goiter appears to be associated with higher complication rates than surgery for cervical goiter [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-obstructive-or-substernal-goiter/abstract/8,19\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,19</a>], as illustrated by a statewide database of cervical (n = 32,777) and substernal thyroidectomies (n = 1153) performed between 1998 and 2004. Patients who underwent substernal thyroidectomy were more likely to be older, have a comorbid condition, be uninsured, be undergoing total thyroidectomy, and have surgery at a low-volume center [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-obstructive-or-substernal-goiter/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].

In a study from the National Surgical Quality Improvement Program database of 2716 patients with substernal goiter, the 14 percent who required a sternal split or transthoracic approach had a higher incidence of unplanned intubation (OR 2.70, 95% CI 1.17-6.25) and bleeding (OR 5.56, 95% CI 2.38-13.0); a higher incidence of death (1.9 versus 0.3 percent) was not statistically significant [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-obstructive-or-substernal-goiter/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. Together, these studies suggest that surgery for substernal goiter (using a cervical approach or sternotomy) is associated with higher complication rates than surgery for cervical goiter.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h3\">Recurrent laryngeal nerve injury</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Transient recurrent laryngeal nerve injury has been reported to occur in 2 to 9 percent of patients undergoing surgery for substernal goiter [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-obstructive-or-substernal-goiter/abstract/6,13,14,18\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,13,14,18</a>].

In patients with nonobstructive multinodular goiter, radioiodine therapy results in goiter volume reductions in the range of 30 to 60 percent. Pretreatment with recombinant human thyroid-stimulating hormone (rhTSH, thyrotropin alfa) allows treatment with lower doses of radioiodine for thyroid volume reduction but may result in development of mild hyperthyroidism and transient goiter enlargement. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-nontoxic-nonobstructive-goiter#H6510749\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of nontoxic, nonobstructive goiter&quot;, section on 'Radioiodine therapy'</a>.)</p><p>Results of radioiodine therapy for obstructive goiter include the following:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In one series of 14 patients with large multinodular goiters, eight of whom had respiratory symptoms and eight of whom had substernal extension, all improved after treatment with 200 to 400 <span class=\"nowrap\">microcuries/g</span> of radioiodine, and no patient had an acute exacerbation of obstructive symptoms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-obstructive-or-substernal-goiter/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Similar improvements in obstructive symptoms were seen in a series of 19 older patients treated with 100 <span class=\"nowrap\">microcuries/g</span> tissue (average total dose 70 millicuries). Goiter volume decreased by 40 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-obstructive-or-substernal-goiter/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Volume reduction of the cervical and substernal components is similar (30 percent in one study) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-obstructive-or-substernal-goiter/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>].</p><p/><p>Despite the reasonable results with radioiodine, surgery is still the treatment of choice because of concerns that radiation thyroiditis might result in worsening of airway obstruction and the need to rule out the diagnosis of carcinoma if the goiter is mostly substernal. However, for patients with obstructive symptoms who are not surgical candidates, we suggest radioiodine therapy as an alternative approach.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h3\">Recombinant human TSH</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Similar to results seen with smaller multinodular goiters, the addition of rhTSH to radioiodine in patients with obstructive goiters results in a greater reduction in thyroid volume than radioiodine alone. However, rhTSH is not currently US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved for this indication, and we do not recommend it, pending additional clinical trials demonstrating safety and efficacy. This is discussed in detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-nontoxic-nonobstructive-goiter#H6511841\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of nontoxic, nonobstructive goiter&quot;, section on 'Pretreatment with recombinant human TSH to increase the radioiodine uptake'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h1\">SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The most common symptom in patients with obstructive cervical or substernal goiter is exertional dyspnea, which is present in 30 to 60 percent of cases. This symptom usually occurs when the tracheal diameter is under 8 mm. (See <a href=\"#H1\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-presentation-and-evaluation-of-goiter-in-adults#H6514262\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical presentation and evaluation of goiter in adults&quot;, section on 'Obstructive symptoms'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Bilateral thyroid lobe enlargement, especially if the goiter extends posterior to the trachea, may cause either compression or concentric narrowing of the trachea or compression of the esophagus or jugular veins. With some goiters, there is growth of one or both lobes through the thoracic inlet into the thoracic cavity, which can result in obstruction of any of the structures in the inlet. Such goiters are referred to as substernal (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F101836%7EENDO%2F101835\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef101836 graphicRef101835 \">image 1A-B</a>). (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Anatomic relationships'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients with obstructive symptoms from a cervical or substernal goiter require removal or ablation of the thyroid. (See <a href=\"#H7830154\" class=\"local\">'Obstructive symptoms'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients with obstructive goiter, we suggest surgery rather than radioiodine (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). The reduction in thyroid volume with radioiodine is only moderate, and there are theoretical concerns that radioiodine could acutely worsen obstruction or a missed malignancy. However, radioiodine therapy is an option for patients with obstructive symptoms who are poor surgical candidates. (See <a href=\"#H7830085\" class=\"local\">'Surgery'</a> above and <a href=\"#H11\" class=\"local\">'Radioiodine therapy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For asymptomatic patients with normal flow-volume loops whose goiters end at the level of the brachiocephalic vein or higher, we suggest observation rather than surgery (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). We monitor such patients with serial computed tomography (CT) scans, initially after one year and, if stable, at increasing intervals (eg, two years later, then three years, then five years). (See <a href=\"#H7830161\" class=\"local\">'Asymptomatic substernal goiter'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Recommendations for asymptomatic patients with goiters that extend below the level of the brachiocephalic vein are controversial. The author of this topic suggests surgical excision for most patients except older patients and those who are poor operative candidates, while other experts suggest observation of asymptomatic patients. All patients requiring surgery for substernal goiter should be referred to experienced thyroid surgeons in high-volume centers to minimize complication rates. (See <a href=\"#H7830085\" class=\"local\">'Surgery'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For most patients undergoing surgery, we suggest a total or near-total thyroidectomy rather than subtotal thyroidectomy, to minimize the risk of recurrent goiter (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). (See <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Surgical approach'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients who undergo total thyroidectomy for benign disease should start a replacement dose of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=levothyroxine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">levothyroxine</a> daily at an approximate dose of 1.6 <span class=\"nowrap\">mcg/kg</span> body weight. Patients over 65 years should be started at a 10 to 15 percent lower dose. We typically do not prescribe suppressive doses of levothyroxine to prevent recurrence. However, the author of this topic suggests a trial of suppressive therapy in young patients with no contraindications to suppression who experience growth of a surgical remnant. (See <a href=\"#H7830904\" class=\"local\">'Levothyroxine after surgery'</a> above.)</p></div><div id=\"topicAgreement\">Use of UpToDate is subject to the <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/legal/license\" class=\"licenseLink\" id=\"sla_in_page\">Subscription and License Agreement</a>.</div><div id=\"references\" class=\"headingAnchor\"><h1>REFERENCES</h1><ol id=\"reference\"><li><a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-obstructive-or-substernal-goiter/abstract/1\" class=\"nounderline abstract_t\">Katlic MR, Grillo HC, Wang CA.
