While most women never will develop a contralateral second primary breast cancer, risk-reducing strategies may be appropriate for some. A contralateral prophylactic mastectomy (CPM) is a risk-reducing mastectomy performed in the clinical setting for the patient diagnosed with an invasive or a noninvasive breast cancer. While there is no clear survival benefit for most breast cancer patients who do not carry a deleterious <em>BRCA1</em> or <em>BRCA2</em> mutation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/contralateral-prophylactic-mastectomy/abstract/1-3\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-3</a>], the rates of performing a CPM have increased over the last several years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/contralateral-prophylactic-mastectomy/abstract/4,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,5</a>]. </p><p>The risk of a contralateral breast cancer, the decision-making process to undergo a CPM, and outcomes will be reviewed in this topic. Management of patients with invasive and noninvasive breast cancer, with and without an inherited genetic mutation, is reviewed separately.

However, a review of 162 patients with sporadic breast cancer found that the 10-year cumulative incidence of contralateral breast was 1 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/contralateral-prophylactic-mastectomy/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=patterns-of-relapse-and-long-term-complications-of-therapy-in-breast-cancer-survivors\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Patterns of relapse and long-term complications of therapy in breast cancer survivors&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients with breast cancer who carry a deleterious <em>BRCA1</em> or <em>BRCA2</em> mutation, the risk of a contralateral breast cancer is approximately 10 to 25 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/contralateral-prophylactic-mastectomy/abstract/10,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,11</a>]. However, some studies have estimated the risk to be as high as 65 percent for <em>BRCA1</em> carriers and 50 percent for <em>BRCA2</em> carriers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/contralateral-prophylactic-mastectomy/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-patients-at-high-risk-for-breast-and-ovarian-cancer#H15\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of patients at high risk for breast and ovarian cancer&quot;, section on 'BRCA1 and BRCA2 carriers with a personal history of cancer'</a>.)</p><p/><p>Other reasons for undergoing a CPM include relative ease of follow-up without a mammogram or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), reduction of anxiety for occurrence of a second breast cancer, and desire for symmetry that can be achieved with bilateral mastectomies and reconstruction.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H21364213\"><span class=\"h1\">CANDIDATE SELECTION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Risk-reduction prophylactic mastectomy is often offered to patients with or without a previous history of breast cancer who carry a germline genetic mutation conferring a high risk for breast cancer (<em><span class=\"nowrap\">BRCA1/2</em>,</span> <em>TP53</em>, <em>PTEN</em>, <em>CDH1</em>, or <em>STK11</em> mutation), those with a strong family history of breast or ovarian cancer, and those with a history of thoracic radiation therapy at &lt;30 years of age [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/contralateral-prophylactic-mastectomy/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. This approach is consistent with guidelines from the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN). For those specifically who have had breast cancer, the decision for CPM takes into account many of the same factors that go into decisions about prophylactic mastectomy. However, the decision to undergo a CPM is frequently an individual patient&rsquo;s choice and based on the management (eg, mastectomy) of the presenting breast cancer, the risk of contralateral disease given an ipsilateral cancer, their desire for symmetry, and anxieties regarding follow-up imaging. Family history, genetics, and other markers of increased risk may weigh on a patient&rsquo;s decision regarding CPM.</p><p>Some subsets of patients may also be at high risk of epithelial ovarian and fallopian tubal cancer and would benefit from risk-reducing bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy. This is discussed in detail elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=risk-reducing-bilateral-salpingo-oophorectomy-in-women-at-high-risk-of-epithelial-ovarian-and-fallopian-tubal-cancer#H2750355\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Risk-reducing bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy in women at high risk of epithelial ovarian and fallopian tubal cancer&quot;, section on 'Candidates for risk-reducing BSO'</a>.)</p><p>While, previously, women with lobular carcinoma in situ (LCIS) were thought to be at significant risk such that bilateral prophylactic mastectomy was offered, a more preferable approach for such patients is risk-reducing medical therapy. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=atypia-and-lobular-carcinoma-in-situ-high-risk-lesions-of-the-breast\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Atypia and lobular carcinoma in situ: High-risk lesions of the breast&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1394855091\"><span class=\"h1\">DECISION-MAKING PROCESS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The decision to undergo a CPM is generally based upon the patient&rsquo;s personal preference as well as the surgical management of the presenting breast cancer (ie, mastectomy). Patients often state that their decision may be (in part) influenced by other people, including the surgeon, primary care clinician, friends, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> family members. Hence, the patient and her surgeon should fully discuss the actual risks of a contralateral breast cancer in terms of the patient&rsquo;s own personal and family history and her goals for treatment. (See <a href=\"#H3437385472\" class=\"local\">'Pretreatment counseling'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3437385472\"><span class=\"h2\">Pretreatment counseling</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The frequency of CPM has increased from nearly 4 percent in 2002 to almost 13 percent in 2012, despite a lack of survival benefit associated with the procedure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/contralateral-prophylactic-mastectomy/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. It must also be recognized, however, that data involving CPM is not based on randomized trials, thus limiting our knowledge about potential improvements in survival. Providers should engage in a discussion with patients considering CPM regarding limitations in the data, the patient&rsquo;s perceived versus the actual benefits of the procedure, and the accompanying risks.</p><p>Regarding potential benefits, evidence shows that the risk of contralateral breast cancer is reduced by CPM, and this may be sufficient rationale for some women at risk of a second breast cancer to pursue the procedure. However, it has been shown that the average woman overestimates her risk of contralateral breast cancer at the time of her initial breast cancer diagnosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/contralateral-prophylactic-mastectomy/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. Providers must therefore ensure patients have accurate data regarding their baseline level of risk as they make the decision regarding CPM. Furthermore, although many women opt for CPM in order to improve and extend life, available data, although limited, have shown a survival benefit only for those who carry deleterious <em><span class=\"nowrap\">BRCA1/2</em></span> mutations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/contralateral-prophylactic-mastectomy/abstract/2,16\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,16</a>]. Most women undergoing CPM, however, do not have such mutations or a strong family history [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/contralateral-prophylactic-mastectomy/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. Patients must also be made aware of the risks and complications of undergoing a CPM, as this involves a more extensive operation (bilateral mastectomies with or without bilateral reconstruction). (See <a href=\"#H21364239\" class=\"local\">'Outcomes'</a> below.)</p><p>Despite knowing that CPM does not clearly improve survival, women who have the procedure do so, in part, to extend their lives. Based upon a survey of 123 women with unilateral breast cancer, most women who undergo a CPM do so with a desire to reduce the risk of a contralateral breast cancer (98 percent) and improve survival (94 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/contralateral-prophylactic-mastectomy/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. However, only 18 percent believed that women undergoing a CPM lived longer. These discordant findings suggest that cognitive dissonance exists in decision-making. Although women understand that a CPM is unlikely to extend their survival, anxiety and fear of recurrence may be driving their decisions. Interventions aimed at improving risk communication in an effort to promote evidence-based decision making are warranted.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H19678549\"><span class=\"h2\">Factors influencing patient choice</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A number of sociodemographic and tumor characteristics have been associated with a higher likelihood of pursuing CPM, including:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Younger age [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/contralateral-prophylactic-mastectomy/abstract/4,6,19-22\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,6,19-22</a>]</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Caucasian race [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/contralateral-prophylactic-mastectomy/abstract/4,20,21\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,20,21</a>]</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Private health insurance [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/contralateral-prophylactic-mastectomy/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Family history of breast cancer [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/contralateral-prophylactic-mastectomy/abstract/4,19,21-23\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,19,21-23</a>]</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Noninvasive histology [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/contralateral-prophylactic-mastectomy/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Lobular tumor histology [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/contralateral-prophylactic-mastectomy/abstract/21,22,24\" class=\"abstract_t\">21,22,24</a>] </p><p/><p>Other factors, such as preoperative evaluation with a bilateral breast magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/contralateral-prophylactic-mastectomy/abstract/4,23\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,23</a>], failed attempt at breast conservation management [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/contralateral-prophylactic-mastectomy/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>], and the option of immediate reconstruction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/contralateral-prophylactic-mastectomy/abstract/4,21,23\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,21,23</a>], are independently associated with the decision to pursue CPM. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H21364239\"><span class=\"h1\">OUTCOMES</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2473936451\"><span class=\"h2\">Breast cancer risk reduction</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Based upon a prospective study of 745 women with breast cancer and a family history of breast <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> ovarian cancer undergoing a CPM, the risk reduction of a contralateral breast cancer (CBC) was approximately 96 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/contralateral-prophylactic-mastectomy/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. In this cohort, the risk reduction following a CPM for women less than age 50 years was 94.4 percent (n = 388; number needed to treat [NNT] 3.6), and 96.0 percent for women 50 years of age and older (n = 357; NNT 7.4). </p><p>The likelihood of finding an occult invasive or noninvasive breast cancer in the CPM specimen, not identified on radiographic imaging (ie, mammogram, magnetic resonance imaging [MRI]), is low and reported to be approximately 1 to 2 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/contralateral-prophylactic-mastectomy/abstract/25,26\" class=\"abstract_t\">25,26</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H89077829\"><span class=\"h2\">Overall survival</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Retrospective and observational data have not suggested an overall survival benefit for most breast cancer patients who undergo a CPM [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/contralateral-prophylactic-mastectomy/abstract/14,27,28\" class=\"abstract_t\">14,27,28</a>], though prospective randomized data are lacking. However, for patients with a deleterious <em>BRCA1</em> or <em>BRCA2</em> mutation, and in some studies, women diagnosed at a young age (&lt;50 years), a survival benefit has been attributed to a CPM [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/contralateral-prophylactic-mastectomy/abstract/1,2,5,16,29\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2,5,16,29</a>]. </p><p>In a study of almost 500,000 women with unilateral stage I to III breast cancer enrolled in the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results database, there was no improvement with CPM in either breast cancer-specific survival (hazard ratio [HR] 1.08, 95% CI 1.01-1.16) or overall survival (HR 1.08, 95% CI 1.03-1.14) compared with breast-conserving therapy alone [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/contralateral-prophylactic-mastectomy/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. Similarly, in a propensity matched analysis of almost 190,000 patients with stage 0 to III breast cancer in the California Cancer Registry, there was no significant mortality difference between those undergoing breast-conserving therapy or bilateral mastectomy (though both were associated with lower mortality than unilateral mastectomy) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/contralateral-prophylactic-mastectomy/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>].</p><p>Results among younger women, however, are mixed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/contralateral-prophylactic-mastectomy/abstract/1,28,30\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,28,30</a>]. For example, in a study of almost 15,000 women aged &le;45 years with stage I or II breast cancer, those receiving CPM and unilateral mastectomy versus unilateral mastectomy alone experienced no survival benefit [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/contralateral-prophylactic-mastectomy/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. By contrast, in an earlier risk-stratified analysis of almost 9000 women with early breast cancer enrolled in the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) database, CPM was associated with improved disease-specific survival (0.63, 95% CI 0.57-0.69), an effect that was due to improvements in breast cancer-specific mortality among patients ages 18 to 49 years with stage I to II estrogen receptor (ER)-negative breast cancer [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/contralateral-prophylactic-mastectomy/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Five-year adjusted breast cancer survival for such patients was improved with CPM versus without (89 versus 84 percent). </p><p>However, for women with breast cancer who carry a deleterious <em><span class=\"nowrap\">BRCA1/2</em></span> mutation, a CPM can improve breast cancer survival [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/contralateral-prophylactic-mastectomy/abstract/3,31\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,31</a>]. The following studies illustrate these findings:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a retrospective analysis of 181 patients, a CPM was associated with a 48 percent reduction in death from breast cancer (HR 0.52, 95% CI 0.29-0.93) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/contralateral-prophylactic-mastectomy/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].

The type of mastectomy is determined by the tumor characteristics, patient body habitus, patient preference, and surgical expertise. There is no adverse impact of immediate reconstruction either in the development or detection of future cancers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/contralateral-prophylactic-mastectomy/abstract/44\" class=\"abstract_t\">44</a>]. Reconstruction is determined by the use of postoperative radiation treatments, patient preference, and surgeon expertise.</p><p>Specific approaches to performing a mastectomy and breast reconstruction are discussed separately.

Some have argued that the risk of this minimally invasive procedure is small, and would preempt the need for axillary evaluation if an occult invasive cancer was found on final pathology [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/contralateral-prophylactic-mastectomy/abstract/45\" class=\"abstract_t\">45</a>]. Others, however, argue that the risk of finding metastatic disease warranting axillary staging in patients undergoing prophylactic mastectomy is low, and therefore sentinel node biopsy in these patients can be omitted [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/contralateral-prophylactic-mastectomy/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>].

Systemic therapy may consist of chemotherapy, depending on the stage of the cancer and other prognostic and predictive features, human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-directed therapy for HER2-positive tumors, and endocrine therapy for hormone receptor-positive tumors. The decision to proceed with CPM does not affect these recommendations. For those with hormone receptor-positive tumors, adjuvant endocrine therapy has been shown to reduce the risk of breast cancer recurrence as well as new breast cancers (in either breast). Discussion of appropriate adjuvant therapy as well as medical risk-reducing strategies is found elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=adjuvant-chemotherapy-for-her2-negative-breast-cancer\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Adjuvant chemotherapy for HER2-negative breast cancer&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=adjuvant-systemic-therapy-for-her2-positive-breast-cancer\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Adjuvant systemic therapy for HER2-positive breast cancer&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=adjuvant-endocrine-therapy-for-non-metastatic-hormone-receptor-positive-breast-cancer\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Adjuvant endocrine therapy for non-metastatic, hormone receptor-positive breast cancer&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=selective-estrogen-receptor-modulators-and-aromatase-inhibitors-for-breast-cancer-prevention\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Selective estrogen receptor modulators and aromatase inhibitors for breast cancer prevention&quot;</a>.)</p><p>For those who do not proceed with CPM, breast cancer surveillance remains an important aspect of risk management.

(See <a href=\"#H21364200\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The rationale for contralateral prophylactic mastectomy (CPM) in a patient who has had breast cancer is to reduce the risk of CBC. Other reasons for undergoing a CPM include relative ease of follow-up without a mammogram or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), reduction of anxiety for occurrence of a second breast cancer, and desire for symmetry that can be achieved with bilateral mastectomies and reconstruction. (See <a href=\"#H2296582\" class=\"local\">'Rationale'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Risk-reduction mastectomy is often offered to patients with or without a previous history of breast cancer who carry a germline genetic mutation conferring a high risk for breast cancer (<em><span class=\"nowrap\">BRCA1/2</em>,</span> <em>TP53</em>, <em>PTEN</em>, <em>CDH1</em>, or <em>STK11</em> mutation), those with a strong family history of breast or ovarian cancer, and those with a history of thoracic radiation therapy at &lt;30 years of age. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The decision to undergo a CPM is based on these same factors but is also individualized according to patient preferences and history, taking into account the surgical management of the presenting breast cancer (ie, mastectomy), the risk of contralateral disease given an ipsilateral cancer, and the patient&rsquo;s desire for symmetry and anxieties regarding follow-up imaging. (See <a href=\"#H21364213\" class=\"local\">'Candidate selection'</a> above and <a href=\"#H1394855091\" class=\"local\">'Decision-making process'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Women with breast cancer and a family history of breast or ovarian cancer and who undergo a CPM have a 96 percent reduction in risk of developing a contralateral cancer. (See <a href=\"#H2473936451\" class=\"local\">'Breast cancer risk reduction'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>There is no clear overall survival benefit for most breast cancer patients who undergo a CPM, though prospective randomized data are unavailable. However, a survival benefit with CPM exists for patients with a deleterious <em>BRCA1</em> or <em>BRCA2</em> mutation, and possibly for those diagnosed at a young age (&lt;50 years). (See <a href=\"#H89077829\" class=\"local\">'Overall survival'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Women with breast cancer undergoing a CPM have nearly a twofold increased risk of major complications (eg, reoperation) compared with women undergoing a unilateral mastectomy. (See <a href=\"#H1933768585\" class=\"local\">'Postoperative morbidity and mortality'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Typically, the same type of mastectomy is performed for a CPM as for the mastectomy to treat the breast cancer.
