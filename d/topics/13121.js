In contrast to previous classification systems, the 2015 WHO classification relies to a greater extent on immunohistochemical characterization in addition to light microscopy, allowing for subtyping that more judiciously guides treatment strategy and predicts clinical course. In addition, it provides standardized criteria and terminology for lung cancer diagnosis on small biopsies and cytology, which is critical, given that the majority of patients with lung cancer present with high-stage disease and are not surgical candidates. Finally, it provides guidance for doing molecular testing on many carcinoma types, particularly adenocarcinomas, recognizing the therapeutic importance of targetable genetic alterations. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=personalized-genotype-directed-therapy-for-advanced-non-small-cell-lung-cancer\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Personalized, genotype-directed therapy for advanced non-small cell lung cancer&quot;</a>.) </p><p>Changes from the 2004 WHO classification for adenocarcinomas and biopsies are based on the 2011 multidisciplinary expert panel recommendations, representing the International Association for the Study of Lung Cancer (IASLC), the American Thoracic Society (ATS), and the European Respiratory Society (ERS) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathology-of-lung-malignancies/abstract/3,4\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,4</a>]. The rationale for the changes introduced by the 2015 WHO classification is based upon several observations:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Advances in understanding the specific molecular pathways that drive malignancy have opened up new pathways for treatment, and molecular characterization of patients with adenocarcinoma is resulting in the use of agents with high levels of antitumor activity, particularly for those with driver mutations. As an example, epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) tyrosine kinase inhibitors are the preferred initial treatment for patients with metastatic lung adenocarcinoma whose tumors have characteristic activating mutation in EGFR. Targeted therapy is also the preferred approach for those with adenocarcinomas whose tumors harbor the EML4-ALK translocation. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=personalized-genotype-directed-therapy-for-advanced-non-small-cell-lung-cancer\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Personalized, genotype-directed therapy for advanced non-small cell lung cancer&quot;</a>.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Distinguishing squamous carcinoma from other non-small carcinomas, particularly adenocarcinoma, is important for patients with advanced-stage disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathology-of-lung-malignancies/abstract/5-7\" class=\"abstract_t\">5-7</a>] as certain agents are contraindicated for patients with squamous histology because of decreased efficacy (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pemetrexed-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">pemetrexed</a>) or the potential for increased toxicity (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=bevacizumab-including-biosimilars-of-bevacizumab-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">bevacizumab</a>). The 2004 WHO classification did not address how this distinction was to be made on small biopsies and specifically endorsed lumping tumors under the &quot;non-small cell carcinoma&quot; rubric [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathology-of-lung-malignancies/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. The new classification scheme offers guidelines for how to use a panel of immunohistochemical stains (eg, p40, TTF-1, cytokeratin <span class=\"nowrap\">5/6)</span> when obvious features of a specific line of differentiation are not apparent on a small biopsy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathology-of-lung-malignancies/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].

Less extensive surgery may be adequate treatment in such cases.</p><p/><p>The following discussion is based on the 2015 WHO schema.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h1\">ADENOCARCINOMA</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Adenocarcinoma is the most common type of lung cancer in contemporary series, accounting for approximately one-half of lung cancer cases. The increased incidence of adenocarcinoma is thought to be due to the introduction of low-tar filter cigarettes in the 1960s, although such causality is unproven [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathology-of-lung-malignancies/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. The World Health Organization (WHO) classification emphasizes that tissue specimens should be managed not only for pathologic diagnosis, but also to preserve tissue for molecular studies, which may have important treatment implications such as use of targeted therapies for certain subsets of patients. Patients with advanced lung adenocarcinoma and other non-small carcinomas not otherwise specified should have their tumors tested for the presence of a driver mutation (eg, mutated epidermal growth factor receptor, ALK translocation, and increasingly, other mutations) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathology-of-lung-malignancies/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].

There is significant variation in the extent and architecture of neoplastic gland formation, with major subtypes demonstrating an acinar, papillary, micropapillary, lepidic, or solid growth pattern, with either mucin or pneumocyte marker expression, these having prognostic significance when predominant within resections [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathology-of-lung-malignancies/abstract/2,9,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,9,10</a>]. Less common patterns include cribriform, colloid, enteric, and fetal (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F108093\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef108093 \">picture 3</a>). The cribriform pattern has also been noted to have prognostic significance [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathology-of-lung-malignancies/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>], while solid and micropapillary patterns also may predict benefit for those patients having adjuvant chemotherapy after complete resection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathology-of-lung-malignancies/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1177702\"><span class=\"h2\">Comparison of the 2015 and 2004 WHO classification of adenocarcinoma</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The 2015 WHO classification is similar to the 2011 schema from the International Association for the Study of Lung Cancer, the American Thoracic Society, and the European Respiratory Society <span class=\"nowrap\">(IASLC/ATS/ERS),</span> incorporating a number of changes from the 2004 classification in the classification of patients with adenocarcinoma (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F108152\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef108152 \">table 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathology-of-lung-malignancies/abstract/2-4,13,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">2-4,13,14</a>]. The following table shows the characteristics of the invasive tumors and preinvasive lesions (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F109647\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef109647 \">table 2</a>).</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The terms bronchioloalveolar carcinoma (BAC) and mixed subtype adenocarcinoma are eliminated. The term &quot;lepidic&quot; has been introduced to describe non-invasive growth along intact alveolar septae. Lesions that were formerly classified as BAC are now placed in one of several categories that appear to correlate with the early stages of transformation and are listed below:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Atypical adenomatous hyperplasia (AAH), an entity that was previously and continues to be recognized in the WHO system as a preinvasive lesion for lung adenocarcinoma (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F108081\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef108081 \">picture 4</a>). They generally measure 5 mm or less.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Adenocarcinoma in situ (AIS) is a localized (&le;3 cm) adenocarcinoma in which growth is restricted to tumor cells growing along alveolar structures (lepidic growth pattern) and lacks any component of invasion. Most AIS tumors are non-mucinous (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F108083\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef108083 \">picture 5</a>). Mucinous lesions comprise a small subset of such tumors (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F108087\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef108087 \">picture 6</a>). Observational studies indicate that AIS has a 100 percent cancer-specific survival if completely resected. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>The new category, minimally invasive adenocarcinoma, describes a small, solitary adenocarcinoma (&le;3 cm) with a predominantly lepidic growth pattern and &le;5 mm invasion. Most but not all of these lesions are non-mucinous (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F108089\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef108089 \">picture 7</a>). The cancer-free survival in these patients should approach 100 percent with complete surgical resection, based upon observational studies.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Invasive adenocarcinomas are classified by their predominant pattern.

Other patterns might include acinar and solid (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F80147\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef80147 \">picture 8</a>), but any combination may occur. The 2015 WHO book also mentions a pattern of spread through the air spaces (STAS), which was not discussed in the 2011 <span class=\"nowrap\">IASLC/ATS/ERS</span> classification and has since become more clearly recognized [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathology-of-lung-malignancies/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. It is not officially recognized in the classification schema, however.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The subtypes of clear cell, rhabdoid, and signet ring adenocarcinoma have been discontinued, recognizing these as cytologic features to be included as descriptions when present in any amount.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The new term invasive mucinous adenocarcinoma (formerly mucinous bronchioloalveolar carcinoma) has been introduced to identify a separate variant, the implication being that most of what was formerly called mucinous BAC represented focally invasive mucinous adenocarcinomas (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F108091\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef108091 \">picture 9</a>). This term excludes tumors that meet criteria for AIS or minimally invasive adenocarcinoma (MIA).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Other variants of invasive adenocarcinoma include colloid, fetal, and enteric adenocarcinoma (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F108093\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef108093 \">picture 3</a>). Mucinous cystadenocarcinoma has been reclassified under the category of colloid adenocarcinoma. Resection of colloid carcinoma is generally curative, but several cases with distant metastases to the brain or bone have been reported [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathology-of-lung-malignancies/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>On small biopsies, lesions without identifiable adenocarcinoma patterns present, but in which immunohistochemical stains support the diagnosis of adenocarcinoma, eg, TTF-1 positive, the terminology &quot;non-small cell carcinoma, favor adenocarcinoma&quot; is used (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F79343\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef79343 \">picture 10</a>).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>At resection, in similar fashion to biopsies, a morphologically undifferentiated non-small cell carcinoma with TTF-1 positivity would now be classified as an adenocarcinoma with a wholly solid pattern based on immunohistochemistry, as opposed to a large cell carcinoma using the 2004 WHO classification.</p><p/><p>Radiographic correlates of this classification have also been developed and include some of the following observations: </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>AAH and non-mucinous AIS characteristically have a ground glass radiographic appearance (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F60122\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef60122 \">image 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F72990\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef72990 \">image 2</a>).

Classical pulmonary blastoma is a biphasic tumor in which fetal adenocarcinoma is accompanied by a primitive mesenchymal component resembling the blastomatous component of renal Wilms tumors. Regardless of their true histogenesis, fetal adenocarcinomas have a distinctive histologic appearance and are associated with a better prognosis than typical pulmonary adenocarcinomas. These tumors are composed of relatively bland columnar cells arranged in a complex glandular pattern resembling that seen in the epithelial component of classical pulmonary blastomas and have a striking resemblance to endometrial adenocarcinoma (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F108093\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef108093 \">picture 3</a>). The cytoplasm of the columnar cells is often vacuolated and clear due to the presence of glycogen. Stains for epithelial mucins are usually negative, or only focally and faintly positive. </p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H979379364\"><span class=\"h1\">ADENOSQUAMOUS CARCINOMA</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Adenosquamous carcinomas are defined as tumors composed of more than 10 percent malignant glandular and squamous components. The mixed histology probably represents the well-recognized heterogeneity of lung carcinomas rather than a prognostically distinct subset [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathology-of-lung-malignancies/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. The reported incidence of adenosquamous carcinoma ranges from 0.4 to 4 percent of bronchogenic carcinomas. Adenosquamous carcinoma is an aggressive tumor and appears to have a poorer prognosis than either adenocarcinoma or squamous cell carcinoma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathology-of-lung-malignancies/abstract/23,24\" class=\"abstract_t\">23,24</a>]. As these tumors are comprised in part of a glandular component, molecular testing of the tumor is recommended. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=personalized-genotype-directed-therapy-for-advanced-non-small-cell-lung-cancer\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Personalized, genotype-directed therapy for advanced non-small cell lung cancer&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1177018\"><span class=\"h1\">SQUAMOUS CELL CARCINOMA</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Squamous cell carcinoma was the most frequent histologic type of lung tumor in nearly all studies done prior to the mid-1980s. Now, adenocarcinoma is more common than squamous cell carcinoma, particularly in women.</p><p>The diagnosis of squamous cell carcinoma is predicated upon the presence of keratin production by tumor cells <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> intercellular desmosomes (referred to as &quot;intercellular bridges&quot;) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F72421\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef72421 \">picture 12</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F73209\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef73209 \">picture 13</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F51629\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef51629 \">picture 14</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F78684\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef78684 \">picture 15</a>), or by immunohistochemistry consistent with squamous cell carcinoma (ie, expression of p40, p63, CK5, or <span class=\"nowrap\">CK5/6,</span> desmoglein). While variants of squamous cell carcinoma in the 2004 World Health Organization (WHO) classification system included papillary, clear cell, small cell, and basaloid carcinoma, these have since been replaced with the categories of non-keratinizing, keratinizing, and basaloid subtypes, with clear cell change now regarded as a cytologic feature [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathology-of-lung-malignancies/abstract/2,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,13</a>]. Tumors are non-keratinizing if there is no keratinization, keratinizing if any keratinization is present, and basaloid if basaloid features comprise more than 50 percent of the tumor. For tumors that are non-keratinizing, immunohistochemistry is required to distinguish between squamous carcinoma, solid type adenocarcinoma, and large cell carcinoma with a null phenotype. For such tumors, diffuse positive staining with a squamous marker should be present to confirm a squamous phenotype.</p><p>Most squamous cell carcinomas (60 to 80 percent) arise in the proximal portions of the tracheobronchial tree (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F59922\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef59922 \">picture 16</a>) through a squamous metaplasia-dysplasia-carcinoma in situ sequence (squamous carcinoma in situ), although they are increasingly presenting as peripheral lesions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathology-of-lung-malignancies/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. Central and peripheral squamous cell carcinomas may show extensive central necrosis with resulting cavitation (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F60622\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef60622 \">picture 17</a>). A small subset of central, well differentiated squamous cell carcinomas occur as exophytic, endobronchial, papillary lesions (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F56588\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef56588 \">picture 18</a>). Patients with this unusual variant of squamous cell carcinoma typically present with persistent cough, recurrent hemoptysis, or relapsing pulmonary infections due to airway obstruction. Most patients with exophytic endobronchial squamous cell carcinoma have low-stage disease at diagnosis, with a correspondingly good prognosis; five-year survival rates are greater than 60 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathology-of-lung-malignancies/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h1\">LARGE CELL CARCINOMA</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Large cell carcinoma (LCC) is a malignant epithelial neoplasm lacking both glandular and squamous differentiation by light microscopy and immunohistochemistry, and lacking cytologic features of small cell carcinoma. LCC usually presents as a large peripheral mass with prominent necrosis. Histologically, LCC is characterized by sheets of round to polygonal cells with prominent nucleoli and abundant pale staining cytoplasm without differentiating features (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F108094\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef108094 \">picture 19</a>). Because LCC represents a diagnosis of exclusion, it is inappropriate to apply the term to small endoscopic biopsies or cytology specimens, both of which have inherent sampling problems [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathology-of-lung-malignancies/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. The term non-small cell lung cancer, not otherwise specified (NSCLC-NOS) is more appropriate for cases diagnosed in this way, when there is no evidence of squamous or adenocarcinomatous differentiation on immunohistochemistry. Specific entities in the World Health Organization (WHO) 2004 classification that are reclassified are as follows: large cell neuroendocrine carcinoma is now considered a neuroendocrine tumor, basaloid carcinoma is now a subgroup of squamous cell carcinoma, and lymphoepithelioma-like carcinoma now belongs to &quot;other and unclassified carcinomas&quot; [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathology-of-lung-malignancies/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. As in the case of adenocarcinoma, previously defined subgroups such as &quot;clear cell&quot; and &ldquo;rhabdoid&rdquo; are now considered cytologic features rather than distinct histologic subtype.</p><p>LCC includes poorly differentiated NSCLCs that are not further classifiable by routine light microscopy or immunohistochemical marker expression. A combination of electron microscopy and immunohistochemistry (IHC) will, however, demonstrate evidence of squamous, glandular, or neuroendocrine differentiation in as many as 90 percent of cases. IHC has allowed the reclassification of several entities formerly classified as LCCs, supported by molecular studies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathology-of-lung-malignancies/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. For example, in the 2015 classification, poorly differentiated carcinomas are reclassified as squamous cell carcinoma if they have p40 expression; solid adenocarcinoma if TTF-1 expression is observed, even if mucin is absent; and neuroendocrine carcinoma if staining with chromogranin and synaptophysin are present [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathology-of-lung-malignancies/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Poorly differentiated carcinomas are considered large cell only if they lack defining IHC markers (with so-called null phenotype).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1176731\"><span class=\"h1\">SARCOMATOID CARCINOMA</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Sarcomatoid carcinoma is a broad term that represents a heterogeneous group of non-small cell lung carcinomas (NSCLCs, meaning they have a malignant epithelial component) that also contain a component of true sarcoma or are composed in part or completely of <strong>sarcoma-like</strong> elements. The term is used more generically and when a more specific diagnosis is possible, that more specific diagnosis should be rendered. In a large Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) database study, sarcomatoid carcinomas are rare, comprising less than 1 percent of all lung cancers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathology-of-lung-malignancies/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. A histologic diagnosis of sarcomatoid carcinoma was associated with overall worse survival (hazard ratio [HR] for death 1.60, 95% CI 1.35-2.06). While there are no significant changes between the 2004 and 2015 World Health Organization (WHO) classification of sarcomatoid carcinomas, the new classification recommends molecular testing of such carcinomas for genetic alterations, in similar fashion to other non-small cell carcinomas [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathology-of-lung-malignancies/abstract/2,4\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,4</a>].

Other differentiated sarcomatous elements may also be present but they are not required for the diagnosis. They are usually large at the time of presentation and are highly malignant.

These tumors include small cell carcinoma, large cell neuroendocrine carcinoma, typical carcinoid, and atypical carcinoid. In addition, diffuse idiopathic pulmonary neuroendocrine cell hyperplasia, a possibly preinvasive epithelial lesion, is included in this category (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F50502\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef50502 \">table 3</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathology-of-lung-malignancies/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. </p><p>Within the group of pulmonary neuroendocrine tumors, typical and atypical carcinoids share a number of features and are similar to carcinoid lesions arising at other sites. Small cell carcinomas and large cell neuroendocrine carcinomas are characterized clinically by a more aggressive course and pathologically by a much higher mitotic rate compared with pulmonary carcinoids (11 or more mitoses per 10 high power fields) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathology-of-lung-malignancies/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. A high Ki-67 score may help distinguish small cell and large cell neuroendocrine carcinoma from pulmonary carcinoids, especially in small biopsies, but staining for Ki-67 is not part of the diagnostic criteria. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h2\">Small cell carcinoma</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Small cell lung carcinoma (SCLC) accounts for approximately 15 percent of all bronchogenic carcinomas. SCLC shows a strong correlation with cigarette smoking and is extremely rare in persons who have never smoked. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cigarette-smoking-and-other-possible-risk-factors-for-lung-cancer\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Cigarette smoking and other possible risk factors for lung cancer&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Molecular studies have identified a number of abnormalities in SCLCs, including in particular deletions in chromosome 3p.

Some are associated with isolated larger cells that have similar cytologic features and may even contain small nucleoli. These tumors tend to be as responsive to chemotherapy as are pure SCLCs and should be classified as such.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>About 5 percent of cases of SCLC may also be combined with non-small cell elements, such as squamous carcinoma or adenocarcinoma, and still respond at least initially to therapy directed to small cell carcinoma. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), such tumors should be subsumed under the &quot;combined&quot; rubric, listing both components present (eg, combined small cell carcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma). For tumors to be considered combined small and large cell carcinoma (or large cell neuroendocrine carcinoma), at least 10 percent of the tumor should consist of large cells. There is no percentage requirement for adenocarcinoma, squamous cell carcinoma, or sarcomatoid carcinoma.</p><p/><p>SCLC is composed of cells with a size no larger than the size of three resting lymphocyte nuclei (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F81277\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef81277 \">picture 21</a>). These may be round, oval, angulated, and with usually small amounts of cytoplasm. The nuclei are typically hyperchromatic and either have a dispersed &quot;salt and pepper&quot; chromatin or a homogeneous dispersed chromatin. The cells are fragile and the tumors are generally extensively necrotic, both of which may contribute to the difficulty in establishing a histologic diagnosis. Tumor cells are usually positive for one or more of chromogranin or synaptophysin, although around 10 percent may be unreactive for neuroendocrine markers. Cytokeratin staining is often dot-like in morphology.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4047701511\"><span class=\"h2\">Large cell neuroendocrine carcinoma</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Large cell neuroendocrine carcinoma has an architecture that suggests neuroendocrine differentiation: the cells are arranged in organoid, trabecular, or palisading patterns (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F50765%7EPULM%2F63311\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef50765 graphicRef63311 \">picture 22A-B</a>). Necrosis is usually prominent and may be extensive and infarct-like. Evidence of neuroendocrine differentiation is usually demonstrated by immunoreactivity for chromogranin and synaptophysin (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F70724%7EPULM%2F66047\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef70724 graphicRef66047 \">picture 23A-B</a>). These tumors are generally high grade, most commonly located in the peripheral lung, and associated with an aggressive clinical course. This entity was previously classified as a variant of large cell carcinoma in previous WHO classifications, but is classified as a neuroendocrine carcinoma in the 2015 WHO classification (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F50502\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef50502 \">table 3</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathology-of-lung-malignancies/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p>Large cell neuroendocrine carcinoma comprises cells generally much larger than three resting lymphocytes with abundant cytoplasm that is often eosinophilic (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F50502\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef50502 \">table 3</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathology-of-lung-malignancies/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>].

The World Health Organization (WHO) classification applies the term DIPNECH to a proliferation of scattered single pulmonary neuroendocrine cells, tumorlets, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> linear proliferations of these cells confined to bronchial and bronchiolar epithelium [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathology-of-lung-malignancies/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Due to the frequent presence of tumorlets and neuroendocrine cell hyperplasia in the background of resected peripheral carcinoids, it has been proposed that DIPNECH represents a precursor to pulmonary neuroendocrine tumors. However, the risk of developing clinically significant disease from these lesions appears to be low [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathology-of-lung-malignancies/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>].
