Vomiting and nausea may or may not occur together, or may be perceived at the same level of intensity. As an example, vomiting can occur without preceding nausea in individuals with mass lesions in the brain or increased intracranial pressure (ICP). Furthermore, some medications may alleviate nausea but not vomiting, or vice versa.</p><p>The symptoms of nausea and vomiting may be caused by many pathologic states involving several systems (including gastrointestinal, neurologic, renal, and psychiatric). Younger children may not be able to describe nausea, which may further complicate diagnosis. The best course of action should be dictated by the medical history, taking into consideration clinical features of specific disorders and their relative frequency among children in different age groups. The most important consideration during the initial encounter is recognition of serious conditions, such as intestinal obstruction and increased ICP, for which immediate intervention is required. (See <a href=\"#H102891175\" class=\"local\">'Concerning signs'</a> below.)</p><p>This topic review will provide an overview of the neurophysiology and differential diagnosis of nausea and vomiting in children, while suggesting a general approach to specific testing. Individual disorders are discussed in further detail in linked topic reviews. Several gastrointestinal disorders present with abdominal pain in addition to nausea and vomiting, and these are discussed below. However, evaluation of the child in whom abdominal pain is the primary presenting complaint is discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=emergency-evaluation-of-the-child-with-acute-abdominal-pain\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Emergency evaluation of the child with acute abdominal pain&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=chronic-abdominal-pain-in-children-and-adolescents-approach-to-the-evaluation\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Chronic abdominal pain in children and adolescents: Approach to the evaluation&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H113391611\"><span class=\"h1\">DEFINITIONS</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Vomiting</strong> (emesis) refers to the forceful oral expulsion of gastric contents associated with contraction of the abdominal and chest wall musculature. Vomitus often has a slight yellow tinge, which is caused by reflux of small amounts of bile into the stomach. Vomitus is considered bilious if it has a green or bright yellow color, indicating larger amounts of bile in the stomach; bilious vomiting is often associated with intestinal obstruction, as described below.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Nausea</strong> generally refers to an unmistakable sensation of unpleasantness that may precede vomiting, but may be present even in a child who does not vomit. It is often associated with autonomic changes such as salivation, increased heart and respiratory rates, and a reduction in gastric tone and mucosal blood flow [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-infant-or-child-with-nausea-and-vomiting/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Although there is no forceful expulsion of gastric contents with nausea, there may be retrograde reflux of fluids from the duodenum to the gastric antrum.</p><p/><p>The related terms, regurgitation, anorexia, sitophobia, early satiety, retching, and rumination are defined in the table (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F55952\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef55952 \">table 1</a>).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">PHYSIOLOGY OF EMESIS</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H45141450\"><span class=\"h2\">Neurophysiology</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Vomiting may have a physiologic benefit since it provides a means to expel potential toxins. Nausea and vomiting may also induce a conditioned aversion to ingested toxins [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-infant-or-child-with-nausea-and-vomiting/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. In disease states, however, vomiting pathways are activated inappropriately. The major pathways through which nausea and vomiting are induced are vagal afferents, the area postrema, the vestibular system, and the amygdala [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-infant-or-child-with-nausea-and-vomiting/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Five principal neurotransmitter receptors mediate vomiting: muscarinic (M1), dopamine (D2), histamine (H1),<sub> </sub>serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine [5-HT<sub>3</sub>]), and substance P (neurokinin 1). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=characteristics-of-antiemetic-drugs\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Characteristics of antiemetic drugs&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Vagal afferent pathway</strong> &ndash; Abdominal vagal afferents are involved in the emetic response. These pathways can be evoked by either mechanical or chemosensory sensations. Examples of sensations that trigger this pathway include overdistension, food poisoning, mucosal irritation, cytotoxic drugs, and radiation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-infant-or-child-with-nausea-and-vomiting/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Vagal afferents are an important site of action of 5-HT<sub>3</sub> receptor antagonists used as antiemetic drugs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-infant-or-child-with-nausea-and-vomiting/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Area postrema</strong> &ndash; The area postrema has been referred to as the &quot;chemoreceptor trigger zone.&quot; Anatomically, this region is located at the caudal extremity of the floor of the fourth ventricle. Because the area postrema represents a relatively permeable blood-brain barrier region, it is the place where many, but not all, systemic chemicals act to induce emesis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-infant-or-child-with-nausea-and-vomiting/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. The area postrema is an important site for M1, D2, 5-HT<sub>3</sub>, and neurokinin 1 (NK1) receptors, each of which is a key mediator of vomiting.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Vestibular system</strong> &ndash; The vestibular system is involved in the emetic response to motion. This response is often exacerbated when vestibular input is in conflict with visual sensations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-infant-or-child-with-nausea-and-vomiting/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Irritation or labyrinthine inflammation can produce vomiting. Others have suggested that overstimulation of the vestibular system is not a complete explanation for motion sickness, and that circulating neuroactive compounds may be involved. H1 receptors in the vestibular nucleus have a role in this response.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Amygdala</strong> &ndash; The amygdala is involved in a variety of stress and emotional responses. Among other structures, it receives input from the olfactory bulb and olfactory cortex and sends impulses to the hypothalamus. Aberrant activation of the amygdala may lead to a sensation of nausea.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Somatomotor events</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The act of vomiting represents a highly coordinated sequence of events. As noted above, vomiting describes the act of emptying out the stomach, characterized by cycles of retching followed by the forceful expulsion of gastric contents. The detailed sequence of events is as follows [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-infant-or-child-with-nausea-and-vomiting/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The diaphragm descends and the intercostal muscles contract while the glottis is closed.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The abdominal muscles contract and the gastric contents are forced into upper gastric vault and lower esophagus.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The abdominal muscle relaxes and the esophageal refluxate empties back into the gastric vault.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Several cycles of retching, each more rhythmical and forceful in nature, occur, with shorter intervals in between.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Abdominal contraction associated with elevation of diaphragms results in forceful expulsion of gastric contents.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H102891044\"><span class=\"h1\">APPROACH TO MANAGEMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients with acute vomiting, typically for hours to a few days, most often present to an emergency department, whereas patients with chronic symptoms are more often initially evaluated in outpatient office settings. Emergency department clinicians should expeditiously exclude life-threatening disorders such as bowel obstruction, diabetic ketoacidosis, adrenal crisis, toxic ingestion, or increased intracranial pressure (ICP) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F51919\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef51919 \">table 2</a>).</p><p>In both urgent care and routine outpatient settings, the following three steps should generally be undertaken in patients with nausea and vomiting:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The etiology should be sought, taking into account the child's age, and whether the nausea and vomiting is acute, chronic, or episodic.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The consequences or complications of nausea and vomiting (eg, fluid depletion, hypokalemia, and metabolic alkalosis) should be identified and corrected.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Targeted therapy should be provided, when possible (eg, surgery for bowel obstruction or dietary changes for food sensitivity).

In many cases, the cause of the nausea and vomiting can be determined from the history, and physical examination and additional testing is not required. The urgency with which various diagnostic possibilities should be pursued depends upon a number of factors, including the duration of illness, overall clinical status of the patient (especially hydration, circulatory, and neurologic status), and associated findings.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H102891175\"><span class=\"h2\">Concerning signs</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Warning signs that may indicate a serious cause of vomiting include (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F100349\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef100349 \">table 3</a>):</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Nonspecific symptoms</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Prolonged vomiting</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Profound lethargy</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Significant weight loss</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Symptoms of gastrointestinal obstruction or disease</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Bilious vomiting</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Projectile vomiting in an infant three to six weeks of age</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Hematemesis</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Hematochezia (rectal bleeding)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Marked abdominal distension and tenderness</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Symptoms or signs suggesting neurologic or systemic disease</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Bulging fontanelle in a neonate or young infant</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Headache, positional triggers for vomiting or vomiting on awakening, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> lack of nausea</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Altered consciousness, seizures, or focal neurologic abnormalities</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>History of head trauma</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Hypotension disproportionate to the apparent illness, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> hyponatremia and hyperkalemia</p><p/><p>Patients should be referred to a pediatric gastroenterologist or other appropriate specialist (eg, pediatric surgeon, neurologist) when there are symptoms or physical findings that are of particular concern.

In addition, patients with prolonged vomiting are at risk for developing dehydration and electrolyte abnormalities.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Positional triggers for vomiting or vomiting on awakening, lack of associated nausea, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> headache suggests increased ICP. (See <a href=\"#H24\" class=\"local\">'Intracranial hypertension'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Associated symptoms:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Diarrhea (with or without fever) in a patient with acute onset of vomiting is consistent with viral gastroenteritis. This possibility is supported by a history of close contacts with vomiting <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> diarrhea and suggests gastroenteritis. However, more serious causes of these symptoms should be considered in patients with atypical features. These causes include infection (sepsis, infectious <span class=\"nowrap\">enteritis/colitis,</span> appendicitis, or inflammatory bowel disease [IBD]), and Hirschsprung disease-associated enterocolitis (especially in neonates or infants with risk factors, such as trisomy 21). (See <a href=\"#H18\" class=\"local\">'Gastroenteritis'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Rectal bleeding (hematochezia) suggests intussusception (especially in infants and toddlers), infectious colitis, or IBD.

Focal tenderness in the right upper quadrant suggests gallbladder disease (cholelithiasis or cholecystitis) or pancreatitis. Tenderness in the costovertebral angle suggests pyelonephritis. Abdominal pain or tenderness in the epigastric area is nonspecific, but is also consistent with esophagitis, gastritis, peptic ulcer disease, or pancreatitis.

Important causes of these symptoms include pyloric stenosis and intestinal obstruction (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F61133\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef61133 \">table 6</a>).

This symptom may be described as vomiting by parents. The symptom gradually improves in most infants during the first year of life, and may be minimized by conservative antireflux measures [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-infant-or-child-with-nausea-and-vomiting/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].

No specific clinical features definitively identify these infants, but they may have recurrent fussiness or irritability and feeding aversion. These symptoms are thought to result from pain caused by esophageal acid exposure. Bradycardia or cyanotic episodes also may occur, particularly in preterm or neurologically-impaired infants. Poor weight gain despite an adequate intake of calories should prompt evaluation for causes of vomiting and weight loss other than GERD.

The disease usually begins in early infancy, within one to four weeks following introduction of cow's milk or soy protein. It is most commonly caused by cow's milk or soy protein, although other foods can be triggers; it is uncommon in breastfed infants. FPIES is a non IgE-mediated reaction to food, similar to food protein-induced enteropathy, but with more severe manifestations.

In the past, patients were classically described as being emaciated and dehydrated with a palpable &quot;olive-like&quot; mass at the lateral edge of the rectus abdominus muscle in the right upper quadrant of the abdomen.

Plain radiographs of the abdomen generally provide a rapid assessment of possible bowel obstruction with relatively little radiation exposure. Abdominal ultrasound provides high sensitivity and specificity for detecting intussusception. If a diagnosis is not established by ultrasound and proximal bowel obstruction is suspected, then an upper gastrointestinal contrast study usually is appropriate. If the abdominal radiograph or physical examination suggests distal bowel obstruction (as might be seen in Hirschsprung disease), then a contrast enema usually is appropriate.

In this condition, the cecum is abnormally positioned in the right upper quadrant, and is fixated to the right lateral abdominal wall by bands of peritoneum. These abnormalities predispose to intestinal volvulus, in which the intestine twists on its mesentery. This causes acute small bowel obstruction and ischemia, which usually presents with sudden onset of bilious vomiting and an acute abdomen. Volvulus occurs early in infancy in approximately one-half of infants with malrotation. Other infants with malrotation may remain asymptomatic or present later in childhood with volvulus. Affected infants also may present with signs of duodenal obstruction or with associated congenital anomalies such as intestinal atresias.

The diagnosis can be suggested by a delay in passage of the first meconium (greater than 48 hours of age). Affected children may also present initially with enterocolitis, a potentially life-threatening illness in which patients have a sepsis-like picture with fever, vomiting, diarrhea, and abdominal distension, which can progress to toxic megacolon.

Patients with intussusception typically develop the sudden onset of intermittent, severe, crampy, progressive abdominal pain, accompanied by inconsolable crying and drawing up of the legs toward the abdomen. The episodes become more frequent and more severe over time. Vomiting may follow episodes of abdominal pain. Initially, emesis is nonbilious, but it may become bilious as the obstruction progresses. A sausage-shaped abdominal mass may be felt in the right side of the abdomen. As symptoms progress, increasing lethargy develops, which can be mistaken for meningoencephalitis. In up to 70 percent of cases, the stool contains gross or occult blood.

In most cases, dyspepsia appears to be functional in nature due to a disorder of upper gastrointestinal sensation and motility [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-infant-or-child-with-nausea-and-vomiting/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. Patients with functional dyspepsia often report nausea, but persistent vomiting is uncommon. Dyspepsia may occasionally arise from an organic disease such as peptic ulcer (with or without underlying Helicobacter pylori infection), food allergy, or Crohn disease. The approach to the adolescent patient with dyspeptic symptoms, and a more detailed discussion of functional dyspepsia are given separately.

By definition, neither is caused by underlying gastrointestinal disease, and the vomiting is not self-induced. Some patients have nausea alone, others have vomiting alone, and others have both symptoms; there may be associated autonomic symptoms such as pallor, sweating, or dizziness. These diagnostic categories are distinguished from functional dyspepsia by the absence of abdominal pain. They are more common in individuals with underlying anxiety or depression. Early morning nausea that improves throughout the day is a common temporal pattern [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-infant-or-child-with-nausea-and-vomiting/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. </p><p>The evaluation includes a focused history and physical examination to identify alarm symptoms suggesting a central nervous system disorder (eg, weight loss, neurological symptoms, severe morning vomiting or headaches), exclusion of pregnancy where appropriate, and assessment for psychological distress and a family history of functional gastrointestinal disorders. The possibility of gastroparesis (eg, post-viral) should be considered (see <a href=\"#H19\" class=\"local\">'Gastroparesis'</a> above). Similar to other functional gastrointestinal disorders, the most valuable intervention is an interdisciplinary approach addressing the psychosocial contributors, which may include reassurance, relaxation strategies, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> cognitive behavioral therapy. Antiemetic medications are generally ineffective for functional nausea. Selected patients with refractory functional nausea after referral to a specialist may benefit from a trial of pharmacotherapy with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cyproheptadine-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">cyproheptadine</a> or antidepressants [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-infant-or-child-with-nausea-and-vomiting/abstract/15-17\" class=\"abstract_t\">15-17</a>].

Early signs and symptoms of appendicitis are often subtle, and may vary depending upon the location of the appendix. An inflamed anterior or pelvic appendix produces marked symptoms in the right lower quadrant, while a retrocecal appendix may not cause the same degree of local signs of peritonitis because the inflammation is masked by the overlying bowel.</p><p>In many patients, initial features are nonspecific, including indigestion, flatulence, bowel irregularity, and sometimes just a sense of feeling unwell. These symptoms usually are followed by pain in the epigastrium or periumbilical region, which is visceral in character (ie, constant, not very severe in intensity, and poorly localizable). The symptoms eventually localize to the right lower quadrant once inflammation involves the overlying parietal peritoneum. Nausea and vomiting, if they occur, follow the onset of pain. The diagnosis of appendicitis is less likely in patients in whom nausea and emesis are the first signs of illness.
