It accounts for a large proportion of pediatric antibiotic prescriptions and is associated with considerable medical expenditures [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-otitis-media-in-children-diagnosis/abstract/2,3\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,3</a>].</p><p>The diagnosis of AOM will be reviewed here.

OME is also called serous, secretory, or nonsuppurative otitis media. OME frequently precedes the development of AOM or follows its resolution. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=otitis-media-with-effusion-serous-otitis-media-in-children-clinical-features-and-diagnosis#H5\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Otitis media with effusion (serous otitis media) in children: Clinical features and diagnosis&quot;, section on 'Clinical features'</a>.)</p><p>The distinction between OME and AOM may be difficult, since they are part of a continuous spectrum. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acute-otitis-media-in-children-treatment#H2\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Acute otitis media in children: Treatment&quot;, section on 'Clinical course'</a> and <a href=\"#H25\" class=\"local\">'Otitis media with effusion'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h1\">ANATOMY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The anatomic features of the right tympanic membrane are depicted in the figure (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F57110\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef57110 \">figure 1</a>). The normal middle ear is aerated, and the tympanic membrane is slightly convex, translucent, mobile, and intact (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F52626\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef52626 \">picture 1</a>). In contrast, in established AOM, the middle ear is fluid-filled, and the tympanic membrane is usually bulging, yellow or white in color, opaque, and immobile (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F97608\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef97608 \">picture 2</a>). In some cases, the tympanic membrane may be erythematous, but erythema of the tympanic membrane is a nonspecific finding; it is only helpful in making a diagnosis of AOM if there is concomitant bulging. Increased pressure in the middle ear may lead to central ischemia, necrosis, and perforation of the tympanic membrane.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h1\">IMPORTANCE OF ACCURATE DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The importance of accurate diagnosis of AOM cannot be overstated. Accurate diagnosis ensures appropriate treatment for children with AOM, who require antibiotic therapy, and avoidance of antibiotics in children with otitis media with effusion, in whom antibiotics are unnecessary. Accurate diagnosis also prevents overuse of antibiotics, which leads to the development of resistant organisms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-otitis-media-in-children-diagnosis/abstract/4-6\" class=\"abstract_t\">4-6</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=otitis-media-with-effusion-serous-otitis-media-in-children-management#H170941090\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Otitis media with effusion (serous otitis media) in children: Management&quot;, section on 'Approach to management'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acute-otitis-media-in-children-treatment#H6\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Acute otitis media in children: Treatment&quot;, section on 'Antibiotic therapy versus observation'</a>.)</p><p>Establishing the diagnosis of AOM in infants and young children can be difficult. The child may not cooperate with the examination, and the tympanic membrane may be obscured by cerumen. In addition, symptoms of AOM may overlap with those of upper respiratory tract infection or may be subtle or absent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-otitis-media-in-children-diagnosis/abstract/7-11\" class=\"abstract_t\">7-11</a>].

Otoscopy is performed using appropriate tools and an adequate light source (eg, a halogen bulb with brightness &ge;100 foot-candles [1000 lux]) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-otitis-media-in-children-diagnosis/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. The otoscope bulb should be replaced at least every two years, and the battery replaced when outdated [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-otitis-media-in-children-diagnosis/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. Pneumatic otoscopy skills, including accurate interpretation of findings, can be improved through training [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-otitis-media-in-children-diagnosis/abstract/13,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,14</a>]. Excellent training modules are available online (eg, <a href=\"http://pedsed.pitt.edu/06_browse.asp&amp;token=M36WSdalMXe9uztGb7UpNkGJRNLZsawd65UgNhCy2tY7/tKra8+hJ/JnrhcYB57/&amp;TOPIC_ID=6009\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">Children's Hospital of Pittsburgh ePROM: Enhancing Proficiency in Otitis Media</a>).</p><p>A pneumatic otoscope with a round head is preferred because it has the best seal (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F63633\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef63633 \">picture 3</a>). The magnifying glass can be moved aside if and when cerumen removal is necessary. The nipple on the metal head is the site of attachment for the insufflator bulb, which is used to assess mobility of the tympanic membrane. (See <a href=\"#H13\" class=\"local\">'Mobility'</a> below.)</p><p>Cerumen must be removed from the external canal under direct vision in order to be sure that the view of the tympanic membrane is unobstructed. Once cerumen has been removed, systematic assessment of the entire tympanic membrane is undertaken, as described below. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cerumen#H9\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Cerumen&quot;, section on 'Cerumen removal'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h2\">Overview</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The diagnosis of AOM requires middle ear effusion (MEE) and acute signs of middle ear inflammation (bulging of the tympanic membrane is the most specific and reproducible sign of middle ear inflammation) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-otitis-media-in-children-diagnosis/abstract/15,16\" class=\"abstract_t\">15,16</a>]. The classic examination findings include a tympanic membrane that is white or pale yellow, bulges into the external auditory canal, and has decreased or absent mobility (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F63268\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef63268 \">picture 4</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-otitis-media-in-children-diagnosis/abstract/17-19\" class=\"abstract_t\">17-19</a>]. However, this constellation of findings is not always present. (See <a href=\"#H19\" class=\"local\">'Diagnosis'</a> below.)</p><p>Accurate diagnosis of AOM requires systematic evaluation of the tympanic membrane for position, translucency, mobility, color, and other findings (eg, fluid level, perforation). Systematic assessment of the tympanic membrane is facilitated by the use of the COMPLETES mnemonic [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-otitis-media-in-children-diagnosis/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Color (eg, gray, white, pale yellow, amber, pink, red, blue)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Other conditions (eg, fluid level, bubbles, perforation, otorrhea, bullae, tympanosclerosis [scars], atrophic areas, retraction pockets, cholesteatoma)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Mobility</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Position (eg, neutral, retracted, full, or bulging)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Lighting (a halogen light source and fully charged battery should be used)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Entire surface (the four quadrants of the tympanic membrane should be examined) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F57110\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef57110 \">figure 1</a>)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Translucency</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>External auditory canal and auricle (eg, deformed, displaced, inflamed, foreign body)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Seal (a good seal requires an airtight pneumatic system and a speculum that is large enough to prevent air leak)</p><p/><p>Although the COMPLETES mnemonic serves as a reminder of the important aspects of the otoscopic examination, it reflects neither the order of the examination nor the importance of the individual components in distinguishing AOM from OME [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-otitis-media-in-children-diagnosis/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>].</p><p>Experienced otoscopists at a tertiary care children's hospital developed and validated a classification scheme describing the signs and symptoms that they use to diagnose AOM [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-otitis-media-in-children-diagnosis/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Bulging tympanic membrane (with or without opacification or air-fluid level): AOM</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Opacification of the tympanic membrane or air-fluid level: OME</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Absence of bulging, opacification, and air-fluid level: no MEE</p><p/><p>Although the cases of AOM, OME, and no MEEs that were used to develop and validate the classification scheme were not microbiologically confirmed, the otoscopists had completed a training program in which their diagnoses were validated against myringotomy findings. Expert otoscopists from other centers concurred in the relative importance of the findings of otoscopy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-otitis-media-in-children-diagnosis/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. We agree that bulging of the tympanic membrane is the crucial finding that differentiates AOM from OME. (See <a href=\"#H19\" class=\"local\">'Diagnosis'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h2\">Position</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A bulging tympanic membrane is the hallmark of AOM [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-otitis-media-in-children-diagnosis/abstract/10,15,17,19,21\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,15,17,19,21</a>]. The position of the tympanic membrane is the most critical characteristic in distinguishing AOM from OME [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-otitis-media-in-children-diagnosis/abstract/10,15,17,19\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,15,17,19</a>].

When the tympanic membrane is retracted, the manubrium of the malleus appears to be shortened, and the lateral process becomes more prominent and seems closer to the otoscope [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-otitis-media-in-children-diagnosis/abstract/20,22\" class=\"abstract_t\">20,22</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>When there is infected fluid in the middle ear, the tympanic membrane may appear to be full; larger amounts of infected fluid make it appear to bulge. Bulging is first apparent in the posterosuperior area, where the tympanic membrane is most compliant (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F57110\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef57110 \">figure 1</a>). When the tympanic membrane is bulging, the malleus handle is obscured (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F63268\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef63268 \">picture 4</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-otitis-media-in-children-diagnosis/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>].</p><p/><p>A bulging tympanic membrane is the single most important sign of acute inflammation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-otitis-media-in-children-diagnosis/abstract/10,15,17,19\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,15,17,19</a>]. In a large study correlating examination findings with a diagnosis of AOM, the triad of bulging tympanic membrane, impaired mobility, and redness or cloudiness of the tympanic membrane predicted myringotomy diagnosis of AOM in 83 to 99 percent of cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-otitis-media-in-children-diagnosis/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. In another study correlating examination findings with a diagnosis of AOM, 92 percent of children with AOM had a bulging tympanic membrane compared with none of the children with OME or no effusion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-otitis-media-in-children-diagnosis/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. In a systematic review, the adjusted likelihood ratio (LR) for bulging tympanic membrane was 51 (95% CI 36-73) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-otitis-media-in-children-diagnosis/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>].</p><p>In a large study correlating examination findings with a diagnosis of AOM, retracted tympanic membranes were unlikely to be associated with AOM [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-otitis-media-in-children-diagnosis/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. Normally positioned tympanic membranes were unlikely to be associated with AOM unless mobility was distinctly impaired.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h2\">Translucency</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Translucency of the tympanic membrane is another important aspect of the examination. The tympanic membrane normally appears translucent (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F52626\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef52626 \">picture 1</a>). In contrast, the tympanic membrane appears cloudy or opaque when there is fluid in the middle ear. Opacification of the tympanic membrane is not helpful in differentiating AOM from OME. In a study correlating examination findings with a diagnosis of AOM by experienced otoscopists, opacity of the tympanic membrane was present in 50 of 50 cases of AOM and 33 of 34 cases of OME [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-otitis-media-in-children-diagnosis/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>].</p><p>An air-fluid level is present when the tympanic membrane appears translucent above and opaque below the line of demarcation (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F67379\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef67379 \">picture 6</a>). Air fluid levels are more suggestive of OME than AOM [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-otitis-media-in-children-diagnosis/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. Air-fluid levels fluctuate with pneumatic otoscopy, a technique that helps distinguish fluid levels from tympanosclerosis, which, being part of the tympanic membrane, moves with it. (See <a href=\"#H13\" class=\"local\">'Mobility'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h2\">Mobility</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Pneumatic assessment of the mobility of the tympanic membrane is an important means of determining the presence of MEE, an essential criterion for AOM [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-otitis-media-in-children-diagnosis/abstract/20,23,24\" class=\"abstract_t\">20,23,24</a>]. However, pneumatic assessment does not indicate whether the fluid is infected and cannot be used in isolation to make a diagnosis of AOM. </p><p>Bulging of the tympanic membrane remains the single most important sign of AOM and precludes the necessity of pneumatic otoscopy because all bulging membranes have decreased or absent mobility. In addition, pneumatic otoscopy can be extremely painful in children with AOM.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1300575552\"><span class=\"h3\">Procedure</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Mobility of the tympanic membrane is assessed by creating positive and negative pressures within the external auditory canal by using the insufflator bulb of the otoscope. A good seal between the speculum and the external auditory canal is essential in order to make a judgment regarding mobility. A seal cannot be obtained if the tympanic membrane is perforated or contains a patent tympanostomy tube, or if the speculum is too small.</p><p>To ensure an airtight seal, the largest speculum that fits comfortably into the cartilaginous portion of the external auditory canal should be used (a 4 mm speculum will work for most children) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-otitis-media-in-children-diagnosis/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. The outer diameter of the speculum may be increased by putting a small piece of rubber tubing around the tip of the speculum [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-otitis-media-in-children-diagnosis/abstract/22,25\" class=\"abstract_t\">22,25</a>].</p><p>A leak in the pneumatic system is another reason for a poor seal. The pneumatic system should be checked for leaks periodically by occluding the tip of the speculum with a finger and squeezing the rubber bulb to see if resistance is felt [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-otitis-media-in-children-diagnosis/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>].</p><p>Mobility of the tympanic membrane is best visualized in the posterosuperior quadrant or pars flaccida, where the tympanic membrane is most compliant (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F57110\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef57110 \">figure 1</a>). Positive pressure is created when the insufflator bulb is compressed, and negative pressure when it is released. The tympanic membrane moves away from the observer with positive pressure and toward the observer with negative pressure (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F55117\" class=\"graphic graphic_movie graphicRef55117 \">movie 1</a>).</p><p>When there is high negative pressure in the middle ear cavity, the tympanic membrane may be maximally retracted and unable to move away from the observer with positive pressure (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F67928\" class=\"graphic graphic_movie graphicRef67928 \">movie 2</a>). Mobility of a retracted tympanic membrane can be assessed by creating negative pressure in the external auditory canal. The otoscope should be removed from the external canal and the bulb compressed. After the bulb is compressed, the otoscope is reinserted into the external canal. When the seal is secured, the bulb is released, creating negative pressure, which allows the retracted tympanic membrane to move toward the observer into a neutral position.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15\"><span class=\"h3\">Interpretation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Mobility is described as normal (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F55117\" class=\"graphic graphic_movie graphicRef55117 \">movie 1</a>), increased, absent (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F67928\" class=\"graphic graphic_movie graphicRef67928 \">movie 2</a>), or decreased.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Increased mobility of an area of the tympanic membrane may be caused by atrophy (an atrophied tympanic membrane is referred to as &quot;dimeric&quot;).

(See <a href=\"#H17\" class=\"local\">'Other findings'</a> below.)</p><p/><p>The finding of decreased or absent mobility of the tympanic membrane can confirm a diagnosis of MEE. When using this criterion to establish MEE, it is essential that the adequacy of the seal be assured; if it is not, the diagnosis of MEE may be faulty.
