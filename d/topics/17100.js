The normal heavy chain constant region (CH region) has a number of domains, of which CH1 is responsible for light chain binding. In the absence of an associated light chain, the CH1 domain binds to heat shock protein 78 (heavy chain binding protein, BiP), and the heavy chain undergoes proteasomal degradation rather than secretion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-heavy-chain-diseases/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].

It is the most common form of HCD and occurs in patients from the Mediterranean region or Middle East, usually young males, and is often associated with relatively poor sanitation.

Growth retardation (in children), digital clubbing, and mesenteric lymphadenopathy may also be present.</p><p>Infiltration of the jejunal mucosa with plasmacytoid cells is the most frequent pathologic feature. The duodenum and ileum are less often affected. The diagnosis depends upon the recognition of a monoclonal alpha heavy chain without an associated light chain in the serum, urine, intestinal secretions, or cells infiltrating the intestinal mucosa.</p><p>The serum protein electrophoretic pattern is normal in one-half of cases, and in the remainder an unimpressive broad band may appear in the alpha-2 or beta mobility regions. The amount of alpha heavy chain in the urine is small.</p><p>In the absence of therapy, alpha HCD typically is progressive and fatal. The usual treatment is with antibiotics such as tetracyclines and eradication of any concurrent infection (eg, parasites, viruses, <em>Helicobacter pylori</em>, <em>Campylobacter jejuni</em>).
