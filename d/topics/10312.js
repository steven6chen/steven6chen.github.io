Diagnosis is usually made in childhood, although diagnostic delays and variable disease manifestations are common and some individuals may be diagnosed with FA in adulthood. </p><p>Management of patients with FA is challenging because hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HCT) is curative for bone marrow failure and hematologic neoplasms but not for the non-hematologic features. Patients also require increased surveillance for both hematologic and non-hematologic malignancies, and reduced-intensity therapy is typically used for HCT and cancer treatment.</p><p>This topic review discusses the management and prognosis of FA. The clinical manifestations and diagnosis of FA is discussed in detail separately.

HCT outcomes in patients with FA have improved dramatically since 2000, a trend made possible by the development of FA-specific reduced intensity approaches to conditioning and improvements in the understanding of supportive care needs for these patients. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hematopoietic-cell-transplantation-for-idiopathic-severe-aplastic-anemia-and-fanconi-anemia-in-children-and-adolescents\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Hematopoietic cell transplantation for idiopathic severe aplastic anemia and Fanconi anemia in children and adolescents&quot;</a>.)</p><p>We refer all patients with FA who have evidence of bone marrow failure to a specialized HCT center to discuss the risks and benefits of HCT and to initiate evaluation of potential HCT donors. It may also be appropriate to refer individuals with FA who do not have bone marrow failure to an HCT center to discuss these issues. However, we do not advocate performing HCT in individuals with adequate bone marrow function, with the rationale that some individuals with FA, including those with mild cytopenias, will not develop bone marrow failure. Additionally, HCT prior to the onset of bone marrow failure may require increased conditioning intensity and thus carries risks of increased toxicity.

(See <a href=\"#H3496204996\" class=\"local\">'Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HCT)'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Androgen therapy may be a reasonable option to improve blood counts for some patients including those with moderate bone marrow failure for whom no donor is available, those who do not meet medical eligibility criteria for HCT due to pre-existing organ dysfunction or ongoing infection, and those who decline HCT. (See <a href=\"#H1182002631\" class=\"local\">'Androgens'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Alternatively, if the patient is asymptomatic with stable cell counts and no clonal abnormality, it may be reasonable to monitor the CBC every three to four months and perform a bone marrow examination annually as done for mild bone marrow failure. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">If there is a cytogenetic abnormality known to be associated with poor-risk MDS in the absence of other MDS-defining features, the CBC and bone marrow should be monitored more frequently (eg, CBC every one to two months; bone marrow every one to six months), and the best-available donor HCT should be pursued. (See <a href=\"#H3496204996\" class=\"local\">'Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HCT)'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For those with severe bone marrow failure (ANC <span class=\"nowrap\">&le;500/microL,</span> platelet count <span class=\"nowrap\">&le;30,000/microL,</span> hemoglobin &lt;8 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/dL),</span> <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> transfusion dependence, we pursue HCT with the best available donor. An HLA-matched sibling who has been determined not to have FA is preferable, with the second choice being a closely matched unrelated donor. If neither of these options are available, a trial of androgen therapy may be attempted while (or prior to) pursuing other alternative donors such as cord blood or haploidentical HCT, with attempts to limit transfusion exposure and opportunistic infections during the androgen trial. For individuals who do not have access to HCT for whatever reason (eg, medically ineligible, lack of donor, cost), androgen therapy or investigational approaches such as gene therapy may be used. (See <a href=\"#H1182002631\" class=\"local\">'Androgens'</a> below and <a href=\"#H2487193522\" class=\"local\">'Therapies under development'</a> below.)</p><p/><p>This monitoring schedule and management approach is consistent with the 2014 <a href=\"http://fanconi.org/images/uploads/other/FA_Guidelines_4th_Edition_Revised_Names_in_Appendix.pdf&amp;token=qlLEedu6CB82xt29LYuCHL4lQk4KuENFi2T9zRT86CTVwAFug7WHl7PQ13Vpdm3Y66hMow4LCurXBdnPECwe8H8ZO9HYtLUIdaOrSf4s17ZkKaQ80fF9bZ3YNIMGDsi+&amp;TOPIC_ID=109777\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">Fanconi Anemia Guidelines for Diagnosis and Management</a> from the Fanconi Anemia Research Fund [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-and-prognosis-of-fanconi-anemia/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p>Of note, immunosuppressive therapy (IST), which is used frequently in patients with acquired aplastic anemia, has no role in the treatment of FA because the disease is not immune-mediated.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3496204996\"><span class=\"h2\">Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HCT)</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Allogeneic HCT is the only established curative therapy for patients with FA and severe bone marrow failure, transfusion-dependent anemia or thrombocytopenia, MDS, or AML; we urgently refer these patients for HCT. The preferred approach is to use bone marrow (rather than peripheral blood stem cells) from an eligible sibling who is HLA matched at 8 of 8 alleles of the four most commonly tested HLA genes (HLA -A, -B, -C, and DRB1) or a closely matched unrelated donor.</p><p>It is critical to remember that all sibling or other related donors must undergo chromosomal breakage testing or genetic testing to ensure that they do not also have FA. This testing is necessary because family donors who are apparently asymptomatic and healthy may have FA but lack classic findings due to mosaicism, incomplete penetrance of FA-associated abnormalities, or young <span class=\"nowrap\">age/late</span> onset of disease manifestations. HCT performed with a family donor who also turns out to have FA, even if mosaic <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> asymptomatic, would carry a very high risk of graft failure. On the other hand, siblings who are only carriers of one heterozygous mutation in an autosomal recessive FA-associated gene are eligible as donors.</p><p>Options for patients with FA who lack a closely matched related or unrelated donor but still require HCT for bone marrow failure include the following:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For parents interested in having additional children, in vitro fertilization (IVF) with pre-implantation genetic diagnosis (PGD) approaches are an established method that not only ensures that future children will not have FA, but also can select for an HLA-matched sibling that can be used as a donor. While not always effective and also associated with challenging ethical and emotional dimensions that must be addressed, this approach has facilitated successful matched sibling donor HCT in a number of patients with FA dating back to 2001 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-and-prognosis-of-fanconi-anemia/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. This approach is not optimal for individuals with FA who have an urgent need for HCT (eg, those who require transfusions or have severe neutropenia despite optimal supportive care), since it may take one to two years before a healthy sibling donor is available. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=preimplantation-genetic-testing#H8\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Preimplantation genetic testing&quot;, section on 'Reasons couples choose to undergo PGD'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Unrelated cord blood transplantation (CBT) appears to be less effective than matched unrelated donor bone marrow for patients with FA. This was demonstrated in a 2007 series of 93 patients with FA who underwent CBT, in which overall survival was 40 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-and-prognosis-of-fanconi-anemia/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Use of cord blood units with higher stem cell doses and incorporation of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fludarabine-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">fludarabine</a> into CBT conditioning regimens may improve outcomes in the future.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Haploidentical HCT using a parental or other related donor is under investigation at several centers. This approach shows promise, although outcomes are not as good as those seen with closely matched unrelated donors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-and-prognosis-of-fanconi-anemia/abstract/4,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,5</a>].</p><p/><p>Based on the above results, CBT or haploidentical HCT should only be performed for patients with FA in the context of active clinical trials.</p><p>Individuals with FA are at risk for significant toxicity from standard chemotherapy doses used for HCT conditioning. Strategies developed at the University of Minnesota and other centers that incorporate reduced doses of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cyclophosphamide-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">cyclophosphamide</a> (20 to 60 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> total dose; representing 50 to 90 percent reduction compared with conventional cyclophosphamide conditioning doses), in combination with immunosuppressive but otherwise low-toxicity agents such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fludarabine-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">fludarabine</a> and anti-thymocyte globulin, have been extremely effective in matched sibling donor HCT for FA. Rates of engraftment associated with these approaches are &gt;90 percent, and overall post-HCT survival is &gt;95 percent in most series reported since 2005 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-and-prognosis-of-fanconi-anemia/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. Additional developments have also improved outcomes from unrelated donors, including matching with high-resolution HLA genotyping, T cell depletion, and conditioning regimens with lower toxicity. Thus, even though unrelated donor HCT may carry a higher risk of long-term toxicity, it is likely to be preferable to delaying HCT while attempting to use non-curative supportive care approaches to increasing blood counts. Issues related to HCT are discussed in more detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hematopoietic-cell-transplantation-for-idiopathic-severe-aplastic-anemia-and-fanconi-anemia-in-children-and-adolescents#H9\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Hematopoietic cell transplantation for idiopathic severe aplastic anemia and Fanconi anemia in children and adolescents&quot;, section on 'Fanconi anemia'</a>.)</p><p>Although HCT is curative for bone marrow failure and potentially for hematopoietic neoplasms, it does not cure other manifestations of FA. As noted above, HCT appears to increase the risk of squamous cell cancers, especially in individuals with severe graft-versus-host disease (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-fanconi-anemia#H2548628516\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of Fanconi anemia&quot;, section on 'Solid tumors'</a>). Additionally, insulin resistance, bone health disorders, and other endocrinopathies may be worsened by HCT, and require close lifelong monitoring [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-and-prognosis-of-fanconi-anemia/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H3483406247\" class=\"local\">'Identification and management of organ dysfunction'</a> below.)</p><p>Information on the pre-transplant evaluation, donor selection, conditioning regimen, optimal stem cell source (eg, bone marrow rather than peripheral blood) and post-transplant care are presented in detail separately.

Androgen therapy is also increasingly used to support blood counts for a period of weeks to months while parents attempt IVF with PGD and until the resulting HLA-matched donor is able to donate.</p><p>Only about half of patients with FA will respond to androgen therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-and-prognosis-of-fanconi-anemia/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. Patients with severe bone marrow aplasia are less likely to respond than those with residual bone marrow function, and responses can take weeks to months. Thus, the recommended time to initiate a trial of androgen therapy is when a patient has developed moderate to severe bone marrow failure (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F57755\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef57755 \">table 1</a>) but is not consistently transfusion dependent. Androgen therapy has the most dramatic effect on the erythroid lineage and can improve hemoglobin within a few weeks of initiation. Responses in the platelet count are generally slower and less complete, and neutropenia may not completely resolve. [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-and-prognosis-of-fanconi-anemia/abstract/11,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,12</a>].</p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=oxymetholone-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">Oxymetholone</a> is the most commonly used androgen in FA (starting dose 2 to 5 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg/day);</span> <a href=\"topic.htm?path=danazol-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">danazol</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=oxandrolone-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">oxandrolone</a> have also been used [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-and-prognosis-of-fanconi-anemia/abstract/13-15\" class=\"abstract_t\">13-15</a>]. If the blood counts stabilize or improve, the daily dose may be tapered to the minimum effective dose to avoid non-hematologic toxicity. If no response is seen after three months, oxymetholone should be discontinued.</p><p>The efficacy of androgens in FA was evaluated in a retrospective series of 70 patients from Germany who were treated with androgen therapy from 1974 to 2014 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-and-prognosis-of-fanconi-anemia/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. Of the 37 for whom medical records were available, most received <a href=\"topic.htm?path=oxymetholone-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">oxymetholone</a>. Approximately two-thirds of the patients had an improvement in their hemoglobin level (25 of 37; 68 percent); 12 of these (32 percent of the group) had trilinear responses, with improvement in hemoglobin, white blood cell (WBC) count, and platelet count. The median time to response was 12 to 14 weeks. In most cases, these responses were sufficient to convert the patient from transfusion-dependent to transfusion-independent. Toxicities were mild; however, liver adenoma was reported in 12 of 26 patients (46 percent). There was evidence of clonal evolution to MDS or AML in 12, all of whom underwent subsequent HCT. Overall survival of the cohort at approximately 10 years was 76 percent.</p><p>Androgen therapy can be associated with a number of side effects, including virilization, growth abnormalities, behavioral changes, and hypertension. The most concerning side effects of androgens in patients with FA involve the liver, and include transaminitis, cholestasis, peliosis hepatis, and liver tumors. In a series in which androgens were administered to 36 patients with FA and 97 patients with other conditions such as acquired aplastic anemia, those with FA were more likely to develop androgen-associated liver tumors at a younger age than those without FA [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-and-prognosis-of-fanconi-anemia/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. Of 36 liver tumors reported overall, 21 were hepatocellular carcinomas and 13 were adenomas. In the German experience mentioned above, liver adenoma was reported in the records of 12 of 26 patients (46 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-and-prognosis-of-fanconi-anemia/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. Given these concerning risks, patients receiving androgen therapy should have liver chemistry profiles monitored every one to two months, with liver ultrasounds performed every 6 to 12 months.</p><p>A 2014 study was the first to report outcomes of FA patients treated with low-dose <a href=\"topic.htm?path=oxandrolone-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">oxandrolone</a>, an anabolic steroid with a potentially favorable toxicity profile compared to <a href=\"topic.htm?path=oxymetholone-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">oxymetholone</a>. Of nine patients with a median follow-up of nearly two years, 78 percent had a hematologic response, none had clinical virilization, and none developed liver tumors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-and-prognosis-of-fanconi-anemia/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. More experience with this agent is needed.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3880265377\"><span class=\"h2\">Transfusions and growth factors</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Transfusion and growth factor support may be necessary due to progressive bone marrow failure and associated complications in patients with FA. However, increasing evidence supports a judicious approach, as extensive transfusions may be associated with worse outcomes with HCT, and extensive use and high doses of growth factors such as G-CSF and thrombopoietin mimetics in patients with other bone marrow failure syndromes have been associated with increased risks of developing MDS and AML.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>RBCs</strong> &ndash; Red blood cell (RBC) transfusion is indicated for any patient with symptomatic anemia (eg, decreased activity level, excessive fatigue, shortness of breath, and poor growth) or anemia with hemodynamic instability. Only leukoreduced, irradiated units of RBCs should be used, to minimize the risk of cytomegalovirus transmission, alloimmunization, and transfusion-associated graft-versus host disease (ta-GVHD). Directed donations by family members should be <strong>avoided</strong> to reduce the risk of graft rejection due to alloimmunization in patients who subsequently undergo HCT.

An approach to assessing and treating transfusional iron overload (eg, with phlebotomy or chelation therapy) is presented separately.

The use of single donor pheresis platelets minimizes exposure to multiple donors, and all products should be irradiated to prevent ta-GVHD. As with RBCs, directed platelet donations from family members should be avoided.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>G-CSF</strong> &ndash; Granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) or granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) raises the neutrophil count in most neutropenic patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-and-prognosis-of-fanconi-anemia/abstract/17-19\" class=\"abstract_t\">17-19</a>]. However, we reserve the use of G-CSF for patients with FA to those with an ANC <span class=\"nowrap\">&lt;200/microL,</span> or those with known active invasive bacterial or fungal infections and an ANC <span class=\"nowrap\">&lt;1000/microL,</span> due to concerns that G-CSF or GM-CSF may increase the risk of MDS and AML in patients with bone marrow failure syndromes.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">For those who require growth factor support, experience is greater with G-CSF than with GM-CSF.

Additionally, since siblings are potential donors for hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT), it is important to exclude siblings with FA as potential HCT donors. Testing for known familial mutations can also be pursued for other interested family members in addition to siblings.</p><p>Testing family members of an affected individual can be done by assessing for chromosomal breakage using peripheral blood lymphocytes, or by genetic testing if the familial mutation(s) have been characterized. Testing should be accompanied by counseling with a genetic counselor or clinician with expertise in FA and the management of heterozygotes. Counseling and testing of siblings should be done as soon as possible after proband diagnosis, so that alternative donor strategies can be pursued if there are no unaffected siblings who are an HLA match.</p><p>Prenatal testing is possible using cells obtained by chorionic villus sampling, amniocentesis, or cordocentesis. In vitro fertilization with PGD as discussed above is another method utilized to detect disease or carrier status prior to implantation of sibling embryos.

For most individuals who are heterozygous for an FA mutation, there may be a slight increased risk of cancer, but the absolute risk appears to be relatively small, and there are no specific recommended screenings for individuals who are heterozygous carriers.
