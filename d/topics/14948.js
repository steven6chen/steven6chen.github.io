It is typically a self-limited condition with fever and manifestations of acute inflammation lasting for an average of 12 days without therapy. However, cardiovascular complications, such as coronary artery (CA) aneurysms leading to potential occlusion and cardiac ischemia, occur in a sizeable percentage of untreated children. The major sequelae of KD are dramatically decreased as a result of therapy with intravenous <a href=\"topic.htm?path=immune-globulin-intravenous-subcutaneous-and-intramsucular-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">immune globulin</a> (IVIG). Nonetheless, the duration of fever correlates with risk of developing CA aneurysms. Therefore, additional therapy is advised in patients with persistent fever after initial IVIG therapy.</p><p>The treatment of refractory KD is discussed in this review. The initial treatment of KD, diagnosis, clinical manifestations, and cardiovascular sequelae are reviewed elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=kawasaki-disease-initial-treatment-and-prognosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Kawasaki disease: Initial treatment and prognosis&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=kawasaki-disease-clinical-features-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Kawasaki disease: Clinical features and diagnosis&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cardiovascular-sequelae-of-kawasaki-disease-clinical-features-and-evaluation\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Cardiovascular sequelae of Kawasaki disease: Clinical features and evaluation&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H623547\"><span class=\"h1\">RESISTANCE TO INITIAL COURSE OF IVIG</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Persistent or recurrent fever of any magnitude between 36 hours to approximately two weeks after the start of treatment in patients with KD is generally assumed to be the result of failure to abort the disease process. Patients who have persistent or recurrent fever more than 24 hours after completion of the initial treatment should also be assessed for intercurrent infection, and the diagnosis of KD should be re-evaluated. However, these patients should be retreated for presumed recrudescence of KD, unless there is clear evidence of another explanation for fever, since numerous studies have confirmed an association between prolonged fever and development of coronary artery (CA) abnormalities. Fever within 36 hours of the start of intravenous <a href=\"topic.htm?path=immune-globulin-intravenous-subcutaneous-and-intramsucular-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">immune globulin</a> (IVIG) therapy does not warrant retreatment, because it may represent a reaction to the medication or a slow response to therapy. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=kawasaki-disease-initial-treatment-and-prognosis#H19\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Kawasaki disease: Initial treatment and prognosis&quot;, section on 'Follow-up'</a>.)</p><p>It is important for the clinician to remain alert to mild temperature elevations in children treated for KD. In one study of 378 patients, those who remained febrile had an almost ninefold increased risk of developing CA abnormalities compared with those who responded to initial IVIG (12.2 versus 1.4 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/refractory-kawasaki-disease/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Accurate core temperature measurements are important for optimal management of KD patients in view of the strong association between elevated temperatures and CA abnormalities. Temperatures should be taken orally or rectally [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/refractory-kawasaki-disease/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Inaccurate temperature measurement may explain the rare reports of development of CA abnormalities after children apparently became afebrile based upon axillary temperature measurement [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/refractory-kawasaki-disease/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Thus, the most prudent approach to a child recovering from KD is regular follow-up during the convalescent period regardless of whether there are any signs of smoldering vasculitis. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=kawasaki-disease-initial-treatment-and-prognosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Kawasaki disease: Initial treatment and prognosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H624730\"><span class=\"h2\">Incidence</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Fever persists or returns within 48 hours in approximately 10 to 15 percent of patients with KD who are initially treated with IVIG and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aspirin-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">aspirin</a> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/refractory-kawasaki-disease/abstract/1,4-6\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,4-6</a>]. For unclear reasons, however, this fraction can vary significantly. In 2006, the incidence of refractory KD in Boston was 8 percent. In contrast, the likelihood of having KD refractory to initial IVIG therapy in San Diego increased to 38 percent in 2006 from a range of 10 to 20 percent between 1998 and 2005 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/refractory-kawasaki-disease/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. This increase was not associated with any changes in the formulations of IVIG used. In addition, the same IVIG brands and lots administered in San Diego to treat patients with KD were also used in Boston.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H623748\"><span class=\"h2\">Risk factors</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Just as the mechanism of action of IVIG in KD is not understood, the reason that some patients with KD fail initial IVIG therapy is also not clear. Retrospective studies have identified potential factors that predict which patients will require further therapy for refractory disease. The presence of one or more of these risk factors for treatment failure should alert clinicians to an increased likelihood that the patient may not respond adequately to the initial IVIG therapy. Scoring models based upon these risk factors have been developed to predict initial response to IVIG therapy, but their sensitivity (range from 86 to 33 percent) and specificity (range from 87 to 62) are still not adequate for identifying all children who would potentially benefit from augmented initial therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/refractory-kawasaki-disease/abstract/6-8\" class=\"abstract_t\">6-8</a>]. In addition, risk scores that are useful for identifying children in Japan who will have IVIG resistance are less effective in predicting which children are at risk for refractory KD in other populations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/refractory-kawasaki-disease/abstract/9,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,10</a>]. Nonetheless, many centers do add glucocorticoids or other agents to initial IVIG for children at high risk of failing to respond to initial IVIG even as ongoing studies seek to improve the sensitivity and specificity of algorithms for identifying such high-risk patients. Studies are ongoing to determine whether patients with these risk factors may benefit from more aggressive initial therapy. Risk factors for IVIG resistance and for CA aneurysms are reviewed in greater detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=kawasaki-disease-initial-treatment-and-prognosis#H3881491061\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Kawasaki disease: Initial treatment and prognosis&quot;, section on 'Identification of high-risk patients'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=kawasaki-disease-complications#H1213989795\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Kawasaki disease: Complications&quot;, section on 'Risk factors for coronary artery aneurysms'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H625620\"><span class=\"h2\">Other causes of fever</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Fever that occurs during or within 36 hours after the IVIG infusion may be due to a reaction to the medication [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/refractory-kawasaki-disease/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. Intercurrent infection or macrophage activation syndrome (MAS, a form of hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/refractory-kawasaki-disease/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>] are other potential causes of recurrent or prolonged fever in patients with KD. Alternative diagnoses, such as systemic juvenile idiopathic arthritis or a chronic vasculitis (eg, polyarteritis nodosa), should be considered when findings of KD are prolonged beyond three to four weeks. In general, a child diagnosed with KD who has persistent or recurrent fever plus reappearance of one or more of the presenting signs of mucocutaneous inflammation 36 hours after the start of the IVIG infusion is likely to have IVIG resistance. However, an absence of signs of KD other than fever, or appearance of manifestations of an infection, MAS, or other conditions, should lead to evaluation for other causes of fever. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=vasculitis-in-children-classification-and-incidence\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Vasculitis in children: Classification and incidence&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-polyarteritis-nodosa-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of polyarteritis nodosa in adults&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-hemophagocytic-lymphohistiocytosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical features and diagnosis of hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fever-without-a-source-in-children-3-to-36-months-of-age\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Fever without a source in children 3 to 36 months of age&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fever-of-unknown-origin-in-children-evaluation#H4\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Fever of unknown origin in children: Evaluation&quot;, section on 'Overview of evaluation'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h1\">RETREATMENT WITH IVIG</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Children who are febrile more than 24 to 36 hours after completion of the initial intravenous <a href=\"topic.htm?path=immune-globulin-intravenous-subcutaneous-and-intramsucular-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">immune globulin</a> (IVIG) infusion require additional therapy unless an alternative explanation for persistent or recurrent fever is unambiguously demonstrated. We generally re-treat children with persistent fever after an initial dose of IVIG with a single infusion of IVIG (2 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/kg)</span> for a total cumulative IVIG dose of 4 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/kg</span> (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F115933\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef115933 \">algorithm 1</a>) because of the apparent dose-response effect of IVIG and its general safety [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/refractory-kawasaki-disease/abstract/1,13,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,13,14</a>].</p><p>There are no prospective trials evaluating approaches to salvage therapy in children who fail initial treatment for KD. Results from observational studies suggest that the majority of patients with persistent fever after initial IVIG therapy will have resolution of their fever after retreatment with IVIG [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/refractory-kawasaki-disease/abstract/1,11,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,11,15</a>]. It also appears that retreatment with IVIG (resulting in a higher total cumulative dose of IVIG) decreases the risk of coronary artery (CA) aneurysms. However, some clinicians prefer to use alternative salvage agents such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=infliximab-including-biosimilars-of-infliximab-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">infliximab</a>, even though data demonstrating beneficial effects on CAs are minimal [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/refractory-kawasaki-disease/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>].</p><p>IVIG carries a dose-related risk of causing hemolytic anemia, with up to 15 percent of children receiving 4 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/kg</span> requiring transfusions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/refractory-kawasaki-disease/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. The hemolysis is due to antibodies against major blood types in IVIG. Children with type AB blood are at highest risk, while those with type O do not develop hemolysis. Thus, in some children with non-type O blood, we may use glucocorticoids instead of a second dose of IVIG for resistant KD (see <a href=\"#H8\" class=\"local\">'Glucocorticoid therapy'</a> below). Cumulative doses of IVIG above 4 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/kg</span> are typically not beneficial in KD, so we do not usually give more than this amount during the acute phase of KD. Overall, at least 5 percent of children remain febrile despite multiple doses of IVIG [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/refractory-kawasaki-disease/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=kawasaki-disease-initial-treatment-and-prognosis#H3\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Kawasaki disease: Initial treatment and prognosis&quot;, section on 'Intravenous immune globulin'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h1\">THERAPEUTIC OPTIONS IN PATIENTS WHO FAIL IVIG RETREATMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Even multiple doses of intravenous <a href=\"topic.htm?path=immune-globulin-intravenous-subcutaneous-and-intramsucular-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">immune globulin</a> (IVIG) may not completely control recalcitrant cases of KD. These patients are at high risk of developing coronary artery (CA) abnormalities and long-term sequelae of the disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/refractory-kawasaki-disease/abstract/18-20\" class=\"abstract_t\">18-20</a>]. The greatest risk factor is prolonged fever. Ideally, such patients should be identified prospectively, before CA abnormalities develop, allowing supplemental therapy to prevent or ameliorate vascular damage (see <a href=\"#H623748\" class=\"local\">'Risk factors'</a> above). One systematic review and meta-analysis of 16 controlled studies involving 2746 patients treated with IVIG plus glucocorticoids versus IVIG alone concluded that the efficacy of glucocorticoid in providing CA abnormality protection was inversely related to the duration of illness before glucocorticoids were administered [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/refractory-kawasaki-disease/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. Evidence is strong that the addition of glucocorticoids to initial IVIG treatment decreases the likelihood that high-risk patients will develop CA aneurysms. Analysis of rescue therapy with glucocorticoids, however, does not provide statistically significant evidence of a benefit on CA outcomes. Unfortunately, risk scores are insufficiently sensitive or specific to reliably identify high-risk patients. Instead, many patients wind up failing to fully respond to IVIG and then are candidates for salvage therapy (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F115933\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef115933 \">algorithm 1</a>). The ultimate goal, both with initial IVIG treatment and salvage therapy with glucocorticoids or other agents, is to prevent or minimize dilatation of the CAs, but no salvage agent unequivocally has been shown to achieve this goal in children who have failed to respond to IVIG.</p><p>Therapeutic options for rescue therapy are based upon agents that have demonstrated effectiveness in other vasculitides including glucocorticoids, inhibitors of tumor necrosis factor (TNF), other immunosuppressive agents, and plasmapheresis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/refractory-kawasaki-disease/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. These rescue therapies have not been compared in controlled studies, and all have been used in small numbers of children who are refractory to IVIG. While many second-line agents appear to be capable of controlling fever in children with KD, none have demonstrated a protective effect on CAs in prospective clinical trials. In addition, fever in KD is self-limiting, and apparent response to therapy reported in uncontrolled studies may represent abatement of the disease process that is not directly related to the therapy administered. Thus, while a wide variety of salvage agents are reported to be safe and effective in small, uncontrolled studies, their therapeutic utility remains unproven. Clinicians are thus left with numerous imperfect options and inadequate data to make a fully informed choice when their patient remains febrile and is at high risk of developing CA abnormalities.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Glucocorticoid therapy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Our practice is to employ a regimen of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methylprednisolone-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">methylprednisolone</a> (30 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> per day) for up to three consecutive days in patients who demonstrate ongoing signs suggestive of active vasculitis (eg, persistent or recurrent fever) despite two doses of IVIG (total 4 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/kg)</span> or whose risk of hemolysis with a second dose of IVIG warrants use of an alternate agent. Methylprednisolone is administered over two hours once daily until a full response (ie, resolution of fever and clinical manifestations of mucocutaneous inflammation) is obtained or the patient has received three doses of methylprednisolone. At that point, children who continue to have evidence of active vasculitis should be treated with one of the less-studied salvage therapies discussed below (eg, an anti-TNF agent or plasmapheresis). (See <a href=\"#H10\" class=\"local\">'TNF inhibition'</a> below and <a href=\"#H11\" class=\"local\">'Plasmapheresis'</a> below.)</p><p>As a result of experience with glucocorticoids for the treatment of a broad range of vasculitides, glucocorticoids were the first agents used as salvage therapy for children with KD who failed to respond to two courses of IVIG [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/refractory-kawasaki-disease/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. Several case reports, series, and uncontrolled clinical trials have reported the benefits of a short course of systemic glucocorticoids in patients with KD resistant to IVIG therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/refractory-kawasaki-disease/abstract/4,18-20,23,24\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,18-20,23,24</a>]. Most found that many patients had a good clinical response, with persistent resolution of fevers, and one retrospective study found daily <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prednisolone-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">prednisolone</a> rescue therapy for more than 15 days was effective in preventing CA abnormalities. However, not all found a difference in the incidence of CA aneurysms in those treated with systemic glucocorticoids versus an additional dose of IVIG [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/refractory-kawasaki-disease/abstract/4,25,26\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,25,26</a>]. One systematic review and meta-analysis concluded that salvage therapy with glucocorticoids may be ineffective in protecting CAs because too much time has passed and damage has occurred [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/refractory-kawasaki-disease/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. Until a randomized trial comparing the efficacy of glucocorticoids and other medications for salvage therapy provides high-quality data, clinicians will continue to have to rely on extrapolations from imperfect studies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/refractory-kawasaki-disease/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>].</p><p>Various glucocorticoid regimens are used in patients who fail to respond to IVIG therapy, generally paralleling glucocorticoid regimens for augmented initial therapy of KD. In North America, the first prospective trial of augmented primary treatment used intravenous (IV) pulsed-dose <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methylprednisolone-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">methylprednisolone</a> (30 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> per day) for up to three consecutive days, and this is the agent most often used to treat children who remain febrile after initial IVIG therapy. In Japan, children with KD are typically hospitalized longer than in the US, and salvage therapy is based upon the RAISE protocol, with daily doses of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prednisolone-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">prednisolone</a> 1 to 2 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg/day</span> IV or orally (PO) for at least 15 days [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/refractory-kawasaki-disease/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>].</p><p>The following studies are illustrative:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a Japanese case series, 63 of 411 patients (11 percent) did not respond to an initial IVIG infusion of 2 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/kg</span> IVIG and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aspirin-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">aspirin</a> (30 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> per day) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/refractory-kawasaki-disease/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. Thirty-four of 44 nonresponding patients treated with IV <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methylprednisolone-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">methylprednisolone</a> (30 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> per day for three days) had persistent resolution of their fevers. The remaining 19 nonresponding patients were treated with an additional dose of IVIG, and 12 patients had resolution of fever. All patients who failed second-line therapy were given another course of either methylprednisolone or IVIG. Overall, there were eight cases of CA aneurysms. One case occurred in a patient who responded to initial therapy, while the other seven cases occurred in patients who failed second-line therapy. Five of the 10 patients who failed to respond to methylprednisolone and two of the seven patients who failed to respond to a second dose of IVIG developed CA aneurysms.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In another trial, the safety and efficacy of pulsed-dose glucocorticoids versus additional doses of IVIG were compared in patients with IVIG-resistant KD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/refractory-kawasaki-disease/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. In this trial, 35 of 262 patients (13 percent) did not respond to an initial infusion of 2 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/kg</span> of IVIG plus <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aspirin-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">aspirin</a> (30 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> per day) and were retreated with an additional dose of IVIG (1 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/kg)</span>. Seventeen patients did not respond to the second dose of IVIG and were randomly assigned to receive either a single additional dose of IVIG (1 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/kg)</span> or pulsed-dose glucocorticoids. Those who received glucocorticoids had a shorter duration of fever and lower overall medical costs. The incidence of CA aneurysms was high in both groups and did not differ significantly between the two (five of seven in the group retreated with IVIG and seven of nine in the glucocorticoid group). This study was limited by the small number of patients and perhaps by the suboptimal dose of IVIG used for retreatment.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a retrospective study, Japanese researchers reviewed records of 1947 consecutive patients with KD between 2000 and 2011 at 13 hospitals in two prefectures of Japan [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/refractory-kawasaki-disease/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. Of the 1745 eligible patients who received initial therapy with IVIG (either 2 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/kg</span> for one day or 1 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/kg/day</span> over two consecutive days plus <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aspirin-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">aspirin</a> 30 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg/day),</span> 359 patients had fever for more than 24 hours after receiving IVIG or fever that recurred after an afebrile period and were eligible for analysis of first-line rescue therapy. Three groups were identified: 140 patients were treated with a second dose of IVIG (1 or 2 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg);</span> 80 patients were treated with IV <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prednisolone-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">prednisolone</a>, 2 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg/day</span> in three divided doses until C-reactive protein (CRP) normalized (&lt;0.5 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL),</span> after which the dose was switched to enteral administration and tapered over 15 days; and 154 patients received both the IVIG and prednisolone regimens. If the fever recurred, the duration or dose of prednisolone could be increased. Failure to respond to rescue therapy was less common in the IVIG plus prednisolone group (11.9 percent) than in the IVIG-alone group (28.7 percent) or the prednisolone-alone group (30.6 percent). Similarly, CA abnormalities were less prevalent in the IVIG plus prednisolone group (6.6 percent) than in the IVIG-alone group (15.4 percent) or the prednisolone-alone group (16.7 percent), although these differences did not reach statistical significance.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h2\">Other therapies</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The increased risk of CA aneurysms in children who fail IVIG and glucocorticoid therapy has led to a search for an alternative therapy in these patients. The following discussion includes several agents with the potential for causing more serious toxicity than either IVIG or glucocorticoids. Thus, we reserve these agents for children with severe refractory KD who have not only failed initial standard therapy, but also at least one repeat infusion of IVIG and a course of glucocorticoid therapy. In addition, these therapies should be given under the supervision of a clinician with expertise in treating children with KD. The most commonly used of these agents is the TNF-alpha inhibitor, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=infliximab-including-biosimilars-of-infliximab-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">infliximab</a>.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h3\">TNF inhibition</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Anti-tumor necrosis factor (TNF) alpha agents such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=infliximab-including-biosimilars-of-infliximab-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">infliximab</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=etanercept-including-biosimilars-of-etanercept-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">etanercept</a> have been studied for the treatment of KD because elevated levels of TNF are a characteristic of KD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/refractory-kawasaki-disease/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. TNF inhibition or blockade is a promising treatment for TNF-driven signs and symptoms in KD, based upon its relative safety, rapidity of action, and reported efficacy compared with plasmapheresis, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cyclosporine-ciclosporin-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">cyclosporine</a>, and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cyclophosphamide-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">cyclophosphamide</a>. In particular, these agents can rapidly, and apparently safely, lower fever and help normalize laboratory markers of inflammation in IVIG-resistant cases of KD. As with glucocorticoids, however, TNF inhibition has not convincingly been demonstrated to affect the development of CA abnormalities.</p><p>The potential adverse events associated with use of these agents, including infection and malignancy, are reviewed in greater detail separately. In general, however, few serious adverse effects have been reported in association with use of immunosuppressive agents in KD. Presumably this is because KD is a self-limited condition, so patients do not need prolonged, repeat dosing of second-line agents. Unlike long-term use in chronic diseases, children have brief exposure to the medications and therefore have less profound suppression of cytokines, lymphocytes, and neutrophils.

Progression of echocardiographic changes in CAs was similar between the two groups. There were no severe adverse events directly attributed to treatment in either group. Transient hepatomegaly (but with normal serum alanine aminotransferase [ALT]) was observed in five patients from the infliximab group and one from the IVIG group. Three patients treated with infliximab developed low-titer antibodies to infliximab.

Fever resolved in 92 percent of patients, most within 48 hours. Improvements in rash and conjunctival injection were also seen in many patients. Five patients had CA dilatation, and one had a CA aneurysm prior to treatment with infliximab. One month after disease onset, 12 patients had CA dilatation, and three had CA aneurysms, but, with longer-term follow-up, all cases of CA aneurysms and all but three cases of CA dilatation resolved. Transient drug eruptions and self-limited threefold elevations of hepatic transaminases were reported in seven patients. Eight patients developed synovitis, which resolved with use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, and four developed infections after treatment with infliximab, including <em>Pseudomonas</em> bacteremia in one, phlebitis in one, and urinary tract infections in two.

Four patients developed CA lesions. Proinflammatory cytokines (ie, soluble TNF receptor and interleukin [IL] 6), which were initially elevated, decreased with infliximab therapy in responsive patients, but elevated markers of cell-mediated vasculitis (ie, damage-associated molecular pattern molecules and vascular endothelial growth factor) were not suppressed. In contrast, in patients who responded to IVIG, all cytokines decreased markedly after IVIG therapy.

These medications are relatively toxic, with onsets of action in other conditions that are often delayed for days or weeks. Even patients with severe KD generally have fever for less than three weeks. Thus, few patients will remain ill enough to consider these immunosuppressive drugs by the time standard therapies have been exhausted.

Prolonged fever is a risk factor for coronary artery (CA) sequelae in KD. In these patients, other causes of fever should be considered. Risk factors for failing to respond to a single dose of IVIG include male sex, age &lt;6 months, elevated C-reactive protein (CRP), and low sodium or platelet levels. Patients with refractory KD are at increased risk of developing CA aneurysms.

Additional dose(s) of IVIG may be administered prior to considering other medications in those patients who remain febrile, although benefits of a total dose of more than 4 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/kg</span> of IVIG have not been demonstrated.
