The significance of these findings remains controversial and a causative role has not been proven. The vast majority of cannabis users do not develop schizophrenia, and not everyone diagnosed with schizophrenia has been exposed to cannabis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/co-occurring-schizophrenia-and-substance-use-disorder-epidemiology-pathogenesis-clinical-manifestations-course-assessment-and-diagnosis/abstract/54\" class=\"abstract_t\">54</a>].

As an example, patients with schizophrenia may use stimulants to reverse negative symptoms or depressed mood. Accumulating data support the idea that nicotine derived from smoking tobacco affects several neurotransmitter systems, including dopamine, and that certain neurocognitive deficits in schizophrenia associated with neurotransmitters (eg, reaction time, spatial working memory, sustained attention) are improved after nicotine administration [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/co-occurring-schizophrenia-and-substance-use-disorder-epidemiology-pathogenesis-clinical-manifestations-course-assessment-and-diagnosis/abstract/35,56\" class=\"abstract_t\">35,56</a>]. In addition, hydrocarbons derived from smoking tobacco (not related to nicotine intake per se) have been found to induce metabolism and lower plasma levels of antipsychotic drugs, thereby reducing side effects of these drugs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/co-occurring-schizophrenia-and-substance-use-disorder-epidemiology-pathogenesis-clinical-manifestations-course-assessment-and-diagnosis/abstract/57\" class=\"abstract_t\">57</a>]. Most studies, however, do not support this hypothesis. Substances used by individuals vary and appear to be motivated by several factors in addition to the individual&rsquo;s symptoms. Observations that substance abuse precedes the onset of psychosis or neuroleptic treatment in 14 to 69 percent of schizophrenia cases further argues against the &ldquo;self-medication hypothesis&rdquo; [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/co-occurring-schizophrenia-and-substance-use-disorder-epidemiology-pathogenesis-clinical-manifestations-course-assessment-and-diagnosis/abstract/43\" class=\"abstract_t\">43</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Bidirectional</strong> &ndash; This model suggests that the presence of either a mental disorder or SUD can contribute to the development of the other in a mutually reinforcing manner over time.

Substances of abuse are believed to ameliorate this deficit. Drugs such as nicotine, alcohol, and cocaine may reinforce brain reward pathways by increasing levels of dopamine in the nucleus accumbens of the limbic system. A specific example is cocaine, which blocks the dopamine transporter from reuptake of dopamine, thereby increasing the amount of dopamine in the synapse available to bind to and activate post-synaptic dopamine receptors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/co-occurring-schizophrenia-and-substance-use-disorder-epidemiology-pathogenesis-clinical-manifestations-course-assessment-and-diagnosis/abstract/43\" class=\"abstract_t\">43</a>]. Another example is nicotine, which is obtained by a high proportion of individuals with schizophrenia from smoking tobacco, and which affects the dopamine reward pathway by binding to nicotinic acetylcholine receptors in the midbrain [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/co-occurring-schizophrenia-and-substance-use-disorder-epidemiology-pathogenesis-clinical-manifestations-course-assessment-and-diagnosis/abstract/58\" class=\"abstract_t\">58</a>]. These neurons project from the ventral tegmental area to the nucleus accumbens where dopamine release leads to experiences of reward, promoting impulsive, addictive behavior [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/co-occurring-schizophrenia-and-substance-use-disorder-epidemiology-pathogenesis-clinical-manifestations-course-assessment-and-diagnosis/abstract/43\" class=\"abstract_t\">43</a>].

In addition, dopamine deficits in the prefrontal cortex related to repeated exposure to drugs may impair this region&rsquo;s ability to modulate dopamine release in the nucleus accumbens accounting for decreased sensitivity to rewards in chronically addicted patients and their attempts to compensate for this deficit through compulsive drug use [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/co-occurring-schizophrenia-and-substance-use-disorder-epidemiology-pathogenesis-clinical-manifestations-course-assessment-and-diagnosis/abstract/44,59\" class=\"abstract_t\">44,59</a>]. &#160;</p><p>Several hypotheses and associated research address specific substances:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Nicotine</strong> &ndash; Among the cognitive deficits in schizophrenia is visual-spatial memory. Hypofunction of cortical dopamine in the hippocampus of schizophrenia results in impaired performance in visual-spatial working memory.

These studies found that agonist activity of nicotinic agents at the alpha-7 acetylcholine receptor in the hippocampus and anterior cingulate corrects the visual-spatial memory impairment, sensorimotor gating abnormalities, social abnormalities, and changes in striatal dopamine release that have been demonstrated in genetic and transgenic rodent models of schizophrenia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/co-occurring-schizophrenia-and-substance-use-disorder-epidemiology-pathogenesis-clinical-manifestations-course-assessment-and-diagnosis/abstract/5,35,56\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,35,56</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">A 2016 systematic literature review of evidence from both animal and human studies reinforced evidence that nicotine obtained from smoking may be used to normalize (self-medication hypothesis) genetically-determined deficits in sensory gating and cognitive processing due to dysregulation of alpha-7 and alpha-4 beta-2 subunit containing nicotine receptors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/co-occurring-schizophrenia-and-substance-use-disorder-epidemiology-pathogenesis-clinical-manifestations-course-assessment-and-diagnosis/abstract/61\" class=\"abstract_t\">61</a>]. However, alternative evidence was also cited supporting the concept that nicotinic receptor dysfunction impairs dopamine-dependent reward circuits which accounts for both negative and depressive symptoms in schizophrenia and predisposes to heavy smoking (common or shared vulnerability hypothesis) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/co-occurring-schizophrenia-and-substance-use-disorder-epidemiology-pathogenesis-clinical-manifestations-course-assessment-and-diagnosis/abstract/61\" class=\"abstract_t\">61</a>]. This may explain evidence of early, premorbid smoking behavior, which itself may contribute to the expression and early onset of schizophrenia.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Further deficits in brain reward circuits accounting for risk of smoking were identified by functional magnetic resonance imagining in a study showing increased activation of the bilateral ventro-medial prefrontal cortex, a core region of the brain reward system, triggered by appetitive cigarette cues in 18 smokers with schizophrenia compared with 24 control smokers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/co-occurring-schizophrenia-and-substance-use-disorder-epidemiology-pathogenesis-clinical-manifestations-course-assessment-and-diagnosis/abstract/62\" class=\"abstract_t\">62</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Cannabis </strong>&ndash; Cannabinoids have been shown in animal models to modulate release of neurotransmitters implicated in psychosis, including dopamine and gamma-aminobutyric acid by activating cannabinoid-1 receptors (CB1) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/co-occurring-schizophrenia-and-substance-use-disorder-epidemiology-pathogenesis-clinical-manifestations-course-assessment-and-diagnosis/abstract/63\" class=\"abstract_t\">63</a>]. Preclinical evidence suggests that CB1-mediated increases in mesolimbic dopaminergic activity may explain the positive psychotic symptoms induced by tetrahydrocannabinol. Either too much or too little dopaminergic activity in the prefrontal cortex is associated with prefrontal cortex-related cognitive functions, leading to a bell-shaped relationship between dopamine levels and working memory efficiency [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/co-occurring-schizophrenia-and-substance-use-disorder-epidemiology-pathogenesis-clinical-manifestations-course-assessment-and-diagnosis/abstract/63\" class=\"abstract_t\">63</a>].

Although effects on neurotransmitter systems may account for some of the ability of cannabinoids to cause positive, negative, and cognitive symptoms, the mechanism by which exposure to cannabinoids might represent a risk factor associated with the development of schizophrenia remains unclear and controversial [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/co-occurring-schizophrenia-and-substance-use-disorder-epidemiology-pathogenesis-clinical-manifestations-course-assessment-and-diagnosis/abstract/63,67,68\" class=\"abstract_t\">63,67,68</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">The endocannabinoid system is critical to a number of neurodevelopmental processes that include axon elongation, neurogenesis, neural maturation, neural specification, glia formation, and neuronal migration [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/co-occurring-schizophrenia-and-substance-use-disorder-epidemiology-pathogenesis-clinical-manifestations-course-assessment-and-diagnosis/abstract/54\" class=\"abstract_t\">54</a>].

This could contribute to smaller fronto-temporal white matter volumes and cognitive impairment, which could in turn increase schizophrenia risk. Subsequent assessment of the influence of another cannabinoid-related gene, mitogen-activated protein kinase 14 (MAPK14), suggests that MAPK14-CB1 gene-gene interactions may mediate brain morphometric features in schizophrenia patients with heavy marijuana use [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/co-occurring-schizophrenia-and-substance-use-disorder-epidemiology-pathogenesis-clinical-manifestations-course-assessment-and-diagnosis/abstract/70\" class=\"abstract_t\">70</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Candidate gene studies suggest that the presence of risk alleles in dopamine D2 receptor, catechol-O-methyltransferase, protein kinase B, brain derived neurotropic factor, and FK505-binding protein genes may increase vulnerability to cannabis-induced psychosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/co-occurring-schizophrenia-and-substance-use-disorder-epidemiology-pathogenesis-clinical-manifestations-course-assessment-and-diagnosis/abstract/66,71\" class=\"abstract_t\">66,71</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Opioids</strong> &ndash; Since N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptors play important roles in the pathophysiology of substance misuse, rare variants in the NMDA-related genes have been hypothesized to exert effects on the risk for substance misuse.
