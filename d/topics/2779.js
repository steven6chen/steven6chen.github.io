Virtually all patients with malignant disease experience recurrent episodes of acute pain, which may accompany surgery, invasive procedures, or complications, such as a pathological fracture. In addition, chronic pain that is severe enough to warrant opioid therapy is experienced by 30 to 50 percent of patients undergoing active antineoplastic therapy and by 75 to 90 percent of those with advanced disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cancer-pain-management-general-principles-and-risk-management-for-patients-receiving-opioids/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>].</p><p>The causes of chronic pain are diverse in this population, and both prevalence and severity vary with the type of neoplasm, stage and extent of disease, prior treatment, comorbidities, and other factors. Tissue injury produced by the neoplasm is the primary etiology in about three-fourths of patients with chronic cancer pain, and the remainder have pain related to the late effects of antineoplastic therapy or to painful comorbidities. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=assessment-of-cancer-pain\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Assessment of cancer pain&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Opioid therapy is the first-line approach for moderate or severe chronic cancer pain. While opioids are effective analgesics, they are potentially abusable drugs. The public health consequences of opioid abuse drive the imperative that all physicians assume responsibility for risk management when these drugs are prescribed for legitimate medical purposes. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cancer-pain-management-with-opioids-optimizing-analgesia\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Cancer pain management with opioids: Optimizing analgesia&quot;</a>.)</p><p>This topic review will cover the general principles of cancer pain management and provide an overview of risk assessment and management in patients treated with opioids. An overview of assessment of cancer pain, a review of specific cancer pain syndromes, the clinical use of opioid analgesics, non-opioid analgesics (including adjuvant analgesics) and nonpharmacologic methods of cancer pain management are covered elsewhere. (See appropriate topic reviews.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">THE PROBLEM OF UNDERTREATMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Adequate pain relief can be achieved in 70 to 90 percent of patients when well-accepted treatment guidelines for cancer pain are followed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cancer-pain-management-general-principles-and-risk-management-for-patients-receiving-opioids/abstract/3-9\" class=\"abstract_t\">3-9</a>]. Given that most recommended therapies for cancer pain are within the scope of both specialty and primary care medical practice, the treatment of cancer pain should be viewed as a best practice for all medical disciplines involved in the care of this population.</p><p>Unfortunately, the availability of effective therapy and updated guidelines from reliable leading societies has not eliminated the problem of undertreatment of cancer pain [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cancer-pain-management-general-principles-and-risk-management-for-patients-receiving-opioids/abstract/10-16\" class=\"abstract_t\">10-16</a>]. A year 2014 systematic review concluded that while there was a decrease in undertreatment between 2008 and 2013 of approximately 25 percent (from 43 to 31 percent), approximately one-third of patients with cancer-related pain still do not receive pain medication proportional to their pain intensity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cancer-pain-management-general-principles-and-risk-management-for-patients-receiving-opioids/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. Furthermore, the odds of undertreatment are twice as high for minority patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cancer-pain-management-general-principles-and-risk-management-for-patients-receiving-opioids/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>].</p><p>The causes of undertreatment are multifactorial and reflect the combined effects of clinician-, patient-, and system-related barriers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cancer-pain-management-general-principles-and-risk-management-for-patients-receiving-opioids/abstract/10,17-21\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,17-21</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Clinicians often have inadequate knowledge and skills, or attitudes that minimize the importance of pain management. They may be reluctant to prescribe drugs due to concern about side effects or a fear of hastening death through aggressive pain control. &#160;</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients may underreport pain because of stoicism, a desire to be liked, or concerns about distracting the physician from antineoplastic treatment. In addition, when opioid therapy is provided, therapeutic nonadherence is believed to be common, perhaps due to fear of addiction or the development of side effects.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>System-wide impediments to optimal analgesic therapy may include financial concerns (eg, lack of health care insurance coverage, inability to purchase drugs), a limited number of specialists in pain management or palliative care, and an incentive structure in the health care system that does not encourage physicians to manage pain as a priority.</p><p/><p>Uncontrolled pain results in unnecessary suffering, decreased ability to cope with illness, interference with activities of daily living, and extended or repeat hospital admissions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cancer-pain-management-general-principles-and-risk-management-for-patients-receiving-opioids/abstract/19,22\" class=\"abstract_t\">19,22</a>]. Uncontrolled pain may also delay or disrupt anticancer treatment, compromising its effectiveness.</p><p>Given the profound impact of uncontrolled pain on all aspects of life, and the prevalence and complexity of undertreatment, clinicians must be attuned to the possibility that poorly controlled pain is being under-reported, and that it may be the result of poor access to care, under prescribing, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> nonadherence. The risk should be assumed to be particularly high in vulnerable populations, including minorities, the poor or uninsured, and in patients with a history of chemical dependency or other serious psychiatric disease. Awareness of undertreatment and the willingness to confront its causes is a first step toward improving outcomes.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">PAIN MANAGEMENT WITHIN THE CONTEXT OF PALLIATIVE CARE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Among individuals with active cancer, pain is best considered as a domain within the broader context of palliative care. Palliative care is an interdisciplinary therapeutic approach that focuses on the comprehensive management of the physical, psychological, social, and spiritual needs of patients with serious or life-threatening disease and their families [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cancer-pain-management-general-principles-and-risk-management-for-patients-receiving-opioids/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>].</p><p>The overriding goal of palliative care is to reduce the suffering and illness burden of the patient and family throughout the course of a progressive illness. Palliative care focuses on diminishing the burden of illness from the time of diagnosis to death. Effective palliative care considers the needs of both the patient and his or her family, viewing the family as the unit of care. It addresses the nature of grief before the death and into the bereavement period that follows. </p><p>Generalist-level palliative care (primary palliative care) can and should be provided by all clinicians who are involved in the ongoing care of the patient with a serious life threatening illness and his or her family. Consultation with clinicians who are specifically trained in palliative care (subspecialist or secondary) may be appropriate whenever the complexity of problems warrants a referral and is typically sought when the end of life is perceived to be near. Subspecialty palliative care services are most available in high-income countries, as exemplified by the United States. The availability of subspecialty palliative care in low income countries is quite limited. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=benefits-services-and-models-of-subspecialty-palliative-care\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Benefits, services, and models of subspecialty palliative care&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=palliative-care-and-hospice-outside-of-the-united-states\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Palliative care and hospice outside of the United States&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Palliative medicine specialists work in interdisciplinary teams, or develop networks that facilitate the involvement of other professionals when needed. Most hospitals in the US now have some type of institution-based palliative care consultation program [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cancer-pain-management-general-principles-and-risk-management-for-patients-receiving-opioids/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. Community-based palliative care is gradually emerging &ldquo;upstream&rdquo; from hospice, which at present, provides most cancer patients with specialist palliative care at the end of life [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cancer-pain-management-general-principles-and-risk-management-for-patients-receiving-opioids/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=palliative-care-delivery-in-the-home\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Palliative care delivery in the home&quot;</a>.)</p><p>From the perspective of palliative care, pain assessment and management are major aspects of the care plan that focuses on many domains related to quality of life. Pain management should be integrated with other strategies that are being used to address other key goals, such as the relief of other symptoms (eg, dyspnea, fatigue), coordination of care across sites, appropriate advance care planning, and management of family distress.</p><p>Like pain management itself, the broader clinical concerns that constitute palliative care should be considered a best practice for all clinicians engaged in the treatment of patients with cancer. At a generalist level, this typically takes the form of multidimensional assessment and intervention in a variety of domains related to preserving function, improving adaptation, and maintaining quality of life. When the clinical issues are complex, particularly when pain is difficult to control or accompanied by other concerns, referral to a palliative care specialist is appropriate. </p><p>Pain specialists may or may not have expertise in palliative care or a professional focus on pain in the cancer population. Because pain specialists vary in background, training, interest and accessibility, the clinician seeking help for a patient with challenging pain should ensure that a pain specialist has experience and capability in cancer pain before making a referral.</p><p>Regardless of the treatment team, assessment of the patient with cancer pain requires a clear understanding of the goals of care in relation to the broader treatment plan. As an illness advances, the goals of the patient and his or her family may evolve, gradually shifting to an emphasis on comfort above all else. As this occurs, decisions about therapy and the information provided to the patient and family may change. Modifying the care plan as goals of care shift requires ongoing communication, education, and support of the patient and his or her family. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=discussing-goals-of-care\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Discussing goals of care&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h1\">GENERAL PRINCIPLES OF PAIN MANAGEMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>An effective strategy for cancer pain management is predicated on several broad principles:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A detailed assessment of the pain should be performed initially; careful reassessment is indicated whenever a change occurs. The initial assessment of the patient with cancer pain always includes a history and examination, and often requires imaging or laboratory tests. The approach may be conceptualized as collecting data sufficient to characterize key elements of the pain (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=assessment-of-cancer-pain\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Assessment of cancer pain&quot;</a>):</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>A specific pain syndrome, if one can be defined (eg, multifocal bone pain or malignant brachial plexopathy) (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-cancer-pain-syndromes\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of cancer pain syndromes&quot;</a>)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>The inferred pathophysiology of the pain (eg, neuropathic pain related to dysfunction of the nervous system, or nociceptive pain related to ongoing tissue injury) (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=assessment-of-cancer-pain#H8\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Assessment of cancer pain&quot;, section on 'Inferred pathophysiology (types of cancer pain)'</a>)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>The etiology of the pain (ie, its relationship to the disease or another factor)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>The extent of cancer and the plan for further cancer treatment</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>The goals of care relative to pain management</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Other &quot;palliative care concerns&quot;, including management of symptoms other than pain. The somatic symptom burden tends to be high in patients with cancer-related pain, and recognizing and managing somatic symptoms may improve quality of life and functional status [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cancer-pain-management-general-principles-and-risk-management-for-patients-receiving-opioids/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The second principle recognizes that pain may be addressed by disease-modifying antineoplastic therapy and other interventions directed against the etiology of the pain. Treatments that address the underlying etiology of pain, such as radiation therapy, surgery, or in some cases, chemotherapy, can be integrated into a broader plan of care for symptom control. Treatment of cancer-related pain usually requires close consultation with an oncology specialist, who can provide the necessary information about the availability of antineoplastic therapy.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Whether or not primary disease-modifying therapy is possible, a large proportion of patients with pain due to active cancer require symptomatic treatment. Beginning in the early 1980s, a worldwide consensus has evolved that considers opioid-based pharmacotherapy as the mainstay approach for the symptomatic treatment of cancer patients with active disease and pain that is moderate to severe. This conclusion was originally codified in the World Health Organization's (WHO) &quot;analgesic ladder&quot; approach, which was originally published in the mid-1980s [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cancer-pain-management-general-principles-and-risk-management-for-patients-receiving-opioids/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>] and has had a global influence on clinical practice and policies pertaining to medication availability.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">The basic principles of the analgesic ladder apply to cancer patients with active disease, whether or not the patient is a candidate for disease-modifying therapy. As long as the patient reports pain, the starting point can be a pharmacotherapeutic strategy predicated on a stepwise approach determined by the severity of pain (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F63298\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef63298 \">figure 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cancer-pain-management-general-principles-and-risk-management-for-patients-receiving-opioids/abstract/27,28\" class=\"abstract_t\">27,28</a>]:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Patients with cancer pain that is generally mild should first be treated with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acetaminophen-paracetamol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">acetaminophen</a> or a nonsteroidal antiinflammatory agent (NSAID). This Step 1 of the ladder also states that this analgesic may be combined with an adjuvant drug that provides additional analgesia (ie, a so-called &quot;adjuvant analgesic&quot;, such as an analgesic antidepressant drug for neuropathic pain), treats a side effect, or manages a coexisting symptom. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cancer-pain-management-adjuvant-analgesics-coanalgesics\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Cancer pain management: Adjuvant analgesics (coanalgesics)&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Patients with moderate to severe pain, and those with chronic pain that is less intense but does not respond adequately to a trial of an NSAID alone, should be treated with an opioid.</p><p/><p>The analgesic ladder promotes the concept that one group of opioids should be conventionally used to treat pain of moderate intensity (step 2 of the ladder) and the other group of opioids should be conventionally selected for severe pain (step 3 of the ladder). Step 2 drugs were previously designated with the misnomer &quot;weak&quot; opioids (with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=codeine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">codeine</a> as the prototype) and step 3 drugs were designated &quot;strong&quot; opioids (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=morphine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">morphine</a> as the prototype). On both steps 2 and 3, the approach indicates the potential for benefit with combination therapy that includes an NSAID or other drugs to enhance analgesia or treat side effects.</p><p>It is important to understand the limitations of this analgesic ladder approach. Although it is still relevant in providing a framework for the stepwise and systematic approach to managing cancer pain, and describing an appropriate role for opioid therapy, many details are outdated and it should not be viewed as evidence-based or a best practice guideline. For example, the distinction between weak and strong opioids is pharmacologically outmoded and should not be used to justify the selection of one or another drug. Furthermore, at least one contemporary randomized trial found that low-dose <a href=\"topic.htm?path=morphine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">morphine</a> (up to 30 mg daily) reduced pain significantly as compared to <a href=\"topic.htm?path=codeine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">codeine</a> (or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tramadol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">tramadol</a>) with or without <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acetaminophen-paracetamol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">acetaminophen</a> in patients with moderate cancer pain with similar tolerability and an earlier effect [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cancer-pain-management-general-principles-and-risk-management-for-patients-receiving-opioids/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. &#160; </p><p>Evidence-based clinical guidelines now exist for managing cancer pain, and competency in cancer pain management requires a more detailed understanding of the principles of appropriate drug selection, dosing, and other processes of care than were originally built into the analgesic ladder strategy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cancer-pain-management-general-principles-and-risk-management-for-patients-receiving-opioids/abstract/4,5,7,8,30-32\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,5,7,8,30-32</a>]. Guidelines for use and selection of opioids for management of cancer-related pain are discussed in detail elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cancer-pain-management-with-opioids-optimizing-analgesia\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Cancer pain management with opioids: Optimizing analgesia&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The decades since the publication of the analgesic ladder have also witnessed the development of many other options for pain control, which are outlined in the table (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F74350\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef74350 \">table 1</a>). Adjuvant analgesics, as well as interventional, rehabilitative, psychological, and integrative approaches to pain control are discussed in detail elsewhere.

Their potential for abuse and addiction results from the &quot;brain reward&quot; they induce in biologically predisposed individuals, which is mediated through dopamine pathways in the brain. The public health consequences of opioid abuse drive the imperative that all physicians assume responsibility for risk management when potentially abusable drugs like opioids are prescribed for legitimate medical purposes. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=opioid-use-disorder-epidemiology-pharmacology-clinical-manifestations-course-screening-assessment-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Opioid use disorder: Epidemiology, pharmacology, clinical manifestations, course, screening, assessment, and diagnosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Medications with the potential for abuse and addiction such as opioids are regulated, with restrictions on whether and how they can be prescribed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cancer-pain-management-general-principles-and-risk-management-for-patients-receiving-opioids/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>]. In the US, these drugs are designated &quot;controlled substances&quot; under a federal law known as the Controlled Substances Act (CSA), which places controlled prescription drugs in one of five &quot;schedules&quot; based on abuse liability (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F66064\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef66064 \">table 2</a>). Under the CSA, most opioids used for cancer pain management are schedule II, which indicates a high liability for abuse and diversion. Both federal and state laws are in force to regulate all scheduled drugs, particularly those in schedule II. Physicians are required to know and comply with these laws. &#160;</p><p>With increasing prescription drug abuse and opioid-associated overdose deaths, the federal government has taken additional steps to regulate opioids. In response to a mandate by the US Congress, the Food and Drug Administration has created two Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategies (REMS), one for extended-release and long-acting opioids including transdermal preparations and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methadone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">methadone</a> analgesics, and one for transmucosal immediate release <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fentanyl-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">fentanyl</a> formulations (TIRFs) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cancer-pain-management-general-principles-and-risk-management-for-patients-receiving-opioids/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>]. </p><p>The prescriber components of the <a href=\"http://www.er-la-opioidrems.com/IwgUI/rems/home.action&amp;token=Y4MMePS/eSVj0Ey6UUx3RaLLdZ98LCZeAZM88Yjs7rX1eP3jGw9vdvJUro0wmoXs9kU85no4JAmiOfTJKCIxjw==&amp;TOPIC_ID=2792\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">REMS program for the long-acting/extended release preparations</a> (ie, prescriber education and patient counseling) are strongly encouraged, but not mandatory. However, for transmucosal <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fentanyl-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">fentanyl</a> (TIRF) preparations, the REMS requires registration of outpatient prescribers, pharmacies, distributors, and patients in the <a href=\"http://www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/cder/rems/index.cfm&amp;token=3Adm4xoOmtiUj4xfH9EHbjlyIZUQawoBWBPNSy+tfvCpKWWhIY7WFNtC7cZJHozdbp3q7d9H5bjyOsPOUzkCrA==&amp;TOPIC_ID=2792\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">TIRF REMS access program</a>. Prescribers may not prescribe transmucosal fentanyl for outpatient use until they have completed enrollment in the TIRF REMS program and a knowledge assessment. Furthermore, the REMS for transmucosal fentanyl includes mandatory statements signed by the patient and prescriber, which outline patient and physician responsibilities for safe opioid use. The approved REMS are available on the <a href=\"https://www.fda.gov/Drugs/DrugSafety/InformationbyDrugClass/ucm163647.htm&amp;token=8RYIFfyLhIBYEqeX7m6uPGtnB1wPEGG5AqBctyC78FWNGw+6UqbQagwqweZcANKrwh+moLZwcDmVFe62Yio+MEtisDt27nd5FzPpNWJoHPw=&amp;TOPIC_ID=2792\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">FDA website</a>.</p><p>It is unclear whether implementation of these REMS, especially for the <span class=\"nowrap\">extended-release/long-acting</span> preparations, will curb the potential for abuse with this group of drugs, and the REMS are just one of many changes happening at the federal and state levels that are intended to reduce drug abuse. The intent of these new laws and regulations, which is to reduce opioid abuse, is widely supported by clinicians, regulators, and those in law enforcement. Clinicians have raised concerns, however, that the effort to reduce risk could create barriers to prescribing, the result of which will be more unrelieved pain, challenging the ability of oncologists and palliative care clinicians to provide compassionate care that includes adequate pain relief. Achieving a balance in drug regulation between the need to reduce abuse and the need to maintain access to essential medications is very challenging, and the concerns that REMS and other approaches will increase the reluctance of oncologists and other clinicians to use opioids generally, or specific formulations like the transmucosal immediate-release <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fentanyl-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">fentanyl</a> drugs specifically, are legitimate. Principles for balancing opioid access with the need to curb misuse and abuse are addressed in a 2016 policy statement on protecting access to opioid treatment for cancer-related pain from the American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cancer-pain-management-general-principles-and-risk-management-for-patients-receiving-opioids/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>]. &#160; &#160; </p><p>Nevertheless, clinicians must remain vigilant.

Taken together, they suggest that hospice and palliative care programs are ill prepared for identifying and managing opioid misuse, abuse, and addiction. In one of these studies, a survey of Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education (ACGME)-accredited palliative medicine fellowship programs about substance abuse perception, policies, training, and screening, policies for screening patients (present at 41 percent of 32 programs), dealing with diversion (present at 27 percent), and use of a screening tool (present at 32 percent of programs) were reported infrequently [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cancer-pain-management-general-principles-and-risk-management-for-patients-receiving-opioids/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>].</p><p>The available evidence suggests that aberrant opioid behavior in patients with cancer-associated pain is not uncommon [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cancer-pain-management-general-principles-and-risk-management-for-patients-receiving-opioids/abstract/41,42\" class=\"abstract_t\">41,42</a>]. In one study of 432 patients with cancer-associated pain treated with opioids by palliative care specialists, 18 percent were using opioids in a nonprescribed manner to cope with the various stressful events associated with the diagnosis and management of their cancer [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cancer-pain-management-general-principles-and-risk-management-for-patients-receiving-opioids/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>]. Aberrant opioid use in this population can interfere with medical treatments, including oncologic care, and they may contribute to an internal struggle on the part of the physician to adequately treat pain without doing harm to the patient or the community. </p><p>Given the legitimate public health and law enforcement concerns about the impact of abuse, the broad clinical consensus about the central role of opioids in cancer pain management does not negate the obligation on the part of prescribers to assess and manage the possibility of drug abuse, the occurrence of first-time addiction or relapse, or the concern about diversion.</p><p>Prescribing of opioids should always be preceded by careful risk assessment. If the estimated risk of problematic drug-related behavior is considered to be substantial, a careful strategy is necessary to preempt or minimize problems [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cancer-pain-management-general-principles-and-risk-management-for-patients-receiving-opioids/abstract/5,43-46\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,43-46</a>]. Risk assessment requires a clear understanding of the phenomena that are associated with a risk of drug abuse, addiction, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> diversion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cancer-pain-management-general-principles-and-risk-management-for-patients-receiving-opioids/abstract/45\" class=\"abstract_t\">45</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Drug abuse</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The term &quot;drug abuse&quot; refers to the use of a drug in a manner that deviates from medical, legal, and social standards. Prescription drugs are abused when taken in any manner that was not prescribed. In the United States, prescription drug abuse has been on the rise for a decade. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prescription-drug-misuse-epidemiology-prevention-identification-and-management#H341971835\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Prescription drug misuse: Epidemiology, prevention, identification, and management&quot;, section on 'Prescription drug misuse'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Addiction</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Addiction is a disease with a strong genetic component that is defined by aberrant drug-taking behavior, characterized by craving, loss of control, compulsive use, and continued use despite harm. The biologic propensity toward addictive disease affects a small minority of the population, probably no more than 10 percent. A personal or family history of alcohol or drug abuse may reveal such a propensity, and individuals with such a history should be considered high risk for problematic drug-related behavior. It must also be recognized that the lack of such a history does not mean that the genetic predisposition to addiction is absent and it is possible that exposure to therapeutic opioids can unmask a previously unrecognized addictive disorder. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=risky-drinking-and-alcohol-use-disorder-epidemiology-pathogenesis-clinical-manifestations-course-assessment-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Risky drinking and alcohol use disorder: Epidemiology, pathogenesis, clinical manifestations, course, assessment, and diagnosis&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=opioid-use-disorder-epidemiology-pharmacology-clinical-manifestations-course-screening-assessment-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Opioid use disorder: Epidemiology, pharmacology, clinical manifestations, course, screening, assessment, and diagnosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Addiction must be distinguished from the physiologic phenomenon of physical dependence (defined solely by the occurrence of withdrawal symptoms after abrupt dose reduction or the administration of an antagonist) and tolerance (defined solely by the drug-induced loss of effect over time). Although these phenomena presumably occur commonly as addiction evolves, neither are necessary for addiction to occur, and equally important, neither means that abuse or addiction is occurring.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Diversion</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Diversion is a legal concept, referring to the distribution of a drug into the illicit marketplace. Physicians are required to stop prescribing when there is a strong likelihood that diversion of prescribed drugs is occurring. In the United States, this legal constraint is codified in the Federal Controlled Substances Act, which states that prescribing of a controlled prescription drug (ie, one with the potential for abuse) is legal only if it is for a legitimate medical purpose, and performed within the course of usual professional practice [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cancer-pain-management-general-principles-and-risk-management-for-patients-receiving-opioids/abstract/47\" class=\"abstract_t\">47</a>].

Great care must be taken, however, because physicians are subject to review under medical practice regulations, as well as drug laws, and must prescribe within conventionally accepted standards. When it is suspected, consultation with a specialist in addiction medicine, pain medicine or palliative care should be considered in an effort to appropriately diagnose and manage the nature of a drug-related problem. Careful documentation is mandatory.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h2\">Risk assessment</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>With an understanding of these phenomena, clinicians can stratify the estimated risk of problematic drug-related behavior in individual patients, and judge whether treatment with a controlled prescription drug can proceed without assistance from a specialist. General principles of risk assessment and risk management for patients receiving opioids for treatment of cancer pain are outlined in the table (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F50477\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef50477 \">table 3</a>).</p><p>Although numerous questionnaires have been developed for the prediction of risk, none has been adequately validated or is in widespread use [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cancer-pain-management-general-principles-and-risk-management-for-patients-receiving-opioids/abstract/48-51\" class=\"abstract_t\">48-51</a>]. In clinical practice, a relatively higher risk of problematic drug-related behavior during treatment with an opioid or other controlled prescription drug should be presumed if the patient has one or more of the following [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cancer-pain-management-general-principles-and-risk-management-for-patients-receiving-opioids/abstract/43,45,46\" class=\"abstract_t\">43,45,46</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A personal history of alcohol or drug abuse</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A family history of alcohol or drug abuse</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A major psychiatric disorder</p><p/><p>The presence of any of these factors indicates an elevated risk for problematic drug-related behavior. Other factors, such as younger age, smoking history, social isolation or involvement with a drug abuse subculture, a history of multiple automobile accidents, and inability to maintain employment, also may be important to consider when stratifying risk of aberrant drug-related behaviors. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prescription-drug-misuse-epidemiology-prevention-identification-and-management\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Prescription drug misuse: Epidemiology, prevention, identification, and management&quot;</a>.)</p><p>All cancer patients who are prescribed controlled prescription drugs must be carefully monitored during therapy for non-adherence.&nbsp;Those who are at relatively higher risk should be monitored more rigorously. While there are tools to assist with screening and diagnosis during therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cancer-pain-management-general-principles-and-risk-management-for-patients-receiving-opioids/abstract/48,52-58\" class=\"abstract_t\">48,52-58</a>], none are adequately validated, none have been studied in cancer patients, none can replace a careful substance use and psychiatric history, and none can be recommended for routine use.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h2\">Risk management</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Competent risk management empowers the clinician to use controlled prescription drugs as broadly and as aggressively as medical indications require.</p><p>When the risk of aberrant drug-related behavior is assessed as low (as it is in most patients with cancer pain), prescribing of an opioid can proceed with simple and straightforward strategies for monitoring and controlling drug use. The medical record should document that prescribing is occurring in the context of a therapeutic relationship and for a specific medical problem that has been evaluated in a routine manner (history, examination, appropriate formulation of diagnosis). Reassessment should be performed or planned at periodic intervals to ensure that the medication remains necessary and adequate. There should be documentation of each prescription that is written for a controlled substance.</p><p>In contrast, patients who are considered to be at relatively high risk for aberrant drug-related behavior should have additional &quot;control measures&quot; incorporated into therapy (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F50477\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef50477 \">table 3</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cancer-pain-management-general-principles-and-risk-management-for-patients-receiving-opioids/abstract/45,46,59,60\" class=\"abstract_t\">45,46,59,60</a>].
