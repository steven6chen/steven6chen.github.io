It can progress to blindness, and in some cases, be accompanied by potentially fatal systemic disease. It is typically caused by reactivation of latent disease. CMV retinitis can be prevented by initiating antiretroviral therapy (ART) early in the course of HIV infection. However, CMV retinitis is still seen in patients who do not have access to these medications <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> are unable to adhere to their ART regimen. </p><p>The treatment of CMV retinitis will be reviewed here. The epidemiology, clinical manifestations, and diagnosis of CMV retinitis are discussed elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pathogenesis-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-aids-related-cytomegalovirus-retinitis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pathogenesis, clinical manifestations, and diagnosis of AIDS-related cytomegalovirus retinitis&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H715106935\"><span class=\"h1\">APPROACH TO TREATMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>For patients who develop AIDS-related cytomegalovirus (CMV) retinitis, treatment consists of CMV antiviral therapy and antiretroviral therapy (ART) for HIV. In high-income settings, we suggest starting ART approximately two weeks after starting therapy to treat CMV [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-aids-related-cytomegalovirus-retinitis/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. However, in resource-limited settings, ART should be initiated immediately. (See <a href=\"#H101636402\" class=\"local\">'When to initiate antiretroviral therapy'</a> below and <a href=\"#H992685081\" class=\"local\">'Treatment in resource-limited settings'</a> below.)</p><p>Antiviral treatment options for CMV retinitis include systemic <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> intravitreal therapy. Our approach to treatment is consistent with guideline recommendations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-aids-related-cytomegalovirus-retinitis/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>] (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F80535\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef80535 \">table 1</a>):</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients with newly diagnosed infection, we first assess the location of the lesions (central versus peripheral) and if the patient has immediate sight-threatening disease (lesions &lt;1500 microns from the fovea or adjacent to the optic nerve head). </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>For patients with immediate sight-threatening lesions, we recommend initial therapy with local intravitreal injections in conjunction with systemic therapy. Treatment should be started as soon as possible [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-aids-related-cytomegalovirus-retinitis/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].

(See <a href=\"#H446525712\" class=\"local\">'Disease that is NOT immediately sight threatening'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The choice of which antiviral agents to use depends in part upon the individual&rsquo;s ability to take oral medications, the presence of comorbid conditions, their concomitant medications, and their ability to adhere to treatment. Other factors that impact the choice of treatment include the diagnostic capacity to determine the severity of disease, the availability of oral antiviral agents, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> skilled providers to perform intravitreal injections. (See <a href=\"#H446525724\" class=\"local\">'Systemic therapy'</a> below and <a href=\"#H992685081\" class=\"local\">'Treatment in resource-limited settings'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For those with relapsed infection, we typically suggest dual therapy with IV <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ganciclovir-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ganciclovir</a> (or oral <a href=\"topic.htm?path=valganciclovir-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">valganciclovir</a>) plus IV <a href=\"topic.htm?path=foscarnet-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">foscarnet</a>, unless ART has only recently been initiated, in which case further immune reconstitution may be expected and reinduction with monotherapy valganciclovir or foscarnet may well suffice. (See <a href=\"#H528854006\" class=\"local\">'Salvage therapy'</a> below.)</p><p/><p>Initial induction therapy is typically administered until retinitis has become inactive (usually two to three weeks). It is then followed by lower-dose maintenance therapy. (See <a href=\"#H461225826\" class=\"local\">'Duration of induction therapy'</a> below and <a href=\"#H446525759\" class=\"local\">'Maintenance therapy for initial infection'</a> below and <a href=\"#H528853403\" class=\"local\">'Discontinuing maintenance therapy'</a> below.)</p><p>Patients should be monitored closely on treatment to evaluate response to therapy and drug-induced complications (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F80535\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef80535 \">table 1</a>). Patients should then continue to be monitored, even after they have been successfully treated for CMV retinitis, to evaluate for the onset of significant intraocular inflammation secondary to an immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome. (See <a href=\"#H10\" class=\"local\">'Patient monitoring'</a> below and <a href=\"#H12\" class=\"local\">'CMV immune reconstitution inflammatory syndromes'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H446525483\"><span class=\"h1\">INDUCTION THERAPY FOR INITIAL INFECTION</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H446525490\"><span class=\"h2\">Disease that is immediately sight threatening</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>We recommend a combination of intravitreal therapy plus systemic therapy for patients with immediate sight-threatening disease (lesions located &lt;1500 microns from the fovea or adjacent to the optic nerve head) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F80535\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef80535 \">table 1</a>). Treatment should be administered as soon as possible. We use intravitreal therapy for such patients since it may take several days to achieve steady state intraocular drug levels with systemic therapy. There are no well-designed clinical trials evaluating the use of intravitreal therapy plus systemic therapy for patients with immediate sight-threatening disease. However, given the high risk of vision loss, we administer both modalities to minimize the risk of disease progression.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H446525662\"><span class=\"h3\">Intravitreal therapy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Intravitreal therapy should be used in conjunction with systemic therapy for patients with immediate sight-threatening disease (see <a href=\"#H446525724\" class=\"local\">'Systemic therapy'</a> below). Either <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ganciclovir-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ganciclovir</a> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=foscarnet-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">foscarnet</a> can be injected directly into the eye to achieve high drug levels. Several different regimens can be used [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-aids-related-cytomegalovirus-retinitis/abstract/1-3\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-3</a>]. We administer intravitreal injections of ganciclovir (2.5 mg in 0.05 ml volume) weekly for two to three injections. We prefer this formulation of intraocular ganciclovir, rather than one that requires a larger volume, to minimize the risk of increased ocular pressure. Foscarnet (2.4 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/injection)</span> can also be administered as intraocular therapy and should be given twice weekly for 1 to 4 doses over a period of 7 to 14 days. If systemic therapy is initiated within 24 hours of the initial intravitreal injection, subsequent injections are probably unnecessary. Potential adverse events related to intraocular injections include endophthalmitis, vitreous hemorrhage, and retinal detachment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-aids-related-cytomegalovirus-retinitis/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. </p><p>The use of intravitreal therapy is supported by small non-randomized studies that found intravitreal injections with either <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ganciclovir-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ganciclovir</a> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=foscarnet-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">foscarnet</a> were effective treatment for cytomegalovirus (CMV) retinitis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-aids-related-cytomegalovirus-retinitis/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. In addition, well-designed randomized trials demonstrated ganciclovir implants were better than intravenous (IV) ganciclovir as initial therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-aids-related-cytomegalovirus-retinitis/abstract/6,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,7</a>]. As an example, in a randomized trial of 188 patients with AIDS and newly diagnosed cytomegalovirus retinitis, the median time to progression of retinitis ranged from 191 to 221 days in those who received implants (depending upon the dose) versus 71 days in those who received IV ganciclovir [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-aids-related-cytomegalovirus-retinitis/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. However, ganciclovir implants are no longer being manufactured, and as such, are no longer a treatment option. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H446525724\"><span class=\"h3\">Systemic therapy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>We prefer oral <a href=\"topic.htm?path=valganciclovir-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">valganciclovir</a> for systemic therapy, rather than IV therapy, given its good oral bioavailability, ease of administration, and the reduced risk of complications or toxicity from an indwelling venous catheter. However, several other systemic therapy options (ie, IV <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ganciclovir-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ganciclovir</a>, IV <a href=\"topic.htm?path=foscarnet-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">foscarnet</a>, IV <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cidofovir-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cidofovir</a>) are available. The choice depends in part on the patient&rsquo;s ability to tolerate the individual agents. The antiviral agents used to treat CMV may require dose modifications for renal impairment; detailed dosing recommendations are available in the individual drug information monographs included within UpToDate and the individual topic reviews.

Valganciclovir is given at doses of 900 mg twice daily with food for the first 14 to 21 days of induction therapy. Oral bioavailability is approximately 60 percent and is 10-fold higher than that with oral ganciclovir [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-aids-related-cytomegalovirus-retinitis/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].

The toxicity profile of valganciclovir is identical to that of IV ganciclovir and is mainly related to its effect on bone marrow suppression [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-aids-related-cytomegalovirus-retinitis/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>].

In a systematic review of HIV-infected individuals from such countries, the prevalence of CMV retinitis from 2009 to 2013 was reported to be as high as 17.6 percent (95% CI, 12.6-22.7%) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-aids-related-cytomegalovirus-retinitis/abstract/63\" class=\"abstract_t\">63</a>]. The highest prevalence was observed in Asia, and approximately 30 percent of patients with CMV retinitis experienced blindness in one or both eyes. In a report from Myanmar, approximately one-third of patients with AIDS-related CMV retinitis died within three months of diagnosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-aids-related-cytomegalovirus-retinitis/abstract/65\" class=\"abstract_t\">65</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2155253472\"><span class=\"h2\">Antiviral regimens</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Early diagnosis and anti-CMV therapy is the best way to prevent CMV-related complications (eg, retinal detachment and immune recovery uveitis [CMV-IRU]). In addition, in resource-limited settings, antiretroviral therapy (ART) for HIV should be initiated immediately because the high early mortality risk generally outweighs the risk of developing a CMV-IRU. This is in contrast to high-income settings where ART is initiated approximately two weeks after anti-CMV induction therapy because such patients are typically monitored more closely and receive better supportive care for concurrent infections other than CMV. Additional discussions on initiating ART and immune reconstitution syndromes are found above. (See <a href=\"#H101636402\" class=\"local\">'When to initiate antiretroviral therapy'</a> above and <a href=\"#H12\" class=\"local\">'CMV immune reconstitution inflammatory syndromes'</a> above.) </p><p>Treatment for CMV retinitis should include systemic therapy with oral <a href=\"topic.htm?path=valganciclovir-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">valganciclovir</a>. However, several issues impact the approach to treatment in resource-limited settings: it may be difficult to determine the severity of CMV retinitis (eg, whether or not sight-threatening disease is present or absent); there are limited options for managing toxicity to initial therapy (eg, granulocyte stimulating factor to treat neutropenia); and alternative systemic antiviral agents such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=foscarnet-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">foscarnet</a> are typically not available.

Although CMV retinitis can be prevented by initiating antiretroviral therapy (ART) early in the course of HIV infection, this disease is still seen in patients who do not have access to these medications <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> are unable to adhere to their ART regimen. (See <a href=\"#H1\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients <strong>with</strong> immediately sight-threatening lesions, we recommend initial therapy with an immediate intravitreal injection of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ganciclovir-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ganciclovir</a> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=foscarnet-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">foscarnet</a> plus systemic therapy for CMV rather than systemic therapy alone (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=2\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1B</a>). Criteria for sight-threatening lesions are lesions &lt;1500 microns from the fovea or adjacent to the optic nerve head. If systemic therapy is initiated within 24 hours of the initial intravitreal injection, subsequent injections are probably not necessary. (See <a href=\"#H446525490\" class=\"local\">'Disease that is immediately sight threatening'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients <strong>without</strong> immediately sight-threatening CMV retinitis, we recommend systemic therapy rather than local therapy (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=2\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1B</a>). Oral <a href=\"topic.htm?path=valganciclovir-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">valganciclovir</a> is as effective as intravenous therapy and is therefore typically the preferred systemic therapy. (See <a href=\"#H446525712\" class=\"local\">'Disease that is NOT immediately sight threatening'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Induction therapy with systemic antiviral medications is typically administered for 14 to 21 days. However, the ultimate duration is determined by the patient&rsquo;s response to therapy. After successful induction therapy, patients should transition to maintenance therapy with reduced doses of anti-CMV therapy. (See <a href=\"#H461225826\" class=\"local\">'Duration of induction therapy'</a> above and <a href=\"#H446525759\" class=\"local\">'Maintenance therapy for initial infection'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Dilated indirect ophthalmoscopy should be performed two weeks after initiating therapy. For patients with immediately sight-threatening disease, some clinicians perform weekly dilated retinal exams until there is evidence of healing. Patients should be followed monthly thereafter while the patient is on anti-CMV treatment; fundus photographs obtained at these visits are optimal for detecting early relapse. (See <a href=\"#H10\" class=\"local\">'Patient monitoring'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients in high-income settings who are not already on ART, we suggest that ART be started approximately two weeks after initiating CMV therapy rather than starting concurrently with CMV therapy or delaying therapy significantly longer than two weeks (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). However, in resource-limited settings, ART should be initiated immediately. (See <a href=\"#H101636402\" class=\"local\">'When to initiate antiretroviral therapy'</a> above and <a href=\"#H992685081\" class=\"local\">'Treatment in resource-limited settings'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We suggest discontinuing CMV maintenance therapy in the patients who are on ART with an undetectable viral load if they meet all of the following criteria: received anti-CMV therapy for at least three months, have quiescent retinitis, and have a CD4 count &ge;100 <span class=\"nowrap\">cells/microL</span> for at least three months (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). We restart maintenance therapy if the CD4 count subsequently drops below 100 <span class=\"nowrap\">cells/microL</span>. (See <a href=\"#H528853403\" class=\"local\">'Discontinuing maintenance therapy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Any patient who develops vision loss, visual blurring, floaters, or ocular pain on CMV therapy should be evaluated by an ophthalmologist to determine if these symptoms are related to CMV progression, relapse, retinal detachment, or an immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (eg, CMV immune recovery uveitis). ART should not be stopped in the setting of IRIS given the importance of immune recovery, but anti-inflammatory therapy may provide some benefit. (See <a href=\"#H12\" class=\"local\">'CMV immune reconstitution inflammatory syndromes'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For most patients who relapse on maintenance therapy, we suggest IV <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ganciclovir-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ganciclovir</a> (or oral <a href=\"topic.htm?path=valganciclovir-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">valganciclovir</a>) plus <a href=\"topic.htm?path=foscarnet-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">foscarnet</a> (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=5\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2B</a>). However, if a patient does <strong>not</strong> have immediately sight-threatening disease, and only recently initiated ART, we would re-administer induction therapy using the same agent they previously received. (See <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'Relapsed infection'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In resource-limited settings, the treatment of CMV retinitis should include systemic therapy with oral <a href=\"topic.htm?path=valganciclovir-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">valganciclovir</a>.
