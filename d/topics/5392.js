It is characterized by fever, peripheral edema, pulmonary opacities, hypoxemia, respiratory distress, hypotension, renal and hepatic dysfunction, rash, and serositis resulting in pleural and pericardial effusions. It is a cytokine release syndrome, sometimes called &quot;cytokine storm,&quot; and all of the pathophysiologic consequences result from the release of inflammatory cytokines from malignant promyelocytes, probably independent of their differentiation to segmented neutrophils and hyperleukocytosis. </p><p>The differentiation syndrome occurs in approximately 25 percent of patients with APL during induction therapy that includes <a href=\"topic.htm?path=all-trans-retinoic-acid-systemic-tretinoin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">all-trans retinoic acid</a> (ATRA, also known as tretinoin) or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=arsenic-trioxide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">arsenic trioxide</a> (ATO), but it is also seen in untreated patients or after other cytotoxic therapies. Early recognition and aggressive management are essential.</p><p>The pathogenesis, clinical presentation, diagnosis, and treatment of differentiation syndrome will be discussed here. The pathogenesis, diagnosis, and treatment of APL are presented separately.

In addition, it also occurs in patients with relapsed or refractory APL who are treated with these agents. The risk of the syndrome is not a function of the dose of either of these agents, nor is it proportional to the WBC count. Differentiation syndrome is not observed when ATRA <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> ATO are used as consolidation or maintenance therapy for APL, nor does it complicate ATRA or ATO treatment of non-APL malignancies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/differentiation-retinoic-acid-syndrome/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. This syndrome depends on the presence of malignant promyelocytes. For example, APL is the most common acute leukemia to present with non-infectious fever, and this is thought to be due to the release of cytokines even before treatment is initiated.</p><p>While the reported incidence rates of differentiation syndrome have ranged from 2 to 27 percent in patients treated with standard doses of ATRA and 30 percent in patients treated with ATO, this variation is at least partially due to the use of different diagnostic criteria among studies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/differentiation-retinoic-acid-syndrome/abstract/1-4\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-4</a>]. The incidence may be lower when ATRA is administered concurrently with induction chemotherapy or prophylactic glucocorticoids [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/differentiation-retinoic-acid-syndrome/abstract/1,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,5</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H23\" class=\"local\">'Prevention'</a> below and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=initial-treatment-of-acute-promyelocytic-leukemia-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Initial treatment of acute promyelocytic leukemia in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p>One of the largest studies analyzed 739 patients with newly diagnosed APL treated with ATRA plus <a href=\"topic.htm?path=idarubicin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">idarubicin</a> for induction as part of two prospective trials [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/differentiation-retinoic-acid-syndrome/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. Differentiation syndrome was diagnosed in 25 percent; 13 percent were severe and 12 percent were moderate.</p><p>As yet, no factors reliably predict which patients are more or less likely to develop differentiation syndrome after treatment with ATRA or ATO. An increased incidence has been reported in patients with an elevated white blood cell (WBC) count at diagnosis, a rapidly increasing WBC count, expression of CD13 on APL blasts, or an elevated body mass index (BMI), although only a high BMI has been confirmed as a risk factor in subsequent studies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/differentiation-retinoic-acid-syndrome/abstract/7-14\" class=\"abstract_t\">7-14</a>]. It is important to recognize that the syndrome can occur in the absence of an elevated WBC count.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">PATHOGENESIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The etiology of the differentiation syndrome is incompletely understood, but is thought to be due to release of inflammatory vasoactive cytokines, causing capillary leak, fever, edema, rash, and hypotension [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/differentiation-retinoic-acid-syndrome/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. It has also been linked to the maturation of promyelocytes induced by <a href=\"topic.htm?path=all-trans-retinoic-acid-systemic-tretinoin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">all-trans retinoic acid</a> (ATRA) or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=arsenic-trioxide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">arsenic trioxide</a> (ATO), followed by tissue infiltration by the maturing cells [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/differentiation-retinoic-acid-syndrome/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>], but this may be a secondary phenomenon.</p><p>Acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) is characterized by the presence of an abnormal PML-RARa fusion gene that encodes a protein, which functions as an aberrant retinoid receptor. This <span class=\"nowrap\">PML/RARa</span> protein heterodimerizes with the retinoid X receptor (RXR); the resulting <span class=\"nowrap\">PML/RARa-RXR</span> complex binds to retinoic acid responsive elements in target genes. This interaction blocks myeloid differentiation at the promyelocytic stage. ATRA and ATO induce differentiation of the malignant myeloid clone by dissociating the <span class=\"nowrap\">PML/RARa-RXR</span> complex from the target genes. This leads to a sudden increase in differentiated myelocytes and neutrophils that is believed to contribute to the pathogenesis of differentiation syndrome. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=molecular-biology-of-acute-promyelocytic-leukemia#H2\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Molecular biology of acute promyelocytic leukemia&quot;, section on 'Retinoic acid and the retinoic acid receptor'</a>.)</p><p>Patients treated with ATRA or ATO who develop differentiation syndrome demonstrate interstitial edema and infiltration of the lung, lymph nodes, spleen, liver, and pericardium with maturing myeloid cells [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/differentiation-retinoic-acid-syndrome/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Three general theories have been proposed to explain the infiltration of myeloid cells into the lung and other tissues:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>ATRA and ATO may induce release of cytokines from differentiating myeloid cells that cause a capillary leak syndrome. In vitro studies have demonstrated a strong upregulation of chemokine production by APL cells after treatment with ATRA <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> ATO [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/differentiation-retinoic-acid-syndrome/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. In addition, the administration of vasoactive cytokines (eg, interleukin-2 for renal cell carcinoma) produces a number of features of the differentiation syndrome, including fever, generalized weight gain, and episodic hypotension [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/differentiation-retinoic-acid-syndrome/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>].

Some of these abnormalities may be due to the underlying acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) and concomitant chemotherapy.</p><p>Patients with APL are monitored daily with complete blood counts.

Radiographic opacities often mimic the patterns seen with pulmonary edema or an infectious pneumonia in a febrile neutropenic patient. Ground glass opacity tends to be diffuse, involving most or all lung zones [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/differentiation-retinoic-acid-syndrome/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. However, approximately 40 percent of patients with differentiation syndrome have a clear chest radiograph at presentation, although only 11 percent of patients with severe disease have a clear chest radiograph, so treatment of the differentiation syndrome should not be delayed by waiting for the radiograph to become abnormal [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/differentiation-retinoic-acid-syndrome/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h3\">Computed tomography</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The chest computed tomography (CT) findings associated with the differentiation syndrome are nonspecific and may include diffuse ground glass opacities, subpleural nodular opacities, septal thickening, pleural and pericardial effusions, and patchy consolidation (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F66511\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef66511 \">image 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/differentiation-retinoic-acid-syndrome/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].

We recommend prompt treatment with glucocorticoids for all patients with suspected differentiation syndrome and typically use intravenous <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dexamethasone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">dexamethasone</a> 10 mg twice daily. The dexamethasone is continued for at least 3 days and until the complete disappearance of symptoms and is then tapered. This recommendation is largely based on the following observations:</p><p>In a series of 44 patients with differentiation syndrome, intravenous <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dexamethasone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">dexamethasone</a> was initiated at a dose of 10 mg twice daily in all but two patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/differentiation-retinoic-acid-syndrome/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. <a href=\"topic.htm?path=all-trans-retinoic-acid-systemic-tretinoin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">All-trans retinoic acid</a> (ATRA) was discontinued at the earliest signs or symptoms of the differentiation syndrome in 82 percent in that study. The following results were noted:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Two deaths occurred that were attributable to the differentiation syndrome. One of these patients did not receive <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dexamethasone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">dexamethasone</a> until three days after the onset of symptoms; the other had prompt administration of dexamethasone.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The syndrome resolved in all eight patients continued on ATRA with the addition of glucocorticoids.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>None of the patients who subsequently received ATRA as maintenance therapy developed differentiation syndrome.</p><p/><p>Retrospective comparisons have noted a decreased mortality rate after the widespread use of empiric glucocorticoid therapy compared with no glucocorticoid therapy (approximately 5 versus 30 percent mortality) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/differentiation-retinoic-acid-syndrome/abstract/6,25,37,38\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,25,37,38</a>]. This evidence suggests that high-dose glucocorticoids (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dexamethasone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">dexamethasone</a> 10 mg every 12 hours) are beneficial and has made it impossible to conduct a placebo-controlled trial [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/differentiation-retinoic-acid-syndrome/abstract/1,2,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2,7</a>]. However, some patients will have progression of their symptoms despite dexamethasone administration [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/differentiation-retinoic-acid-syndrome/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>].</p><p>The potential toxicities of short-term glucocorticoid treatment include hyperglycemia, insomnia, depression, emotional instability, and immunosuppression.

Based on the retrospective study of 44 patients described above and our clinical experience, it seems likely that ATRA <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> ATO can be safely continued for most patients with differentiation syndrome as long as prompt treatment with glucocorticoids is implemented [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/differentiation-retinoic-acid-syndrome/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H19\" class=\"local\">'Glucocorticoids'</a> above.)</p><p>While ATRA and ATO are clearly implicated in the pathogenesis of the syndrome, they are an essential component of the curative treatment for acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL). It is clear that patients with APL who receive both ATRA and chemotherapy have superior rates of complete remission and disease-free survival when compared with patients who receive chemotherapy alone. This is discussed in more detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=initial-treatment-of-acute-promyelocytic-leukemia-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Initial treatment of acute promyelocytic leukemia in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Many clinicians will stop the ATRA <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> ATO if the differentiation syndrome symptoms are severe (eg, requirement for high-flow oxygen or mechanical ventilation). This practice is largely based upon theoretical concerns regarding the pathogenesis of differentiation syndrome, which may not be correct.</p><p>When ATRA is discontinued due to severe manifestations of the differentiation syndrome, it may be resumed once manifestations of the differentiation syndrome have resolved. In a retrospective series, differentiation syndrome recurred in 3 of the 19 patients in whom ATRA was discontinued and then reintroduced; two of the three were taking concurrent glucocorticoids [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/differentiation-retinoic-acid-syndrome/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].
