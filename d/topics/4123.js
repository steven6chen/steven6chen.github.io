Echinacea is indigenous to North America and was used by Native Americans in the Great Plains. Samples of echinacea have been found in archeological digs from the 1600s, thought to be the location of Lakota Sioux Indian village sites [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-use-of-echinacea/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Native Americans were noted to use echinacea both topically and systemically for ailments such as burns, snakebites, pain, cough, and sore throat [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-use-of-echinacea/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].</p><p>Various echinacea species including <em>Echinacea purpurea</em>, <em>E. angustifolia</em>, and <em>E. pallida</em> have been touted as &quot;immune stimulants&quot; by a number of investigators [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-use-of-echinacea/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. Medicinal preparations of root and above-ground parts of echinacea species have been the subject of in vitro, animal, and human studies to evaluate their possible mechanism(s), safety, and efficacy.</p><p>At present, echinacea is used by individuals mainly with the intention of treating or preventing uncomplicated upper respiratory tract infections (URI) such as the common cold [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-use-of-echinacea/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. Sales of echinacea in the United States in 2008 were estimated to be $15.1 million, a 4.5 percent increase from 2007 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-use-of-echinacea/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. The National Health Interview Survey found that echinacea use decreased by about one-half from 2007 to 2012. Echinacea was the sixth most common non-vitamin, non-mineral supplement used by adults in the United States in 2012, used by 2.3 million adults [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-use-of-echinacea/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. Similarly, echinacea use by children fell from the most commonly used herbal product in 2007 to the fourth most common in 2012 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-use-of-echinacea/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].

Though several echinacea products are standardized to the amount of echinacosides, there is no general consensus on the active component(s) of echinacea responsible for its purported medicinal properties.</p><p>In vitro, echinacea causes macrophage activation and the release of tumor necrosis factor, interleukin 1, interleukin 6, and interferon [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-use-of-echinacea/abstract/9-11\" class=\"abstract_t\">9-11</a>]. Echinacea has been noted to have antiviral activity against influenza [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-use-of-echinacea/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>], herpes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-use-of-echinacea/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>], and poliovirus. Phenolic compounds present in echinacea demonstrate antioxidant activity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-use-of-echinacea/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. It has also been reported to have antiinflammatory activity through inhibition of lipoxygenase and cyclooxygenase [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-use-of-echinacea/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>] and is able to stimulate the anterior pituitary-adrenal cortex.</p><p>In animal studies, echinacea affects several aspects of the immune system, in part by increasing the number of circulating white blood cells [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-use-of-echinacea/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. Echinacea also increases phagocytosis, promotes activity of lymphocytes, stimulates cytokine production, triggers the alternate complement pathway, and modulates apoptosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-use-of-echinacea/abstract/17,18\" class=\"abstract_t\">17,18</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL TRIALS/INDICATIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Many clinical studies have attempted to elucidate the safety and effectiveness of echinacea. Unfortunately, many of these studies have poor methodology and are difficult to interpret conclusively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-use-of-echinacea/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. However, several randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials have been undertaken and are of sufficient quality to derive useful information, particularly around the use of echinacea for upper respiratory tract infections (URI).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Upper respiratory tract infection</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Echinacea is commonly used for the treatment and prevention of nonspecific URI.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12395121\"><span class=\"h3\">Treatment</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Echinacea research is challenging because there are differing opinions regarding the best echinacea species, plant part, active component(s), and dose. Echinacea products used in studies are often not standardized. Several controlled trials of echinacea for URI prior to 2000 showed a decrease in symptom intensity and duration [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-use-of-echinacea/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. Since then, randomized trials have found that echinacea is no better than placebo for the treatment of URI [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-use-of-echinacea/abstract/21-26\" class=\"abstract_t\">21-26</a>]. A 2014 systematic review of 15 randomized trials comparing echinacea with placebo for the treatment of colds found no benefits of echinacea products [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-use-of-echinacea/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h3\">Prevention</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Well-designed studies of echinacea have not generally found it to be efficacious for the prevention of community-acquired URI [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-use-of-echinacea/abstract/5,28\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,28</a>]. However, a 2014 systematic review found that the results of individual trials using echinacea for cold prophylaxis consistently had positive trends towards benefit despite lack of statistical significance [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-use-of-echinacea/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. Post-hoc pooled data from 9 of 10 echinacea prevention trials (1167 patients) showed a 10 percent absolute risk reduction in cold incidence, which was statistically significant although of questionable clinical significance.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A randomized, controlled trial of 109 patients with a history of more than three colds or respiratory infections in the preceding year, randomly assigned the study subjects to receive 4 mL fluid extract of <em>Echinacea purpurea</em> or 4 mL of placebo juice twice daily [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-use-of-echinacea/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. The incidence and severity of colds and respiratory infections were determined during eight weeks of follow-up, based upon patient reported symptoms together with findings on physical examination. During the eight-week treatment period, 35 of 54 patients (65 percent) in the echinacea group and 40 of 54 patients (74 percent) in the placebo group had at least one cold or respiratory infection (relative risk 0.88, 95% CI 0.60-1.22). The average number of colds and respiratory infections per patient was 0.78 in the echinacea group and 0.93 in the placebo group (difference 0.15, CI -0.12-0.41). The median duration of colds and respiratory infections was 4.5 days in the echinacea group and 6.5 days in the placebo group (difference 2 days, CI -1-+3 days). There were no significant differences between treatment groups in the number of infections in each category of severity. Side effects were observed in 11 patients (20 percent) of the echinacea group and in 7 patients (13 percent) of the placebo group (p = 0.44).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A randomized trial assigned 302 adults to receive <em>E. purpurea</em>, <em>E. angustifolia</em>, or placebo for 12 weeks [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-use-of-echinacea/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. The time until onset of the first URI was not significantly different for the three groups (66, 69, and 65 days, respectively). There were also no significant differences in URI rates for the two echinacea groups compared with placebo.</p><p/><p>Experimental studies have also generally not found that echinacea is effective in preventing URI after challenge with rhinovirus [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-use-of-echinacea/abstract/5,25,29,30\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,25,29,30</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A small trial randomly assigned 48 adults to receive echinacea (2.5 mL three times daily) or placebo for seven days before and seven days after nasal inoculation with rhinovirus type 39 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-use-of-echinacea/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. There was a similar rate of microbiological infection with rhinovirus in both groups (92 versus 95 percent). There was a trend toward fewer patients treated with echinacea developing clinical colds (58 versus 82 percent, p = 0.11) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-use-of-echinacea/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A randomized trial examined the effects of three different preparations of <em>E. angustifolia</em> root (extracted with supercritical carbon dioxide, 60 percent ethanol, or 20 percent ethanol) and placebo in 399 volunteers who were challenged with rhinovirus [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-use-of-echinacea/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. Treatment was administered three times daily with a 1.5 mL tincture (the active preparation contained the equivalent of 300 mg of echinacea root) for five days prior to rhinovirus challenge. Rates of infection and clinical URI were not significantly different for any of the preparations or placebo.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h1\">SAFETY</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Adverse reactions</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Although echinacea is usually well-tolerated, side effects can occasionally occur.

Fever along with nausea and vomiting have also been reported.</p><p>Allergic reactions can occur in individuals sensitive to the <span class=\"nowrap\">Asteraceae/Compositae</span> family. Patients allergic to ragweed, chrysanthemums, marigolds, and daisies may have reactions to echinacea [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-use-of-echinacea/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]. One trial found that rash was also more frequent in children treated with oral echinacea compared with placebo (7.1 versus 2.7 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-use-of-echinacea/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>].</p><p>One case report of anaphylaxis associated with use of <em>Echinacea angustifolia</em> and <em>E. purpurea</em> has been published; however, the exact mechanism and amount of concern remain controversial [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-use-of-echinacea/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h2\">Use in autoimmune disease</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The immune stimulating effects of echinacea have led to concerns regarding the use of echinacea in patients with autoimmune disorders [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-use-of-echinacea/abstract/33,34\" class=\"abstract_t\">33,34</a>]. Despite these concerns, little is known regarding the exacerbation of autoimmune illnesses due to echinacea. Case reports include an exacerbation of pemphigus vulgaris, a recurrence of erythema nodosum, and a case of renal tubular acidosis due to Sj&ouml;gren&rsquo;s associated with echinacea use [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-use-of-echinacea/abstract/35-37\" class=\"abstract_t\">35-37</a>]. By contrast, a pilot study in patients with low-grade autoimmune idiopathic uveitis found that treatment with <em>E. purpurea</em> extract was associated with shorter duration of steroid treatment required to induce remission [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-use-of-echinacea/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h2\">Use in pregnancy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A cohort study followed pregnant women who contacted the Toronto Motherisk Program about gestational use of echinacea [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-use-of-echinacea/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>]. There were 206 women who used echinacea products in pregnancy (112 in the first trimester). No increased risk for still births, spontaneous abortions, and major malformations occurred for the women who used echinacea compared with 206 controls matched for age, alcohol use, and cigarette smoking. Similarly, the Norwegian Mother and Child Cohort Study identified 363 pregnant women reporting echinacea use with no associated higher risk of congenital anomalies or poor pregnancy outcomes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-use-of-echinacea/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>]. A systematic review also did not find evidence suggesting that echinacea is teratogenic [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-use-of-echinacea/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>]. Nonetheless, it is prudent to avoid echinacea during pregnancy and lactation.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h1\">HERB-DRUG INTERACTIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Because of its immunostimulating activity, echinacea may interfere with immunosuppressant therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-use-of-echinacea/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]. One study in healthy volunteers found that echinacea can impact CYP3A and CYP1A2 activities [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-use-of-echinacea/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>]. Although there are no case reports of adverse interactions, caution should be used when administering echinacea along with drugs dependent on these enzymes for elimination.</p><p>One in vitro study found that echinacea can stimulate proliferation of cervical and breast cancer cells in the face of exposure to <a href=\"topic.htm?path=doxorubicin-conventional-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">doxorubicin</a> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-use-of-echinacea/abstract/43\" class=\"abstract_t\">43</a>].

Typical dosages recommended by manufacturers and herbal experts and used in studies are 300 to 400 mg of dried extract three times daily, one cup of tea (1 gram root in 150 mL boiling water for 5 to 10 minutes) three times daily, and 0.25 to 1 mL of liquid alcohol extract three times daily [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-use-of-echinacea/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]. Many experts also believe that use more than eight weeks continuously is not advisable [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-use-of-echinacea/abstract/44\" class=\"abstract_t\">44</a>], although several studies have revealed no significant adverse effects with up to 12 weeks of continuous use.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h1\">BRAND</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Many different preparations of echinacea are available.
