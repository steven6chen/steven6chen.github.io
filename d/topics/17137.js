Worldwide, prostate cancer will account for over 1,600,000 cases and 366,000 deaths annually [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-role-of-magnetic-resonance-imaging-in-prostate-cancer/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p>Although widespread use of serum prostate-specific antigen (PSA) screening of healthy men has resulted in decreases in cancer-related mortality, this benefit has been accompanied by increased detection and treatment of many cancers bearing low metastatic potential [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-role-of-magnetic-resonance-imaging-in-prostate-cancer/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=screening-for-prostate-cancer#H2\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Screening for prostate cancer&quot;, section on 'Prostate-specific antigen (PSA)'</a>.)</p><p>A priority in the management of the disease is the ability to accurately assess the presence of clinically significant lesions, the extent of disease at diagnosis, and to characterize the risk of future progression, thereby avoiding unnecessary treatment in men at low risk of progression.</p><p>Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) offers increasingly reliable visualization of potentially significant prostate cancers and thus has shown advantages as a means by which to better select patients for biopsy and identify lesions for biopsy. MRI also provides information for staging the tumor extent and monitoring treatment response.</p><p>The technology of prostate MRI, the new prostate imaging reporting and data system (PI-RADS), and its current and potential clinical applications are reviewed in this topic.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2432818359\"><span class=\"h1\">TECHNOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Key advances that have contributed to the increased clinical utility of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the prostate include the use of magnets with high field strength, the use of an endorectal coil, and the development of a novel set of imaging sequences that can be used in combination (so-called multiparametric MRI) to improve both lesion identification and characterization.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2432818415\"><span class=\"h2\">Magnet strength</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>MRI of the prostate was introduced in 1982 using a 0.08 Tesla (T) magnet [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-role-of-magnetic-resonance-imaging-in-prostate-cancer/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. Since then, MRI hardware and software have advanced considerably with the introduction and widespread adoption of higher-strength magnets (1.5-3.0T). Increased field strength improves both imaging resolution (due to increased signal-to-noise ratio) and the speed of imaging.</p><p>Most radiologists consider a field strength &ge;1.5T essential for prostate imaging, and most major academic and high-volume centers use and recommend 3T as the optimal platform. The typical examination time, including patient preparation and placement of an intravenous line for contrast administration, is 40 to 50 minutes.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2432818814\"><span class=\"h2\">Endorectal coil</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The endorectal coil was introduced for prostate MRI in 1989 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-role-of-magnetic-resonance-imaging-in-prostate-cancer/abstract/5,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,6</a>]. Although initial studies suggested that this technique offers improved spatial resolution and reduces local motion of the prostate during imaging, the frequency of its use has diminished with advances in MRI hardware and software technology.</p><p>The endorectal coil is a disposable receiver coil mounted on a flexible plastic shaft surrounded by an inflatable latex balloon. After a digital rectal exam with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lidocaine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">lidocaine</a> gel, the endorectal coil is inserted while the patient is in the left lateral decubitus position. The balloon is then inflated, most commonly with air, although <a href=\"topic.htm?path=barium-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">barium</a> or a perfluorocarbon or perfluoropolyether liquid is used in some institutions. Inflation allows the coil to be closely located behind the posterior prostate. To suppress peristalsis, patients are administered 1 mg intramuscular <a href=\"topic.htm?path=glucagon-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">glucagon</a> just after placement of the endorectal coil.</p><p>Whether an endorectal coil is always useful is not certain. Satisfactory results have been obtained with both 1.5T and 3T magnets without the use of an endorectal coil. Taking these factors into consideration as well as the variability of MRI equipment available in clinical use, the prostate imaging reporting and data system (PI&#8208;RADS) Steering Committee recommends that supervising radiologists strive to optimize imaging protocols in order to obtain the best and most consistent image quality possible with the MRI scanner used [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-role-of-magnetic-resonance-imaging-in-prostate-cancer/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. Cost, availability, patient preference, and other considerations need to be considered.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2432818787\"><span class=\"h2\">Multiparametric imaging</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There are three individual imaging sequences that should be obtained during a prostate MR examination. These include diffusion weighted imaging (DWI) with apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC), T2-weighted (T2W) imaging, and dynamic intravenous contrast-enhanced (DCE) imaging [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-role-of-magnetic-resonance-imaging-in-prostate-cancer/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].</p><p>In brief, each sequence allows noninvasive assessment of three forms of tissue:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Diffusion weighted imaging &ndash; DWI measures the mobility of water molecules due to Brownian motion. The apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) is a quantitative measure reflecting this motion. In general, prostate cancer has increased cell density, which is imaged as an area with focally restricted free water diffusion. This is best detected by using high-b-value DWI with resulting ADC maps. The restricted area can be detected as a focal high signal (white) on DWI combined with focal low signal (black) lesion on the corresponding ADC image.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">The &quot;b-value&quot; is a reflection of the strength and timing of the gradients used to obtain the images. The operator, when prescribing the sequence parameters, selects this. For optimal prostate DWI MR, the MR systems must be capable of obtaining high-b-value diffusion sequences to allow for stronger diffusion and rapid scan times to allow dynamic intravenous contrast-enhanced sequence acquisition. Most magnets in clinical practice have this capability.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">The radiologist can then measure the ADC value for a particular region of interest. The discovery and verification of the relationship of the ADC value with the Gleason pattern has been a major advance in the development of prostate multiparametric MRI. The ADC value is inversely related to the Gleason grade of the tumor; thus, the lower the ADC, the higher the Gleason grade [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-role-of-magnetic-resonance-imaging-in-prostate-cancer/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. If a focal lesion is found in the gland to have restricted diffusion with an ADC value at 800 or less, it is very likely that this lesion is clinically significant, which is defined here as containing a component of Gleason pattern 4 disease. DWI images are the primary ones for assessment of the peripheral zone and are of course also used in the transition zone along with T2W.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Prostate T2W imaging, which reflects local tissue water, can delineate the normal prostate zonal anatomy, clearly showing the transition and peripheral zones. The peripheral zone is depicted as a region of high signal (white) on T2W images and the transition zone, a mix of both high and low signal areas reflecting the typical patterns of benign prostate hyperplasia. T2W imaging detects cancer as focal regions of moderately low signal intensity. T2W images are the primary ones for assessment of the transition zone.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Dynamic contrast-enhanced (DCE) images are those obtained after the rapid intravenous injection of contrast (gadolinium-DTPA) and subsequent rapid imaging. These images depict the local vascular environment and are useful to assess vascularity in specific regions of the prostate. Focal prostate cancer typically has areas of abnormal neovascularity that can be depicted by analysis of changes such as early arterial enhancement, wash-in, and wash-out.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Magnetic resonance spectroscopy imaging (MRSI) has been used in prostate imaging and can offer an assessment of metabolic characteristics of intraprostatic foci. MRSI is not included in the prostate imaging reporting and data system (PI-RADS) version 2 for focal prostate cancer characterization. It can be used to detect cancer recurrence after treatment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-role-of-magnetic-resonance-imaging-in-prostate-cancer/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. However, MRSI is not used routinely.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H92386142\"><span class=\"h2\">Prostate imaging reporting and data system (PI-RADS)</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Prostate MRI is now available in all major centers. In response to this, the International Prostate MRI Working Group developed and introduced PI-RADS to increase the quality and diagnostic value of prostate MRI [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-role-of-magnetic-resonance-imaging-in-prostate-cancer/abstract/10,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,11</a>].

The system includes recommendations for technical and operating specifications, as well as standardized terminology for reporting and a sector map for all locations within the gland.</p><p>PI-RADS enables the reader to summarize the level of suspicion that a nodule represents prostate cancer using a five-point scale. For detection of cancer with Gleason score &ge;7, multiparametric prostate MRI evaluated according to PI-RADS version 2 demonstrates a sensitivity of 0.85 (95% CI 0.78-0.91) and a specificity of 0.71 (95% CI 0.60-0.80) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-role-of-magnetic-resonance-imaging-in-prostate-cancer/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2432818366\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL APPLICATIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Prostate magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was initially applied as a tool for staging men with known prostate cancer prior to radical prostatectomy or radiation therapy. In this setting, prostate MRI provides information on the presence or absence of extra-glandular disease, or involvement of the neurovascular bundles and seminal vesicles, and thus helps differentiate stage <span class=\"nowrap\">T1/2</span> disease from T3 disease (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F110728\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef110728 \">table 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-role-of-magnetic-resonance-imaging-in-prostate-cancer/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>].</p><p>Subsequent investigations have established several new roles for prostate MRI. The role gaining the most attention is that of guiding targeted prostate biopsies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-role-of-magnetic-resonance-imaging-in-prostate-cancer/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. In men with an elevated serum prostate-specific antigen (PSA) and a prior negative transrectal ultrasound (TRUS) biopsy, MR-targeted biopsies have been shown to result in a reduction in the number of unnecessary biopsies, a higher yield of significant cancers, and fewer biopsy cores. MR-guided biopsies include transperineal approaches, which have the advantage of avoiding the rectal wall and of reduced rates of postbiopsy infections [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-role-of-magnetic-resonance-imaging-in-prostate-cancer/abstract/16,17\" class=\"abstract_t\">16,17</a>].</p><p>Prostate MRI also has gained utilization in several additional settings. These include selective evaluation in men with an elevated PSA prior to prostate biopsy, men in whom the diagnosis has already been established for tumor localization and staging, monitoring during active surveillance, or planning salvage radiation in cases of treatment failure.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14499361\"><span class=\"h2\">Elevated serum PSA with a prior negative TRUS biopsy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>For men with persistently elevated PSA levels despite negative systematic prostate biopsy, MRI is a valuable tool to detect occult prostate cancers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-role-of-magnetic-resonance-imaging-in-prostate-cancer/abstract/18,19\" class=\"abstract_t\">18,19</a>]. Multiparametric MRI provides biopsy target information and can guide targeted prostate biopsy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-role-of-magnetic-resonance-imaging-in-prostate-cancer/abstract/16,20\" class=\"abstract_t\">16,20</a>]. In this setting, prostate MRI-directed biopsy has led to the detection of clinically significant cancers in as many as 34 to 41 percent of men with persistent clinical suspicion and prior negative biopsy, a majority of which were high-grade (&ge;Gleason 7) following prostate MRI to direct biopsy.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H92386340\"><span class=\"h2\">Initial presentation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Prostate MRI also has a variety of roles in patients at their initial presentation or during their initial treatment planning.</p><p>Prostate MRI was initially applied, in the late 1980s, as a tool for staging men with known prostate cancer, usually prior to radical prostatectomy and radiation therapy. In this setting, prostate MRI is used to provide information on the presence or absence of extraglandular disease, or involvement of the neurovascular bundles [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-role-of-magnetic-resonance-imaging-in-prostate-cancer/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>] and seminal vesicles, and thus help differentiate stage <span class=\"nowrap\">T1/2</span> disease from T3 disease (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F110728\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef110728 \">table 1</a>).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H99676965\"><span class=\"h3\">Elevated PSA</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The decision to proceed to prostate biopsy in the setting of an elevated PSA is not automatic; rather, it represents a shared decision that incorporates the patient's health status, perceived likelihood for harboring significant disease, and personal wishes. Prostate MRI is increasingly regarded as an adjunctive tool in refining risk status for clinically meaningful disease.</p><p>Prospective studies of pre-biopsy MRI in men with elevated PSA or clinical suspicion of prostate cancer have shown a potential benefit in the refinement of the detection algorithm by selectively offering biopsy to men with higher likelihood of harboring significant disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-role-of-magnetic-resonance-imaging-in-prostate-cancer/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. For example, in a study of 175 men with clinical suspicion of prostate cancer undergoing multiparametric MRI <strong>prior</strong><em> </em>to biopsy, MRI outperformed clinical risk prediction aids (eg, the Prostate Cancer Prevention Trial risk calculator) for the determination of high-grade disease, with area under receiver operating characteristic curves of 0.77 versus 0.67, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-role-of-magnetic-resonance-imaging-in-prostate-cancer/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. A randomized clinical trial of multiparametric MRI combined with targeted biopsy versus TRUS-guided random biopsy showed that multiparametric MRI for the diagnosis of prostate cancer was 97 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-role-of-magnetic-resonance-imaging-in-prostate-cancer/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. In another study, targeted biopsy diagnosed 30 percent (173 versus 122 cases) more high-risk prostate cancers than standard TRUS and 17 percent less low-risk cancers (213 versus 258 cases) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-role-of-magnetic-resonance-imaging-in-prostate-cancer/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>].</p><p>However, a small proportion of men without prostate abnormalities detected by MRI will have prostate cancer on systematic biopsy, although a majority of these tumors are low-grade (predominately Gleason pattern 3). The trial comparing multiparametric MRI combined with targeted biopsy versus standard TRUS biopsy alone found that all of the tumors missed by MRI had Gleason 6 lesions on subsequent saturation biopsy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-role-of-magnetic-resonance-imaging-in-prostate-cancer/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. Due to the limited capacity for aggressive biologic behavior associated with histologically low-grade tumors, the clinical significance of missing such a diagnosis is uncertain [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-role-of-magnetic-resonance-imaging-in-prostate-cancer/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>].</p><p>The ability of multiparametric MRI to rule out clinically-significant prostate cancer prior to initial biopsy was evaluated in the PROMIS study, a prospective, multicentered United Kingdom trial conducted between 2012 and 2015 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-role-of-magnetic-resonance-imaging-in-prostate-cancer/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. The trial evaluated 576 biopsy-na&iuml;ve patients referred for prostate biopsy based on clinical suspicion for prostate cancer due to elevated PSA, abnormal digital rectal examination, or family history. All patients underwent 1.5 Tesla multiparametric MRI followed by concurrent standard TRUS biopsy and transperineal template mapping biopsy sampling the entire prostate at 5 mm intervals, which served as a reference standard.</p><p>The negative predictive values of multiparametric MRI for the detection of significant cancer (defined as Gleason &ge;4+3 or cancer length &ge;6 mm) were 89 and 76 percent for the detection of Gleason &ge;3+4 tumors of any volume. By this approach, a strategy of foregoing biopsy among patients with low-suspicion MRIs (scores equivalent to prostate imaging reporting and data system [PI-RADS] 1 and 2) might avoid a primary biopsy in 27 percent of men and diagnosis of 5 percent fewer clinically insignificant cancers. It is important to note that, due to the era of the study's conception, MRI studies were performed on a lower field strength magnet than is used in many centers today, and it employed a five-level Likert reporting system rather than the PI-RADS rubric.</p><p>Some authors have proposed that men with negative or normal multiparametric prostate MRI studies may forego biopsy. However, the validity of this approach has not been evaluated and it is not currently recognized by the American Urological Association or the National Comprehensive Cancer Network clinical guidelines for routine practice [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-role-of-magnetic-resonance-imaging-in-prostate-cancer/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. The economic implications of widespread policies of prostate MRI for all patients with clinical suspicion for prostate cancer remain unclear, although several studies appear to demonstrate cost-effectiveness despite the initial expense of MRI, which is offset by the avoidance of unnecessary biopsies, a decreased detection of clinically insignificant tumors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-role-of-magnetic-resonance-imaging-in-prostate-cancer/abstract/27,28\" class=\"abstract_t\">27,28</a>], and refined management strategies in the low-risk setting, including active surveillance.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H99676988\"><span class=\"h3\">Lesion localization</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In men with clinical suspicion for prostate cancer, multiparametric MRI identifies tumors with greater accuracy than systematic TRUS guided techniques. Moreover, MRI appears to offer improved accuracy for the detection of high-grade (Gleason &ge;3+4) tumors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-role-of-magnetic-resonance-imaging-in-prostate-cancer/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>].</p><p>The potential role of multiparametric MRI was illustrated by the PRECISION trial, which included 500 men with a clinical suspicion of prostate cancer (elevated serum PSA, abnormal digital rectal examination, or both) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-role-of-magnetic-resonance-imaging-in-prostate-cancer/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. Study participants were randomly assigned to either standard TRUS-guided 10- to 12-core biopsy or to multiparametric MRI. If the MRI detected areas that were equivocal or suggestive (PI-RADS version 2 score &ge;3) of clinically significant prostate cancer (Gleason score 3+4 or greater), patients underwent an MR-targeted biopsy (to a maximum of three sites and a maximum of four cores per site). Patients without suspicious areas apparent on MRI did not undergo biopsy. (See <a href=\"#H92386142\" class=\"local\">'Prostate imaging reporting and data system (PI-RADS)'</a> above.)</p><p>The primary outcome of the trial was the detection of clinically significant prostate cancer. Multiparametric MRI and MR-targeted biopsy detected Gleason score 3+4 or greater disease in 38 percent of men, compared with 26 percent in those who were randomized to TRUS biopsies. The difference in detection rate (12 percent) satisfied the predetermined threshold for noninferiority of MRI with or without a biopsy in this trial. Moreover, the 95 percent confidence interval showed superiority of MRI with or without targeted biopsy over TRUS. In addition, 28 percent of those undergoing MRI with PI-RADS version 2 scores &le;2 were not subjected to a protocol biopsy.</p><p>MRI has clinical value in identifying occult tumors in anatomic regions of the prostate that are not conventionally sampled during systematic sextant biopsy, such as the detection of tumors within the anterior zone, which may be inadequately sampled on systematic biopsies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-role-of-magnetic-resonance-imaging-in-prostate-cancer/abstract/31,32\" class=\"abstract_t\">31,32</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H99677624\"><span class=\"h3\">Targeted prostate biopsy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Directed biopsy targeting prostatic MR lesions has been shown to increase the yield and detection rate of high-grade prostate cancer.</p><p>Targeted biopsies have been performed by several techniques:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Fusion biopsy, where previously obtained MR images are overlaid with real-time transrectal sonography allowing three-dimensional tracking in space with high spatial accuracy.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Cognitive fusion biopsy, wherein the region of a particular lesion is identified and directed during TRUS.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In-bore biopsy, in which biopsy sites are localized and targeted in real-time while a patient is undergoing MR examination [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-role-of-magnetic-resonance-imaging-in-prostate-cancer/abstract/20,33\" class=\"abstract_t\">20,33</a>].</p><p/><p>All these approaches have demonstrated favorable tumor detection rates, and they are all associated with technical challenges, require some training, and may require a greater time commitment during early adoption.</p><p>Several prospective studies have compared fusion MR-ultrasound biopsy with standard systematic approaches [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-role-of-magnetic-resonance-imaging-in-prostate-cancer/abstract/23,34\" class=\"abstract_t\">23,34</a>]. In a study of 1003 men with clinical suspicion of prostate cancer, MR-ultrasound fusion biopsy detected 30 percent more high-risk (Gleason &ge;4+3) cancers and 17 percent less low-risk cancers compared with systematic biopsy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-role-of-magnetic-resonance-imaging-in-prostate-cancer/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>].

Typically if not already performed, a biopsy is recommended for all PI-RADS 3, 4, and 5 lesions. In the PRECISION trial, the detection rates for clinically significant prostate cancer for PI-RADS 3, 4, and 5 lesions were 12, 60, and 63 percent, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-role-of-magnetic-resonance-imaging-in-prostate-cancer/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. If the patient has a prior biopsy with only Gleason pattern 3 and the MRI findings indicate a PI-RADS 3, 4, or 5 lesion, the current approach is that a targeted biopsy should be performed of that specific lesion.</p><p>Lesion characterization may also be of value in men with low-risk disease who are being managed with active surveillance.

However, a systematic review concluded that MRI can be used to detect clinically significant prostate cancer in men on active surveillance [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-role-of-magnetic-resonance-imaging-in-prostate-cancer/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>], although there are no published data to support the use of MRI in place of repeat standard biopsy to detect progression over time. Patients receiving management with active surveillance are increasingly undergoing multiparametric MRI in the early phases of their diagnosis, either as an initial diagnostic modality or to confirm the grade and extent of disease. </p><p>For example, in a study of 207 men with previously diagnosed, favorable-risk prostate cancer undergoing first-time MRI-ultrasound fusion biopsy during active surveillance, 14 percent experienced pathological upgrading in MR-fusion biopsy cores alone that was not detected by systematic sampling [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-role-of-magnetic-resonance-imaging-in-prostate-cancer/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>].

In the absence of clinical suspicion for disease recurrence, however, MRI is not indicated to assess treatment response. MRI is helpful in men post-prostatectomy with biochemical failures, allowing for detection of recurrent or residual disease in the resection bed. This information defines the local tumor recurrence and allows for careful planning and delivery of salvage radiation or focal image-guided ablative salvage therapy such as cryotherapy. Multiparametric MRI may also be helpful in differentiating between residual local disease and distant metastatic spread.
