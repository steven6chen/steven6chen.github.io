The mechanisms of the neutropenia are varied and the propensity to infection depends upon the adequacy of bone marrow reserve.</p><p>Drug-induced neutropenia and agranulocytosis will be reviewed here.

The diagnosis may be suspected from the history and is established by bone marrow examination and, when relevant, other tests.

This may be a very important distinction to make, particularly if the medication is critical to the patient&rsquo;s care. As certain viral infections can be associated with neutropenia, it would be problematic to permanently discontinue use of an important drug on the mistaken assumption that it is the cause of the neutropenia. Bone marrow examination can be particularly helpful in this case. If the marrow cellularity is normal with a late myeloid arrest, the danger from neutropenia is likely much less, and re-challenge or even continuation with careful monitoring may be possible.
