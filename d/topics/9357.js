As such, it has become an increasingly popular method of contraception. Despite the overall excellent safety profile, side effects and complications can occur at the time of insertion and at different time points following insertion.</p><p>This topic will address diagnosis and management of side effects and complications related to intrauterine contraception in a temporal fashion broken down by typical onset of presentation in relation to timing from intrauterine device (IUD) insertion. Issues related to intrauterine contraception types, patient candidates and device selection, as well as the non-complicated insertion and removal procedure, are reviewed separately.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=intrauterine-contraception-candidates-and-device-selection\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Intrauterine contraception: Candidates and device selection&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=intrauterine-contraception-insertion-and-removal\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Intrauterine contraception: Insertion and removal&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1804189442\"><span class=\"h1\">IUD NOMENCLATURE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Alternate terms for intrauterine contraception include the intrauterine device (IUD), intrauterine contraceptive (IUC), or intrauterine system (IUS, used in reference to the progestin-containing devices). In this topic, we use the term IUD for all types of intrauterine contraception. As of 2017, five types of IUDs are available in the United States (US); one contains copper and four release the progestin <a href=\"topic.htm?path=levonorgestrel-systemic-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">levonorgestrel</a> (LNg). A discussion of the various IUD types and selection is presented elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=intrauterine-contraception-background-and-device-types\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Intrauterine contraception: Background and device types&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=intrauterine-contraception-candidates-and-device-selection\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Intrauterine contraception: Candidates and device selection&quot;</a>.)</p><p>For this topic, we will use the following abbreviations:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>TCu380A (US commercial name Paragard)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>LNg <span class=\"nowrap\">52/5</span> (US commercial name Mirena)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>LNg <span class=\"nowrap\">52/3</span> (US commercial name Liletta)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>LNg 19.<span class=\"nowrap\">5/5</span> (US commercial name Kyleena)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>LNg 13.<span class=\"nowrap\">5/3</span> (US commercial name Skyla)</p><p/><p>Other IUDs studied in international research are described where relevant below using IUD shape and dose.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H750402231\"><span class=\"h1\">PREVALENCE OF COMPLICATIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Serious complications are rare and include expulsion (3 to 6 percent in the first year), pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) (1 percent in first 20 days, and 0.5 percent in first 3 to 6 months), contraceptive failure (0.2 to 0.8 percent in first year) with increased risk of ectopic pregnancy if failure does occur, and perforation (0.01 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intrauterine-contraception-management-of-side-effects-and-complications/abstract/1-8\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-8</a>]. Malposition is a less serious side effect and occurs in up to 10 percent of women. The common side effects of pain and irregular bleeding are the most frequently cited reasons for IUD removal within the first 6 months (28 to 35 percent and 10 to 19 percent, respectively) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intrauterine-contraception-management-of-side-effects-and-complications/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. Thus, recognition and management of less serious side effects is also important for improving patient satisfaction and continuation rates.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3463829605\"><span class=\"h1\">RISK FACTORS FOR COMPLICATIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Though IUDs can generally be safely used by most women, some populations may be at increased risk of complication. As eligibility criteria and sub-population patterns of IUD use change, recognition of risk factors for side effects and complications becomes increasingly important.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Young age</strong> &ndash; Young age, typically defined as age 25 years or less, has been associated with IUD failure (ie, pregnancy) and likely with IUD expulsion. Young age does not appear to increase risk of other IUD complications such as perforation or infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intrauterine-contraception-management-of-side-effects-and-complications/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span><strong>IUD failure</strong> &ndash; Young age has been associated with a higher rate of IUD failure, presumably secondary to increased fertility. In a retrospective claim-based study including over 90,000 women who received either a copper or levonorgestrel-releasing IUD, women age 15 to 19 years were nearly 30 percent more likely to have an IUD failure compared with women age 20 to 24 years and 40 percent more likely to experience IUD failure compared with women age 25 to 44 years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intrauterine-contraception-management-of-side-effects-and-complications/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span><strong>IUD expulsion</strong> &ndash; Although there is conflicting evidence, the majority of studies report that an age of 25 years or less is associated with increased risk of IUD expulsion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intrauterine-contraception-management-of-side-effects-and-complications/abstract/12-14\" class=\"abstract_t\">12-14</a>]. In a systemic review evaluating IUD expulsion among women age 25 years or younger compared with older IUD users, six studies suggested increased risk of expulsion with decreased age for the copper IUD. Results regarding expulsion risk with LNg IUD were mixed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intrauterine-contraception-management-of-side-effects-and-complications/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. The risk of IUD expulsion may be particularly increased for very young women. In a planned secondary analysis of a prospective cohort study of over 5400 women who were provided with the IUD (copper or levonorgestrel-releasing) of choice at no cost, women age 14 to 19 years had more than twice the risk of IUD expulsion compared with women age 20 years and older, regardless of parity and IUD type, at up to 36 months of follow-up [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intrauterine-contraception-management-of-side-effects-and-complications/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. For comparison, during the first year after IUD insertion in non-postpartum women of all ages, expulsion occurs following 3 to 10 percent of copper IUD insertions and 3 to 6 percent of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=levonorgestrel-systemic-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">levonorgestrel</a> IUD insertions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intrauterine-contraception-management-of-side-effects-and-complications/abstract/2,3,16-19\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,3,16-19</a>]. Of note, nulliparity, which is more common in women of younger age, does not appear to increase the risk of IUD expulsion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intrauterine-contraception-management-of-side-effects-and-complications/abstract/2,3\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,3</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Postpartum or postabortion</strong> &ndash; Risk of IUD expulsion is increased with both immediately and delayed postpartum IUD insertion and following second-trimester abortion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intrauterine-contraception-management-of-side-effects-and-complications/abstract/20,21\" class=\"abstract_t\">20,21</a>]. There is no increased risk of expulsion with insertion after first-trimester abortion compared to interval insertion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intrauterine-contraception-management-of-side-effects-and-complications/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. The use of IUDs for postpartum and postabortion contraception is reviewed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=postpartum-contraception-initiation-and-methods\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Postpartum contraception: Initiation and methods&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=postabortion-contraception\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Postabortion contraception&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Breastfeeding</strong> &ndash; While older, smaller studies failed to recognize any association between breastfeeding status at time of IUD insertion and perforation risk [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intrauterine-contraception-management-of-side-effects-and-complications/abstract/23-25\" class=\"abstract_t\">23-25</a>], larger, more recent studies suggest a significantly increased risk of IUD perforation associated with breast feeding [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intrauterine-contraception-management-of-side-effects-and-complications/abstract/8,26,27\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,26,27</a>]. A large European prospective cohort study of over 61,000 women undergoing IUD insertion found that breastfeeding status at time of IUD insertion was associated with a six fold increase (RR 6.1, 95% CI 3.9-9.6) risk in perforation among breastfeeding vs non-breastfeeding users with no difference between LNg and copper IUDs. The overall risk, however, remained small at approximately 1 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intrauterine-contraception-management-of-side-effects-and-complications/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. A recent systemic review found that other complications related to IUD insertion including expulsion, pain, and removal requests were similar or lower for breast feeding IUD users vs. non-breastfeeding users [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intrauterine-contraception-management-of-side-effects-and-complications/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=postpartum-contraception-initiation-and-methods#H640923987\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Postpartum contraception: Initiation and methods&quot;, section on 'Intrauterine contraception'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Distorted uterine cavity</strong> &ndash; Anatomic abnormalities, including M&uuml;llerian anomalies or large intra-cavitary leiomyomas that severely distort the uterine cavity, are generally accepted relative contraindications to IUD use [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intrauterine-contraception-management-of-side-effects-and-complications/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Uterine anomalies &ndash; Though there is biologic plausibility to suggest that conditions associated with uterine cavity distortion could be associated with increased risk of complications, there is limited data to support or challenge this hypothesis. There are case reports of successful IUD use in women with M&uuml;llerian anomalies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intrauterine-contraception-management-of-side-effects-and-complications/abstract/29,30\" class=\"abstract_t\">29,30</a>]. However, based on the limited evidence available we do not routinely advise IUD use in this population, though we recognize that it could be considered in special circumstances with appropriate counseling. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-congenital-anomalies-of-the-uterus#H26\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of congenital anomalies of the uterus&quot;, section on 'Diagnosis'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Uterine leiomyoma &ndash; Given the potential contraceptive and non-contraceptive benefits of IUD use (particularly hormonal IUDs) in women with leiomyomas and available safety profile data, we support IUD use in this population, which is consistent with the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention statement that the &quot;advantages generally outweigh theoretical or proven risks&quot; [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intrauterine-contraception-management-of-side-effects-and-complications/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. That said, we also discuss with women that the available data suggest a possible increased risk of IUD expulsion in women with leiomyoma. Two cohort studies included in a systemic review of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=levonorgestrel-systemic-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">levonorgestrel</a> IUD use among women with leiomyomas reported higher rates of IUD expulsion among women with leiomyomas (11 percent each) than among women without leiomyomas (0 and 3 percent), though the difference was not statistically significant in one study, and the other study did not test for significance [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intrauterine-contraception-management-of-side-effects-and-complications/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]. The remaining six prospective non-comparative studies included in this review reported expulsion rates ranging from 0 to 20 percent. These studies, however, did not specify fibroid location or cavitary impact. There are limited data about other potential complications in this population. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-congenital-anomalies-of-the-uterus#H26\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of congenital anomalies of the uterus&quot;, section on 'Diagnosis'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=uterine-leiomyomas-fibroids-epidemiology-clinical-features-diagnosis-and-natural-history#H11\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Uterine leiomyomas (fibroids): Epidemiology, clinical features, diagnosis, and natural history&quot;, section on 'Diagnostic evaluation'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Factors that do not increase risk</strong> &ndash; Although it has been hypothesized that uterine position or size may increase the risk of IUD complication, there are no scientific data to support this claim. In a large international IUD data set of over 5500 women, retroverted uterine position was not associated with higher rates of failure or expulsion as compared with anteverted or mid-positioned uteri [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intrauterine-contraception-management-of-side-effects-and-complications/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>]. Similarly, in a case-control study of 71 pregnant women with IUDs in-situ compared with 284 matched controls, uterine position was not associated with an increased risk of IUD failure resulting in pregnancy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intrauterine-contraception-management-of-side-effects-and-complications/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>]. Similarly, uterine cavity length does not appear to be a risk factor for IUD failure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intrauterine-contraception-management-of-side-effects-and-complications/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>] or expulsion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intrauterine-contraception-management-of-side-effects-and-complications/abstract/34,35\" class=\"abstract_t\">34,35</a>]. Nulliparity does not affect the success rate for IUD placement [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intrauterine-contraception-management-of-side-effects-and-complications/abstract/2,3\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,3</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1139231610\"><span class=\"h1\">TIME OF INSERTION</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1842813373\"><span class=\"h2\">Insertional difficulties</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Prevention</strong> &ndash; In order to minimize risk of perforation or misplacement and to maximize provider control over the movement and angles of the cervix and uterus, a tenaculum should always be used and an adequate amount of tissue should be grasped to limit the chance of the tenaculum tearing the cervix. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=intrauterine-contraception-insertion-and-removal#H2\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Intrauterine contraception: Insertion and removal&quot;, section on 'Preprocedure'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Difficult insertion</strong> &ndash; Insertional difficulties can include challenges with identifying the cervical os (eg, women after loop electrosurgical excision procedure [LEEP] or cone biopsy) or with passing the sound through the cervix and internal os (eg, cervical stenosis, tortuous path of canal). Potential solutions include use of an os finder, cervical dilators, and ultrasound guidance. We find ultrasound-guided insertion particularly helpful for women who have had a previous difficult insertion, malposition, or expulsion; those who are obese such that pre-insertion uterine positioning cannot be determined; or those with known or suspected distortion of the uterine cavity. These issues are addressed in detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=intrauterine-contraception-insertion-and-removal#H77827807\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Intrauterine contraception: Insertion and removal&quot;, section on 'Difficult insertion'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Vasovagal reaction</strong> &ndash; Vasovagal reactions can occur after IUD insertion and are characterized by presyncope, syncope, nausea, bradycardia, and hypotension. Most reactions are transient and resolve spontaneously. Trendelenburg position, a cool pack or cloth on the head neck or chest, and an alcohol pad under the nose for distraction and to treat nausea can all be of benefit. In rare circumstances, the vasovagal reaction may be severe enough to require an ammonia inhalant (0.3 mL) as a respiratory stimulant, or intravenous (IV) support with fluids <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> <a href=\"topic.htm?path=atropine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">atropine</a> (0.4 to 0.6 mL IV) in order to improve symptoms and vital signs. If the symptoms do not resolve, a paracervical block may be placed or the IUD can be removed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intrauterine-contraception-management-of-side-effects-and-complications/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>]. One-on-one continuous monitoring should be performed in these circumstances. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=reflex-syncope-in-adults-and-adolescents-clinical-presentation-and-diagnostic-evaluation\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Reflex syncope in adults and adolescents: Clinical presentation and diagnostic evaluation&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=reflex-syncope-in-adults-treatment\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Reflex syncope in adults: Treatment&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3093874330\"><span class=\"h2\">Unexpected findings at time of placement</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Large or small uterine cavity</strong> &ndash; Extremes of uterine cavity size, generally agreed upon as size &lt;6 cm or &gt;9 cm, may create problems for IUD function and retention. The mechanism of action for the CuT380A IUD is largely dependent upon approximation of the device with the uterine wall, and, thus, there is concern for decreased efficacy if this device is placed in a cavity that measures beyond 9 cm. The progestin-containing IUDs have more leeway in their positioning against the entire uterine cavity since the primary mechanism of action for these devices is to thicken cervical mucous and to cause a sterile foreign body reaction that makes the uterine cavity inhospitable to proper sperm function. Therefore, we advise women whose uterine cavity sounds to &gt;9 cm that the copper IUD may be less effective, though the increased relative risk of pregnancy is not known, and she may want to consider an LNg IUD or subdermal contraceptive implant instead.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">If the uterine cavity appears to measure less than 6 cm when assessed with a sound, it is possible that the sound has not traversed the internal os or across the entire length of the uterine cavity. Ultrasound assessment of the uterine cavity with the sound in place can help distinguish between a small cavity and a sound that is stuck at the level of the internal cervical os. Women with a small uterine cavity diameter appear to have higher risk for IUD misplacement or migration that leads to an embedded device [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intrauterine-contraception-management-of-side-effects-and-complications/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>]. These patients are still IUD candidates. If a cavity sounds to 5 to 6 cm and the provider truly believes they are through the internal os and at the fundus, we recommend a smaller-framed IUD, such as the LNg 19.5 or LNg 13.5 devices. If the provider is unsure that they were at the uterine fundus when they measured a small uterine cavity, three-dimensional ultrasound evaluation should be performed to measure the uterine cavity to help with IUD candidacy determination and IUD size considerations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intrauterine-contraception-management-of-side-effects-and-complications/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Infection</strong> &ndash; If a pelvic infection is suspected (eg, findings of cervicitis, mucopurulent discharge, cervical motion tenderness, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> fundal tenderness on examination) at the time of IUD insertion, IUD insertion should be delayed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intrauterine-contraception-management-of-side-effects-and-complications/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>]. Testing for sexually transmitted infections is performed in at-risk women. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=screening-for-sexually-transmitted-infections\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Screening for sexually transmitted infections&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Women diagnosed with asymptomatic gonorrhea or chlamydia cervicitis on screening at the time of IUD insertion should be treated per standard guidelines (eg, <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/std/tg2015/&amp;token=R4Uiw8/bmPVaqNHRDqpXLKy1Ja7NNbTQNlMM7q+2yK72w7Xz7fXsuhto3l2rUf92&amp;TOPIC_ID=5422\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">2015 CDC Sexually Transmitted Diseases Treatment Guidelines</a>). The IUD does <strong>not</strong> need to be removed while the infection is treated [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intrauterine-contraception-management-of-side-effects-and-complications/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>]. While there are no large studies to help guide practice, if bacterial vaginosis, trichomonosis, or vaginal candidosis are diagnosed at the time of IUD insertion, the IUD can be inserted and treatment of the infection is started at the same time.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Incomplete insertion or partial expulsion</strong> &ndash; Occasionally, partial IUD extraction or downward misplacement (ie, the IUD stem is visible extruding from the cervix) is noticed immediately upon removal of the IUD applicator. Alternately, the clinician can accidently pull the IUD partially out of the uterus when attempting to trim the IUD strings with the scissors. If downward misplacement or partial expulsion is recognized immediately at time of placement, CuT380 devices may be removed, reloaded into the applicator, and reinserted with a second attempt. However, the LNg IUDs typically cannot be reloaded into the applicator. If the IUD cannot be reloaded, then a new IUD may be needed. We do not advise using other instruments, such as a forceps or clamp, to manually push the extruding LNg IUD into the uterus, as such action could increase the risk of uterine perforation or damage or break the IUD.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1277060819\"><span class=\"h2\">Perforation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Uterine perforation occurs when an instrument passes through the wall of the uterus and can result in visceral injury, hemorrhage, and infection. While the major risk factor for perforation is having an intrauterine gynecologic procedure such as IUD insertion, additional risk factors include clinician inexperience, stenotic cervix, and immobile or retroverted uterus. The type of IUD does not appear to impact perforation risk [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intrauterine-contraception-management-of-side-effects-and-complications/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. Breastfeeding may independently increase the risk for perforation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intrauterine-contraception-management-of-side-effects-and-complications/abstract/8,26,27,39-41\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,26,27,39-41</a>]. The incidence of perforation is reported in <span class=\"nowrap\">1/1000,</span> most of which likely happen at time of insertion rather than delayed migration of the device causing perforation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intrauterine-contraception-management-of-side-effects-and-complications/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].

Of note, hemodynamic instability is rare after a uterine perforation.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Women in whom uterine perforation by the sound or IUD is suspected and are hemodynamically stable, but the IUD has not been deployed, are further monitored for signs <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> symptoms of tachycardia, hypotension, syncope, or intraperitoneal bleeding. Women with normal vital signs and examination can be sent home after a period of prolonged monitoring. We typically monitor vitals and serial exams every 10 to 15 minutes for a total of three assessments. Women with unchanged examinations are sent home with teaching on worsening symptoms and symptoms that require emergent evaluation. We then follow up by phone within 48 hours. Women who become unstable are managed as in the above bullet.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Women in whom uterine perforation is suspected immediately following IUD deployment and who are hemodynamically stable can undergo attempted IUD removal by placing gentle traction on the string. If the IUD is not easily removed with gentle traction, operative laparoscopy should be utilized to either visually monitor and potentially correct uterine trauma while the IUD is pulled out from a vaginal approach or, to allow for abdominal localization, dissection, and removal of an IUD that is primarily in the peritoneal cavity or is involving structures, such as bowel or vessels, that may need repair. Intraoperative x-ray can be helpful to find a peritoneal IUD that is encased in adhesions or otherwise not easily visualized, especially as some peritoneal IUDs are encased in omentum that deviates cranially with intra-operative Trendelenburg positioning. Very rare cases necessitate laparotomy for peritoneal IUD localization, dissection, and removal. Given the low risk of infection and limited evidence to support the practice, we do not routinely give prophylactic antibiotics to women with suspected uterine perforation at time of IUD placement who do not have clinical signs of infection.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Women in whom uterine perforation is suspected after the IUD has been deployed but IUD deployment cannot be confirmed (eg, IUD strings are not visible in the cervical os after deployment or at routine follow-up visit), are monitored as above. If this occurs at the time of IUD insertion, the IUD applicator is examined to ensure the IUD was indeed deployed and the examination field, including vagina, are inspected to ensure that the IUD did not fall out prior to insertion. If the IUD is not found extra-corporally or it is suspected that intraperitoneal placement has occurred, ultrasound is performed without delay (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F57867\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef57867 \">image 1</a>).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent3\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#45;</span>If the ultrasound reveals a correctly positioned intrauterine IUD, then no further action is necessary.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent3\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#45;</span>If the IUD is not found in the uterus on initial ultrasound evaluation, a kidney, ureter, and bladder (KUB) radiograph should be performed. If the IUD is not seen on KUB, it can be assumed that the IUD was expelled. In this case, a pregnancy test and repeat contraceptive counseling are performed. If the KUB demonstrates an intraperitoneal IUD, surgical planning should be initiated for laparoscopic removal. While the surgical retrieval should be expeditious to prevent further injury, emergent removal is not required if the patient is stable. Given risk of infection and potential for long term sequela, empiric antibiotic therapy to cover pelvic inflammatory disease is administered as described in the above bullet. Laparotomy can be required if laparoscopic removal is not possible, if perforation of intra-abdominal organs is suspected, or if ongoing intraperitoneal hemorrhage is suspected.</p><p/><p>Patients who have a perforation with an initial insertion attempt can have a repeat IUD insertion attempted after several weeks with procedural adjuncts to avoid repeat perforation, such as ultrasound guidance. An alternate contraceptive should be used until the IUD is replaced. Given the relatively small size uterine defect associated with IUD perforation, IUD perforation is not a contraindication to labor or vaginal delivery.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3867155788\"><span class=\"h1\">IMMEDIATE POST-INSERTION: 0 TO 7 DAYS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>We educate patients that vaginal bleeding and cramping uterine pain are common side effects in the first week after IUD insertion. We also discuss warning sides for pelvic infection, although this complication is uncommon.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H68166671\"><span class=\"h2\">Post-insertion bleeding</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Minor trauma from IUD insertion, including tenaculum placement and abrasion of the cervix by the IUD, commonly result in post-procedural bleeding. Most women have at least some degree of spotting or bleeding immediately after IUD insertion, though data specific to initial bleeding patterns after IUD insertion are sparse. A study of 160 women who received the copper T-200 reported that 94 percent of women had bleeding immediately after IUD insertion, that mean duration of initial bleeding was 4.5&plusmn;2.4 days, and that women required a mean of 3.5&plusmn;2.5 pads per day [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intrauterine-contraception-management-of-side-effects-and-complications/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>].</p><p>Patient education and reassurance regarding normal bleeding are paramount. We counsel women that post-procedural bleeding should not be much heavier than a normal period, may be prolonged in timing, and can even blend directly into the prolonged or abnormal uterine bleeding that happens in the first three to six months of IUD use as the uterine lining synchronizes to the presence of the new LNg or copper IUD. Some experts treat women prophylactically with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) or the antifibrinolytic <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tranexamic-acid-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">tranexamic acid</a> to reduce the amount of bleeding associated with copper IUD insertion (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F113193\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef113193 \">table 1</a>). We generally do not use prophylactic medication as the abnormal bleeding typically resolves quickly and most women do well with advance education and supportive counseling (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F113217\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef113217 \">figure 1</a>). (See <a href=\"#H3093729610\" class=\"local\">'Irregular bleeding and/or cramping'</a> below.)</p><p>Women who report heavy bleeding, commonly described as soaking through a pad or more per hour, should be evaluated quickly, as this could be a sign of partial expulsion, uterine perforation, or cervical laceration.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3631961447\"><span class=\"h2\">Uterine cramping or pain</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Post-procedural cramping is very common after IUD insertion regardless of IUD type. The mild to moderate discomfort or pain that occurs with insertion lessens within minutes for almost all women [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intrauterine-contraception-management-of-side-effects-and-complications/abstract/43-46\" class=\"abstract_t\">43-46</a>]. Most women report some ongoing cramping upon leaving the office, though at levels and patterns significantly less than those experienced peri-insertion. In one study of 59 women who underwent IUD insertion, 86 percent required over-the-counter analgesics for cramping symptoms, but only 11 to 13 percent required medication for more than five days [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intrauterine-contraception-management-of-side-effects-and-complications/abstract/46\" class=\"abstract_t\">46</a>]. We advise NSAIDs (ie, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ibuprofen-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ibuprofen</a> at doses of 600 to 800 mg every six to eight hours) and heating pads as needed for discomfort. Women who develop significantly worsening pain not improved with NSAIDs should be seen for urgent evaluation, as this could be a sign of complication such as partial expulsion, malposition, uterine perforation, or pelvic infection.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2660797382\"><span class=\"h2\">Infection and/or pelvic inflammatory disease</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Risk</strong> &ndash;<strong> </strong>Historically there have been concerns that IUD use increases the risk of pelvic inflammatory disease (PID). However, extensive epidemiologic study, clinical trials and systematic reviews do not support this concern. While gonorrhea and chlamydia infection are associated with PID, rates of PID are similar among asymptomatic infected women whether or not they have an IUD. Rates of PID in asymptomatic infected women range from 0 to 5 percent, while PID rates among uninfected women range from 0 to 2 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intrauterine-contraception-management-of-side-effects-and-complications/abstract/47,48\" class=\"abstract_t\">47,48</a>]. Infection attributable to the insertion process is rare, as demonstrated by the following studies and trial:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>In one international study including over 22,000 women, the risk of infection was just under 1 percent within the first 20 days after insertion and rare thereafter with a cumulative risk of 0.1 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intrauterine-contraception-management-of-side-effects-and-complications/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. Moreover, the risk of PID did not increase with prolonged use. Subsequent large United States studies have estimated the risk of PID after IUD insertion to be 0.5 percent in the first 3 to 6 months [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intrauterine-contraception-management-of-side-effects-and-complications/abstract/4,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,5</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>In a United States population screened for sexually transmitted infections either before or at the time of IUD insertion, the risk of PID within the first 90 days after insertion was 1.1 per 1000 women [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intrauterine-contraception-management-of-side-effects-and-complications/abstract/49\" class=\"abstract_t\">49</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>In a trial of over 2500 IUD users, LNg <span class=\"nowrap\">52/5</span> IUD users had a significantly lower rates of PID than copper IUD users over a three-year period, which suggests the LNg IUDs may have a protective effect against PID [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intrauterine-contraception-management-of-side-effects-and-complications/abstract/50\" class=\"abstract_t\">50</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Management</strong> &ndash; Although PID resulting from IUD insertion is rare, given the possible serious sequelae of PID, clinicians should have a low threshold for empiric treatment of PID in women who have recently undergone IUD insertion. The diagnosis and treatment of PID are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pelvic-inflammatory-disease-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pelvic inflammatory disease: Clinical manifestations and diagnosis&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pelvic-inflammatory-disease-treatment\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pelvic inflammatory disease: Treatment&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Importantly, most women with an IUD in-situ who are diagnosed with PID do not require IUD removal prior to initiation of antibiotic therapy, regardless of interval since IUD insertion (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F114453\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef114453 \">algorithm 1</a>). In a systematic review that included three randomized trials and a prospective cohort study, one cohort study and one trial reported shorter hospitalization duration for the women who left their IUDs in place, one trial reported no laboratory differences among women treated with or without the IUD in situ, and one trial reported that women who underwent IUD removal during treatment &quot;experienced improved recovery in most clinical signs and symptoms&quot; compared with women who retained their IUDs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intrauterine-contraception-management-of-side-effects-and-complications/abstract/51\" class=\"abstract_t\">51</a>]. Based on these data, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) US Selected Practice Recommendations for Contraceptive Use recommend that women with an IUD and PID should be started on appropriate antibiotic therapy with the IUD in place [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intrauterine-contraception-management-of-side-effects-and-complications/abstract/52\" class=\"abstract_t\">52</a>]. The one exception is women with known actinomyces and PID. As actinomyces flourishes on foreign bodies, such as the IUD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intrauterine-contraception-management-of-side-effects-and-complications/abstract/53\" class=\"abstract_t\">53</a>], possible actinomyces infection requires prompt removal of the IUD to improve treatment and recovery. Actinomyces is typically treated with penicillin or tetracyclines such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=doxycycline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">doxycycline</a>. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cervicofacial-actinomycosis#H20\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Cervicofacial actinomycosis&quot;, section on 'Antibiotics'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Women who are treated for PID and have an IUD in-situ should have close clinical follow up within 48 to 72 hours to ensure improvement. Women with persistent or worsening signs or symptoms should undergo ultrasound to evaluate for tubo-ovarian abscess and initiation of parenteral antibiotic therapy. Women who fail to respond to inpatient therapy or who are at high risk may benefit from IUD removal. Removed IUDs can be sent for microbiology culture to help guide antibiotic therapy.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">For women who have been treated for documented intra-uterine infection and had their IUD removed, IUD reinsertion timing is unclear. We advise that the IUD insertion be delayed until the treatment course is complete, the symptoms are resolved, and the cervical exam is normal. Due to the high risk of reinfection, the CDC recommends repeat testing for gonorrhea or chlamydia infection at three months from the original infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intrauterine-contraception-management-of-side-effects-and-complications/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1485814189\"><span class=\"h1\">EARLY POST-INSERTION: 0 TO 3 MONTHS</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3093729610\"><span class=\"h2\">Irregular bleeding and/or cramping</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Irregular <span class=\"nowrap\">(and/or</span> heavy) bleeding and cramping are the most common patient concerns in the first few months after IUD placement, regardless of IUD type (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F113217\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef113217 \">figure 1</a>). In a self-reported survey study of IUD users, increased bleeding and cramping was experienced in 15 percent and 32 percent of LNg <span class=\"nowrap\">52/5</span> users and 71 percent and 63 percent of TCu380 users at three months after IUD insertion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intrauterine-contraception-management-of-side-effects-and-complications/abstract/54\" class=\"abstract_t\">54</a>]. However, by six months following insertion, 62 percent of LNg <span class=\"nowrap\">52/5</span> users reported lighter bleeding and 81 percent of TCu380 users reported lighter or no change in bleeding patterns. Despite the altered bleeding patterns, 94 percent of LNg <span class=\"nowrap\">52/5</span> IUD users and 93 percent of TCu380 users reported being somewhat or very satisfied with their IUD method. Counseling regarding expected bleeding changes prior to IUD insertion may improve patients' expectations and satisfaction, largely by selecting only those patients who understand and accept potential inconvenient short-term bleeding. Overall, most women are reassured to know that bleeding does not indicate a decrease in contraceptive efficacy, that the bleeding is not dangerous, and that the symptoms will likely improve with time. For most women, supportive counseling is an adequate intervention. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=intrauterine-contraception-background-and-device-types#H3994119028\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Intrauterine contraception: Background and device types&quot;, section on 'Impact of device type on bleeding pattern'</a>.)</p><p>However, women who continue to have heavy <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> prolonged bleeding are evaluated to exclude IUD malposition or expulsion, pregnancy, infection, and cervical dysplasia (see <a href=\"#H1644153901\" class=\"local\">'Anytime post-insertion'</a> below). We offer medical treatment to women who continue to have bothersome bleeding up to 3 months from IUD insertion, and we discuss that supporting data for these approaches are mostly lacking.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For women with continued bleeding with an LNg IUD, treatment options include a trial of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), combined <span class=\"nowrap\">estrogen/progestin</span> hormonal contraception, and progestin-only pills. In the absence of supporting data, we take the following approach based on the risks of undesired side effects, ease of use, availability, and cost. First we treat with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ibuprofen-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ibuprofen</a> 800 mg every eight hours, which may reduce bleeding and cramping by inhibiting prostaglandin production. A trial of ibuprofen can be continued for one to three cycles or months. Alternate NSAID options include <a href=\"topic.htm?path=naproxen-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">naproxen</a> 500 mg twice daily for five days or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diclofenac-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">diclofenac</a> 50 mg taken three times daily for five days. If NSAID therapy is not helpful, contraindicated, or declined by patient, we next offer a low-dose combined hormonal contraceptive pill, again offered in a one to three cycle or month trial. As there are no data on the optimal pill for this indication, choice of pill is determined by patient preference, drug availability, and insurance coverage. Theoretically, the use of combined hormonal methods help synchronously thin the endometrial lining. Women who respond well can be treated for one to three months and then the combined pill can be stopped. If the bothersome bleeding continues or if the woman is not a candidate for estrogen therapy, the last option is a progestin-only pill such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=norethindrone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">norethindrone</a> 0.35 mg taken daily for one to three months.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For women with continued bleeding with a copper IUD, treatment options that have been studied include NSAID medications, combined estrogen-progestin contraception or progestin-only pills, the fibrinolysis inhibitor <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tranexamic-acid-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">tranexamic acid</a>, and the antidiuretic <a href=\"topic.htm?path=desmopressin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">desmopressin</a> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intrauterine-contraception-management-of-side-effects-and-complications/abstract/55\" class=\"abstract_t\">55</a>]. Based on the available data and differences in cost and risk among the treatment options, we first offer <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ibuprofen-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ibuprofen</a> 800 mg every eight hours to reduce bleeding and cramping. Alternate NSAID options include <a href=\"topic.htm?path=naproxen-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">naproxen</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diclofenac-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">diclofenac</a> as for LNg IUDs above. For women in whom NSAID treatment is not adequate, we next offer a trial of contraceptive pills (either <span class=\"nowrap\">estrogen/progestin</span> or progestin-only) based on the woman's preferences and risk factors for estrogen use. Lastly, for women who continue to have bothersome bleeding, we offer tranexamic acid 650 mg twice daily for five days (or 500 mg twice daily if outside of the United States).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">A trial comparing <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ibuprofen-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ibuprofen</a> (400 mg three times) daily with placebo in 28 women starting the TCu380A reported that women receiving ibuprofen noted less menstrual blood loss, although both groups reported increased menstrual bleeding relative to pre-IUD insertion (2 percent increase for ibuprofen users versus 74 percent for placebo users) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intrauterine-contraception-management-of-side-effects-and-complications/abstract/56\" class=\"abstract_t\">56</a>]. In a trial of 175 Chinese women that compared two doses of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tranexamic-acid-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">tranexamic acid</a> (500 mg and 1000 mg) twice daily with placebo following IUD insertion, both groups receiving tranexamic acid reported less menstrual blood loss [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intrauterine-contraception-management-of-side-effects-and-complications/abstract/57\" class=\"abstract_t\">57</a>]. There was no difference in blood loss between the high- and low-dose groups. In a trial of 19 women comparing tranexamic acid (1500 mg three times a day for five days), <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diclofenac-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">diclofenac</a>&nbsp;(50 mg three times on the first day followed by 25 mg three times daily for four days, for two periods), and placebo, tranexamic acid was associated with the greatest reduction in menstrual blood flow, although a reduction was also noted with diclofenac [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intrauterine-contraception-management-of-side-effects-and-complications/abstract/58\" class=\"abstract_t\">58</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H895783362\"><span class=\"h2\">Infection</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>If an infection such as endometritis or pelvic inflammatory disease is going to occur, the most common time of infection is near the time of insertion. However, infection can rarely develop later. Management of infection in a woman with an IUD is the same regardless of the time point from insertion. (See <a href=\"#H2660797382\" class=\"local\">'Infection and/or pelvic inflammatory disease'</a> above.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H259257735\"><span class=\"h2\">Problems noted at time of follow-up examination</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>While there are no studies that demonstrate the benefit of a follow-up visit following IUD insertion, a visit for IUD surveillance several weeks after insertion (ie, string check) allows the provider an opportunity to assess the woman's satisfaction with the device and identify any unwanted side effects or complications. The following issues can be identified during a routine post-insertion check or at any time a speculum examination is performed.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Non-palpable strings</strong> &ndash; Women are no longer routinely advised to check their IUD strings on a regular basis because there is no evidence to support this practice [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intrauterine-contraception-management-of-side-effects-and-complications/abstract/52,59\" class=\"abstract_t\">52,59</a>]. However, some women check strings to confirm the IUD is in place. Given the rare but serious sequelae from an unrecognized IUD perforation or early expulsion, women with concerns for non-palpable strings should be seen in a timely fashion for pelvic examination to confirm IUD string presence. If the IUD strings are not visible extruding from the cervix, ultrasound examination is performed to identify the IUD location (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F57867\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef57867 \">image 1</a>). (See <a href=\"#H1277060819\" class=\"local\">'Perforation'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Non-visible strings</strong> &ndash; If the IUD strings are not visible on speculum examination, a cytobrush can be placed in the cervix and gently twisted in attempt to pull the strings down and out of the cervical os. An IUD hook can be used in a similar manner if the cytobrush does not extract the strings. If these maneuvers are not successful, we then perform an ultrasound to localize the IUD (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F57867\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef57867 \">image 1</a>).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>For women whose IUD is confirmed as being in the correct location by ultrasound, no further intervention or surveillance is necessary. Women whose IUD strings are within the uterus or upper cervix may have a lower risk of expulsion as the strings may provide an additional barrier from the IUD coming out. However, signs and symptoms of expulsion should be discussed.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>For women whose IUD is not visible in the uterus by ultrasound, we perform additional imaging to exclude possible uterine perforation. (See <a href=\"#H1277060819\" class=\"local\">'Perforation'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Expulsion</strong> &ndash; While IUD expulsion can occur at any time, expulsion is more likely to happen within the first months after insertion. In a study of over 2100 women who underwent IUD insertion, the mean expulsion rates were 1 percent at one month of follow-up and 4 percent at one year [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intrauterine-contraception-management-of-side-effects-and-complications/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. The management of IUD expulsion is discussed in detail below. (See <a href=\"#H3108373607\" class=\"local\">'Expulsion'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Perforation</strong> &ndash;<strong> </strong>While perforation is frequently diagnosed at time of occurrence, delayed diagnosis can be made if the IUD strings are no longer visible at the time of speculum examination. (See <a href=\"#H1277060819\" class=\"local\">'Perforation'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Partner feels strings</strong> &ndash; On occasion, patients report that their sexual partners can feel the IUD strings at time of intercourse, which can be irritating or painful for the partner. At time of insertion, we suggest cutting the strings at least 2 cm long to leave enough length for the strings to curve around the face of the cervix. With time, the IUD strings typically both soften and curve around along the cervix to project towards the cervical-vaginal fornix instead of along the length of the vagina. If the partner is aware of the strings but not bothered by them, no intervention is needed.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">For women whose IUD strings are bothering a sexual partner, a Scopette or clamp can be used to direct the string ends to the posterior vaginal fornix. Additionally, if there is enough length, the strings can be re-cut with curved scissors to make sure that they are cut on the perpendicular; when the strings are cut on the bias with straight scissors there may be greater risk for partner discomfort. If the partner continues to be irritated by the strings after these interventions, the strings can instead be cut flush with the external cervical os to completely minimize the risk of the partner feeling them.

While the rate of IUD discontinuation is lower than that for other contraceptive methods, the rate of IUD removal by United States women during their first year of IUD use ranges from 20 (LNg IUDs) to 22 (TCu380A) percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intrauterine-contraception-management-of-side-effects-and-complications/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H908884481\"><span class=\"h2\">Hormonal side effects</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Common progestin-related complaints include acne, weight change, hirsutism, headache, nausea, and mood changes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intrauterine-contraception-management-of-side-effects-and-complications/abstract/50,80\" class=\"abstract_t\">50,80</a>].

Limited evidence also suggests that asymptomatic female genital colonization is not uncommon. In a review of over 20,000 Pap smears,<em> Actinomyces</em>-like organisms were seen on 0.26 percent of smears [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intrauterine-contraception-management-of-side-effects-and-complications/abstract/102\" class=\"abstract_t\">102</a>].

However, the Pap smear is not the most specific test for <em>Actinomyces</em>; of all the <em>Actinomyces</em> diagnoses that made with Pap smear, only half are truly culture positive when cervical culture is performed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intrauterine-contraception-management-of-side-effects-and-complications/abstract/53,104\" class=\"abstract_t\">53,104</a>].

The differential diagnosis for non-visualized IUD strings on speculum examination includes IUD in situ, unrecognized IUD expulsion, malposition such as IUD embedding in the uterine fundus, and IUD perforation.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">For women who desire IUD removal but have non-visible IUD strings, we take the following approach to identifying the strings:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>First, we attempt to tease the strings out of the external os by inserting and rotating a cytobrush into the endocervix. This technique has a reported efficacy of 98 percent and can be performed regardless of concern for pregnancy or intentions for IUD removal versus continuation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intrauterine-contraception-management-of-side-effects-and-complications/abstract/57,58\" class=\"abstract_t\">57,58</a>]. Use of a colposcope can provide further string visualization with this technique [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intrauterine-contraception-management-of-side-effects-and-complications/abstract/111-113\" class=\"abstract_t\">111-113</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>If string retrieval with the cytobrush is not successful, there is no concern for pregnancy, and the patient is able to tolerate continued attempts, string identification (and IUD removal) can be attempted using a Bozeman uterine packing forceps, a curved Kelly forceps, IUD hook, or alligator forceps. Given the effect of gravity with the patient lying on her back, deviation of the forceps posterior may result in improved blind location of the IUD.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>For women in whom cervix instrumentation does not identify the strings, and depending on the patient's ability to tolerate cervical manipulation, we dilate the cervix with a 21 to 27 French (ie, 7 to 9 mm) Pratt dilator to facilitate opening the forceps to grasp the string. A paracervical block (10 to 20 cc 1% <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lidocaine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">lidocaine</a> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=chloroprocaine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">chloroprocaine</a> without epinephrine) could be employed to improve success at initial clinic removal.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>If IUD removal remains unsuccessful, pelvic ultrasound should be performed to confirm IUD location (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F57867\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef57867 \">image 1</a>). Once intrauterine position is confirmed, these methods can be attempted again either in the office or outpatient surgical setting, depending on the patient's needs for sedation. In a prospective study of 29 parous women who presented for LNg <span class=\"nowrap\">52/2</span> IUD removal without visible strings, 100 percent were able to have their IUD removed in office on first visit using an IUD hook, Kelly clamp, or other blunt grasper, or ring forceps with or without adjuvant ultrasound guidance <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> cervical anesthetic [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intrauterine-contraception-management-of-side-effects-and-complications/abstract/114\" class=\"abstract_t\">114</a>]. In a second study of 23 women with failed initial IUD removal, 83 percent had successful removal with the addition of ultrasound guidance alone [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intrauterine-contraception-management-of-side-effects-and-complications/abstract/113\" class=\"abstract_t\">113</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>For women in whom the above techniques are not successful in identifying the IUD strings or if ultrasound evaluation reveals an IUD embedded in the uterine wall, hysteroscopic evaluation and removal can be necessary, either in an office or outpatient surgical setting. After appropriate cervical anesthesia and dilation, the operative hysteroscope is passed through the cervix and gently advanced into the uterus until the IUD or strings are visualized. Once visualized, the hysteroscopic grasper is used to grasp the strings (preferable if they are seen) or the device, and the IUD, grasper, and hysteroscope can all be withdrawn concurrently from the cervix.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Difficult removal</strong> &ndash; If IUD strings are visible at the external os, but the device cannot be removed with traditional gentle traction, increased moderate traction can be applied to the IUD strings. If the IUD still cannot be removed with moderate traction or if the strings either feel like they are breaking or actually do break off the device, a pelvic ultrasound, preferably with 3D images, is obtained to confirm IUD location (if not already performed) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F57867\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef57867 \">image 1</a>). If ultrasound confirms intrauterine position but the IUD is unable to be removed, we perform hysteroscopic removal, similar to women whose IUD strings are not visible. (See <a href=\"#H259257735\" class=\"local\">'Problems noted at time of follow-up examination'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">For IUDs known or suspected on ultrasound to be embedded in the fundal myometrium but not perforating through the serosa, we recommend trial of traditional removal in the office, as a case series study of 157 women reported that only 10 percent of all IUDs diagnosed as embedded on preoperative imaging were confirmed to be embedded on hysteroscopy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intrauterine-contraception-management-of-side-effects-and-complications/abstract/115\" class=\"abstract_t\">115</a>]. If moderate traction does not remove the embedded IUD, we perform hysteroscopic removal to ensure complete, atraumatic IUD removal. If the embedded IUD portion looks like it might break with traction, it can be teased or dug out of the myometrium with the closed grasper. Once more, if the IUD is visible, it can be regrasped at a portion distal to the weak point in the device and removed.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Broken IUD</strong> &ndash; IUD breakage is rare and limited to case reports. Most cases occurred during IUD removal when the IUD fractured and resulted in a retained arm, but there are also rare cases reporting spontaneous expulsion of a portion of a fractured IUD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intrauterine-contraception-management-of-side-effects-and-complications/abstract/116\" class=\"abstract_t\">116</a>]. There are limited data on the consequences of leaving an IUD fragment in situ, including abnormal bleeding, pain, infertility, and infection. For women who are symptomatic or who want the fragment removed, the location can be diagnosed with ultrasonography, hysteroscopy, or a kidney, ureter, bladder (KUB) x-ray. Asymptomatic women are counseled that long term sequela of leaving an IUD fragment in utero has unknown possible future consequences. For women who desire future fertility, we advise fragment removal if the fragments are visible on imaging or hysteroscopy. Options for removal of retained fragments include manual vacuum aspiration, an IUD hook, narrow tip forceps, and hysteroscopic assisted extraction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intrauterine-contraception-management-of-side-effects-and-complications/abstract/116\" class=\"abstract_t\">116</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1262795393\"><span class=\"h1\">SOCIETY GUIDELINE LINKS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Links to society and government-sponsored guidelines from selected countries and regions around the world are provided separately.

Abnormal bleeding and cramping are typically self-limited and resolve within three months. Very rarely, infection such as pelvic inflammatory disease develops. Most women with an IUD in-situ who are diagnosed with PID do not require IUD removal regardless of interval since IUD insertion (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F114453\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef114453 \">algorithm 1</a>). The one exception is women with known actinomyces PID. As actinomyces flourishes on foreign bodies, such as the IUD, actinomyces PID requires prompt removal of the IUD to improve treatment and recovery.

Because of these issues, some women will desire IUD removal. In addition, women with an IUD can be diagnosed with cervical dysplasia or actinomyces, which requires additional treatment.
