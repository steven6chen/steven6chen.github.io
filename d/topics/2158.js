One of the first reports of hyperthyroid bone disease was in 1891 when von Recklinghausen described the &quot;worm-eaten&quot; appearance of the long bones of a young woman who died from hyperthyroidism [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bone-disease-with-hyperthyroidism-and-thyroid-hormone-therapy/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. With the introduction of antithyroid drugs and radioiodine in the 1940s, clinically apparent hyperthyroid bone disease became less common. However, bone density measurements demonstrate that bone loss is common in patients with overt hyperthyroidism and to a lesser extent in those with subclinical hyperthyroidism, whether caused by endogenous hyperthyroidism or excessive doses of thyroid hormone(s) (thyroxine [T4] or triiodothyronine [T3]).</p><p>This topic will review bone disease in patients with overt and subclinical hyperthyroidism. The clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and treatment of overt and subclinical hyperthyroidism are reviewed separately.

This action is mediated by nuclear triiodothyronine (T3) receptors, predominantly thyroid receptor (TR)-alpha-1, which has been found in rat and human osteoblast cell lines [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bone-disease-with-hyperthyroidism-and-thyroid-hormone-therapy/abstract/3-5\" class=\"abstract_t\">3-5</a>] and in osteoclasts derived from an osteoclastoma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bone-disease-with-hyperthyroidism-and-thyroid-hormone-therapy/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. Thyroid hormone may affect bone calcium metabolism either by a direct action on osteoclasts or by acting on osteoblasts, which in turn mediate osteoclastic bone resorption [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bone-disease-with-hyperthyroidism-and-thyroid-hormone-therapy/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. Thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) may also have a direct effect on bone formation and bone resorption, mediated via the TSH receptor on osteoblast and osteoclast precursors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bone-disease-with-hyperthyroidism-and-thyroid-hormone-therapy/abstract/7,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,8</a>]; this putative effect is, however, controversial, since bone loss appeared independent of TSH levels in the experiments in mice with a loss-of-function TSH receptor [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bone-disease-with-hyperthyroidism-and-thyroid-hormone-therapy/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].</p><p>Increased serum interleukin-6 (IL-6) concentrations in hyperthyroid patients may also play a role in thyroid hormone-stimulated bone loss [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bone-disease-with-hyperthyroidism-and-thyroid-hormone-therapy/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. IL-6 stimulates osteoclast production and may be an effector of the action of parathyroid hormone (PTH) on bone.

The bone density changes may or may not be reversible with therapy. These changes in bone metabolism are associated with negative calcium balance, hypercalciuria, and rarely, hypercalcemia.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Bone density</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Bone loss is a uniform feature of overt hyperthyroidism [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bone-disease-with-hyperthyroidism-and-thyroid-hormone-therapy/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. The extent of the reduction in bone density in most studies of hyperthyroid patients ranges from 10 to 20 percent. The extent of the reversibility of bone loss with therapy is unclear. Studies that have looked at changes in bone density after treatment of hyperthyroidism have yielded variable results. As examples:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A meta-analysis of studies demonstrated improvement in bone mineral density (BMD) with treatment of hyperthyroidism [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bone-disease-with-hyperthyroidism-and-thyroid-hormone-therapy/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. Within the first year after treatment, BMD was below age-matched controls (Z-score below 0). However, BMD was similar to age-matched controls one to four years after treatment of hyperthyroidism. A subsequent study also showed complete recovery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bone-disease-with-hyperthyroidism-and-thyroid-hormone-therapy/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In another study, bone density was measured using dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry (DXA) technology at baseline and 12 months after definitive management of hyperthyroidism in 50 young patients (mean age 29.4 years) with hyperthyroidism and either bone pain or an elevation in serum alkaline phosphatase [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bone-disease-with-hyperthyroidism-and-thyroid-hormone-therapy/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. At baseline, 92 percent had low bone density. One year after treatment, bone density improved by 6 percent. However, bone density remained below aged-matched controls. Several other studies have also shown incomplete recovery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bone-disease-with-hyperthyroidism-and-thyroid-hormone-therapy/abstract/14-16\" class=\"abstract_t\">14-16</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a cross-sectional, population-based study of 5778 women without and 252 women with a self-reported history of hyperthyroidism, bone density was measured at the ultradistal forearm using DXA technology. Women with a history of hyperthyroidism had a higher prevalence of osteoporosis (adjusted odds ratio [OR] 1.5, 95% CI 1.1-2.0) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bone-disease-with-hyperthyroidism-and-thyroid-hormone-therapy/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>].</p><p/><p>The variability in these results is likely due to differences in bone densitometry techniques, site of measurement, patient-specific factors (eg, duration and severity of hyperthyroidism prior to treatment, vitamin D sufficiency), and length of follow-up [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bone-disease-with-hyperthyroidism-and-thyroid-hormone-therapy/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. Taken together, the above data suggest that bone loss is incompletely reversible in some patients, and therefore, a past history of hyperthyroidism should be considered during an assessment of clinical risk factors for osteoporosis. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=osteoporotic-fracture-risk-assessment#H17\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Osteoporotic fracture risk assessment&quot;, section on 'Clinical risk factor assessment'</a>.)</p><p>Histomorphometric studies of iliac crest bone biopsies show a greater deleterious effect of hyperthyroidism on cortical as opposed to trabecular bone [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bone-disease-with-hyperthyroidism-and-thyroid-hormone-therapy/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. In one report, hyperthyroid patients had only a 2.7 percent reduction in trabecular bone volume, but there was a 40 percent increase in osteoclast resorption surfaces in cortical bone and a 32 percent increase in cortical bone porosity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bone-disease-with-hyperthyroidism-and-thyroid-hormone-therapy/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. There was no change in osteoid volume (ie, no osteomalacia). Another study showed reduction in the trabecular volume but an even greater reduction in the cortical porosity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bone-disease-with-hyperthyroidism-and-thyroid-hormone-therapy/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>].</p><p>Three-dimensional reconstructions of the remodeling sequence have shown how these changes occur. In the normal remodeling sequence, osteoclastic resorption and osteoblastic bone formation are synchronized. In overt hyperthyroidism, osteoclastic resorption is stimulated out of proportion to osteoblastic remineralization [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bone-disease-with-hyperthyroidism-and-thyroid-hormone-therapy/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. Both resorption and formation occur rapidly; the normal cycle duration of approximately 200 days is halved. In addition, more surfaces are resorbing and forming. But with each cycle, there is more bone resorbed than formed, and this is associated with loss of mineralized bone with each remodeling cycle. In contrast, cycle length approximates 700 days in hypothyroid patients and is associated with an increase in mineralized bone.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Fracture risk</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Overt hyperthyroidism is a risk factor for fracture [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bone-disease-with-hyperthyroidism-and-thyroid-hormone-therapy/abstract/11,22-24\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,22-24</a>].

Exogenous thyroid hormone therapy was not a risk factor for fracture in women with normal serum TSH concentrations, but a history of hyperthyroidism was a risk factor for hip fracture, even after adjustment for serum TSH concentration and BMD.
