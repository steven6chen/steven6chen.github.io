The dome-shaped diaphragm is the most important inspiratory muscle [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-and-diagnosis-of-unilateral-diaphragmatic-paralysis-and-eventration-in-adults/abstract/1-3\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-3</a>]. The other main muscles of inspiration are the scalenes, external intercostals, and sternomastoids. The muscles of expiration are the internal intercostals and the muscles of the abdominal wall (including the rectus abdominus, internal and external obliques, and transversus abdominus). Normal diaphragmatic function is discussed separately.

The clinical manifestations and evaluation of respiratory muscle weakness due to neuromuscular disease, the evaluation and management of bilateral diaphragmatic paralysis in adults, disorders of control of ventilation, and the evaluation and management of diaphragm paralysis in the newborn are reviewed separately.

Each nerve divides into four trunks that innervate the anterolateral, posterolateral, sternal, and crural portions of the diaphragm. Interruption or injury to one of the phrenic nerves results in unilateral diaphragmatic paralysis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-and-diagnosis-of-unilateral-diaphragmatic-paralysis-and-eventration-in-adults/abstract/5-9\" class=\"abstract_t\">5-9</a>]. Normal diaphragmatic structure and function are described separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=causes-and-diagnosis-of-bilateral-diaphragmatic-paralysis#H2\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Causes and diagnosis of bilateral diaphragmatic paralysis&quot;, section on 'Normal diaphragm function'</a>.)</p><p>Depending upon the degree of diaphragmatic compromise, the other hemidiaphragm or the accessory muscles of respiration assume some or all the work of breathing. This compensation is achieved by more intense contraction of the accessory muscles and by the progressive recruitment of other, less important accessory inspiratory muscles (sternomastoid, trapezius, latissimus dorsi, and pectoralis minor and major). Patients may also recruit abdominal muscles to augment exhalation, which forces the respiratory system to a lower volume (below functional residual capacity) at end-exhalation. The low volume increases the elastic recoil energy in the chest wall, assisting the next inspiration.</p><p>In the case of unilateral diaphragm paralysis, the normal contralateral hemidiaphragm is able to generate enough negative pleural pressure to promote inspiration. The negative intrapleural pressure draws air in through the trachea, but also draws some air across the chest from the side of the paralyzed hemidiaphragm. As the paralyzed hemidiaphragm is pliable and mobile, it moves up into the chest (paradoxically) during inspiration. The movement of air from one lung to the other increases the work of breathing without improving gas exchange. However, over time (approximately one year) the paralyzed hemidiaphragm becomes less pliant and less responsive to the pull of negative pleural pressure from the contralateral side. The decreased compliance of the paralyzed hemidiaphragm reduces the amount of airflow from the paralyzed to the normal side. Thus, the respiratory impairment of unilateral diaphragm paralysis tends to improve even without restoration of phrenic nerve function.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H17481150\"><span class=\"h1\">UNILATERAL DIAPHRAGMATIC PARALYSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Unilateral diaphragmatic paralysis is more common than bilateral disease.

A related condition, hereditary brachial plexopathy (MIM 162100) can also be associated with phrenic nerve weakness. Diaphragm paralysis complicates about 5 percent of congenital brachial plexus palsies.

Respiratory insufficiency in this setting is often reversible, particularly if the lung injury is reversible (asthma attack, COPD exacerbation or pneumonia). In case of progressive lung disease, the symptoms may persist requiring long-term ventilator support.

Pulmonary function testing provides supportive evidence of inspiratory muscle weakness, a measure of the degree of respiratory impairment, and a benchmark for future comparisons. The differential diagnosis of unilateral diaphragmatic paralysis includes a subpulmonic pleural effusion, diaphragmatic eventration, diaphragmatic hernia, and unilateral subdiaphragmatic processes (eg, abscess, splenomegaly).</p><p>Electromyography and measurement of transdiaphragmatic pressures are not necessary for routine management of unilateral diaphragmatic weakness, unless the patient is incapacitated enough to consider surgical treatment.

The diagnosis can be easily confirmed with a fluoroscopic &quot;sniff&quot; test, in which diaphragmatic movement is observed fluoroscopically while the patient sniffs forcefully [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-and-diagnosis-of-unilateral-diaphragmatic-paralysis-and-eventration-in-adults/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. The sniff test shows paradoxical elevation of the paralyzed hemidiaphragm with inspiration compared with the rapid descent of the normal hemidiaphragm. The sniff test is positive in over 90 percent of patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-and-diagnosis-of-unilateral-diaphragmatic-paralysis-and-eventration-in-adults/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>].</p><p>For patients with a diagnosis of unilateral diaphragmatic paralysis, computerized tomography of the thorax is obtained to evaluate the course of the ipsilateral phrenic nerve and exclude involvement by a tumor. Patchy areas of atelectasis may be noted at the lung base. For patients with a history of neck pain or injury, we obtain magnetic resonance imaging of the cervical spine.

When unilateral diaphragmatic paralysis is present, the forced vital capacity (FVC) is usually decreased to values in the range of 70 to 80 percent of predicted, a less pronounced reduction than seen with bilateral disease. The FVC may decrease further by 15 to 25 percent in the supine position. The deleterious effect of the supine position is more pronounced with paralysis of the right hemidiaphragm, possibly due to the larger proportion of lung function performed by the larger right lung. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tests-of-respiratory-muscle-strength\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Tests of respiratory muscle strength&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The maximal inspiratory pressure (MIP) is usually decreased to values of 60 percent of predicted (normal values are more negative than -60 cm H<sub>2</sub>O). The maximal expiratory pressure (MEP) is usually normal.

We do not routinely obtain maximum voluntary ventilation (MVV), unless needed for cardiopulmonary exercise testing. Similarly, we have not found sniff nasal pressures measured at the nose to provide additional information, although other authors use this test [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-and-diagnosis-of-unilateral-diaphragmatic-paralysis-and-eventration-in-adults/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>].</p><p>Occasionally, oxygen saturation is reduced in the supine position. In the absence of accompanying lung disease, it is unusual for the patient with unilateral diaphragmatic paralysis to develop an elevated arterial partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PaCO<sub>2</sub>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-and-diagnosis-of-unilateral-diaphragmatic-paralysis-and-eventration-in-adults/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H17481192\"><span class=\"h3\">Electromyography and physiologic testing</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Electromyography (EMG) has a limited role in unilateral diaphragmatic paralysis; however, measurement of the pressure generated by the inspiratory muscles may be helpful.

When sleep-disordered breathing is suspected, overnight multichannel polysomnography is obtained. Overnight pulse oximetry may be used as a screening test for nocturnal oxygen desaturation, but is generally not adequate screening for sleep-disordered breathing in these patients, as it underestimates the degree of hypoventilation and sleep disturbance.

However, the prognosis for recovery of diaphragmatic function is variable, and the exact proportion of patients who manifest improvement is unknown. Even those who do not recover diaphragm function generally lead a normal life, although breathlessness may occur during exercise or situations of increased ventilatory demands.

The lateral view of the upright radiograph generally confirms a localized elevation of the dome of the hemidiaphragm with a smooth contour.

(See <a href=\"#H17481220\" class=\"local\">'Etiology'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Most adults with diaphragmatic eventration are asymptomatic, but some have exertional dyspnea. (See <a href=\"#H17481227\" class=\"local\">'Clinical manifestations'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The diagnosis of diaphragmatic eventration is based on the upright frontal and lateral chest radiographs showing the typical finding of a localized area of elevation of the dome of the hemidiaphragm. The lateral view confirms the localized nature of the elevation of the dome of the hemidiaphragm and the smooth contour. When the eventration is more diffuse, the radiographic appearance is similar to that of unilateral diaphragmatic paralysis. (See <a href=\"#H17481234\" class=\"local\">'Evaluation and diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Further evaluation of diaphragmatic eventration is not necessary in asymptomatic patients. Pulmonary function tests are typically performed in those patients with exertional or recumbent dyspnea or when it is unclear if the problem is an eventration or unilateral paralysis.
