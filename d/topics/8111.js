Endogenous heparin and heparin-binding proteins have a variety of anticoagulant, anti-inflammatory, and possibly anti-angiogenic effects, which are incompletely understood [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/heparin-and-lmw-heparin-dosing-and-adverse-effects/abstract/3-7\" class=\"abstract_t\">3-7</a>].</p><p>The form of heparin used clinically as an anticoagulant is isolated from porcine (pig) or bovine (cow) intestines [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/heparin-and-lmw-heparin-dosing-and-adverse-effects/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. It has a mixture of different-length polysaccharides, with a mean size of approximately 45 saccharide units, corresponding to a mean molecular weight of approximately 15,000 daltons (range 3000 to 30,000 daltons). Low molecular weight (LMW) heparins are derived via enzymatic or chemical depolymerization of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=heparin-unfractionated-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">unfractionated heparin</a>, resulting in a product with a mean length of approximately 15 saccharide units and a mean molecular weight of approximately 4000 to 5000 daltons (range 2000 to 9000 daltons) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/heparin-and-lmw-heparin-dosing-and-adverse-effects/abstract/9-13\" class=\"abstract_t\">9-13</a>]. <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fondaparinux-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Fondaparinux</a>, which consists of the minimal AT-binding region of heparin, contains five saccharide units (ie, pentasaccharide) and has an approximate molecular weight of 1700 daltons.</p><p>Heparins act indirectly by binding to antithrombin (AT, formerly called AT III, also known as heparin cofactor I) rather than by binding directly to coagulation factors (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F101832\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef101832 \">figure 1</a>). Binding of heparin to AT is mediated by a unique pentasaccharide sequence in heparin that is randomly distributed along the heparin chains [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/heparin-and-lmw-heparin-dosing-and-adverse-effects/abstract/9,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,14</a>]. The binding site for heparins on AT is located at the AT amino terminus [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/heparin-and-lmw-heparin-dosing-and-adverse-effects/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. Binding of heparin to this site on AT induces a conformational change in AT, which converts AT from a slow to a rapid inactivator of coagulation factors (eg, thrombin [factor IIa], factor Xa) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F94856\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef94856 \">figure 2</a>). The enhancement of AT anticoagulant activity by heparins is on the order of 1000- to 4000-fold [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/heparin-and-lmw-heparin-dosing-and-adverse-effects/abstract/15,16\" class=\"abstract_t\">15,16</a>].</p><p>Both unfractionated and LMW heparins efficiently inactivate factor Xa via AT. However, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=heparin-unfractionated-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">unfractionated heparin</a> is a much more efficient inactivator of thrombin because thrombin inactivation requires the formation of a ternary complex between heparin, AT, and thrombin, and this ternary complex can form only when heparin chains are at least 18 saccharide units long (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F94856\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef94856 \">figure 2</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/heparin-and-lmw-heparin-dosing-and-adverse-effects/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. These 18-saccharide-long units are present to a much smaller extent in LMW heparins and are absent from <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fondaparinux-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">fondaparinux</a>. Thus, unfractionated heparin, LMW heparin, and fondaparinux all inactivate factor Xa, but unfractionated heparin also inhibits thrombin [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/heparin-and-lmw-heparin-dosing-and-adverse-effects/abstract/10,18\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,18</a>].

Renal function does not affect elimination at therapeutic doses, although renal elimination may play a role at very high doses. However, dose adjustment is not used in patients with renal insufficiency or renal failure. (See <a href=\"#H8478354\" class=\"local\">'Initial dosing'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">The onset of heparin action when administered intravenously is instantaneous; plasma levels following subcutaneous administration peak at two to four hours, with considerable individual variation.

Individuals with creatinine clearance &lt;30 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/min</span> have a significantly increased plasma level (eg, by approximately 65 percent) and generally require dose adjustment.

The half-life is approximately two hours, and steady state levels are reached on approximately day 2 to 4 of therapy. When administered subcutaneously (the most common route of administration), the half-life of LMW heparins ranges from three to seven hours if renal function is normal.</p><p/><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=heparin-unfractionated-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Unfractionated heparin</a> and LMW heparin do not cross the placenta; however, multiple dose vials may contain benzyl alcohol, which does cross the placenta and may cause fetal harm.

Nomogram-based dosing has been demonstrated for patients with acute venous thromboembolism (VTE) to improve the rapidity of establishing an anticoagulant effect and to reduce the risk of recurrent VTE, compared with practices in which the clinician estimated the initial dosing without using a nomogram.

The likelihood of a therapeutic aPTT within the first 24 hours was greater in those who received nomogram-based dosing than those whose dosing was not guided by a nomogram (odds ratio [OR]: 3.6; 95% CI 2.6-4.9). The frequency of VTE recurrence was also lower in patients who received nomogram-based dosing (OR 0.3; 95% CI 0.1-0.8), highlighting the clinical significance of the findings. Bleeding events were similar.</p><p>The clinical relevance of rapid achievement of a therapeutic aPTT has been well established in randomized trials. As an example, analysis of three consecutive randomized trials for VTE therapy found that individuals who had a therapeutic aPTT within the first 24 hours had a 4 to 6 percent rate of VTE recurrence, compared with a 23 percent recurrence risk in those who did not have a therapeutic aPTT within the first 24 hours.</p><p>Of note, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=heparin-unfractionated-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">unfractionated heparin</a> products manufactured in the United States after October 8, 2009 are approximately 10 percent less potent than heparins manufactured before this date, due to the use of a new United States Pharmacopeia (USP) reference standard, which lessened the potential for contamination and calibrated the new material relative to the international standard issued by the World Health Organization. The relevance of this change was considered to be greatest during the initial three years following the change, when institutions may have stocked heparin from before and after the change in manufacturing. This is of interest primarily to those studying heparin dosing during this period of time; there are no immediate clinical implications for patient dosing.</p><p>Heparin is not intended for intramuscular use and cannot be given orally.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H78179\"><span class=\"h3\">Laboratory monitoring and dose titration</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Once an initial dose has been administered, therapeutic (full-dose) heparin administration is monitored using a combination of clinical assessment and laboratory testing. The infusion rate is adjusted based on results of laboratory testing (eg, aPTT or anti-factor Xa activity).</p><p>A question may arise as to whether the aPTT or anti-factor Xa activity (or both) is superior for heparin monitoring. There are no high quality studies comparing these measures, and there is no evidence to support using one over the other (or using both) for routine monitoring [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/heparin-and-lmw-heparin-dosing-and-adverse-effects/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]. Thus, clinicians should use whichever test is available. Availability of anti-factor Xa activity measurements validated for heparin dosing varies by institution, and institutional protocols should be observed. If both an aPTT and anti-factor Xa test are available, the choice between them (pending further evidence) may be based on cost, convenience, and clinician familiarity. There may be certain exceptions, such as a baseline prolonged aPTT, as discussed below.</p><p>For most indications, the aPTT (or anti-factor Xa activity) is measured approximately four to six hours after heparin initiation. An aPTT of 1.5 to 2.5 times the mean of the control value or upper limit of the normal range is widely accepted for maintenance therapy. Additional nomograms are available for adjusting doses based on the aPTT value (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F72792\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef72792 \">table 3</a>). These often include parameters to repeat a bolus if the aPTT is below a certain value and to hold heparin if the aPTT is above a certain value, and parameters for rechecking the aPTT four to six hours after any dosage change.</p><p>Unlike the international normalized ratio (INR) for the PT, there is no standard against which to normalize aPTT or anti-factor Xa values. Thus, values from different laboratories cannot be compared directly, and each laboratory must independently determine the normal values and therapeutic ranges for heparin that will provide a sufficient blood heparin level (of at least 0.2 <span class=\"nowrap\">units/mL</span> by the protamine titration assay) for each batch of thromboplastin reagent (for the aPTT) or anti-factor Xa assay used [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/heparin-and-lmw-heparin-dosing-and-adverse-effects/abstract/32,33\" class=\"abstract_t\">32,33</a>].

For LMW heparin, serum creatinine is also measured. A thorough bleeding history should be obtained. Many patients will benefit from baseline measurement of transaminases because mild transaminase elevations can occur with heparins, and this information may obviate the need for more extensive testing. (See <a href=\"#H3509845\" class=\"local\">'Baseline testing (unfractionated heparin)'</a> above and <a href=\"#H435249\" class=\"local\">'Baseline testing (LMW heparin)'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><a href=\"topic.htm?path=heparin-unfractionated-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Unfractionated heparin</a> generally is administered intravenously as an initial bolus followed by a continuous infusion using a heparin nomogram (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F58483\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef58483 \">table 2</a>). Subsequent dose adjustments are made based on aPTT values (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F72792\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef72792 \">table 3</a>); some institutions adjust heparin infusion rates based on anti-factor Xa activity levels instead of (or in addition to) the aPTT. (See <a href=\"#H8476818\" class=\"local\">'Unfractionated heparin'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Platelet count monitoring is appropriate to detect heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT). (See <a href=\"#H11\" class=\"local\">'Platelet count monitoring'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Individuals with a prolonged baseline aPTT (eg, due to a lupus anticoagulant) and individuals who require significantly higher than average doses of heparin based on aPTT values may be best monitored by using an anti-factor Xa activity assay.

Administration of AT concentrates may be appropriate in some cases.

Several LMW heparin products are available. (See <a href=\"#H29\" class=\"local\">'LMW heparin'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Some patient groups may require special dosing of LMW heparin (eg, older age, obesity, renal insufficiency (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F90258\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef90258 \">table 4</a>), pregnancy).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>A properly timed anti-factor Xa activity measurement may be used in selected situations in which there is a benefit from confirming that the expected anticoagulant effect has been achieved. (See <a href=\"#H267651294\" class=\"local\">'Laboratory monitoring/measurement'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Some patients receiving LMW heparin require platelet count monitoring for HIT. (See <a href=\"#H11\" class=\"local\">'Platelet count monitoring'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Bleeding risk is increased with unfractionated or LMW heparin. Management of bleeding in a patient receiving heparin depends upon the location and severity of bleeding, the thromboembolic risk, and the aPTT or anti-factor Xa activity. If urgent reversal is required, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=protamine-sulfate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">protamine sulfate</a> is administered by slow intravenous infusion (not to exceed 20 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/minute</span> or 50 mg in any 10-minute period). Full neutralization is achieved with a dose of 1 mg protamine <span class=\"nowrap\">sulfate/100</span> units of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=heparin-unfractionated-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">unfractionated heparin</a>. Protamine sulfate does not fully neutralize LMW heparins, but clinical bleeding may be reduced. Protamine sulfate carries risks of anaphylaxis in some patients. (See <a href=\"#H81630\" class=\"local\">'Bleeding'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Other complications of unfractionated or LMW heparins besides bleeding and HIT include cutaneous reactions, systemic allergic reactions, and hyperkalemia. Osteoporosis typically is of concern with long-term administration of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=heparin-unfractionated-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">unfractionated heparin</a>. Some thrombophilia testing cannot be performed while the patient is receiving heparin (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F76966\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef76966 \">table 5</a>); however, this should not be interpreted to mean that thrombophilia testing is indicated routinely prior to heparin initiation.
