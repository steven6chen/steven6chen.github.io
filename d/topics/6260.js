In 1913, Simon Flexner's introduction of intrathecal meningococcal antiserum prevented some deaths, but the clinical outcome did not improve dramatically until the advent of systemic antimicrobial therapy in the 1930s [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-of-bacterial-meningitis-in-adults/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p>Despite the effectiveness of current antibiotics in clearing bacteria from the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), bacterial meningitis continues to cause significant morbidity and mortality worldwide. In two large case series, for example, the case-fatality rate for adults with bacterial meningitis was approximately 25 percent, and transient or permanent neurologic morbidity occurred in 21 to 28 percent of survivors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-of-bacterial-meningitis-in-adults/abstract/2,3\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,3</a>].

In 2003, it was estimated that 30,000 cases of vaccine serotype IPD were prevented in the United States through routine immunization; approximately two-thirds of these cases were prevented through herd immunity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-of-bacterial-meningitis-in-adults/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. The rate of pneumococcal meningitis fell from 0.8 to 0.55 cases per 100,000 population (a 33 percent reduction); the reduction was greatest in children under five years of age [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-of-bacterial-meningitis-in-adults/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].

The remaining cases were primarily due to <em>H. influenzae</em>, streptococci, <em>Staphylococcus aureus</em>, and gram-negative bacilli. A similar distribution was noted in another study of community-acquired bacterial meningitis in adults [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-of-bacterial-meningitis-in-adults/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p>In a population-based observational study of the incidence and inpatient mortality for the most important causes of community and nosocomial bacterial meningitis based on International Classification of Diseases coding across all hospitals in the United States between 1997 and 2010, the incidence of hospital admission due to bacterial meningitis available in the National Inpatient Sample database revealed 50,822 cases for the five most commonly identified bacterial pathogens [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-of-bacterial-meningitis-in-adults/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. The most common identifiable pathogen was <em>S. pneumoniae</em> (21,858 cases) with an incidence of 0.306 cases per 100,000 people, followed by <em>N. meningitidis</em> (12,833 cases; incidence rate 0.123 per 100,000 people), <em>H. influenzae</em> (3404 cases; incidence rate 0.058 cases per 100,000 people), <em>Staphylococcus </em>species (6031 cases; incidence rate 0.114 cases per 100,000 population), and gram-negative bacteria (6696 cases; incidence rate 0.127 cases per 100,000 people) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F98806\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef98806 \">figure 2</a>). The incidence of pneumococcal meningitis decreased from 1997 to 2010, with an incidence of 0.81 per 100,000 people in 1997 and 0.3 per 100,000 people in 2010; this decrease coincided with introduction of PCV7 in 2000. The incidence of meningococcal meningitis also decreased by 83 percent (0.721 per 100,000 people in 1997; 0.123 per 100,000 people in 2010), in association with introduction of the first meningococcal conjugate vaccine in 2005, which protects against serogroups A, C, Y, and W135.</p><p>In another study analyzing the Kids&rsquo; Inpatient Database and National Inpatient Database considering all cases of bacterial meningitis in the United States from 1993 to 2011, 295,706 cases were identified [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-of-bacterial-meningitis-in-adults/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. There was a significant reduction in cases of meningitis in children and older adults following introduction of PCV7 and the quadrivalent meningococcal conjugate vaccine; the authors speculated that the introduction of PCV13 in the United States in 2010 and the vaccines against meningococcal serogroup B approved in the United States in 2014 and 2015 might further reduce the burden of this disease.</p><p>The efficacy of vaccination for preventing invasive meningococcal disease was also demonstrated in an epidemiologic study in the Netherlands from 1960 to 2012 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-of-bacterial-meningitis-in-adults/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. The incidence of invasive meningococcal disease increased from 0.5 per 100,000 population in 1960 to 4.5 per 100,000 population in 2001 and subsequently decreased to 0.6 per 100,000 population in 2012. In response to a serogroup C epidemic from 1999 to 2001, a serogroup C meningococcal conjugate vaccine was introduced, which reduced the incidence of serogroup C disease by 95 percent.

It has been estimated that meningitis occurs in only 4 percent of invasive pneumococcal infections, compared with 48 percent of invasive <em>N. meningitidis</em> infections, 30 percent of invasive listeriosis, 10 percent of invasive <em>H. influenzae</em> infections, and 4 percent of invasive group B streptococcal infections [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-of-bacterial-meningitis-in-adults/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>].

In African countries with high rates of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection, the majority of meningitis cases are caused by <em>S. pneumoniae</em>, which has been associated with a high mortality rate [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-of-bacterial-meningitis-in-adults/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>].</p><p><em>Streptococcus suis </em>is an emerging zoonosis that causes meningitis in Asia and has been linked to exposure to pigs or pork [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-of-bacterial-meningitis-in-adults/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>].

This has often been classified as nosocomial meningitis because a different spectrum of microorganisms (ie, gram-negative bacilli and staphylococci) is more likely to be implicated than that associated with community-acquired meningitis. These patients often present with clinical symptoms during hospitalization or after hospital discharge, so the term healthcare-associated meningitis is more representative of the diverse mechanisms that can lead to this illness than nosocomial meningitis. Healthcare-associated meningitis is primarily a disease of neurosurgical patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-of-bacterial-meningitis-in-adults/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. Two large series reported a meningitis incidence of 0.3 and 1.5 percent, respectively, after neurosurgical procedures [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-of-bacterial-meningitis-in-adults/abstract/26,27\" class=\"abstract_t\">26,27</a>].

(See <a href=\"#H9\" class=\"local\">'Risk factors'</a> below.)</p><p>The distribution of causative organisms is appreciably different in healthcare-associated meningitis compared with community-acquired meningitis, which was described in the preceding section. This was illustrated in a study of 197 episodes of nosocomial meningitis between 1962 and 1988; nosocomial infection was primarily defined as meningitis that developed more than 48 hours after hospitalization or within one week of hospital discharge [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-of-bacterial-meningitis-in-adults/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Gram-negative bacilli accounted for 38 percent of single episodes of meningitis, and streptococci, <em>S. aureus</em>, and coagulase-negative staphylococci accounted for 9 percent each. In contrast, <em>S. pneumoniae</em> accounted for only 5 percent of cases, <em>L. monocytogenes</em> for 3 percent, and <em>N. meningitidis</em> for 1 percent of cases. In contrast, the majority of meningitis cases that occur after basilar skull fracture or early after otorhinologic surgery care are caused by microorganisms that colonize the nasopharynx, especially <em>S. pneumoniae</em> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-of-bacterial-meningitis-in-adults/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. In another study in adult and pediatric patients with healthcare-associated ventriculitis and meningitis, approximately 80 percent of cases were caused by staphylococci and gram-negative organisms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-of-bacterial-meningitis-in-adults/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>].</p><p>A later report evaluated 6243 consecutive craniotomies performed between 1997 and 1999 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-of-bacterial-meningitis-in-adults/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>].

When comparing patients from periods before and after antimicrobial prophylaxis to prevent wound infection caused by gram-positive bacteria, prophylaxis had no effect on the rate of meningitis but did affect the cause of meningitis: mostly cutaneous organisms without prophylaxis (<em>S. aureus</em>, coagulase-negative staphylococci, and <em>Cutibacterium </em>[formerly <em>Propionibacterium</em>]<em> acnes</em>) compared with mostly noncutaneous organisms with prophylaxis; Enterobacteriaceae and, to a lesser degree, streptococci and <em>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</em> accounted for more cases than coagulase-negative staphylococci, <em>S. aureus</em>, and <em>C. acnes</em>.

Among 38 community-acquired recurrences, 13 were due to <em>S. pneumoniae</em>, four each were due to streptococci and <em>H. influenzae</em>, and three to <em>N. meningitidis</em>. Eleven were culture negative and none was due to gram-negative bacilli. Among 41 nosocomial recurrences, gram-negative bacilli accounted for 19 cases (46 percent), <em>S. aureus</em> for six cases, coagulase-negative staphylococci for three cases, and eight cases were culture negative. In a subsequent review, <em>S. pneumoniae</em> was responsible for 57 percent of cases of recurrent bacterial meningitis, the majority of which were associated with compromised meningeal integrity; causes of compromised meningeal integrity include basilar skull fractures and inner ear abnormalities [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-of-bacterial-meningitis-in-adults/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>].

Despite the effectiveness of current antibiotics in clearing bacteria from the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), bacterial meningitis continues to cause significant morbidity and mortality worldwide. (See <a href=\"#H1\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The frequency of the different etiologic organisms of bacterial meningitis varies with age (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F73706\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef73706 \">table 1</a>). In the United States, following the institution of routine infant immunization with the conjugate <em>Haemophilus influenzae</em> type b vaccine in 1990 and the 7-valent <em>Streptococcus pneumoniae</em> (pneumococcus) conjugate vaccine in 2000 (PCV7) followed by the 13-valent pneumococcal vaccine (PCV13) in 2010, bacterial meningitis has decreased in frequency, and the peak incidence of bacterial meningitis has shifted from children under five years of age to adults.
