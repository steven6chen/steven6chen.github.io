The consequences of lead toxicity have been recognized for millennia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/childhood-lead-poisoning-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Despite this knowledge, lead was included as an ingredient of gasoline in the 1920s and continued to be used in paint in some developed countries until the 1970s [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/childhood-lead-poisoning-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/3,4\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,4</a>]. In many low-income countries, lead in gasoline and industrialized uses of lead (eg, smelters, mines, or refineries) remain major sources of exposure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/childhood-lead-poisoning-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. About 50 percent of the worldwide burden of lead poisoning occurs in Southeast Asia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/childhood-lead-poisoning-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. In 2004, 16 percent of all children in the world were estimated to have blood lead levels (BLLs) &gt;10 <span class=\"nowrap\">mcg/dL</span> (0.48 <span class=\"nowrap\">micromol/L)</span> with 90 percent of children with elevated levels living in low-income regions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/childhood-lead-poisoning-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p>Risk factors, sources, and prevention of childhood lead poisoning include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Risk factors</strong> &ndash; Children younger than six years of age (and particularly those younger than 36 months) are more susceptible to the toxic effects of lead than are adults because they have an incomplete blood-brain barrier that permits the entry of lead into the developing nervous system and because they have a greater prevalence of iron deficiency, which can result from and cause lead poisoning through increased absorption of lead from the gastrointestinal tract [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/childhood-lead-poisoning-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/6-8\" class=\"abstract_t\">6-8</a>]. In addition, they are at greater risk of exposure to lead dust because of crawling, higher respiratory rates, and hand-to-mouth behavior.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">The prevalence of elevated BLLs is highest among inner-city children who live in deteriorating housing that was built before the 1970s or children exposed to lead as a result of industrialized use (eg, aerosolized lead from smelters or refineries or lead in water near mining operations) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/childhood-lead-poisoning-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/1,9,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,9,10</a>]. Lead poisoning is more common among urban than rural children, low-income than middle-income children, and children who live in older housing [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/childhood-lead-poisoning-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/10-15\" class=\"abstract_t\">10-15</a>]. While the prevalence of elevated BLLs has decreased over time, disparities in the geometric mean of BLLs continue when assessing for ethnicity and income level. In the United States, non-Hispanic black children continue to have a statistically higher BLL compared with other populations. In addition, the prevalence of lead poisoning is increased among refugee children who have arrived recently in the United States and among children entering foster care [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/childhood-lead-poisoning-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/16,17\" class=\"abstract_t\">16,17</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Sources</strong> &ndash; Children typically are exposed to environmental lead through ingestion or inhalation. Common sources include chips of paint or lead dust from lead-painted surfaces, food or beverages purchased, stored, or served in lead-soldered cans or lead-glazed pottery, water from lead-soldered plumbing, automobile emissions, or lead-using industry (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F53953\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef53953 \">table 1</a>). Although the United States phased out lead-soldered food cans during the 1980s, imported canned goods may still contain lead [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/childhood-lead-poisoning-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. Less common sources of lead exposure include herbal and folk medications, imported crayons and other toys, mini blinds, cosmetics, jewelry, and imported cookware [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/childhood-lead-poisoning-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/9,15,18\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,15,18</a>]. Adolescents may have an increased risk due to hobbies and occupational exposures in firing ranges and lead dust that accumulates in these facilities [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/childhood-lead-poisoning-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=childhood-lead-poisoning-exposure-and-prevention\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Childhood lead poisoning: Exposure and prevention&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Prevention</strong> &ndash; Removal of the common sources of lead exposure has resulted in declining BLLs in children. As an example, in the United States, as lead was removed from gasoline and paint, the average BLL in children decreased from 16 <span class=\"nowrap\">mcg/dL</span> (0.77 <span class=\"nowrap\">micromol/L)</span> to less than 3 <span class=\"nowrap\">mcg/dL</span> (0.14 <span class=\"nowrap\">micromol/L)</span> in 1991 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/childhood-lead-poisoning-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/11,20\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,20</a>]. This trend in declining BLL in United States children has continued with the estimated geometric mean of 1.3 <span class=\"nowrap\">mcg/dL</span> in 2010 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/childhood-lead-poisoning-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. Residual lead from these and other products remains in the environment because elemental lead cannot be degraded. In many resource-limited parts of the world, lead continues to be used in gasoline, pigment (eg, in paint, cosmetics, and crayons), pottery glaze, solder, cooking vessels, jewelry, toys, and even medications [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/childhood-lead-poisoning-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. These products occasionally are imported into the United States and are potential sources of lead exposure. Although the incidence and severity of lead poisoning in the United States are decreasing, an estimated 450,000 children in the United States were above the reference value of 5 <span class=\"nowrap\">mcg/dL</span> (0.24 <span class=\"nowrap\">micromol/L)</span> in 2012 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/childhood-lead-poisoning-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=childhood-lead-poisoning-exposure-and-prevention#H13\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Childhood lead poisoning: Exposure and prevention&quot;, section on 'Prevention'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h1\">TOXICOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The key aspects determining toxicity are based upon blood lead levels (BLLs), the disposition of lead once it enters the body (toxicokinetics), and molecular toxicology as follows: </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Toxic level</strong> &ndash; No safe or &quot;nontoxic&quot; BLL exists. In the United States, a reference level corresponding to the 97.5<sup>th</sup> percentile of BLLs in US children (5 <span class=\"nowrap\">mcg/dL</span> [0.24 <span class=\"nowrap\">micromol/L]</span> as of 2012) has been adopted [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/childhood-lead-poisoning-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. A similar population-based approach to the definition of a toxic BLL has been adopted by the World Health Organization (WHO) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/childhood-lead-poisoning-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. The toxic BLL in the United States is determined by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) based upon the current understanding of the complications caused by a given concentration of lead in the blood. Between 1970 and 2012, the toxic level or &quot;reference value&quot; was gradually decreased from 60 <span class=\"nowrap\">mcg/dL</span> (2.9 <span class=\"nowrap\">micromol/L)</span> to the 97.5<sup>th</sup> percentile of BLLs in US children (5 <span class=\"nowrap\">mcg/dL</span> [0.24 <span class=\"nowrap\">micromol/L]</span> as of 2012) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F64183\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef64183 \">table 2</a>). The decrease in 1991 was prompted by evidence of cognitive and behavioral effects of low-level lead toxicity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/childhood-lead-poisoning-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/23,24\" class=\"abstract_t\">23,24</a>]. Changes in the definition of the toxic level have been accompanied by changes in policies for screening, treatment, and prevention [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/childhood-lead-poisoning-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=screening-tests-in-children-and-adolescents#H17\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Screening tests in children and adolescents&quot;, section on 'Lead poisoning'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=childhood-lead-poisoning-management\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Childhood lead poisoning: Management&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Toxicokinetics</strong> &ndash; Inorganic lead is not metabolized but is directly absorbed, distributed, and excreted. The absorption of lead depends upon the route of exposure and the age and nutritional status of the exposed individual [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/childhood-lead-poisoning-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. Inhaled lead may either be cleared by cilia resulting in ingestion or retained by the lung (30 to 50 percent) for rapid and complete absorption [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/childhood-lead-poisoning-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. Children absorb a greater proportion of lead from the gastrointestinal tract than do adults (up to 70 percent versus 20 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/childhood-lead-poisoning-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/27,28\" class=\"abstract_t\">27,28</a>]. Fasting, iron deficiency, and calcium deficiency also may increase the gastrointestinal absorption of lead [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/childhood-lead-poisoning-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/9,29,30\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,29,30</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Lead that is absorbed from the gastrointestinal or respiratory tracts is distributed by a three-compartment model to the blood, soft tissues, and bone (trabecular and cortical). The half-life of lead varies depending upon the body compartment and the age of the child [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/childhood-lead-poisoning-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/9,26,31-34\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,26,31-34</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">On average, the half-life in each compartment is:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Blood &ndash; 28 to 36 days</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Soft tissue &ndash; 40 days</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Mineralizing tissues &ndash; Greater than 25 years</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Lead that is not retained in the tissues is excreted by the kidneys or through biliary clearance into the gastrointestinal tract. Children younger than two years of age retain approximately one-half of absorbed lead, whereas adults ultimately retain only 1 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/childhood-lead-poisoning-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. More than 70 percent of the total body burden of lead in children is contained in the mineralized tissues [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/childhood-lead-poisoning-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/9,35\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,35</a>]. Thus, the BLL is not a good reflection of the total body lead burden. In general, the concentration of lead in other organs is comparable to that found in blood. Approximately 99 percent of the lead in blood is bound to red blood cells. The remaining 1 percent, ie, plasma lead, serves as an intermediate in transporting lead from the erythrocytes to other body compartments.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">The lead in mineralizing tissues accumulates in two sub-compartments: a labile compartment that readily exchanges lead with the blood and an inert pool [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/childhood-lead-poisoning-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>]. The inert pool of lead can be mobilized during periods of physiologic stress (eg, pregnancy, lactation, fractures, chronic disease) and represents an endogenous source of lead that can maintain an elevated BLL long after the exogenous exposure source has been removed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/childhood-lead-poisoning-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. Because the body accumulates lead over a lifetime and releases it slowly, lead toxicity may occur without a major acute exposure.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Molecular toxicology</strong> &ndash; Lead is a potent toxic substance with no apparent threshold [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/childhood-lead-poisoning-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>]. Lead interferes with the interactions of divalent cations and sulfhydryl groups. It has widespread physiologic effects because most biochemical reactions are regulated by these agents [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/childhood-lead-poisoning-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/37,38\" class=\"abstract_t\">37,38</a>]. In vitro, many of the reactions in which lead serves as a competitive inhibitor are reversible. However, in vivo, downstream events lead to cell death and irreversible damage, particularly in the central nervous system [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/childhood-lead-poisoning-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/39-41\" class=\"abstract_t\">39-41</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Lead can disrupt signal transduction cascades by activating protein kinase C, competing with magnesium and inhibiting cyclic nucleotide hydrolysis by phosphodiesterases, or inhibiting function at the N-methyl-D-aspartate-type glutamate receptor [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/childhood-lead-poisoning-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/42-45\" class=\"abstract_t\">42-45</a>]. Lead also can uncouple mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation in the central nervous system [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/childhood-lead-poisoning-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/41,46\" class=\"abstract_t\">41,46</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) in individuals with elevated BLLs demonstrates reduction in the <span class=\"nowrap\">N-acetylaspartate/creatine</span> and phosphocreatine ratios in the frontal gray matter, suggesting that lead poisoning affects metabolism in the brain [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/childhood-lead-poisoning-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/47,48\" class=\"abstract_t\">47,48</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Lead competes with calcium for entry into synaptosomes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/childhood-lead-poisoning-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/49\" class=\"abstract_t\">49</a>] and interacts with numerous receptor-activated and voltage-gated cation channels [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/childhood-lead-poisoning-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/50,51\" class=\"abstract_t\">50,51</a>]. In addition, lead increases the infidelity of DNA and RNA polymerase, leading to somatic and germline mutations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/childhood-lead-poisoning-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/52,53\" class=\"abstract_t\">52,53</a>]. Lead-exposed rodents have an increased incidence of cancer [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/childhood-lead-poisoning-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/54-59\" class=\"abstract_t\">54-59</a>]. However, this association has not been found in humans [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/childhood-lead-poisoning-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/60-62\" class=\"abstract_t\">60-62</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Hematologic complications of lead toxicity result from the ability of lead to directly inhibit delta-aminolevulinic acid dehydratase (ALAD), enzymes necessary for heme biosynthesis, and ferrochelatase, a mitochondrial sulfhydryl enzyme causing increased urinary delta-aminolevulinic acid (ALA), urinary coproporphyrin, and erythrocyte zinc protoporphyrin [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/childhood-lead-poisoning-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/63-66\" class=\"abstract_t\">63-66</a>]. The enzymatic blocks responsible are partial. While anemia may not be seen until blood lead concentrations are markedly elevated, the effect on hemoglobin synthesis occurs at lower levels [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/childhood-lead-poisoning-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>ALA dehydratase is inhibited at levels of 10 and 15 <span class=\"nowrap\">mcg/dL</span> (0.48 and 0.72 <span class=\"nowrap\">micromol/L)</span> in children and adults, respectively.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Elevation of erythrocyte protoporphyrin occurs at levels of 30 <span class=\"nowrap\">mcg/dL</span> (1.48 <span class=\"nowrap\">micromol/L)</span>.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Reduced hemoglobin synthesis is found in children at levels of 40 (1.93 <span class=\"nowrap\">micromol/L)</span> and in adults at levels of 50 <span class=\"nowrap\">mcg/dL</span> (2.41 <span class=\"nowrap\">micromol/L),</span> respectively.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">The basophilic stippling of red cells is due to the presence of aggregated ribosomes, which may also include mitochondrial fragments.

The diagnosis usually is made through measurement of an elevated blood lead level (BLL) during routine blood lead screening. False-positive elevation caused by contamination of the fingertip can occur if capillary samples are obtained. (See <a href=\"#H12\" class=\"local\">'Diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Detectable BLLs are associated with irreversible neurocognitive deficits and a lower limit for this toxicity has <strong>not</strong> been established. While many blood lead tests will result below the reference level set by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) (5 <span class=\"nowrap\">mcg/dL</span> [0.24 <span class=\"nowrap\">micromol/L]),</span> there is no safe lead level and none should be considered &quot;normal&quot;. (See <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'Neurologic'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Management decisions should be based upon confirmation of results through venous blood samples that are collected in lead-free tubes. Specific treatment of childhood lead poisoning depends upon the degree of the blood lead elevation, the presence of symptoms, and local resources available for lead abatement. (See <a href=\"#H20\" class=\"local\">'Lead levels'</a> above and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=childhood-lead-poisoning-management\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Childhood lead poisoning: Management&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In patients with elevated BLLs, screening for iron deficiency anemia should also occur (eg, complete blood count, ferritin, and C-reactive protein).
