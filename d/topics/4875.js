While an active fetus is a reassuring sign that the fetus is alive and in good condition, the use of fetal kick counting as a fetal surveillance tool has not achieved widespread acceptance. This is, in part, because optimal methods of diagnosis, evaluation, and management of DFM have not been determined. This topic will review normal fetal movement and provide the author&rsquo;s approach to diagnosis, evaluation, and management of DFM. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">NORMAL FETAL MOVEMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Sonographically, fetal activity can be noted as early as 7 to 8 weeks of gestation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/decreased-fetal-movement-diagnosis-evaluation-and-management/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Maternal perception of fetal movement typically begins in the second trimester at around 16 to 20 weeks of gestation and occurs earlier in parous women than nulliparous women [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/decreased-fetal-movement-diagnosis-evaluation-and-management/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. The mother's first perception of fetal movement, termed &quot;quickening,&quot; is often described as a gentle flutter [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/decreased-fetal-movement-diagnosis-evaluation-and-management/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].</p><p>In the second and third trimesters, sonography reveals a wide range of movements of the fetal trunk (eg, bending, startle, hiccup, breathing, rotation), limbs (eg, stretch, hand to face, opening and closing of hands), and face and head (eg, head rotation, suck, yawn, tongue protrusion). When sonographically detected movements were correlated with maternal perception, approximately 50 percent of isolated limb movements were perceived by the mother, whereas 80 percent of movements involving both the trunk and limb were perceived in one study [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/decreased-fetal-movement-diagnosis-evaluation-and-management/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. In a literature review, mothers perceived 33 to 88 percent of sonographically visualized fetal movements [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/decreased-fetal-movement-diagnosis-evaluation-and-management/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].</p><p>Fetal movement increases throughout day, with peak activity late at night [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/decreased-fetal-movement-diagnosis-evaluation-and-management/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. The frequency of fetal movement in normal pregnancy is probably constant throughout the third trimester [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/decreased-fetal-movement-diagnosis-evaluation-and-management/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]; however, the quality of perceived movements changes. Although some studies report that fetal activity normally decreases near term, this is likely due to counting during fetal quiet cycles, which become longer with advancing gestation, or inclusion of high-risk pregnancies. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H949577412\"><span class=\"h1\">PREVALENCE OF DECREASED FETAL MOVEMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>At least 40 percent of pregnant women become concerned about DFM one or more times during pregnancy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/decreased-fetal-movement-diagnosis-evaluation-and-management/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. Most cases are transient. Four to 15 percent of pregnant women will contact their care provider because of persistent DFM in the third trimester [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/decreased-fetal-movement-diagnosis-evaluation-and-management/abstract/8-11\" class=\"abstract_t\">8-11</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H949577522\"><span class=\"h1\">PATHOPHYSIOLOGY AND SIGNIFICANCE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Normal quantity and quality of fetal movement and other types of fetal biophysical activity (breathing movements, tone) virtually ensures functional integrity of fetal regulatory systems. When these regulatory systems are subjected to mild hypoxemia, DFM is believed to represent a compensatory fetal behavioral response, analogous to the compensatory physiological response of redistribution of blood flow to essential organs. As hypoxemia becomes more severe and prolonged, compensatory responses may fail to protect the fetus, eventually leading to fetal injury or death. </p><p>Maternal perception of DFM is an indicator for pregnancies at increased risk of adverse outcomes. In a prospective, population-based registry of 2313 women with third trimester singleton pregnancies with DFM who presented to healthcare facilities in Norway, many of these fetuses were dead at presentation, and mortality among those who presented with a live fetus was higher than that of the general obstetrical population: 8.<span class=\"nowrap\">2/1000</span> births versus 2.<span class=\"nowrap\">9/1000</span> births [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/decreased-fetal-movement-diagnosis-evaluation-and-management/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. In addition to death, 22 percent of third trimester DFM has been associated with poor outcomes, including impaired fetal growth, preterm birth, neonatal depression, and emergency delivery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/decreased-fetal-movement-diagnosis-evaluation-and-management/abstract/12,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,13</a>]. Fetal growth restriction appears to be a major factor contributing to the increased risk of adverse neonatal outcome in pregnancies with DFM [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/decreased-fetal-movement-diagnosis-evaluation-and-management/abstract/14-16\" class=\"abstract_t\">14-16</a>]. </p><p>Early recognition of DFM may provide an opportunity for identifying fetuses that may be compromised and could benefit from intervention, usually delivery, and thereby prevent possible progression to <span class=\"nowrap\">fetal/neonatal</span> injury or death. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">DIAGNOSIS OF DECREASED FETAL MOVEMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Although there is no consensus on diagnosis of DFM, we consider qualitative (subjective) maternal perception of a reduction of fetal movement diagnostic. The best diagnostic criteria are controversial because the level of fetal movement that reliably distinguishes a healthy fetus from a fetus at increased risk of adverse outcome has not been determined [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/decreased-fetal-movement-diagnosis-evaluation-and-management/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. Furthermore, there is no evidence that any quantitative alarm limit is more effective than qualitative maternal perception of DFM for identifying fetuses at risk of adverse outcome. This is due to wide biologic variation in normal fetal movement among healthy fetuses, as well as the wide variation in maternal perception of fetal activity. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H949577271\"><span class=\"h2\">Our approach</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Our approach reflects the clinical practice guideline for the management of women who report decreased fetal movements consensus document developed by Mater Research, The Stillbirth Foundation, the Perinatal Society of Australia and New Zealand, and the International Stillbirth Alliance [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/decreased-fetal-movement-diagnosis-evaluation-and-management/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. It is intended for management of women with singleton pregnancies in the third trimester:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Recommendation 1: All pregnant women should routinely be provided verbal and written information regarding normal fetal movements during the antenatal period, including a description of normal wake and sleep cycles, the changing patterns and types of movement as the fetus develops, and factors that may modify their perception of fetal movement, such as placental position. This information helps women understand their baby's normal movement patterns.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Recommendation 2: All women should be regularly advised to contact their health care provider if they have any concerns about DFM movements and should not wait until the next day.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Recommendation 3: After discussion, women who remain unsure whether movements are decreased should be given guidance on counting fetal movements, ie, count while lying down on her side and concentrating on fetal movements. As a rule, if she perceives fewer than 10 movements in two hours, she should contact her health care provider. However, maternal concern of DFM over-rides any specific definition of DFM. </p><p/><p>Some patients and providers prefer to use a form for documenting daily movements. Forms provide an ongoing record of fetal movement for day-to-day and week-to-week comparisons [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/decreased-fetal-movement-diagnosis-evaluation-and-management/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>].</p><p>In the second trimester, the prevalence and significance of DFM are largely unknown. We believe a prudent and pragmatic approach is for women over 24 weeks of gestation to contact their provider if they perceive a significant and persistent reduction in fetal movement from baseline, similar to the approach in the third trimester. If a woman presents with DFM before 24 weeks of gestation, she should undergo routine antenatal evaluation, including auscultation for the fetal heartbeat [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/decreased-fetal-movement-diagnosis-evaluation-and-management/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H949577277\"><span class=\"h2\">Kick counts</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Kick counts are a quantitative alternative to our qualitative approach to assessment of fetal activity. The minimum number of maternally perceived fetal movements consistent with fetal well-being has been termed the &quot;alarm limit.&quot; Various methods for defining an alarm limit have been proposed; the following are four examples of thresholds for reassurance of fetal well-being [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/decreased-fetal-movement-diagnosis-evaluation-and-management/abstract/6,21-27\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,21-27</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Perception of least 10 fetal movements (FMs) over up to two hours when the mother is at rest and focused on counting (&quot;count to 10&quot; method)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Perception of at least 10 FMs during 12 hours of normal maternal activity</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Perception of at least 4 FMs in one hour when the mother is at rest and focused on counting</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Perception of at least 10 FMs within 25 minutes in pregnancies 22 to 36 weeks and 35 minutes in pregnancies 37 or more weeks of gestation</p><p/><p>The &quot;count to 10&quot; method is the only alarm limit derived from a population study and subsequently evaluated as a screening test in the same population [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/decreased-fetal-movement-diagnosis-evaluation-and-management/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. In this study, the mean time interval to detect 10 FMs was 20.9 <span class=\"nowrap\">+/-</span> 18.1 minutes. Failure to meet the 10 FM threshold within two hours prompted intervention, leading to a threefold increase in intervention for DFM and a reduction in fetal mortality among patients with DFM (from 44 per 1000 to 10 per 1000). This method has a high compliance and acceptance rate among women because it is easy to perform, convenient, and does not take much time [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/decreased-fetal-movement-diagnosis-evaluation-and-management/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]; it is also clinically practical. However, a prospective cohort study of &ldquo;time to count 10 fetal movements&rdquo; in a Norwegian population did not demonstrate significant differences in the mean time to count 10 FMs between pregnancies with suboptimal outcomes and those with normal outcomes, indicating more research is needed on the optimum method for assessing DFM [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/decreased-fetal-movement-diagnosis-evaluation-and-management/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H949578102\"><span class=\"h1\">DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Transient decreases in fetal activity can be due to fetal sleep states, maternal medications that cross the placenta (eg, sedatives), or maternal smoking. Fetal sleep is a common and benign cause of DFM. Sleep cycles may last up to 40 minutes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/decreased-fetal-movement-diagnosis-evaluation-and-management/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. In a study that observed late preterm fetuses from uncomplicated pregnancies for 100 minutes, quiet sleep (no eye movements, no somatic movements except for the occasional startle, and a fetal heart rate pattern with little baseline variability) occurred at least once in 30 percent of fetuses, but 96 percent of the fetuses cycled between quiet sleep and active states during the period of observation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/decreased-fetal-movement-diagnosis-evaluation-and-management/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. </p><p>Poor maternal perception of fetal activity is another reason for maternal report of DFM. It may be due to early gestational age, <span class=\"nowrap\">decreased/increased</span> amniotic fluid volume, maternal position (sitting or standing versus lying), fetal position (anterior position of the fetal spine), anterior placenta, maternal physical activity, or the mother just being mentally distracted [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/decreased-fetal-movement-diagnosis-evaluation-and-management/abstract/2,4,8,31,32\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,4,8,31,32</a>]. Although obesity has been reported to decrease maternal perception of fetal activity, a systematic review found that increased maternal body size was not associated with altered perception of fetal movement, but was associated with increased presentation for DFM [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/decreased-fetal-movement-diagnosis-evaluation-and-management/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>]. However, the evidence was very low quality.</p><p>In a study of fetal movements before confirmation of fetal death, some women interpreted contractions as fetal movement [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/decreased-fetal-movement-diagnosis-evaluation-and-management/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>]. </p><p>Because these entities cannot be differentiated from pathologic causes of DFM without further evaluation, a sudden decrease in fetal movement should be evaluated as a potential marker of fetal compromise [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/decreased-fetal-movement-diagnosis-evaluation-and-management/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h1\">EVALUATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Randomized trials have not compared approaches for the evaluation and management of women with DFM. Clinical approaches described in observational studies include: physical examination, nonstress or contraction stress tests, ultrasound examination (biophysical profile [BPP]), umbilical artery Doppler, testing for fetomaternal hemorrhage (eg, Kleihauer-Betke test), and amnioscopy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/decreased-fetal-movement-diagnosis-evaluation-and-management/abstract/10,36\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,36</a>]. The wide range of diagnostic approaches reflects efforts to detect acute and chronic fetal hypoxemia and other fetal pathologies (eg, infection, neuromuscular disease) associated with DFM.</p><p>The presentation of a woman with DFM should prompt a thorough evaluation of the current complaint and maternal, obstetric, and fetal risk factors for adverse outcome. The goal of the evaluation is to rule out imminent fetal demise and to try to determine the cause of DFM, such as fetal growth restriction with decreasing placental function. A plan of care is formulated based on the results of the evaluation.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H949578283\"><span class=\"h2\">Initial evaluation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>We suggest the following basic initial evaluation:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Fetal viability should be determined by documenting the fetal heart rate.

In a series of 2313 women with DFM in a Norwegian database, the NST was nonreactive or showed other nonreassuring patterns in 4 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/decreased-fetal-movement-diagnosis-evaluation-and-management/abstract/8,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,10</a>].

Ultrasound examination is performed within 24 hours to reassess fetal well-being unless the patient reports that the fetus is active and &ldquo;back to normal&rdquo; after a reactive nonstress test. Ultrasound examination should include assessment of fetal activity, breathing, tone, and amniotic fluid volume, as well as fetal growth and anatomic survey if not recently performed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/decreased-fetal-movement-diagnosis-evaluation-and-management/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>]. Growth restriction has been associated with a decrease in the number, quality, strength, and duration of fetal movements and repeated episodes of DFM at term [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/decreased-fetal-movement-diagnosis-evaluation-and-management/abstract/39,40\" class=\"abstract_t\">39,40</a>]. This is not surprising since the fetus depends on the placenta for both oxygen and nutrients, thus chronic placental insufficiency can affect both fetal oxygenation and fetal growth.</p><p>In Norwegian series, women randomly assigned to perform fetal movement counting had higher detection of fetal growth restriction than women who received usual care (20 of 23 fetuses [87.0 percent] versus 12 of 20 fetuses [60.0 percent], respectively; relative risk 1.5, 95% CI 1.0-2.1) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/decreased-fetal-movement-diagnosis-evaluation-and-management/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>]. Ultrasound examination detected an abnormality (eg, fetal growth restriction, oligohydramnios, polyhydramnios, congenital anomaly, low biophysical profile score) in 12.6 percent of all consultations for DFM [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/decreased-fetal-movement-diagnosis-evaluation-and-management/abstract/8,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,10</a>] and the population of pregnancies affected by DFM had birth weight percentiles skewed downwards at all gestational ages. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14\"><span class=\"h3\">Doppler velocimetry</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Doppler velocimetry is restricted to pregnancies in which fetal growth restriction has been identified on ultrasound examination, as no benefit has been demonstrated with routine examination of all pregnancies with DFM [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/decreased-fetal-movement-diagnosis-evaluation-and-management/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>]. In a series from Norway, Doppler demonstrated a pathological pattern in 1 percent of the 1151 cases evaluated at hospitals that performed Doppler on most patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/decreased-fetal-movement-diagnosis-evaluation-and-management/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. Most of these abnormalities were associated with growth restricted fetuses. When small for gestational age infants (birth weight less than the 10th percentile) and cases with nonreactive NSTs or abnormal ultrasound examination were excluded, Doppler velocimetry was abnormal in only 1 of 940 cases.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15\"><span class=\"h3\">Testing for fetomaternal transfusion</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>We suggest performing a maternal assay (Kleihauer-Betke stain or flow cytometry) to detect fetomaternal hemorrhage as part of the evaluation of the pregnant woman who presents with both DFM and signs of fetal anemia, such as a sinusoidal fetal heart rate pattern, unexplained fetal tachycardia, or fetal hydrops on ultrasound examination associated with elevated middle cerebral artery Doppler velocity. </p><p>A large fetomaternal transfusion (FMT) is estimated to occur in 0.3 percent of pregnancies and is a significant contributor to stillbirth [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/decreased-fetal-movement-diagnosis-evaluation-and-management/abstract/43\" class=\"abstract_t\">43</a>]. Although testing for FMT in all cases of DFM has been suggested, DFM due to a large FMT is rare.

Thirty-three women had DFM as their only symptom. Fetal movement was absent in 17 cases for a period ranging from 24 hours to 7 days. In this group, six infants survived, five were stillborn, and five died in the neonatal period. However, the number of mothers who experienced DFM in this series was not well-documented.

Counseling women about monitoring fetal activity is problematic if they have poor perception of fetal movement. We discuss the advantages and disadvantages of continued antepartum evaluation but suggest induction after 37 weeks, especially if there are additional risk factors for adverse outcome.

Formal rather than discretionary fetal movement counting appeared to identify fetuses at risk for intrauterine growth restriction or death, but this did not lead to a reduction in perinatal mortality. Reasons for the lack of benefit include clinical error, patient delay in reporting decreased fetal movement, and relying on other fetal evaluations that were falsely reassuring (eg, confirming that the fetal heart rate was in the normal range without performing a nonstress test or biophysical profile). Nonrandomized studies of interventions to enhance maternal awareness of decreased fetal movement tend to report reductions in perinatal death compared with standard care [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/decreased-fetal-movement-diagnosis-evaluation-and-management/abstract/55\" class=\"abstract_t\">55</a>].</p><p>The counseling and evaluation strategy described above has been implemented as a quality improvement project in Eastern Norway.

The stillbirth rate in the overall study population fell from 3.<span class=\"nowrap\">0/1000</span> to 2.<span class=\"nowrap\">0/1000</span> (OR 0.67, 95% CI 0.48-0.93). </p><p>The encouraging findings of the quality improvement project in Norway [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/decreased-fetal-movement-diagnosis-evaluation-and-management/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>] require confirmation. More research on fetal movement monitoring is needed, including assessment of the sensitivity and specificity of fetal movement counting for detecting fetal compromise, the effectiveness of fetal movement counting for decreasing perinatal mortality in high-risk and low-risk pregnancies, and the ease and consequences of implementing clinical practice guidelines for DFM in maternity hospitals worldwide.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H19\"><span class=\"h1\">SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We base the diagnosis of decreased fetal movement (DFM) on qualitative (subjective) maternal perception of a reduction of fetal movement. Patients are instructed to contact their healthcare provider within 12 hours for further evaluation if they perceive a significant and persistent reduction in fetal movement and never to wait longer than two hours if there is <strong>absent</strong> fetal movement. If the woman is in doubt about what constitutes DFM, we instruct her in the kick count method of assessing fetal activity and ask that she call her provider if she counts fewer than 10 kicks over two consecutive hours at times when the fetus is usually active and she is lying on her side (not supine) and focused upon counting. (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Diagnosis of decreased fetal movement'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Our basic evaluation of pregnancies complicated by DFM includes review of the prenatal record for risk factors for adverse pregnancy outcome and a nonstress test. We obtain an ultrasound examination within 24 to 48 hours to reassess fetal well-being unless the patient reports that the fetus is active and &ldquo;back to normal&rdquo; after a reactive nonstress test. Ultrasound examination should include assessment of fetal activity, breathing, tone, and amniotic fluid volume, as well as fetal growth and anatomic survey if not recently performed. We also make a follow up phone call to the patient to enquire if she has ongoing concerns about fetal movement. (See <a href=\"#H13\" class=\"local\">'Ultrasound examination'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Doppler velocimetry is restricted to pregnancies suspected of fetal growth restriction or fetal anemia. (See <a href=\"#H14\" class=\"local\">'Doppler velocimetry'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Testing for fetomaternal hemorrhage is restricted to pregnancies with signs of fetal anemia. (See <a href=\"#H15\" class=\"local\">'Testing for fetomaternal transfusion'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Management of patients with persistent DFM depends on the gestational age and the presence of other identifiable risk factors for stillbirth. If no cause for persistent DFM is determined, we suggest monitoring pregnancies &lt;37 weeks of gestation with nonstress testing and ultrasound examination twice weekly. Given the diminishing hazard of induction after 37 weeks of gestation and the possibility that delivery may be beneficial, we suggest labor induction of these pregnancies when the cervix is favorable (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). (See <a href=\"#H16\" class=\"local\">'Pregnancy management'</a> above.)</p></div><div id=\"topicAgreement\">Use of UpToDate is subject to the <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/legal/license\" class=\"licenseLink\" id=\"sla_in_page\">Subscription and License Agreement</a>.</div><div id=\"references\" class=\"headingAnchor\"><h1>REFERENCES</h1><ol id=\"reference\"><li><a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/decreased-fetal-movement-diagnosis-evaluation-and-management/abstract/1\" class=\"nounderline abstract_t\">de Vries JI, Fong BF.
