The diagnosis and management of third nerve palsy varies according to the age of the patient, characteristics of the third nerve palsy, and the presence of associated signs and symptoms.</p><p>The manifestations and diagnosis of third nerve palsy in adults will be reviewed here. Third nerve palsy in children and other causes of diplopia, ptosis, and anisocoria are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=third-cranial-nerve-oculomotor-nerve-palsy-in-children\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Third cranial nerve (oculomotor nerve) palsy in children&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-diplopia\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of diplopia&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-ptosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of ptosis&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=approach-to-the-patient-with-anisocoria\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Approach to the patient with anisocoria&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">ANATOMY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The third cranial nerve supplies the levator muscle of the eyelid and four extraocular muscles: the medial rectus, superior rectus, inferior rectus, and inferior oblique. These muscles adduct, depress, and elevate the eye. The superior oblique muscle is innervated by cranial nerve IV and the lateral rectus muscle by cranial nerve VI. In addition, the third cranial nerve constricts the pupil through its parasympathetic fibers that supply the smooth muscle of the ciliary body and the sphincter of the iris.</p><p>The third nerve begins as a nucleus in the midbrain that consists of several subnuclei that innervate the individual extraocular muscles, the eyelids, and the pupils. Each subnucleus, except the superior rectus subnucleus, supplies the ipsilateral muscle.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The superior rectus subnucleus innervates the contralateral superior rectus muscle</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The levator subnucleus is a single central caudate nucleus and innervates both levator palpebrae superioris muscles (which control the eyelids)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The parasympathetic pupil nucleus (Edinger-Westphal nuclei) controls pupil constriction</p><p/><p>The third nerve fascicle leaves the nucleus and passes ventrally near important structures in the midbrain (eg, red nucleus, corticospinal tract). The third nerve then enters the subarachnoid space, passes into the lateral wall of the cavernous sinus, and finally divides into superior and inferior branches as it enters the superior orbital fissure in the orbit to innervate the extraocular muscles (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F76281\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef76281 \">figure 1</a>).</p><p>The superior division of the third nerve supplies the levator palpebrae and the superior rectus, while the inferior division supplies the medial and inferior rectus muscles, the inferior oblique, and the pupillary sphincter. Because the fibers are topographically organized within the third nerve fascicle and nerve, a pattern of deficits that represents a divisional palsy is not helpful in anatomic localization [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/third-cranial-nerve-oculomotor-nerve-palsy-in-adults/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL MANIFESTATIONS</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">General features</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients with an acute acquired third nerve palsy usually complain of the sudden onset of binocular horizontal, vertical, or oblique diplopia and a droopy eyelid. Infrequently, the patient is aware of an enlarged pupil. Patients with chronic third nerve palsies (especially with primary aberrant regeneration) may be asymptomatic. Pain accompanying the onset of third nerve palsy is common, except in midbrain lesions, and is not useful to distinguish among etiologies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/third-cranial-nerve-oculomotor-nerve-palsy-in-adults/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Sudden, severe pain (&quot;the worst headache of my life&quot;) might suggest subarachnoid hemorrhage due to a ruptured aneurysm as the cause of the third nerve palsy. Severe pain may also be present in inflammatory lesions or pituitary apoplexy, but mild or moderate pain is also common in ischemic lesions.</p><p>On examination, patients with a complete nonpupil-sparing third nerve palsy have ptosis, a large unreactive pupil, and paralysis of adduction, elevation, and depression. The eye rests in a position of abduction, slight depression, and intorsion &quot;down and out&quot; (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F77466\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef77466 \">picture 1</a>)&nbsp;[<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/third-cranial-nerve-oculomotor-nerve-palsy-in-adults/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].</p><p>In partial lesions, the pupil may be of normal size and normally reactive (no internal dysfunction), dilated and poorly reactive (partial internal dysfunction), or dilated and non-reactive to light and near stimulus (complete internal dysfunction). The asymmetry of pupil size is greater in the light than in the dark. There may be complete or incomplete involvement of the extraocular muscles (external dysfunction) innervated by the third nerve, producing varying degrees of ptosis as well as weakness of ipsilateral adduction (medial rectus), elevation (superior rectus, inferior oblique), <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> depression (inferior rectus). A partial third nerve palsy with a normal pupil, ptosis, and restricted upgaze is shown (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F69413\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef69413 \">picture 2</a>).</p><p>The remainder of the clinical presentation varies depending upon the location and type of lesion (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F56375\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef56375 \">table 1</a>).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h3\">Classification</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>For the purposes of clinical evaluation, we classify third nerve palsies as neurologically isolated or neurologically non-isolated according to the presence of other neurologic deficits or systemic symptoms. We further characterize neurologically isolated lesions as having normal internal function (pupil-sparing) or abnormal internal function (nonpupil-sparing). Complete external dysfunction is identified when there is impairment of the majority of function of all the somatic branches of the oculomotor nerve and ptosis is complete or almost complete; otherwise the external dysfunction is incomplete (eg, divisional palsy).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Midbrain lesions</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Lesions of the third nerve nucleus are rare and are usually associated with other neurologic deficits localized to the midbrain. The most characteristic finding of a nuclear lesion is a complete unilateral third nerve palsy with weakness of both the ipsilateral and contralateral superior rectus (because the superior rectus subnucleus is crossed) and bilateral, incomplete ptosis. The levator palpebrae superioris muscles are controlled by a single central subnucleus. Thus, in patients with nuclear lesions, if ptosis is present, it is bilateral.</p><p>Other patterns of third nerve deficits can be seen occur in nuclear lesions, including bilateral third nerve palsies with sparing of the eyelids and isolated bilateral ptosis with sparing of the extraocular muscles and pupils. Nuclear third nerve palsies can occasionally be associated with ipsilateral ptosis and contralateral eyelid retraction (plus-minus lid syndrome) if supranuclear inhibitory input to the third nerve is disrupted and ptosis from a fascicular lesion on the contralateral side occurs.</p><p>Nuclear lesions can also cause isolated extraocular muscle involvement. However, unilateral or bilateral isolated medial rectus paralysis is unlikely to be caused by a nuclear lesion because medial rectus neurons probably lie at three different locations within the oculomotor nucleus. For this reason, patients with presumed isolated medial rectus paresis should be evaluated for internuclear ophthalmoplegia. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=internuclear-ophthalmoparesis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Internuclear ophthalmoparesis&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Nuclear lesions that are caused by infarction are often accompanied by lesions of the third nerve fascicle because both structures are supplied by the paramedian branches of the basilar artery.</p><p>A nuclear or fascicular third nerve lesion almost always occurs with other neurologic signs or symptoms, which identifies the midbrain location of the lesion:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Contralateral ataxia will be present if the red <span class=\"nowrap\">nucleus/superior</span> cerebellar peduncle is involved</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Cerebellar tremor may be present in Claude syndrome (ipsilateral third nerve palsy and contralateral cerebellar signs)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Contralateral hemiparesis may be present in a cerebral peduncle lesion (Weber syndrome)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Contralateral choreiform movements or tremor are present when red <span class=\"nowrap\">nucleus/substantia</span> nigra involvement occurs (Benedikt syndrome)</p><p/><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Subarachnoid space</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Isolated third nerve palsies often localize to a lesion within the subarachnoid space. In adults, extra-axial third nerve palsies usually are caused by ischemia. In contrast, ischemia is a rare cause for third nerve palsy in children. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=third-cranial-nerve-oculomotor-nerve-palsy-in-children\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Third cranial nerve (oculomotor nerve) palsy in children&quot;</a>.) In addition to ischemia, other causes include aneurysmal compression, infection, inflammation, neoplasia, uncal herniation, and trauma (including neurosurgical procedures) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F56375\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef56375 \">table 1</a>).</p><p>The clinical features of lesions in this area are to some extent specific to etiology:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Inflammatory, infectious, and neoplastic disorders affecting the meninges will often produce other cranial nerve deficits along with a third nerve palsy; otherwise these lesions are typically neurologically isolated.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Ischemic third nerve lesions typically present with intact pupillary function (80 to 90 percent of cases), probably because of the lack of damage to the superficial periphery of the third nerve where the majority of pupillomotor fibers are thought to pass [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/third-cranial-nerve-oculomotor-nerve-palsy-in-adults/abstract/4-11\" class=\"abstract_t\">4-11</a>]. When the pupil is involved, impairment is usually incomplete [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/third-cranial-nerve-oculomotor-nerve-palsy-in-adults/abstract/5,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,12</a>]. In one series of 26 patients with ischemic third nerve palsy, most patients with impaired pupillary function had only mild anisocoria (&lt;1 mm) and none had a fully dilated pupil [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/third-cranial-nerve-oculomotor-nerve-palsy-in-adults/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In contrast, aneurysmal compression of the superficial pupil fibers of the third nerve in the subarachnoid space usually results in a dilated and unresponsive pupil. However, aneurysms can rarely present without pupil involvement, especially if there is incomplete external dysfunction (eg, divisional palsy). When there is incomplete external dysfunction, the lack of pupil involvement does not have the same diagnostic significance as true pupil-sparing in the setting of a third nerve palsy with complete external dysfunction.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Signs of aberrant regeneration or oculomotor synkinesis are common with lesions caused by nerve compression or after trauma and are rare with ischemic lesions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/third-cranial-nerve-oculomotor-nerve-palsy-in-adults/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. These signs include lid retraction with adduction or down-gaze, globe retraction <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> adduction with attempted vertical gaze, and pupil constriction with eye movement using third nerve-innervated muscles [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/third-cranial-nerve-oculomotor-nerve-palsy-in-adults/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Spontaneous improvement of symptoms should not be reassuring in regards to diagnosis; this has been described with aneurysmal lesions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/third-cranial-nerve-oculomotor-nerve-palsy-in-adults/abstract/15,16\" class=\"abstract_t\">15,16</a>].</p><p/><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Cavernous sinus lesions</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Lesions of the third nerve in the cavernous sinus and superior orbital fissure often involve other cranial nerves and have the following clinical manifestations:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Fourth cranial nerve - vertical diplopia (look for lack of intorsion in downgaze in a patient with complete third nerve palsy and possible fourth nerve deficit)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Sixth cranial nerve - horizontal diplopia; esotropia (inward deviation)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>First (ophthalmic) branch of the trigeminal nerve - pain or numbness</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Oculosympathetic fibers - Horner syndrome (look for a smaller pupil on the side of the third nerve palsy)</p><p/><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h2\">Superior orbital fissure/Orbital lesions</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Lesions within the orbit that produce third-nerve dysfunction usually produce other orbital signs, including optic neuropathy, chemosis, conjunctival injection or chemosis, and proptosis.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h1\">ETIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Etiologies of third nerve palsies are specific to the location (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F56375\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef56375 \">table 1</a>). These include a wide variety of pathologies, including structural lesions, cerebrovascular disease, inflammatory or infectious conditions, and trauma. In this regard, a few deserve specific comment.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Intracranial aneurysm &mdash; The most dreaded cause of a third nerve palsy is compression by an enlarging intracranial aneurysm. The most common site of an aneurysm causing a third nerve palsy is the posterior communicating artery; however, aneurysms involving the internal carotid artery and basilar artery are reported to produce third nerve palsies as well [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/third-cranial-nerve-oculomotor-nerve-palsy-in-adults/abstract/17-20\" class=\"abstract_t\">17-20</a>]. In the setting of an acute third nerve palsy, the aneurysm is believed to be acutely enlarging and therefore at risk of imminent rupture. In this setting, subarachnoid hemorrhage can occur within hours or days of initial presentation of the third nerve palsy. The mean age of presentation of aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage is 55 years; however, aneurysms have been reported in young children and in the elderly.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Ischemia &mdash; Ischemic third nerve palsies, also called diabetic third nerve palsies, are the most common etiologic subset of third nerve palsy in adults. The pathogenesis is felt to be microvascular; hypertension and advanced age are also risk factors. While some isolated ischemic third nerve palsies are due to midbrain infarction, most are peripheral [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/third-cranial-nerve-oculomotor-nerve-palsy-in-adults/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Trauma &mdash; Traumatic third nerve palsy usually arises only from severe blows to the head, with skull fracture <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> loss of consciousness [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/third-cranial-nerve-oculomotor-nerve-palsy-in-adults/abstract/14,22,23\" class=\"abstract_t\">14,22,23</a>]. Thus, a third nerve palsy associated with mild head trauma should prompt evaluation for associated pathology.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Migraine &mdash; Ophthalmoplegic 'migraine,' a condition affecting children and young adults, was reclassified as a cranial neuralgia in the revised International Headache Society (IHS) headache classification system published in 2004 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/third-cranial-nerve-oculomotor-nerve-palsy-in-adults/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. This most commonly affects the third cranial nerve, sometimes with permanent deficits [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/third-cranial-nerve-oculomotor-nerve-palsy-in-adults/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. Several cases have been reported in which ophthalmoplegic 'migraine' is associated with MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) gadolinium enhancement of the cisternal segment of the affected cranial nerve in patients with a typical clinical presentation, suggesting that the condition may be a recurrent demyelinating neuropathy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/third-cranial-nerve-oculomotor-nerve-palsy-in-adults/abstract/26-29\" class=\"abstract_t\">26-29</a>].</p><p/><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h1\">DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Several conditions can mimic the extraocular dysfunction of third nerve palsy.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>While often considered, third nerve palsy is extremely unlikely to be the cause of isolated mydriasis. Tonic pupil, iris sphincter damage, and pharmacologic mydriasis should be specifically excluded by careful neuroophthalmologic evaluation and pharmacologic testing in this setting. A complete evaluation of the lid and the ocular motility should also be performed to insure that the anisocoria is an isolated finding. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=approach-to-the-patient-with-anisocoria\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Approach to the patient with anisocoria&quot;</a>.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Orbital disease, eg, orbital fracture, tumor, and inflammation, can affect the extraocular muscles directly. Forced ductions, passive rotation of the eyes with ophthalmic forceps, might confirm the restrictive nature of the ophthalmoplegia caused by these problems.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Myasthenia gravis can mimic any painless, pupil-sparing ophthalmoplegia and should be considered in every patient with a pupil-sparing third nerve palsy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/third-cranial-nerve-oculomotor-nerve-palsy-in-adults/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. Other signs of myasthenia gravis, such as ptosis, variability, and fatigue, usually are present. The &quot;ice test&quot; (a two-minute application of ice to the eyelid with ptosis) may help to differentiate myasthenia from other causes of ptosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/third-cranial-nerve-oculomotor-nerve-palsy-in-adults/abstract/31-33\" class=\"abstract_t\">31-33</a>]. A positive test (&ge;2 mm improvement in ptosis) was 80 percent sensitive and 100 percent specific in one study [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/third-cranial-nerve-oculomotor-nerve-palsy-in-adults/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>].

Usually it is associated with other posterior fossa signs (eg, other cranial neuropathies, hemisensory loss, or hemiparesis). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-diplopia\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of diplopia&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h1\">EVALUATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The evaluation of the patient with a third nerve palsy depends on associated symptoms and signs and the pattern of oculomotor nerve involvement, both of which help to localize the lesion anatomically (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F56375\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef56375 \">table 1</a>). The age of the patient and other historical features also help to distinguish congenital, traumatic, or infectious conditions. Inflammatory and neoplastic conditions have a more insidious onset compared with cerebral infarction.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h2\">Nonisolated third nerve palsy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Third nerve palsies that are accompanied by other neurologic deficits, orbital signs, or meningismus require an evaluation that usually includes neuroimaging. A lumbar puncture (LP) may also be required to evaluate for possible infectious, inflammatory, or carcinomatous meningitis.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A brain magnetic resonance imaging study (MRI) is indicated for patients with findings suggesting a lesion of the nerve's nuclear or fascicular course within the brainstem. These findings include bilateral ptosis, contralateral superior rectus palsy, hemiparesis, ataxia, and tremor. (See <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'Midbrain lesions'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Accompanying meningeal signs (eg, headache, stiff neck, and depressed level of consciousness) or other cranial nerve involvement, especially if bilateral, should prompt evaluation of the cerebrospinal fluid by LP for possible meningitis.

The emergent work-up should include head computed tomography (CT) without contrast looking for blood in the subarachnoid space. If the head CT is unrevealing, LP should be performed to exclude subarachnoid hemorrhage. In the absence of subarachnoid hemorrhage, testing should be performed to exclude an unruptured intracranial aneurysm. (See <a href=\"#H14\" class=\"local\">'Isolated third nerve palsy'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Signs that localize to the cavernous sinus or orbital apex indicate a brain MRI with gadolinium&nbsp;[<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/third-cranial-nerve-oculomotor-nerve-palsy-in-adults/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>].

Considerations include the extent of internal and external third nerve dysfunction, the age of the patient, and medical comorbidity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/third-cranial-nerve-oculomotor-nerve-palsy-in-adults/abstract/12,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,14</a>]. While a selective approach to imaging is presented here, some clinicians recommend neuroimaging for all third nerve palsies regardless of pupil involvement, pain, age, or <span class=\"nowrap\">presence/absence</span> of vasculopathic risk factors.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H119291787\"><span class=\"h3\">Evaluation for intracranial aneurysm</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>On presentation, the first consideration is to assess the risk of an underlying intracranial aneurysm because of the potential risk of imminent subarachnoid hemorrhage. Imaging studies used to diagnose or exclude an intracranial aneurysm include contrast-enhanced MRI with MR angiography (MRA), computed tomographic angiography (CTA), and cerebral angiography. Cerebral angiography remains the gold standard test but is invasive and associated with infrequent but significant risk [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/third-cranial-nerve-oculomotor-nerve-palsy-in-adults/abstract/34-37\" class=\"abstract_t\">34-37</a>]. The risk of the catheter angiography must therefore be weighed against the risk of missing an aneurysm in the individual patient. Factors to consider include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Contrast-enhanced MRI with MRA or CTA have a sensitivity as high as 95 to 98 percent for the detection of aneurysm in the setting of a third nerve palsy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/third-cranial-nerve-oculomotor-nerve-palsy-in-adults/abstract/34-37\" class=\"abstract_t\">34-37</a>]. The quality and reliability of each of these studies and their interpretation are to some extent institution-specific and should be ordered in consultation with the interpreting neuroradiologist [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/third-cranial-nerve-oculomotor-nerve-palsy-in-adults/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>]. While some centers prefer CTA as a first study to exclude aneurysm, MRI is superior for nonaneurysmal etiologies of a third nerve palsy.

Complete internal (pupil sphincter) dysfunction is manifested by a large, unreactive pupil. Partial internal dysfunction can produce anisocoria with a sluggish but reactive pupil. Third nerve palsies are classified as being neurologically isolated or neurologically nonisolated. (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Clinical manifestations'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Associated clinical features, particularly other neurologic deficits, can help localize the site of injury and identify possible etiologies (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F56375\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef56375 \">table 1</a>). (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Clinical manifestations'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The most feared cause of an isolated acute third nerve palsy is an intracranial aneurysm because of its attendant risk of potentially fatal subarachnoid hemorrhage. (See <a href=\"#H10\" class=\"local\">'Etiology'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A patient with acute third nerve palsy and sudden headache <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> meningeal signs should have an emergent noncontrast head computed tomography (CT) to look for subarachnoid hemorrhage. Other testing should follow if suspicion for aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage remains. (See <a href=\"#H13\" class=\"local\">'Nonisolated third nerve palsy'</a> above and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-aneurysmal-subarachnoid-hemorrhage#H26\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage&quot;, section on 'Diagnosis of subarachnoid hemorrhage'</a>.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Other patients with nonneurologically isolated third nerve palsy should undergo neuroimaging (contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) with MR angiography or CT angiography) and if that is negative, lumbar puncture or other laboratory testing. (See <a href=\"#H13\" class=\"local\">'Nonisolated third nerve palsy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For isolated third nerve palsies, the degree of external and internal dysfunction can be used to determine the type and urgency of imaging, including the risk to benefit analysis for proceeding to catheter angiography (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F76645\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef76645 \">table 2</a>). (See <a href=\"#H14\" class=\"local\">'Isolated third nerve palsy'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Observation alone is appropriate only for isolated third nerve palsies with complete external dysfunction and normal internal function (pupil-sparing) in an older patient with vascular risk factors who improves and does not develop aberrant regeneration. However, some clinicians recommend neuroimaging for all third nerve palsies regardless of pupil involvement, pain, age, or <span class=\"nowrap\">presence/absence</span> of vasculopathic risk factors. (See <a href=\"#H14\" class=\"local\">'Isolated third nerve palsy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Cranial contrast enhanced MRI with MR angiography, or cranial contrast enhanced CT angiography followed by <span class=\"nowrap\">MRI/MRA</span> are appropriate initial imaging strategies for other presentations of third nerve palsy. (See <a href=\"#H14\" class=\"local\">'Isolated third nerve palsy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Catheter angiography might still be necessary in patients with a high pretest likelihood of aneurysm (eg, pupil-involved third nerve palsy) even in the setting of a negative MRI with MRA or CTA, depending on institution and patient-specific factors.
