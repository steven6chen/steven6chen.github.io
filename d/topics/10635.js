The source of bleeding may be identified either during efforts to control the bleeding or during a careful evaluation after the patient has been stabilized. The cause of the bleeding determines the appropriate definitive treatment.</p><p>Potential causes of massive hemoptysis are described here. Other aspects of massive hemoptysis (ie, definition, initial management, diagnostic evaluation, and definitive treatment) and etiology and evaluation of nonmassive hemoptysis are reviewed separately.

This distinction can be difficult and may require an otolaryngological or gastrointestinal endoscopic evaluation. Characteristics of the expectorated material that suggest that a gastrointestinal source is unlikely include an alkaline pH, foaminess, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> the presence of pus.</p><p>There are numerous causes of bleeding from the lower respiratory tract. Many are listed in the table (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F96527\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef96527 \">table 1</a>). Three etiologies accounted for 90 percent of the cases of massive hemoptysis through the 1960s: tuberculosis, bronchiectasis, and lung abscess [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/massive-hemoptysis-causes/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Each of these causes has since decreased in frequency, although other etiologies have increased (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F66122\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef66122 \">table 2</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/massive-hemoptysis-causes/abstract/3-7\" class=\"abstract_t\">3-7</a>]. There are no more recent large series examining the prevalence of the causes of massive hemoptysis in general hospital settings. In less developed areas, tuberculosis, bronchiectasis, and bronchogenic carcinoma are the most common causes, particularly in patients with prior pulmonary tuberculosis. In this section, we describe the most common <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> important causes of massive hemoptysis.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4654462\"><span class=\"h2\">Bronchiectasis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The bronchial circulation supplies blood flow to the bronchial wall. In bronchiectasis, chronic airway inflammation causes hypertrophy and tortuosity of the bronchial arteries that accompany the regional bronchial trees, as well as expansion of the submucosal and peribronchial plexus of blood vessels. Rupture of either the tortuous vessels or the capillary plexus results in rapid bleeding because these blood vessels are subjected to systemic blood pressure.</p><p>Bronchiectasis may result from prior bacterial or viral infection, cystic fibrosis, TB, host immune defects chronic airway inflammation, or impairment of the mucociliary clearance apparatus (eg, ciliary dyskinesia or Young's syndrome). The increasing survival of patients with cystic fibrosis into adulthood has made cystic fibrosis an increasingly common cause of massive hemoptysis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/massive-hemoptysis-causes/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. Bronchiectasis is increasingly recognized in patients with alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-bronchiectasis-in-adults#H5\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of bronchiectasis in adults&quot;, section on 'Etiologies'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cystic-fibrosis-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Cystic fibrosis: Clinical manifestations and diagnosis&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=primary-ciliary-dyskinesia-immotile-cilia-syndrome\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Primary ciliary dyskinesia (immotile-cilia syndrome)&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1094903246\"><span class=\"h2\">Infections</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11003744\"><span class=\"h3\">Tuberculosis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Massive hemoptysis can be a consequence of either active or prior tuberculosis (TB).</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Active TB &ndash; Massive hemoptysis due to active TB can occur in the setting of cavitary or noncavitary disease. Most patients have sputum smears that stain positive for acid-fast bacilli. The cause of the bleeding is usually bronchiolar ulceration with necrosis of adjacent blood vessels [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/massive-hemoptysis-causes/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. This type of bleeding usually is from the bronchial arterial circulation. Less often, active TB may cause sudden rupture of a Rasmussen's aneurysm [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/massive-hemoptysis-causes/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. This is an aneurysm of the pulmonary artery that slowly expands because of inflammatory erosion of the external vessel wall until it bursts. There is some uncertainty about whether similar aneurysms can also arise from bronchial arteries.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Prior TB &ndash; There are numerous causes of hemoptysis due to inactive prior TB. These include the erosion of a healed calcified lymph node (ie, broncholith) through a bronchial artery and into an airway, bronchiectasis due to structural lung damage from prior TB, and a mycetoma in a lung cavity from prior TB. Scar carcinomas in areas of prior TB also can cause hemoptysis, although this is rare. Late rupture of a Rasmussen's aneurysm has been reported in patients with prior TB.</p><p/><p>The ongoing importance of TB as a cause of massive hemoptysis in some parts of the world was illustrated by a case series of 120 South African patients with massive hemoptysis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/massive-hemoptysis-causes/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. Active TB was the cause of 73 percent of the cases of massive hemoptysis. Among the patients with TB-related massive hemoptysis, most had either bronchiectasis or cavitation, although approximately one-third had non-cavitary active disease.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11003758\"><span class=\"h3\">Fungal infections</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Fungal infections in the lung have increased in frequency, especially among patients with preexisting cavitary disease and immunocompromised patients (eg, bone marrow transplantation). Types of pulmonary fungal infections include mycetomas (such as aspergillomas), invasive parenchymal fungal infections (eg, chronic necrotizing pulmonary aspergillosis), and dimorphic fungal infections (eg, histoplasmosis, blastomycosis).</p><p>An aspergilloma is a fungus ball composed of Aspergillus hyphae, fibrin, mucus, and cellular debris that is found within a pulmonary cavity. Aspergillomas arise in preexisting pulmonary cavities that have become colonized with Aspergillus species. They are the fungal infection that is most commonly associated with hemoptysis. Among patients with an aspergilloma, hemoptysis occurs in 50 to 90 percent of patients and may be massive [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/massive-hemoptysis-causes/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. The exact cause of bleeding due to an aspergilloma is uncertain. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-chronic-pulmonary-aspergillosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of chronic pulmonary aspergillosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Invasive parenchymal fungal infections may also cause massive hemoptysis, particularly infections caused by the angioinvasive fungi Aspergillus and Mucor [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/massive-hemoptysis-causes/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. The fungi destroy parenchymal and vascular structures, thereby inducing hemorrhage. When the invasive parenchymal fungal infection occurs after bone marrow transplantation, bleeding may be more likely at the time when bone marrow production of neutrophils is returning, since local inflammation may increase [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/massive-hemoptysis-causes/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-chronic-pulmonary-aspergillosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of chronic pulmonary aspergillosis&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epidemiology-and-clinical-manifestations-of-invasive-aspergillosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Epidemiology and clinical manifestations of invasive aspergillosis&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=mucormycosis-zygomycosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Mucormycosis (zygomycosis)&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Acute dimorphic fungal infections of the lung rarely cause hemoptysis and, when they do, it is likely a consequence of mucosal erosion. Prior histoplasmosis has been reported as a potential cause of hemoptysis, either due to the erosion of a calcified lymph node through an airway and vasculature or the effects of fibrosing mediastinitis. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pathogenesis-and-clinical-features-of-pulmonary-histoplasmosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pathogenesis and clinical features of pulmonary histoplasmosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11003765\"><span class=\"h3\">Other lung infections</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Other lung infections (particularly lung abscess) can also cause massive hemoptysis. Regardless of the type of lung infection, bleeding may occur acutely from necrosis of lung tissue or rupture of hypertrophied bronchial arteries due to chronic inflammation. Bacterial pneumonia occasionally causes massive hemoptysis, especially in individuals with thrombocytopenia or coagulopathy. In developing countries, parasitic infections are very common etiologies of hemoptysis, particularly paragonimiasis in Southeast Asia. Severe leptospirosis may be complicated by massive alveolar bleeding and hemoptysis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/massive-hemoptysis-causes/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4654544\"><span class=\"h2\">Bronchogenic carcinoma</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Bronchogenic carcinoma is a common cause of hemoptysis, but an infrequent cause of massive hemoptysis. Nonmassive hemoptysis occurs in 7 to 10 percent of patients with lung cancer at the time of presentation and in approximately 20 percent of patients at some time during their course [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/massive-hemoptysis-causes/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. In contrast, massive terminal hemoptysis occurs in only 3 percent of patients with lung cancer, according to a series of 877 patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/massive-hemoptysis-causes/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. Among the patients who had massive hemoptysis, 80 percent had small, sentinel bleeding episodes during the prior weeks. Patients with massive hemoptysis typically had large, centrally located tumors, especially squamous cell carcinoma. In another case series of 125 patients with massive hemoptysis related to lung cancer, 82 percent were due to bronchial artery involvement, while bleeding due to involvement of the main pulmonary artery was rare (6 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/massive-hemoptysis-causes/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. </p><p>Hemoptysis is also common in patients with bronchial carcinoid tumors, but the amount of bleeding is quite variable. Carcinoid tumors are highly vascular and are prone to bleeding with biopsy. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lung-neuroendocrine-carcinoid-tumors-epidemiology-risk-factors-classification-histology-diagnosis-and-staging\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Lung neuroendocrine (carcinoid) tumors: Epidemiology, risk factors, classification, histology, diagnosis, and staging&quot;</a>.) </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11004547\"><span class=\"h2\">Bronchitis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>It is controversial whether bronchitis alone is sufficient to cause massive hemoptysis. Many clinicians believe that coagulopathy or other contributing factors must be present for massive hemoptysis to occur in the setting of bronchitis alone. Case series have reported bronchitis as the cause of massive hemoptysis in 5 to 37 percent of cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/massive-hemoptysis-causes/abstract/3,4,6,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,4,6,14</a>]. However, since computed tomography of the chest was rarely performed in these older series, it is possible that many of the patients actually had underlying bronchiectasis. In addition, many of the reported cases did not have followup so it is unclear if other underlying causes were initially undiagnosed. Massive hemoptysis should be attributed to bronchitis with reluctance, and only after careful and complete workup.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11003786\"><span class=\"h2\">Immunologic lung diseases</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Diffuse parenchymal lung diseases with an immunologic basis can cause massive hemoptysis, probably due to pulmonary capillaritis. Examples include anti-GBM (Goodpasture's) disease, granulomatosis with polyangiitis (formerly called Wegener's granulomatosis), systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), idiopathic pulmonary hemosiderosis, and microscopic polyangiitis. </p><p>Patients with these diseases may also develop diffuse alveolar hemorrhage. The clinical features and causes of diffuse alveolar hemorrhage are summarized in the tables (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F72772%7EPULM%2F51544\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef72772 graphicRef51544 \">table 3A-B</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/massive-hemoptysis-causes/abstract/15,16\" class=\"abstract_t\">15,16</a>]. In diffuse alveolar hemorrhage, the expectorated volume of hemoptysis may be relatively small compared to the amount of parenchymal bleeding. The reason for this observation is that the alveolar location of the bleeding may not stimulate the cough reflex to the same extent as bleeding in the airway. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pathogenesis-and-diagnosis-of-anti-gbm-antibody-goodpastures-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pathogenesis and diagnosis of anti-GBM antibody (Goodpasture's) disease&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-granulomatosis-with-polyangiitis-and-microscopic-polyangiitis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of granulomatosis with polyangiitis and microscopic polyangiitis&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pulmonary-manifestations-of-systemic-lupus-erythematosus-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pulmonary manifestations of systemic lupus erythematosus in adults&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=idiopathic-pulmonary-hemosiderosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Idiopathic pulmonary hemosiderosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4653942\"><span class=\"h2\">Chemotherapy and bone marrow transplantation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients who are undergoing chemotherapy for leukemia or who have received a hematopoietic stem cell transplant may have sudden, massive pulmonary hemorrhage that is frequently fatal. The etiology of this idiopathic pneumonia syndrome after bone marrow transplantation is uncertain, but postmortem pathology suggests that it is due to diffuse lung injury, presumably from a combination of drugs, radiation, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> thrombocytopenia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/massive-hemoptysis-causes/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. There may also be contributions from underlying fungal or viral infection. Alternatively, patients may develop diffuse alveolar hemorrhage and respiratory failure, which can manifest with little or no hemoptysis. Idiopathic pneumonia syndrome and diffuse alveolar hemorrhage are discussed separately.

More than 8 percent of patients with pulmonary arteriovenous malformations due to HHT will have an episode of massive hemoptysis, according to a series of 143 patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/massive-hemoptysis-causes/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pulmonary-arteriovenous-malformations-clinical-features-and-diagnostic-evaluation-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pulmonary arteriovenous malformations: Clinical features and diagnostic evaluation in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Mitral stenosis increases resistance in the pulmonary veins, accompanied by reversal of blood flow from the pulmonary capillaries into the bronchial veins. The resulting submucosal bronchial varices may rupture, causing &quot;cardiac apoplexy.&quot; This is prone to manifest at times of either increased pulmonary blood flow (exercise, pregnancy) or increased blood volume (pregnancy). Although now rare in the United States, it is worthwhile obtaining echocardiography to exclude this cause of hemoptysis. Cardiopulmonary bypass can markedly reduce such bleeding and should be considered if the bleeding is life-threatening.

However, the hemoptysis may become massive after the initiation of anticoagulant therapy or the use of a thrombolytic agent.

Predispositions include pulmonary hypertension and having the catheter tip too distal in the pulmonary circulation, particularly for relatively long periods of time. A clinical indicator of distal position is when the wedge tracing is obtained with only partial inflation of the balloon.
