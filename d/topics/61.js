It accounts for approximately 10 percent of all cases of acute cholecystitis and is associated with high morbidity and mortality rates.</p><p>This topic will review the pathophysiology, diagnosis, and management of acalculous cholecystitis. Clinical issues related to acute calculous cholecystitis and chronic cholecystitis are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acute-cholecystitis-pathogenesis-clinical-features-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Acute cholecystitis: Pathogenesis, clinical features, and diagnosis&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-acute-calculous-cholecystitis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of acute calculous cholecystitis&quot;</a>.) </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H65323845\"><span class=\"h1\">PATHOGENESIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Acalculous cholecystitis results from gallbladder stasis and ischemia, which then cause a local inflammatory response in the gallbladder wall. The majority of patients with acalculous cholecystitis have multiple risk factors (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F82539\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef82539 \">table 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acalculous-cholecystitis-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-management/abstract/1-7\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-7</a>]. In some cases, specific primary infections predispose to acalculous cholecystitis (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F56077\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef56077 \">table 2</a>). As an example, acalculous cholecystitis occurring in patients with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) and other immunosuppressed patients may be due to opportunistic infections such as microsporidia, <em>Cryptosporidium</em>, or cytomegalovirus [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acalculous-cholecystitis-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-management/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. More often, however, these infections cause a cholangiopathy without cholecystitis. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aids-cholangiopathy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;AIDS cholangiopathy&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Pathologically in patients with acalculous cholecystitis, endothelial injury, gallbladder ischemia, and stasis, lead to concentration of bile salts, gallbladder distension, and eventually necrosis of the gallbladder tissue. Once acalculous cholecystitis is established, secondary infection with enteric pathogens, including <em>Escherichia coli</em>, <em>Enterococcus faecalis</em>, <em>Klebsiella </em>spp, <em>Pseudomonas </em>spp, <em>Proteus</em> spp, and <em>Bacteroides fragilis</em> and related strains,<em> </em>is common [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acalculous-cholecystitis-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-management/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. Perforation occurs in severe cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acalculous-cholecystitis-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-management/abstract/10,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,11</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H1810275760\" class=\"local\">'Complications'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H65324085\"><span class=\"h1\">EPIDEMIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Acalculous cholecystitis is typically seen in patients who are hospitalized and critically ill, though it may also be seen in the outpatient setting in patients with risk factors for acalculous cholecystitis (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F82539\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef82539 \">table 1</a>). Acalculous cholecystitis has been reported in 0.7 to 0.9 percent of patients following open abdominal aortic reconstruction, in 0.5 percent of patients following cardiac surgery, and in as many as 4 percent of patients who have undergone bone marrow transplantation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acalculous-cholecystitis-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-management/abstract/4,12-15\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,12-15</a>]. There is a male preponderance among patients with acute acalculous cholecystitis ranging from 40 to 80 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acalculous-cholecystitis-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-management/abstract/12,16\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,16</a>]. </p><p>The incidence of acalculous cholecystitis in outpatients is not well defined. In one of the largest single center reports, 36 of 47 patients (77 percent) identified over a seven-year period developed symptoms at home without evidence of acute illness or trauma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acalculous-cholecystitis-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-management/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. Significant vascular disease was observed in 72 percent of these patients. Although this suggests that the relative incidence in outpatients may be much higher than is generally recognized, some of these patients may have been misclassified as having acalculous cholecystitis since it is possible that gallstones or microcrystals had not been appreciated.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL MANIFESTATIONS</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3880335637\"><span class=\"h2\">Clinical presentation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The clinical presentation of acalculous cholecystitis varies based on the severity of illness and underlying predisposing conditions (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F82539\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef82539 \">table 1</a>). In critically ill patients, the appearance of unexplained fever may be the only sign of acalculous cholecystitis. The physical examination may reveal a palpable right upper quadrant mass and rarely jaundice [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acalculous-cholecystitis-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-management/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. Jaundice typically results from sepsis-related cholestasis or partial biliary obstruction induced by inflammation extending into the common bile duct. However, it may also occur as a result of extrinsic compression of the common bile duct by a phlegmon (Mirizzi-type syndrome). Because the presentation may be insidious, patients may have sepsis, shock, and peritonitis at presentation due to complications including gallbladder necrosis, gangrene, or perforation. Patients with emphysematous cholecystitis may have crepitus of the right upper quadrant. (See <a href=\"#H1810275760\" class=\"local\">'Complications'</a> below and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=mirizzi-syndrome\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Mirizzi syndrome&quot;</a>.)</p><p>In outpatients or in the critically ill who are able to provide a more detailed history, the presentation may be similar to that seen in calculous cholecystitis, with fever, severe right upper quadrant pain with tenderness to palpation, and a positive Murphy's sign (pain elicited during inspiration while palpating the right upper quadrant) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acalculous-cholecystitis-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-management/abstract/18,19\" class=\"abstract_t\">18,19</a>].

These patients may in fact have had gallstone-related disease or functional gallbladder disorder.

Abnormal liver tests include conjugated hyperbilirubinemia and a mild increase in serum alkaline phosphatase and serum aminotransferases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acalculous-cholecystitis-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-management/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=approach-to-the-patient-with-abnormal-liver-biochemical-and-function-tests\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Approach to the patient with abnormal liver biochemical and function tests&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1810275760\"><span class=\"h2\">Complications</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Similar to patients with acute calculous cholecystitis, complication of acalculous cholecystitis include emphysematous cholecystitis, gangrene, and perforation (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F56763\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef56763 \">image 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acalculous-cholecystitis-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-management/abstract/1,19\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,19</a>]. Gallbladder gangrene develops in approximately 50 percent of patients with acalculous cholecystitis and can result in gallbladder perforation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acalculous-cholecystitis-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-management/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. Emphysematous cholecystitis, in particular, puts patients at risk for perforation. Overall, perforation occurs in approximately 10 percent of patients with acalculous cholecystitis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acalculous-cholecystitis-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-management/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. Perforation may result in a cholecystenteric fistula, abscess formation, or free perforation with generalized peritonitis. In patients with gangrene without perforation, complications include acute pancreatitis, colonic perforation, and obstruction of the common hepatic duct. These complications are discussed in detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acute-cholecystitis-pathogenesis-clinical-features-and-diagnosis#H249918843\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Acute cholecystitis: Pathogenesis, clinical features, and diagnosis&quot;, section on 'Complications'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">DIAGNOSTIC APPROACH</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H68737917\"><span class=\"h2\">Clinical suspicion and evaluation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Acalculous cholecystitis should be suspected in critically ill patients with sepsis without a clear source or jaundice.

In patients in whom the diagnosis is uncertain, we perform abdominal imaging with a contrast-enhanced abdominal computed tomography (CT) scan for evidence of acute acalculous cholecystitis and to exclude other causes of acute abdominal pain. In stable patients in whom the diagnosis is unclear after ultrasonography and abdominal CT scan, we perform a hepatic iminodiacetic acid (HIDA) scan [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acalculous-cholecystitis-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-management/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H1925297594\" class=\"local\">'Imaging'</a> below.)</p><p>Laboratory evaluation should include a complete blood count, electrolytes, liver tests, pancreatic enzymes. In addition, we perform a urine analysis to look for evidence of urosepsis, and a chest radiograph or CT scan to rule out pneumonia. Blood cultures should be obtained in all patients with suspected acalculous cholecystitis. Culture results can guide narrowing of empiric antibiotics.

Sonographic Murphy's sign is operator-dependent and requires an awake and cooperative patient, but, when present, is indicative of gallbladder inflammation. Thickening of the gallbladder wall is the most reliable feature seen in patients with acalculous cholecystitis but is not specific [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acalculous-cholecystitis-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-management/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. False positive results may be due to hypoalbuminemia, ascites, sludge, non-shadowing stones, or cholesterolosis which can mimic a thickened gallbladder wall. </p><p>Gallbladder abnormalities are detected in a significant number of critically ill patients even in the absence of acalculous cholecystitis. In one study of 44 critically ill patients, at least one sonographic abnormality was detected in 37 patients (84 percent) and up to three sonographic abnormalities were detected in 25 (57 percent).

Of these findings, gas in the gallbladder wall or lumen, lack of gallbladder wall enhancement, and edema around the gallbladder have the highest specificity for acalculous cholecystitis (99, 95, and 92 percent, respectively), but these findings have poor sensitivity (11, 38, and 22 percent, respectively).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H68737952\"><span class=\"h3\">Cholescintigraphy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Technetium labeled HIDA is injected intravenously and is then taken up selectively by hepatocytes and excreted into bile. If the cystic duct is patent, the tracer will enter the gallbladder, leading to its visualization without the need for concentration. Normally, visualization of contrast within the common bile duct, gallbladder, and small bowel occurs within 30 to 60 minutes. Failure to opacify the gallbladder at one hour is considered a positive test. Leakage into the pericholecystic space suggests gallbladder perforation. </p><p>As cholescintigraphy (HIDA scan) takes hours to perform, it is not recommended in critically ill patients in whom a delay in therapy can be potentially fatal. The sensitivity of cholescintigraphy for acalculous cholecystitis ranges from 67 to 100 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acalculous-cholecystitis-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-management/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>].

The accuracy can be improved by injection of intravenous <a href=\"topic.htm?path=morphine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">morphine</a> in patients with nonvisualization of the gallbladder to increase bile secretory pressure, which promotes gallbladder filling in the absence of acalculous cholecystitis.

In critically ill patients, the appearance of unexplained fever, leukocytosis, or vague abdominal discomfort may be the only sign of acalculous cholecystitis. Because the presentation may be insidious, gallbladder necrosis, gangrene, and perforation are frequently present at the time of diagnosis. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Clinical manifestations'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Acalculous cholecystitis should be suspected in critically ill patients with sepsis without a clear source or jaundice. It should also be considered in patients with postoperative jaundice. We perform abdominal imaging with ultrasonography in patients with suspected acalculous cholecystitis. In patients in whom the diagnosis is uncertain, we perform a contrast-enhanced abdominal computed tomography (CT) scan for evidence of acute acalculous cholecystitis and to exclude other causes of acute abdominal pain. In stable patients in whom the diagnosis is unclear after ultrasonography and abdominal CT scan, we perform a hepatic iminodiacetic acid scan.
