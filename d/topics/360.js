In addition, acute viral gastroenteritis causes outbreaks in certain closed communities, such as nursing homes, schools, and cruise ships. Restaurant and catered meals are another common source of outbreaks.</p><p>This topic focuses on the management of acute viral gastroenteritis in adults.

The other common pathogens causing viral gastroenteritis are rotavirus, enteric adenovirus, and astrovirus.</p><p>In addition to large outbreaks from consumption of contaminated food and water, noroviruses are efficiently spread person-to-person [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-viral-gastroenteritis-in-adults/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. Viral gastroenteritis has pronounced peaks in the winter and spring [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-viral-gastroenteritis-in-adults/abstract/8,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,9</a>].</p><p>The epidemiology and virology of viral gastroenteritis in adults is discussed in detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=norovirus\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Norovirus&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H752813247\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL MANIFESTATIONS</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7106177\"><span class=\"h2\">History</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Acute gastroenteritis is defined as diarrheal disease (three or more times per day or at least 200 g of stool per day) of rapid onset that lasts less than two weeks and may be accompanied by nausea, vomiting, fever, or abdominal pain [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-viral-gastroenteritis-in-adults/abstract/3,10,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,10,11</a>]. Both vomiting and diarrhea are usually present; however, either can occur alone. In one study, among patients who presented to the emergency department with acute gastroenteritis, the most common symptoms were nausea (93 percent), diarrhea (89 percent), vomiting (81 percent), and abdominal pain (76 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-viral-gastroenteritis-in-adults/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Respiratory symptoms were reported in approximately 10 percent of the subjects and included sore throat, cough, and rhinorrhea [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-viral-gastroenteritis-in-adults/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Other symptoms such as weight loss and fatigue have also been reported.</p><p>Characteristics of the history that suggest a viral etiology of acute gastroenteritis include: an intermediate incubation period (24 to 60 hours), a short infection duration (12 to 60 hours), and a high frequency of vomiting [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-viral-gastroenteritis-in-adults/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. However, these epidemiologic criteria for differentiating between outbreaks caused by norovirus and bacterial pathogens may not be as useful for individual patient assessment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-viral-gastroenteritis-in-adults/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. As an example, one observational study showed few differences in the clinical presentation between adults with acute gastroenteritis due to viral and bacterial pathogens [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-viral-gastroenteritis-in-adults/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. The duration of the diarrhea may differ among viral and bacterial acute gastroenteritis. Norovirus infection usually lasts a median of two days, rotavirus infection three to eight days, and <em>Campylobacter</em> and <em>Salmonella</em> two to seven days [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-viral-gastroenteritis-in-adults/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. Viral gastroenteritis does not typically cause bloody diarrhea.</p><p>The clinical manifestations of gastroenteritis caused by specific viral pathogens are discussed separately.

Fever (38.3 to 38.9&deg;C [101 to 102&deg;F]) occurs in approximately one-half of patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-viral-gastroenteritis-in-adults/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>].</p><p>While relatively uncommon, it is important to identify signs of moderate to severe dehydration, including dry mucous membranes, decreased skin turgor, tachycardia, hypotension, or altered mental status. These were present in fewer than 10 percent of patients presenting to the emergency department with acute gastroenteritis in one study [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-viral-gastroenteritis-in-adults/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H532167781\"><span class=\"h2\">Alarm symptoms and signs</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Clinical features or alarm symptoms and signs (&quot;red flags&quot;) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F89438\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef89438 \">table 1</a>) that identify patients who may need hospitalization or evaluation for other causes include [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-viral-gastroenteritis-in-adults/abstract/10,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,14</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Severe volume <span class=\"nowrap\">depletion/dehydration</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Abnormal electrolytes or renal function</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Bloody <span class=\"nowrap\">stool/rectal</span> bleeding</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Weight loss</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Severe abdominal pain</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Prolonged symptoms (more than one week)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Hospitalization or antibiotic use in the past three to six months</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Age 65 or older</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Comorbidities (eg, diabetes mellitus, immunocompromised)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pregnancy</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7106200\"><span class=\"h2\">Laboratory findings</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Stool studies are not routinely necessary in patients with viral gastroenteritis and are typically negative for fecal leukocytes and occult blood. Stool culture is also negative for bacterial pathogens. The presence of fecal leukocytes, occult blood, lactoferrin, or positive stool culture all indicate an inflammatory, nonviral gastroenteritis.</p><p>In the absence of signs of volume depletion, it is not necessary to measure serum electrolytes, which are usually normal. If substantial volume depletion is present, clinicians should measure serum electrolytes to screen for hypokalemia or renal dysfunction.</p><p>The complete blood count does not reliably distinguish between viral and bacterial gastroenteritis. The white blood cell count may or may not be elevated. In patients with acute viral gastroenteritis with volume depletion, the complete blood count may show signs of hemoconcentration.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H752813261\"><span class=\"h1\">DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The diagnosis of acute viral gastroenteritis is made by a characteristic history of diarrheal disease (three or more times per day or at least 200 g of stool per day) of rapid onset that lasts less than one week and may be accompanied by nausea, vomiting, fever, or abdominal pain and characteristic physical examination of mild, diffuse, abdominal tenderness [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-viral-gastroenteritis-in-adults/abstract/3,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,10</a>].</p><p>Routine laboratory and stool studies (eg, fecal leukocytes, lactoferrin) are not required for the diagnosis of acute viral gastroenteritis; it is not necessary to determine a specific viral diagnosis. However, stool studies should be obtained in the following situations: adults presenting with persistent fever, dehydration, blood or pus in the stool, or other alarm symptoms and signs (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F89438\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef89438 \">table 1</a>), and when there is clinical suspicion of a nonviral, inflammatory etiology of acute gastroenteritis. Diarrhea that lasts for more than a week should also prompt consideration of infectious and noninfectious causes (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F68348\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef68348 \">algorithm 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-viral-gastroenteritis-in-adults/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>].

Diarrhea that lasts over a week in an individual with a history of travel, hiking, or oral-anal sexual activity should prompt evaluation for protozoa such as <em>Giardia</em> and cryptosporidium [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-viral-gastroenteritis-in-adults/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. Recent antibiotic use or hospitalization should prompt consideration of <em>Clostridium difficile</em> infection. Common foodborne illnesses (eg, <em>Staphylococcus aureus</em>) need to be considered, particularly when the incubation period is shorter than is typical for viral illness (ie, within 8 to 16 hours). The presence of alarm symptoms or signs should prompt further investigation for an alternate diagnosis.

In known viral gastroenteritis epidemics, antibiotics are not indicated. Empiric antibiotics may have a limited role in the management of acute gastroenteritis, when it is unclear if the etiology is viral or bacterial. The role of antibiotics in bacterial gastroenteritis is discussed separately.

Soft drinks and fruit juices that are high in sugar content should be avoided. For adults presenting with mild to moderate volume depletion (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F89437\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef89437 \">table 2</a>), <a href=\"topic.htm?path=oral-rehydration-solutions-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">oral rehydration solutions</a> may be superior to sports drinks in maintaining electrolyte balance along with hydration. World Health Organization (WHO) oral rehydration salts (ORS) solution is available from commercial companies. For patients with severe hypovolemia, or an inability to tolerate oral rehydration, repletion with intravenous normal saline or Ringer&rsquo;s lactate is required (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F86529\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef86529 \">algorithm 2</a>).</p><p>Oral rehydration has been associated with a higher risk of paralytic ileus while intravenous hydration carries the risk of phlebitis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-viral-gastroenteritis-in-adults/abstract/18,19\" class=\"abstract_t\">18,19</a>]. Oral rehydration should not be used if the patient has impaired mental status or abdominal ileus. In resource-poor environments in developing countries, where access to medical care and intravenous fluids may be limited, oral rehydration may be particularly useful.</p><p>The principles of oral hydration in adults are based primarily on studies showing a benefit in children [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-viral-gastroenteritis-in-adults/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. In children, the use of WHO ORS solution decreases the mortality due to acute diarrheal illnesses. There are very limited data in adults. A small randomized trial of 60 adults in India with dehydration from viral gastroenteritis showed that adults randomized to Gatorade, which is a modified ORS solution, and Pedialyte had similar improvements in diarrheal symptoms and body weight [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-viral-gastroenteritis-in-adults/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. However, the modified ORS solution and Pedialyte were effective in correcting hypokalemia, whereas the Gatorade was not.

Patients should be encouraged to eat as tolerated. Smaller meals may be less likely to induce vomiting than larger ones. Bland, low-residue foods may also be better tolerated than others. For healthy adults with acute viral gastroenteritis without signs of dehydration, sport drinks, diluted fruit juices, and other flavored soft drinks augmented with saltine crackers and broths or soups can meet the fluid and salt needs in almost all cases. Broiled <span class=\"nowrap\">starches/cereals</span> (potatoes, noodles, rice, wheat, and oat) with some salt are excellent foods to consider. In addition, crackers, bananas, yogurt, soups, and boiled vegetables can also be consumed.</p><p>While the BRAT diet (<strong>b</strong>ananas, <strong>r</strong>ice, <strong>a</strong>pplesauce, and <strong>t</strong>oast) is often recommended, the evidence to support it is weak [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-viral-gastroenteritis-in-adults/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. Similarly, while many authorities advise patients to exclude milk and dairy products from their diet during the episode of diarrhea and for several weeks after symptoms resolve, the evidence to support this is weak [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-viral-gastroenteritis-in-adults/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. A 2008 systematic review of 71 studies concluded that there is limited evidence in adults to support dietary restrictions and that restricted and unrestricted diets seem to be equally effective at reducing the duration of watery and non-watery diarrhea [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-viral-gastroenteritis-in-adults/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H752813361\"><span class=\"h3\">Probiotics</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The value of oral probiotics in acute viral gastroenteritis is not well established, and further research is needed to determine the optimal type, dose, and regimen of probiotics before they are recommended for routine use.</p><p>Probiotics may modulate the immune response through interaction with the gut-associated immune system or through direct effect on other microorganisms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-viral-gastroenteritis-in-adults/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>].

As an example, in one included trial, 230 adults were randomized to receive loperamide oxide (1 or 2 mg) or placebo after each loose stool (maximum of eight tablets in the active groups) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-viral-gastroenteritis-in-adults/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>]. The median time to complete relief was reduced by 12 to 15 hours in the loperamide groups compared with placebo.</p><p>Constipation is a common side effect of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=loperamide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">loperamide</a>, and the risk is increased for older adults [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-viral-gastroenteritis-in-adults/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>]. The risk for constipation can be reduced by the use of loperamide only as needed for each loose stool, rather than scheduled daily dosing, and by limiting its use to two days. Paralytic ileus is an uncommon, but serious, adverse event. Loperamide should be used with caution in patients with hepatic impairment and with monitoring for signs of mental status changes. Patients should stop taking loperamide if they develop constipation, abdominal distention, or worsening abdominal pain. In addition, antimotility agents should be avoided in patients with bloody diarrhea, as the presence of bloody diarrhea indicates the presence of a nonviral cause of gastroenteritis that should be evaluated further [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-viral-gastroenteritis-in-adults/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>]. The use of antimotility agents in some types of nonviral diarrheal illness (eg, <em>C. difficile</em> colitis) could be potentially harmful.

Ondansetron increased the proportion of children with cessation of vomiting, reduced the immediate hospital admission rate and the need for intravenous rehydration therapy. Ondansetron also has a very good safety profile and does not cause any sedation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-viral-gastroenteritis-in-adults/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>].

In general, empiric therapy for community-acquired acute diarrhea (of unclear etiology) may be beneficial but does not appear to dramatically alter the course of illness in unselected populations. If patients initially treated with supportive measures do not improve after seven days or symptoms worsen, then they should be reevaluated and possibly treated for other causes of gastroenteritis.

In developed countries, hospital admission for acute gastroenteritis is uncommon but necessary when severe dehydration is present. Older frail adults are also more susceptible to dehydration and subsequent complications (eg, syncope, hypotension) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-viral-gastroenteritis-in-adults/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. Persons with medical comorbidities, such as immunodeficiency, inflammatory bowel disease, valvular heart disease, diabetes mellitus, renal impairment, rheumatoid arthritis, and systemic lupus erythematosus, as well as patients taking immunosuppressants, systemic corticosteroids, or diuretics, are more vulnerable and at risk for complications and poor outcomes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-viral-gastroenteritis-in-adults/abstract/44\" class=\"abstract_t\">44</a>]. These patients require closer follow-up and a lower threshold for hospitalization or further evaluation if the gastroenteritis is not resolving.</p><p>Acute gastroenteritis usually has no long-term sequelae. In developed countries, 75 percent of adults fully recover from acute gastroenteritis, but an estimated 25 percent of them have long-lasting changes in their bowel habits and a smaller number of these individuals will develop post-infectious irritable bowel syndrome [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-viral-gastroenteritis-in-adults/abstract/45\" class=\"abstract_t\">45</a>].

The best preventive measure that individuals can take is adequate hand hygiene and avoidance of close contact, if possible, with people with symptoms of gastroenteritis. Individuals with acute gastroenteritis should be counseled about diligent hand hygiene to help prevent spread of infection to their family, colleagues, and contacts. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=infection-control-in-the-outpatient-setting\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Infection control in the outpatient setting&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Appropriate community infection control measures partially depend on the epidemiologic setting in which viral gastroenteritis is taking place. For disease outbreaks occurring in health care and long-term care facilities (typically caused by norovirus [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-viral-gastroenteritis-in-adults/abstract/46-48\" class=\"abstract_t\">46-48</a>]), standard enteric precaution measures involve careful handwashing and use of barriers, such as wearing gloves. A meta-analysis, not limited to viral gastroenteritis, suggested that handwashing with soap reduces diarrheal risk by 47 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-viral-gastroenteritis-in-adults/abstract/49\" class=\"abstract_t\">49</a>]. Cohorting of patients may become necessary in outbreaks that are slow to control. Similar measures should be employed in acute care hospitals for adults [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-viral-gastroenteritis-in-adults/abstract/47\" class=\"abstract_t\">47</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=norovirus#H484132535\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Norovirus&quot;, section on 'Outbreaks'</a>.)</p><p>In outbreaks from contamination of an identified water or food source, public health measures should be directed at identified sources [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-viral-gastroenteritis-in-adults/abstract/46,50,51\" class=\"abstract_t\">46,50,51</a>]. Most foodborne cases of gastroenteritis in the United States are due to norovirus [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-viral-gastroenteritis-in-adults/abstract/51\" class=\"abstract_t\">51</a>]; contamination of food occurs either at the environmental source (eg, oysters or raspberries) or by food handlers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-viral-gastroenteritis-in-adults/abstract/52\" class=\"abstract_t\">52</a>]. Recurring norovirus outbreaks on cruise ships have presented difficult problems in infection control requiring isolation of ill crew members (and passengers, if possible) and disinfection of ships with chlorine solutions, phenol-based compounds, or accelerated hydrogen peroxide products [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-viral-gastroenteritis-in-adults/abstract/53\" class=\"abstract_t\">53</a>]. Norovirus is a very stable agent that easily persists in the environment and is notoriously difficult to eradicate; it persists after treatment with chlorine solutions that are well beyond concentrations present in public water systems [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-viral-gastroenteritis-in-adults/abstract/54\" class=\"abstract_t\">54</a>]. Norovirus is the most infectious of viral pathogens, with a median infectious dose of only 18 viruses, which further compounds problems for eradication [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-viral-gastroenteritis-in-adults/abstract/55\" class=\"abstract_t\">55</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"PATIENT_INFORMATION\"><span class=\"h1\">INFORMATION FOR PATIENTS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>UpToDate offers two types of patient education materials, &quot;The Basics&quot; and &quot;Beyond the Basics.&quot; The Basics patient education pieces are written in plain language, at the 5<sup>th</sup> to 6<sup>th</sup> grade reading level, and they answer the four or five key questions a patient might have about a given condition.

(See <a href=\"#H7106389\" class=\"local\">'Etiology'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Acute viral gastroenteritis typically has a short incubation period (24 to 60 hours), a short infection duration (12 to 60 hours), and a high frequency of vomiting, as well as diarrhea. Patients may present with signs of dehydration if they are unable to drink enough fluids to compensate for fluid losses. (See <a href=\"#H752813247\" class=\"local\">'Clinical manifestations'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The diagnosis of acute viral gastroenteritis is made by a characteristic history of diarrheal disease of rapid onset that lasts less than one week and may be accompanied by nausea, vomiting, fever, or abdominal pain. Laboratory and stool studies are not required for the diagnosis of acute viral gastroenteritis. (See <a href=\"#H752813261\" class=\"local\">'Diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>However, adults presenting with persistent fever, dehydration, blood or pus in the stool, or alarm symptoms and signs (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F89438\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef89438 \">table 1</a>) need to be evaluated for a nonviral cause of gastroenteritis (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F68348\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef68348 \">algorithm 1</a>). The diagnostic approach to patients in these settings is discussed in detail separately.

For adults presenting with signs of mild to moderate hypovolemia (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F89437\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef89437 \">table 2</a>), oral rehydration salts (ORS) solution may be superior to sports drinks in maintaining electrolyte balance along with hydration.
