In one retrospective study of 670 febrile infants less than 30 days of age who presented to a pediatric emergency department over a 10-year period from 2004 to 2013, 15 percent of patients (n = 100) had a positive urine culture of a specimen obtained by bladder catheterization [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/urinary-tract-infections-in-neonates/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].

As a result, urine cultures are not obtained for term infants who are being evaluated for early-onset sepsis during the first six days of life.

In one study from an Israeli neonatal intensive care unit from 1990 to 1993, the reported prevalence was 8 percent, but extremely low birth weight (ELBW) infants (BW &lt;1000 g) had a greater risk of 13 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/urinary-tract-infections-in-neonates/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H546597754\"><span class=\"h1\">MICROBIOLOGY</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H546599374\"><span class=\"h2\">Term infants</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In term infants who present with community-acquired infection,<em> Escherichia coli</em> is the most common pathogen accounting for up to 80 percent of infections in most large series [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/urinary-tract-infections-in-neonates/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>]. Other gram-negative bacterial causes of UTI include <em>Klebsiella</em>, <em>Proteus</em>, <em>Enterobacter</em>, and <em>Citrobacter</em>.

Hematogenous spread of infection had been considered to be responsible for UTI because of the higher frequency of febrile UTI (ie, pyelonephritis), which was presumed to be due to bacteremia. However, increasingly it is thought that neonatal UTI in term infants is primarily due to ascending infection rather than hematogenous spread from a remote source because of the microbiology of these infections (eg, <em>E. coli</em>) and the high incidence of urinary tract abnormalities. (See <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'Kidney and urinary tract abnormalities'</a> below.)</p><p>Several virulence factors in <em>E. coli</em> account for the propensity of this organism to cause UTI, especially when the urinary tract is anatomically normal [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/urinary-tract-infections-in-neonates/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. The best studied virulence factor in <em>E. coli</em> is adhesins located on the tip of bacterial fimbriae (also called pili) or bacterial surface, which facilitate bacterial attachment to the uroepithelium. This allows the bacteria to effectively adhere to the uroepithelium and ascend into the kidney. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=bacterial-adherence-and-other-virulence-factors-for-urinary-tract-infection\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Bacterial adherence and other virulence factors for urinary tract infection&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H546598019\"><span class=\"h2\">Preterm infants</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Hematogenous infection likely plays a greater role in preterm infants with UTI, as there is a higher concordance rate of sepsis than in term infants. In one large cohort study based on data from Pediatrix Medical neonatal intensive care units, there was a 13 percent rate of a positive blood culture collected within three days of the urine culture with the same pathogenic organism [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/urinary-tract-infections-in-neonates/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H546596980\"><span class=\"h1\">HOST FACTORS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A variety of host factors influence the predisposition to UTI in neonates.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H546596987\"><span class=\"h2\">Male infants</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Male infants account for three-quarters of neonates and young infants (&lt;3 months of age) with UTIs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/urinary-tract-infections-in-neonates/abstract/1,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,11</a>].

The higher incidence of UTI in uncircumcised males is related to an increased rate of bacterial colonization and enhanced bacterial adherence. The increased incidence in uncircumcised males persists during the first year after birth. Parents of newborn males should be provided with accurate information regarding the potential risks and benefits of circumcision (eg, lower risk of UTI) in order to make an informed decision.

UTI is uncommon in the first three days after birth and generally presents in the second week after birth. The incidence is higher in uncircumcised males, and the risk appears to increase with decreasing gestational age in preterm infants. In addition, congenital anomalies of the kidney and urinary tract (CAKUT) are an important predisposing factor for neonatal UTI.

The first step is renal ultrasonography to identify structural abnormalities. In addition, for neonates with abnormal renal ultrasound, non-<em>E. coli</em> pathogen, or recurrent UTI, we suggest voiding cystourethrogram (VCUG) to evaluate for vesicoureteral reflux.
