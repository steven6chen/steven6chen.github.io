It is <strong>not</strong> a heritable disorder. Thus, recurrence is unlikely.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6961417\"><span class=\"h1\">GENETICS AND PATHOGENESIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The cause of SWS is somatic mosaic mutations in the GNAQ gene, as identified in a study that performed whole-genome sequencing of affected and normal tissue samples from three patients with SWS [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sturge-weber-syndrome/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. This process identified a GNAQ single-nucleotide variant (c.548G&rarr;A, p.Arg183Gln) shared by affected tissue from all three patients. The mutation was also found in samples of affected tissue from 23 of 26 subjects (88 percent) with SWS and 12 of 13 subjects (92 percent) with nonsyndromic (isolated) port wine stains, but in none of 4 subjects with other cerebrovascular malformations and in none of 6 control subjects. The prevalence of the mutation in affected tissues ranged from 1 to 18 percent. These findings confirm the longstanding hypothesis that the capillary-venous malformations of SWS, historically called angiomata, result from somatic mutations in fetal ectodermal tissues that cause inappropriate control or maturation of capillary blood vessel formation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sturge-weber-syndrome/abstract/2,3\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,3</a>].</p><p>The GNAQ gene encodes a guanine nucleotide binding protein, G-alpha-q, that functions to regulate intracellular signaling pathways. The p.Arg183Gln somatic GNAQ mutation activates a set of signalling pathways that are thought to result in either nonsyndromic port wine stains or SWS, depending upon what stage of embryonic development is affected [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sturge-weber-syndrome/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Somatic mutations in GNAQ occurring at a later stage in embryogenesis may affect only precursors of vascular endothelial cells and lead to nonsyndromic port wine stains, while those occurring at an earlier stage may affect a greater variety of precursor cells and lead to SWS.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL FEATURES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>SWS is characterized by a facial capillary malformation (port wine stain) and an associated leptomeningeal capillary-venous malformation (leptomeningeal angioma) involving the brain and eye [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sturge-weber-syndrome/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. These vascular malformations are associated with specific neurologic and ocular abnormalities.</p><p>The neurologic features of SWS may be progressive and include seizures, focal neurologic deficits, and mental retardation. Visual field defects are common when the occipital cortex is affected. These manifestations occur with variable severity. Hydrocephalus also may occur [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sturge-weber-syndrome/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. This complication is thought to result from increased venous pressure caused by thrombosis of the deep venous channels or extensive arteriovenous anastomoses. A small proportion of patients have no neurologic abnormalities.</p><p>The reasons for neurologic progression in SWS are uncertain. A possible mechanism is hypoxic-ischemic injury to tissue adjacent to the leptomeningeal capillary-venous malformation. This is supported by findings in some patients of reduced cellular glucose metabolism, possibly resulting from decreased cerebral blood flow [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sturge-weber-syndrome/abstract/6,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,7</a>]. Other proposed mechanisms are venous occlusion and increased venous pressure.</p><p>Ocular features of SWS include glaucoma and capillary-venous vascular malformations of the conjunctiva, episclera, choroid, and retina [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sturge-weber-syndrome/abstract/8,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,9</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Port wine stain</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Cutaneous port wine stain (capillary malformation) is the most common type of vascular malformation, occurring in 0.3 percent of newborn infants (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F73343\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef73343 \">picture 1</a>). However, only a small proportion of children with port wine stains have SWS. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=capillary-malformations-port-wine-stains-and-associated-syndromes\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Capillary malformations (port wine stains) and associated syndromes&quot;</a>.)</p><p>In SWS, the port wine stain typically is present on the forehead and upper eyelid, primarily in the distribution of the first or second division of the trigeminal nerve [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sturge-weber-syndrome/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. In one report, 274 patients had port wine stains located in the distribution of the trigeminal nerve, and involvement of the eye or central nervous system was noted in 22 (8 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sturge-weber-syndrome/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. All 22 patients of these patients had a port wine stain in the first or second division of the trigeminal nerve. Although traditionally considered important in determining meningeal involvement risk, the location of the capillary malformation (port wine stain) on the face is not a good indicator of the risk of an underlying meningeal capillary malformation. However, the midface and the meninges do share a common embryological origin [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sturge-weber-syndrome/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. Extension of the skin lesion to both sides of the face and the trunk and extremities is common.</p><p>The skin lesion usually is obvious at birth. However, its appearance changes with age and its size increases as the patient grows. In the newborn, the lesion is flat and usually light pink in color. It typically darkens with age to a deep red, port wine appearance, and vascular ectasias develop (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F58831\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef58831 \">picture 2</a>). The vascular ectasias produce nodularity and superficial blebbing, which lead to overgrowth of the underlying soft tissues and sometimes the bone. Dental abnormalities may occur as a result of gingival thickening if this area is affected. By the fifth decade, 65 percent of patients with a facial port wine stain have hypertrophy and nodularity within the lesion.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Leptomeningeal vascular malformation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A leptomeningeal capillary-venous malformation (historically referred to as leptomeningeal angioma) occurs in 10 to 20 percent of cases when a typical facial lesion is present. The intracerebral capillary-venous malformation usually occurs on the same side as the port wine stain. The parietal and occipital areas are affected most commonly, although any portion of the cerebrum can be involved. Leptomeningeal capillary-venous malformation seldom occurs without an accompanying facial capillary malformation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sturge-weber-syndrome/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>].</p><p>The pathologic appearance of the leptomeninges includes thickening and discoloration caused by the increased vascularity. The capillary-venous malformation typically fills the subarachnoid space in the sulci, and large tortuous venous structures most commonly drain into the deep venous system, but may also drain into superficial veins. The underlying parenchyma may be atrophic and contain multiple calcific granular deposits. The intraparenchymal calcification is the result of chronic tissue ischemia caused by venous stasis, a phenomenon known as dystrophic calcification.</p><p>There is evidence that the leptomeningeal capillary-venous malformations in SWS are not static lesions but rather undergo angiogenic remodeling. In one study, the abnormal tissue vessels showed an increased expression of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), VEGF receptors, and angiopoietin receptor TIE2 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sturge-weber-syndrome/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. These findings may lead to the development of new therapeutic strategies in SWS.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h2\">Seizures</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Seizures occurred in 80 percent of patients with SWS in one series of 171 subjects with SWS [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sturge-weber-syndrome/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. Several reports have found that the risk of epilepsy is associated with the presence of bilateral port wine stains [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sturge-weber-syndrome/abstract/14-16\" class=\"abstract_t\">14-16</a>]. As an example, in the series of 171 subjects with SWS, seizures were more common with bilateral than unilateral port wine stains (87 versus 71 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sturge-weber-syndrome/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. In another report, seizures occurred in 93 percent of patients with bilateral leptomeningeal lesions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sturge-weber-syndrome/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. In one case series of six patients with SWS who underwent epilepsy surgery, pathologic examination in all patients revealed a cortical malformation (polymicrogyria, cortical dysplasia) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sturge-weber-syndrome/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>].</p><p>Seizures in SWS may develop at any age, although they usually start in early childhood. In one study of 171 patients with SWS, seizures began by one, two, and five years of age in 75, 86, and 95 percent of affected patients, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sturge-weber-syndrome/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. In another report of 77 children and adults with SWS and at least one witnessed seizure, the median age of seizure onset was six months [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sturge-weber-syndrome/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. A pattern of severe seizures occurring in clusters was noted in 30 patients (39 percent). In patients with this pattern, seizures occurred in clusters of 1 to 21 (median 5) over a period of 1 to 10 days (median 2).</p><p>Seizures are often the first symptom of SWS. They may occur in the setting of an acute illness and may be associated with the acute onset of hemiparesis. (See <a href=\"#H11\" class=\"local\">'Hemiparesis'</a> below.)</p><p>Initially, seizures are typically focal, but often become generalized tonic-clonic. Less often, infantile spasms or myoclonic or atonic seizures are seen.</p><p>The success of controlling seizures with anticonvulsant medication is variable and unpredictable. Some patients have long intervals without seizures, even without medication, while others have frequent or prolonged seizures despite high doses of multiple medications.</p><p>The occurrence of seizures, the age at onset, and the response to treatment affect prognosis. Onset before one year and poor response to anticonvulsant therapy are associated with a greater likelihood of cognitive impairment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sturge-weber-syndrome/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h2\">Hemiparesis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Hemiparesis often develops acutely in conjunction with the onset of seizures [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sturge-weber-syndrome/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. The deficit occurs contralateral to the intracranial lesion. The paretic extremity usually does not grow at a normal rate, resulting in hemiatrophy.</p><p>Some affected children have progressive loss of motor function or have a series of stroke-like events. The mechanism for this deterioration is uncertain. Possible mechanisms include a cumulative effect of repeated thrombotic events within the leptomeningeal capillary-venous malformation or chronic disturbance of blood flow and oxygen delivery to the involved tissues.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h2\">Intellectual disability (mental retardation)</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Children with SWS typically develop normally for several months after birth, then manifest developmental delay. However, the course of cognitive change in children with SWS is highly variable, including both increases and decreases in intelligence quotient (IQ) over time. Factors associated with a lower outcome IQ include baseline abnormalities on electroencephalography (EEG), high seizure frequency, and early frontal lobe involvement on brain MRI [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sturge-weber-syndrome/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. Cognitive impairment can be obvious soon after birth, especially in infants with extensive brain involvement. </p><p>In one report, mental retardation occurred in 60 percent of patients and was severe in 33 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sturge-weber-syndrome/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. In another study, mental handicap occurred in approximately one-half of affected adults [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sturge-weber-syndrome/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>].</p><p>Cognitive function is poorest in patients with bilateral intracerebral lesions. In one report of 122 patients with SWS, only 8 percent of patients with bilateral leptomeningeal capillary-venous malformations were intellectually normal [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sturge-weber-syndrome/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h2\">Behavioral problems</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Behavioral problems are more common in children with SWS than in their unaffected siblings [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sturge-weber-syndrome/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. The risk for behavioral problems is associated with poorer cognitive function and the presence of epilepsy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sturge-weber-syndrome/abstract/22,23\" class=\"abstract_t\">22,23</a>]. However, behavioral problems can occur in patients with normal intelligence.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14\"><span class=\"h2\">Visual field defects</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Many patients have visual field defects, typically a homonymous hemianopia. This is due to the presence of a leptomeningeal capillary-venous malformation affecting one or both occipital lobes or optic tracts. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=homonymous-hemianopia\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Homonymous hemianopia&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H941379\"><span class=\"h2\">Glaucoma</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The predominant ocular abnormality of SWS is glaucoma (increased intraocular pressure), which occurs in 30 to 70 percent of affected patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sturge-weber-syndrome/abstract/8,24\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,24</a>]. The risk of glaucoma is highest in the first decade. Congenital glaucoma is seen in approximately one-half of patients with SWS and presents in newborns with enlargement of the globe (buphthalmos). Occasional patients develop glaucoma as adults. Thus, continued vigilance is needed, even in patients with initially normal intraocular pressure. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-glaucoma-in-infants-and-children#H11\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of glaucoma in infants and children&quot;, section on 'Sturge-Weber syndrome'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H941386\"><span class=\"h2\">Other ophthalmologic findings</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Other ophthalmologic complications include vascular anomalies, heterochromia of the iris, and visual field defects [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sturge-weber-syndrome/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Capillary-venous malformation of the choroid (also known as choroidal hemangioma) occurs in 30 to 40 percent of patients with SWS and can lead to increased intraocular pressure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sturge-weber-syndrome/abstract/8,24,25\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,24,25</a>]. These lesions may be diffuse or localized within the retina (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F74289\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef74289 \">picture 3</a>).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Episcleral and conjunctival lesions include anomalous vessels or capillary-venous malformations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sturge-weber-syndrome/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. In a series of 51 children with SWS, episcleral or conjunctival hemangiomas occurred in 69 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sturge-weber-syndrome/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Heterochromia of the iris originally was noted by Weber. The more deeply pigmented iris usually is ipsilateral to the facial angioma. The pigmentation is caused by aggregated melanocytic hamartomata on the anterior surface of the iris.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H941075\"><span class=\"h2\">Neuroendocrine aspects</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The incidence of growth hormone deficiency in SWS is increased up to 18-fold compared with the general population [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sturge-weber-syndrome/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. Growth hormone deficiency occurs without neuroimaging evidence of pituitary or hypothalamic abnormalities. Central hypothyroidism has also been reported in SWS [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sturge-weber-syndrome/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. Since both of these conditions can be effectively treated, appropriate screening tests should be obtained if indicated.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15\"><span class=\"h1\">DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The diagnosis of SWS is based upon demonstration of the facial capillary malformations and leptomeningeal capillary-venous malformations. Occasional patients who have the leptomeningeal lesion but no facial lesion are identified when neurologic problems develop. These patients also may have glaucoma or other ocular features of the disorder.</p><p>SWS should be distinguished from Klippel-Trenaunay syndrome. In the latter, extensive capillary malformations associated with dysplastic veins involve the limbs and trunk, often with hypertrophy of the affected extremity.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H16\"><span class=\"h2\">Neuroimaging</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The preferred neuroimaging technique for the diagnosis of SWS is brain MRI with gadolinium contrast, which demonstrates the presence of the leptomeningeal capillary-venous malformation and the extent of involvement with brain structures (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F57902%7EPEDS%2F59833%7EPEDS%2F63073\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef57902 graphicRef59833 graphicRef63073 \">image 1A-C</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sturge-weber-syndrome/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. In some cases, leptomeningeal involvement may not be detected by neuroimaging during infancy and becomes apparent later [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sturge-weber-syndrome/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. There is a general consensus among experts that a negative brain MRI with gadolinium at one year of age can reliably exclude the presence of a leptomeningeal lesion. If MRI is not available, cranial computed tomography can identify brain calcification and provide some anatomic information.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H17\"><span class=\"h3\">Indications</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Approximately 90 percent of infants with facial port wine stains do not have an intracranial lesion and would be expected to develop normally. However, SWS cannot be ruled out by a normal brain MRI in the first few months of life. Given these data, and the need to sedate infants for MRI, it is reasonable to perform imaging in infancy only if specific ocular and neurologic abnormalities (glaucoma, seizures, or hemiparesis) are present.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H18\"><span class=\"h1\">TREATMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>No specific treatment exists for SWS. The cutaneous, ocular, and neurologic manifestations are treated with mixed success. There is increasing agreement among experienced clinicians that low dose <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aspirin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">aspirin</a> may be beneficial, with the rationale that antithrombotic therapy may prevent the progression of impaired cerebral blood flow and hypoxic-ischemic neuronal injury [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sturge-weber-syndrome/abstract/30-33\" class=\"abstract_t\">30-33</a>]. However, no controlled studies exist. There is no increased risk of intracranial hemorrhage in patients with SWS whether on aspirin or not.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H19\"><span class=\"h2\">Cutaneous lesions</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Port wine stains can be treated by selective photothermolysis using a pulsed dye laser. This is discussed in detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=laser-and-light-therapy-for-cutaneous-vascular-lesions#H10061356\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Laser and light therapy for cutaneous vascular lesions&quot;, section on 'Port wine stains'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H20\"><span class=\"h2\">Glaucoma</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The development of topical medications has improved the medical management of glaucoma in SWS [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sturge-weber-syndrome/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. However, topical treatment often is ineffective in normalizing intraocular pressure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sturge-weber-syndrome/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>]. In these cases, the surgical treatment depends upon the etiology of the glaucoma. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-glaucoma-in-infants-and-children#H11\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of glaucoma in infants and children&quot;, section on 'Sturge-Weber syndrome'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H21\"><span class=\"h2\">Seizures</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Management of seizures in SWS often is difficult. In one report, adequate control was accomplished with anticonvulsant therapy in approximately 40 percent of cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sturge-weber-syndrome/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>]. Anticonvulsants are standard first-line therapy for patients with epilepsy related to SWS [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sturge-weber-syndrome/abstract/18,36\" class=\"abstract_t\">18,36</a>], though the optimal regimen is unknown. In a retrospective, single center report that analyzed a database of 108 subjects with SWS and one or more prior seizures, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=carbamazepine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">carbamazepine</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=oxcarbazepine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">oxcarbazepine</a> were associated with better seizure control than <a href=\"topic.htm?path=levetiracetam-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">levetiracetam</a>, but no drug was clearly superior [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sturge-weber-syndrome/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>]. The strength of these observations is limited by the small sample size and retrospective nature of the study.</p><p>In refractory cases, hemispherectomy or more limited surgical resection of epileptogenic tissue may be beneficial, although data are limited [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sturge-weber-syndrome/abstract/38-41\" class=\"abstract_t\">38-41</a>]. The available data suggest that focal resections are less likely to result in good seizure control than hemispherectomy:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a survey of 70 patients identified by the Sturge-Weber Foundation who had a hemispherectomy between 1979 and 2001, 81 percent of the 32 who responded were free of seizures and 53 percent were off anticonvulsants [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sturge-weber-syndrome/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a retrospective review of 27 children with SWS who had surgery for medically resistant epilepsy, functional or anatomic hemispherectomy was followed by complete resolution of seizures in eight of eight patients; with focal resection, seizure-free outcome was reported of 11 of 19 (58 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sturge-weber-syndrome/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>].</p><p/><p>Thus, some experts recommend surgery with hemispherectomy, lobectomy or transection of the corpus callosum for patients with SWS and medically resistant epilepsy (eg, poor seizure control despite treatment for six months with a minimum of two anticonvulsants), particularly when associated with clinically significant hemiparesis, visual field loss, and developmental delay [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sturge-weber-syndrome/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H22\"><span class=\"h1\">PROGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The prognosis for SWS depends upon the extent of the leptomeningeal capillary-venous malformation and its effect on the perfusion of the cerebral cortex, as well as the severity of ocular involvement. Prognosis also is affected by the age of onset of seizures and whether they can be controlled.</p><p>Neurologic function may deteriorate with age.

(See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Clinical features'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Cutaneous port wine stain is the most common type of vascular malformation, occurring in 0.3 percent of newborn infants (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F73343\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef73343 \">picture 1</a>). However, only a small proportion of children with port wine stains have SWS. The port wine stain of SWS typically is present on the forehead and upper eyelid, primarily in the distribution of the first or second division of the trigeminal nerve. Although traditionally considered important in determining meningeal involvement risk, the location of the port wine stain on the face is not a good indicator of the risk of an underlying meningeal capillary malformation. (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Port wine stain'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A leptomeningeal capillary-venous malformation (angioma) occurs in 10 to 20 percent of cases when a typical facial lesion is present. The intracerebral lesion usually occurs on the same side as the port wine stain. The parietal and occipital areas are affected most commonly. (See <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Leptomeningeal vascular malformation'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Ocular features of SWS include glaucoma, vascular malformations of the conjunctiva, episclera, choroid (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F74289\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef74289 \">picture 3</a>) and retina, and heterochromia of the iris. (See <a href=\"#H941379\" class=\"local\">'Glaucoma'</a> above and <a href=\"#H941386\" class=\"local\">'Other ophthalmologic findings'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The neurologic features of SWS may be progressive and include seizures, focal neurologic deficits, visual field defects, and mental retardation. These disorders occur with variable severity. A small proportion of patients have no neurologic abnormalities. Seizures in SWS may develop at any age, although they usually start in early childhood. Hemiparesis often develops acutely in conjunction with the onset of seizures. Some affected children have progressive loss of motor function or have a series of stroke-like events. (See <a href=\"#H10\" class=\"local\">'Seizures'</a> above and <a href=\"#H11\" class=\"local\">'Hemiparesis'</a> above and <a href=\"#H12\" class=\"local\">'Intellectual disability (mental retardation)'</a> above and <a href=\"#H13\" class=\"local\">'Behavioral problems'</a> above and <a href=\"#H14\" class=\"local\">'Visual field defects'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The diagnosis of SWS is based upon demonstration of the facial and leptomeningeal vascular malformations. Occasional patients who have the leptomeningeal capillary-venous malformation but no facial lesion are identified when neurologic problems develop. SWS should be distinguished from Klippel-Trenaunay-Weber syndrome in which extensive capillary angiomata associated with dysplastic veins involve the limbs and trunk, often with hypertrophy of the affected extremity. (See <a href=\"#H15\" class=\"local\">'Diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The preferred diagnostic neuroimaging technique for SWS is brain MRI with gadolinium contrast, which demonstrates the presence of the leptomeningeal capillary-venous malformation and the extent of involvement with brain structures (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F57902%7EPEDS%2F59833%7EPEDS%2F63073\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef57902 graphicRef59833 graphicRef63073 \">image 1A-C</a>). A negative brain MRI with gadolinium at one year of age can reliably exclude the presence of leptomeningeal lesion. (See <a href=\"#H16\" class=\"local\">'Neuroimaging'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>No specific treatment exists for SWS. The cutaneous, ocular, and neurologic manifestations are managed with mixed success. There is increasing agreement among experienced clinicians that low dose <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aspirin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">aspirin</a> may be beneficial, though no controlled studies exist. There is no increased risk of intracranial hemorrhage in patients with SWS whether on aspirin or not.
