Atherosclerotic carotid disease is considered symptomatic if the ipsilateral symptoms occurred within the previous six months. Importantly, nonspecific neurologic symptoms (eg, dizziness, lightheadedness) are not indicative of carotid stenosis. Therefore, patients with these symptoms in isolation should be considered as asymptomatic with regard to carotid disease even if they are found to have carotid artery stenosis.

The prevalence of &quot;severe&quot; stenosis (defined as &ge;70 percent of the lumen diameter) was quite low, ranging from &lt;1 percent for men and women age &lt;70 year up to approximately 3 percent for men and 1 percent for women age &ge;80 years (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F103097\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef103097 \">figure 1</a>).The prevalence of at least &quot;moderate&quot; stenosis (defined as &ge;50 percent of the lumen diameter) was somewhat higher.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6615983\"><span class=\"h2\">Stroke risk</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The most feared consequence of carotid atherosclerosis is ischemic stroke.

The following strategies are advocated by different experts:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Intensive medical management with statins, antiplatelet agents, treatment of hypertension and diabetes, and healthy lifestyle changes, rather than carotid revascularization. This approach has gained favor with mounting evidence that modern medical therapy has reduced risk of stroke for patients with asymptomatic carotid disease since the landmark carotid endarterectomy trials of the 1990s and early 2000s that established the advantage of carotid endarterectomy compared with medical therapy of the time. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-asymptomatic-carotid-atherosclerotic-disease#H1424714856\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of asymptomatic carotid atherosclerotic disease&quot;, section on 'Medical management'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Revascularization with carotid endarterectomy for most medically stable patients with asymptomatic carotid stenosis of 60 to 99 percent, along with intensive medical management.

This approach relies on the use of putative markers of high stroke risk, a list which includes the progression of asymptomatic carotid stenosis, the detection of asymptomatic carotid embolism, carotid plaque burden and morphology, reduced cerebrovascular reserve, the presence of silent embolic infarcts, and ultrasound-identified micro-embolization.

However, there is general agreement that the short-term (periprocedural) risk of stroke and death is higher with carotid artery stenting, whereas the risk of myocardial ischemia is greater with endarterectomy.

Cerebral angiography is the gold standard for imaging the carotid arteries, but is not appropriate for screening because of its invasive nature, attendant risk of complications, high cost, and risk of morbidity.

Interobserver agreement in detecting a carotid bruit by physicians is relatively high (kappa = 0.67) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/screening-for-asymptomatic-carotid-artery-stenosis/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. A meta-analysis suggested that the presence of a carotid bruit increases the risk of cerebrovascular disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/screening-for-asymptomatic-carotid-artery-stenosis/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. However, a bruit alone is a poor predictor of either underlying carotid stenosis or stroke risk in asymptomatic patients, as reflected by the following:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a meta-analysis of symptomatic and asymptomatic patients, the sensitivity and specificity of a carotid bruit for a 70 to 99 percent stenosis carotid lesion were 53 percent and 83 percent, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/screening-for-asymptomatic-carotid-artery-stenosis/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The Framingham Heart Study found that an asymptomatic carotid bruit was associated with an approximate doubling of the expected stroke risk [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/screening-for-asymptomatic-carotid-artery-stenosis/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. However, the majority of strokes occurred in a vascular territory different from the carotid bruit, suggesting that a carotid bruit is a marker of generalized atherosclerosis.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The Systolic Hypertension in the Elderly Program (SHEP) found that the presence of a carotid bruit was associated with a nonsignificant overall relative risk of 1.29 for stroke over a mean follow-up of 4.2 years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/screening-for-asymptomatic-carotid-artery-stenosis/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A study of 241 older nursing home residents (mean age 86 years) found that 12 percent had asymptomatic carotid bruits [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/screening-for-asymptomatic-carotid-artery-stenosis/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. The three-year cumulative incidence of cerebrovascular events was similar for patients with and without bruits (10 and 9 percent, respectively). Furthermore, baseline carotid bruits disappeared in 60 percent of surviving residents; loss of the bruit was not due to a cerebrovascular event.</p><p/><p>The poor predictive value of carotid bruits in asymptomatic individuals is in part related to the low prevalence of significant carotid stenosis in this population.</p><p>Bruits are a better indicator of general atherosclerotic disease than of stroke risk [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/screening-for-asymptomatic-carotid-artery-stenosis/abstract/9,12-14\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,12-14</a>]. The rate of myocardial infarction and cardiovascular death in patients with carotid bruits is twice that of patients without carotid bruits [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/screening-for-asymptomatic-carotid-artery-stenosis/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. Patients with carotid artery disease are more likely to die from cardiovascular than cerebrovascular disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/screening-for-asymptomatic-carotid-artery-stenosis/abstract/15,16\" class=\"abstract_t\">15,16</a>]. Nonetheless, risk stratification to identify patients at high risk for cardiovascular disease is most commonly based upon the Framingham risk score, <strong>not</strong> the presence or absence of carotid bruits. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cardiovascular-disease-risk-assessment-for-primary-prevention-our-approach\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Cardiovascular disease risk assessment for primary prevention: Our approach&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=screening-for-coronary-heart-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Screening for coronary heart disease&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15\"><span class=\"h1\">BENEFITS AND HARMS OF SCREENING</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The potential benefit of carotid screening depends on identifying people with asymptomatic carotid stenosis whose stroke risk would be reduced with carotid revascularization or more intensive medical treatment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/screening-for-asymptomatic-carotid-artery-stenosis/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. The potential harms associated with screening include risks associated with the screening procedure itself and risks associated with carotid revascularization or other interventions. The risks of screening studies also include false positive findings and the need for confirmatory testing. The reliability of carotid duplex screening is variable among laboratories and is operator-dependent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/screening-for-asymptomatic-carotid-artery-stenosis/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. False-positive tests cause patient anxiety and the potential for additional testing and unnecessary surgical procedures.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H428126487\"><span class=\"h2\">Our approach</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Consistent with national guidelines (see <a href=\"#H428126481\" class=\"local\">'Recommendations of others'</a> below), we suggest <strong>not</strong> screening asymptomatic individuals for carotid artery stenosis with vascular imaging tests. Although there have been no randomized controlled trials evaluating the utility of screening for carotid artery stenosis, general screening for carotid stenosis in asymptomatic individuals does not appear to be warranted based upon the following observations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/screening-for-asymptomatic-carotid-artery-stenosis/abstract/17,19,20\" class=\"abstract_t\">17,19,20</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The prevalence of asymptomatic carotid stenosis in the population is low; for severe (&ge;70 percent) carotid stenosis, the prevalence increases with age from approximately 0 to 3 percent. (See <a href=\"#H240467881\" class=\"local\">'Prevalence'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The annual risk of ipsilateral stroke in patients with asymptomatic carotid artery stenosis is relatively low (&le;1 percent annually). (See <a href=\"#H6615983\" class=\"local\">'Stroke risk'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>There are no validated, reliable clinical characteristics or markers that could identify a subset of asymptomatic individuals likely to have carotid stenosis who also would benefit from carotid revascularization.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The routine use of duplex ultrasonography to detect asymptomatic carotid stenosis, a low-prevalence condition found in approximately 1 percent of the general population, would result in many more false-positive results than true-positive results, which in turn could lead to many unnecessary interventions, including additional testing and carotid revascularization, with its attendant morbidity and mortality [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/screening-for-asymptomatic-carotid-artery-stenosis/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. Both carotid endarterectomy and carotid stenting are associated with an increased 30-day risk of stroke and death. These risks are variable between surgeons and centers, but are in the range of 2 to 4 percent for endarterectomy performed in the context of randomized trials for asymptomatic carotid stenosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/screening-for-asymptomatic-carotid-artery-stenosis/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. Complication rates may be higher in low-volume settings.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients with asymptomatic carotid stenosis, the absolute reduction in stroke risk with carotid endarterectomy was small when compared with the now-outdated medical treatment employed in the randomized trials of the time (2004 and earlier). This small benefit of revascularization may have been reduced or eliminated with subsequent advances in medical therapy.

However, they note that it is reasonable to screen (with duplex ultrasonography) asymptomatic individuals who have a carotid bruit, and that duplex ultrasonography screening of the carotid arteries &quot;may be considered&quot; for patients who have symptomatic atherosclerotic disease in another vascular bed (ie, peripheral arterial disease, coronary disease, or aortic aneurysm), or have two or more risk factors for atherosclerotic disease.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1336189216\"><span class=\"h1\">SOCIETY GUIDELINE LINKS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Links to society and government-sponsored guidelines from selected countries and regions around the world are provided separately.
