These episodes are brought on by certain things, such as:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Heavy exercise</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Eating a lot of carbohydrates &ndash; Carbohydrates are sugars and starches that are in food.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Stress</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Not eating for long periods of time</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Very cold air</p><p/><p>There are different types of periodic paralysis, depending on the cause. The different types are:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Hypo</strong>kalemic &ndash; &quot;Hypokalemia&quot; is the medical term for low levels of potassium in the blood. Potassium is a salt that cells need to work normally. Too much or too little potassium can cause problems. Hypokalemic periodic paralysis happens when there is too little potassium in the body.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Hyper</strong>kalemic &ndash; &quot;Hyperkalemia&quot; is the medical term for high levels of potassium in the blood. Hyperkalemic periodic paralysis usually happens when there is too much potassium in the body.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Thyrotoxic &ndash; This is a type of hypokalemic periodic paralysis, but it is caused by a condition called hyperthyroidism. In hyperthyroidism, a gland called the thyroid is overactive and makes too much thyroid hormone (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F66834\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef66834 \">figure 1</a>).</p><p/><p>Except in rare cases, people who have periodic paralysis are born with it. The condition is caused by an abnormal gene and usually runs in families. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H544994211\"><span class=\"h1\">What are the symptoms of periodic paralysis syndrome?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In general, periodic paralysis causes sudden episodes of muscle weakness that affect the whole body. These episodes do not make people pass out.</p><p>Hypokalemic periodic paralysis episodes usually happen once every few weeks or months. Each episode usually lasts a few hours, but an episode can last for days.</p><p>Hyperkalemic periodic paralysis episodes usually happen more often, sometimes every day. But each episode is not usually as severe and does not usually last as long. </p><p>Some patients with periodic paralysis develop muscle weakness (that lasts all the time) later in life. These symptoms get worse slowly over time.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H544994226\"><span class=\"h1\">Will I need tests?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>It depends on whether the condition is known to run in your family. If the condition runs in your family, you probably won't need any tests.</p><p>If the condition isn't known to run in your family, your doctor will order tests. He or she will try to have the tests done when you are having symptoms. Tests that are commonly done include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Blood tests</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>An electrocardiogram (also called an &quot;ECG&quot; or &quot;EKG&quot;) &ndash; This test measures the electrical activity in your heart (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F53145\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef53145 \">figure 2</a>). Too little or too much potassium in the body can affect the heart.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Electromyography (also called &quot;EMG&quot;) &ndash; This test shows how well a person's nerves and muscles are working.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H544994264\"><span class=\"h1\">How is periodic paralysis syndrome treated?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Periodic paralysis is treated in different ways.</p><p>Some treatments can help stop or shorten episodes of muscle weakness. Hypokalemic periodic paralysis episodes are treated with potassium that people take by mouth. This treatment helps raise the level of potassium in the body to a normal level.</p><p>Hyperkalemic periodic paralysis episodes do not always need treatment, because they usually last for a short time only. But they are sometimes treated with medicines that lower the level of potassium in the body.</p><p>Other treatments can help prevent episodes of periodic paralysis from happening. These include lifestyle changes and medicines.</p><p>Lifestyle changes that can help prevent episodes:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Avoiding heavy exercise</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Eating a diet that is low in carbohydrates</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Avoiding foods with high levels of potassium, if you have hyperkalemic periodic paralysis (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F58250\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef58250 \">table 1</a>)</p><p/><p>If these lifestyle changes don't help enough, your doctor will talk with you about taking a daily medicine to help prevent symptoms. The medicine your doctor prescribes will depend on the type of periodic paralysis you have.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H544994302\"><span class=\"h1\">What else should I do if I have periodic paralysis syndrome?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Be sure to let your other doctors and nurses know that you have this condition. That way, if you ever have a procedure or surgery, the doctor can make sure your potassium level doesn't get too low or too high. Doctors might also avoid giving you medicines that affect your potassium level.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H544994317\"><span class=\"h1\">More on this topic</span></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=hyperkalemia-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Hyperkalemia (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=exercise-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Exercise (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=hyperthyroidism-overactive-thyroid-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Hyperthyroidism (overactive thyroid) (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=hypokalemia-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Hypokalemia (The Basics)</a></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=low-potassium-diet-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Low-potassium diet (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=exercise-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Exercise (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=hyperthyroidism-overactive-thyroid-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Hyperthyroidism (overactive thyroid) (Beyond the Basics)</a></p></div><div id=\"reviewProcess\"><span>All topics are updated as new evidence becomes available and our <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/home/editorial-policy\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"policy policy_editorialpolicy\">peer review process</a> is complete.</span></div><div id=\"topicRetrievedDate\"><span class=\"emphasis\">This topic retrieved from UpToDate on: </span>Apr 03, 2018.</div><div id=\"disclaimer\">The content on the UpToDate website is not intended nor recommended as a substitute for medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.
