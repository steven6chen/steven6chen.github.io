Classical systemic inflammatory diseases include connective tissue diseases, vasculitis, and granulomatous diseases (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F70616\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef70616 \">table 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pericardial-involvement-in-systemic-autoimmune-diseases/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Cardiac involvement is not uncommon in systemic inflammatory diseases, although major cardiac problems are not usually the presenting manifestation. The reported frequency of cardiac involvement is variable depending on the applied diagnostic methods and patient selection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pericardial-involvement-in-systemic-autoimmune-diseases/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Technological improvements in imaging modalities and the increasing availability of diagnostic imaging have revealed a higher frequency of cardiac abnormalities in patients with systemic inflammatory diseases than in older autopsy studies. </p><p>Systemic inflammatory diseases may affect the pericardium (pericarditis and pericardial effusion), myocardium (myocarditis, cardiomyopathy, rhythm and conduction disturbances, heart failure), coronary arteries (acute coronary syndromes, ischemic heart disease), endocardium (valvular disease, thrombi), and major vessels (aneurysm formation, arterial and venous thrombosis) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pericardial-involvement-in-systemic-autoimmune-diseases/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>]. On rare occasions, pericardial effusion <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> pericarditis may be the first clues of a systemic inflammatory disease or a manifestation of a known systemic disease. In these cases, pericardial involvement generally reflects the activity of the systemic disease. </p><p>This topic will focus on the pericardial complications of systemic autoimmune diseases. A detailed discussion of non-pericardial cardiac manifestations of systemic autoimmune diseases is presented separately.

Pericardial involvement in systemic inflammatory disease is thought to be immune-mediated, although concomitant infection may play a role in some cases. Systemic inflammatory diseases may be either &quot;etiologic&quot; or &quot;permissive&quot; of increased susceptibility to an unrelated primary cause (eg, viral) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pericardial-involvement-in-systemic-autoimmune-diseases/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p>While some patients may manifest with the typical signs and symptoms of pericarditis (fever, pleuritic chest pain) or a hemodynamically significant effusion (dyspnea, fatigue, hypotension), many are incidentally found to have pericardial involvement during other testing (electrocardiography, echocardiography, computed tomography of the chest, or magnetic resonance imaging of the heart). Symptoms of pericardial involvement in systemic inflammatory disease may be insidious or may present suddenly with rapid progression. Cardiac tamponade and constrictive pericarditis are possible, but rare, complications. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acute-pericarditis-clinical-presentation-and-diagnostic-evaluation#H3\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Acute pericarditis: Clinical presentation and diagnostic evaluation&quot;, section on 'Clinical features'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diagnosis-and-treatment-of-pericardial-effusion#H5\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Diagnosis and treatment of pericardial effusion&quot;, section on 'Diagnostic approach'</a>.)</p><p>A definitive diagnosis of pericardial involvement in systemic inflammatory diseases requires the finding of specific histological lesions in the pericardium or of characteristic pericardial fluid features [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pericardial-involvement-in-systemic-autoimmune-diseases/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. However, in clinical practice, the diagnosis is often presumptive, especially when pericardial fluid or tissue is not available (as in mild pericardial involvement with small to moderate effusions that are responsive to medical therapy) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pericardial-involvement-in-systemic-autoimmune-diseases/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].

When a patient with pericardial involvement is asymptomatic, treatment is essentially that of the underlying systemic disease. Patients with a hemodynamically significant pericardial effusion should have the fluid drained (eg, pericardiocentesis or pericardiotomy) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pericardial-involvement-in-systemic-autoimmune-diseases/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Most patients with symptoms of acute pericarditis should be treated with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=colchicine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">colchicine</a> (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F56484\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef56484 \">table 2</a>). In select patients with refractory symptoms despite optimal medical therapy, case reports suggest that the interleukin receptor blocker anakinra may be effective in reducing symptoms and signs of inflammation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pericardial-involvement-in-systemic-autoimmune-diseases/abstract/4-6\" class=\"abstract_t\">4-6</a>].

Pericardial involvement, typically a pericardial effusion, is the most common type of echocardiographic abnormality found in SLE, being reported in &gt;50 percent of patients, and is usually asymptomatic. Large <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> hemodynamically significant effusions resulting in cardiac tamponade are rare in SLE, as is the late development of constrictive pericarditis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pericardial-involvement-in-systemic-autoimmune-diseases/abstract/8,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,9</a>]. When pericardial fluid is available for analysis, specific findings may include antinuclear antibodies, phagocytic cells containing nuclei, low complement levels, and immune complexes similar to those seen in pleural effusions. However, in clinical practice, such findings in pericardial fluid add little to similar tests performed on a patient's serum. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=non-coronary-cardiac-manifestations-of-systemic-lupus-erythematosus-in-adults#H8\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Non-coronary cardiac manifestations of systemic lupus erythematosus in adults&quot;, section on 'Pericardial disease'</a>.)</p><p>Pericarditis is the second most frequent type of pericardial involvement, either acute or recurrent. Pericarditis often occurs when SLE is active and may be associated with other types of serositis (ie, pleural effusion, ascites). The course is generally benign in the large majority of patients with pericardial disease. When symptomatic, however, patients with pericarditis usually respond to nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F56484\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef56484 \">table 2</a>). When given along with NSAIDs, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=colchicine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">colchicine</a>&nbsp;may reduce the risk of recurrent pericarditis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pericardial-involvement-in-systemic-autoimmune-diseases/abstract/9-11\" class=\"abstract_t\">9-11</a>].

During the course of their disease, &lt;10 percent of patients with rheumatoid arthritis will develop pericarditis, although up to one-third have pericardial effusions which are usually asymptomatic. Pericarditis occurs most frequently in patients with active rheumatoid disease and other extra-articular manifestations. As such, most patients with symptomatic pericarditis have a positive serum test for rheumatoid factor. Management should be aimed at the control of the rheumatoid arthritis, though NSAIDs and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=colchicine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">colchicine</a> can be given for symptomatic pericarditis (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F56484\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef56484 \">table 2</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pericardial-involvement-in-systemic-autoimmune-diseases/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>].

In the 70s, the term &quot;adult Still's disease&quot; (ASD) was used to describe a series of adult patients who did not fulfill criteria for classic rheumatoid arthritis (RA) but had features similar to the children with systemic juvenile RA. Pericarditis has been reported in up to one-third of patients, and myocarditis in about 10 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pericardial-involvement-in-systemic-autoimmune-diseases/abstract/13,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,14</a>].

When present, cardiac complications are most commonly secondary to systemic or pulmonary hypertension, but primary cardiac involvement also occurs. Symptomatic pericarditis occurs in 7 to 20 percent of patients with systemic sclerosis, but pathologic evidence of pericardial involvement is observed in 70 to 80 percent of patients at autopsy. Pericardial effusions may be small or large and can develop rapidly, also leading to cardiac tamponade [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pericardial-involvement-in-systemic-autoimmune-diseases/abstract/15,16\" class=\"abstract_t\">15,16</a>]. Patients with symptomatic cardiac involvement due to systemic sclerosis (SS) have a poor prognosis, with two- and five-year mortality rates of approximately 60 and 75 percent, respectively.

Rheumatic fever in general and pericarditis associated with rheumatic fever have become relatively rare in developed countries due to the routine use of antibiotics for pharyngitis. Acute pericarditis is a sign of active rheumatic carditis, usually occurring at the initial episode in the first week following fever and arthritis. Occasionally pericarditis may be the first sign of acute rheumatic fever.

In general, affected vessels vary in size, type, and location in association with the specific vasculitic disorder. Classically, the vasculitic syndromes have been categorized by the predominant sizes of the involved blood vessels (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F79462\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef79462 \">table 4</a>).

Familial clustering, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=colchicine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">colchicine</a> failure, and need of immunosuppressive therapies may represent clues for investigating mutations related to autoinflammatory diseases in these patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pericardial-involvement-in-systemic-autoimmune-diseases/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>].

Cardiac involvement (affecting the pericardium, myocardium, endocardium, and coronary arteries) is not uncommon in systemic inflammatory diseases, although major cardiac problems are not usually the presenting manifestation. (See <a href=\"#H1817334\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pericardial involvement in seen in a variety of systemic inflammatory diseases, including systemic lupus erythematosus, rheumatoid arthritis, adult Still's disease, systemic sclerosis, dermatomyositis, polymyositis, mixed connective tissue disease, Sj&ouml;gren's syndrome, sarcoidosis, rheumatic fever, and the vasculitides. (See <a href=\"#H814268\" class=\"local\">'Specific systemic inflammatory diseases with pericardial involvement'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The most common types of pericardial involvement with systemic inflammatory diseases are acute (or recurrent) pericarditis and asymptomatic pericardial effusions. While some patients may manifest with the typical signs and symptoms of pericarditis (fever, pleuritic chest pain) or a hemodynamically significant effusion (dyspnea, fatigue, hypotension), many are incidentally found to have pericardial involvement during other testing (electrocardiography, echocardiography, computed tomography of the chest). Rarely, constrictive pericarditis can develop due to marked inflammation of the pericardium, and it may respond to NSAIDs or steroid therapy. (See <a href=\"#H814260\" class=\"local\">'Clinical presentation, diagnosis, and treatment'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The treatment approach to pericardial involvement in systemic inflammatory diseases is dependent on symptoms:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>When a patient with pericardial involvement is asymptomatic, treatment is essentially that of the underlying systemic disease. (See <a href=\"#H814260\" class=\"local\">'Clinical presentation, diagnosis, and treatment'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Patients with a hemodynamically significant pericardial effusion should have the fluid drained (eg, pericardiocentesis or pericardiotomy). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cardiac-tamponade#H21697510\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Cardiac tamponade&quot;, section on 'Choosing percutaneous or surgical drainage'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Most patients with symptoms of acute pericarditis should be treated with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=colchicine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">colchicine</a> (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F56484\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef56484 \">table 2</a>).
