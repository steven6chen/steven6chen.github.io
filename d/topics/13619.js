The prevalence of overuse injuries is difficult to determine since they may not result in emergency department or clinician visits. The likelihood of such injuries may be increased by emphasizing sport-specific skills rather than overall fitness [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/physical-activity-and-strength-training-in-children-and-adolescents-an-overview/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>].

Clinicians, parents, coaches, teachers, and program directors can help each participant to safely and effectively meet his or her unique needs.

Warm-up activities increase body temperature and blood flow to active musculature, and stimulate metabolism.</p><p>Each exercise session also should be followed by a 10- to 15-minute active cool-down period that includes light aerobic exercise and stretching.

Training adaptations are specific to the type and mode of training and the total overload. Greater transfer of training adaptations to performance is achieved when resistance exercises closely simulate the actions of the specific sport.</p><p>A well-rounded general strength-training program can meet the needs of most youth. Such a program can increase muscular strength and endurance, speed, and power. Athletic performance, on the other hand, is optimized by matching the demands of the sport with the training program: training the appropriate metabolic systems and duplicating sport-specific joint velocities and angular movements.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H27\"><span class=\"h3\">Overload</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>For neuromuscular adaptation (training effect) to occur, the training stimulus must be greater than that to which the participant is normally accustomed. A strength-training overload is applied through the choice and order of exercises, load, sets, repetitions, rest periods, and frequency of training. The load can be applied through various forms of resistance (eg, free weights, machines, body weight, elastic cords, etc.). The type of load may influence the benefit of strength training. In a meta-analysis, anisometric (also called isotonic) training programs had a greater effect than isometric training programs, but the effect sizes were not statistically significantly different [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/physical-activity-and-strength-training-in-children-and-adolescents-an-overview/abstract/69\" class=\"abstract_t\">69</a>].</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Choice and order of exercises</strong> &ndash; When choosing exercises, it is important that the child fits the equipment and that the skills and technique to perform the exercise are properly taught. Six to eight exercises that train the major muscle groups (chest, shoulders, back, arms, legs, abdomen, lower back) should be selected with appropriate balance across joints (ie, flexors and extensors), as well as between upper and lower body muscle groups.<br/><br/>Participants should be encouraged to train all the major muscle groups, rather than a limited number (eg, chest and arms). Because of the potential for lower back injuries during strength training, exercises that strengthen the core (ie, abdomen and lower back) should be included in all training programs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/physical-activity-and-strength-training-in-children-and-adolescents-an-overview/abstract/9,11,41\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,11,41</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H15\" class=\"local\">'Injury prevention'</a> above.)<br/><br/>Most exercises should be performed through the full natural functional range of motion to properly develop strength and prevent loss of flexibility [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/physical-activity-and-strength-training-in-children-and-adolescents-an-overview/abstract/11,39,40,56\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,39,40,56</a>]. Exceptions include exercises that place undue stress on joint capsules or have extreme ranges of motion, such as bar dips and supine dumbbell flies. These exercises should be performed only to the point of the upper arm being parallel to the ground (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F65981\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef65981 \">picture 2</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F61592\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef61592 \">picture 3</a>).<br/><br/>There is no optimal order for performing exercises. Common practice is to perform multi-joint exercises before single joint exercises, complex movements before simple movements, and large muscle groups before small muscle groups. Performing exercise in this order helps to prevent training plateaus, increase training efficiency, and decrease injury potential.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Load</strong> &ndash; Load is the measurable amount of resistance. Load should be selected so that the predetermined number of sets and repetitions can be completed with some fatigue (not failure). Fatigue is the participant's perception that the repetitions are too hard or that form and technique cannot be maintained. Failure is the inability to complete the repetition. If the participant fails to complete at least 10 repetitions per set with a given weight, the weight is too heavy and should be reduced [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/physical-activity-and-strength-training-in-children-and-adolescents-an-overview/abstract/9,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,11</a>]. <br/><br/>When learning new movements, no-load repetitions can be used to develop balance and control. Load can be gradually increased as the movement is learned, but increments in load should not exceed the participant's ability to maintain balance, control, and proper technique.<br/><br/>There are various opinions on whether youth should lift maximal amounts of weight. Some organizations recommend that strength-training programs exclude lifting maximal amounts of weight for children and adolescents until they attain physical and skeletal maturity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/physical-activity-and-strength-training-in-children-and-adolescents-an-overview/abstract/8,90\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,90</a>].<br/><br/>Maximal lifts can be used to evaluate the effectiveness of a strength-training program when the maximal lifts are supervised and performed correctly following an adequate progression of loading [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/physical-activity-and-strength-training-in-children-and-adolescents-an-overview/abstract/94\" class=\"abstract_t\">94</a>]. However, there is no support for the continuous use of maximum resistance training in youth. Instead of continually lifting maximum loads, participants should be encouraged to use submaximal loads to develop form and technique in a variety of exercises.<br/><br/>Strength-training programs for youth should not rely on only one form of resistance (eg, free weights or machines) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/physical-activity-and-strength-training-in-children-and-adolescents-an-overview/abstract/40,90\" class=\"abstract_t\">40,90</a>]. Programs should be designed to include a variety of physical activities and training methods that develop muscular strength, rather than &quot;specializing&quot; in one strength-training method. Different methods of applying a resistance, such as use of body weight, free weights, weight machines, rubber tubing, and medicine balls can be used in strength-training programs for youth.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Body weight (ie, pull-ups, bar dips, or push-ups) should not be used as a form of resistance when working with sedentary or obese children who lack the strength to safely and successfully perform the exercise.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Free weights are a viable alternative to weight machines when child-size equipment is not available or when working with large children who have difficulty getting in and out of machines. Light-weight or unloaded bars should be used initially to develop proper technique and movement patterns.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Rubber tubing or other forms of resistance bands can be used by many children who are not ready to use free weights or machines. Since the resistance increases further into the range of motion, children should be encouraged to move through a full range of motion while maintaining proper body alignment.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Medicine balls of various sizes can be used to develop upper-body and abdominal strength.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Sets</strong> &ndash; A set is the completion of a given number of repetitions. Single-set protocols are often completed in the first several weeks of training when skill development and conditioning is low. Most youth are encouraged to begin a strength-training program using one to two sets.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Repetitions</strong> &ndash; Repetition is the number of times the load is lifted in a given set. Once movement patterns are established, it is recommended that youth perform sets using loads that permit 6 to 15 repetitions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/physical-activity-and-strength-training-in-children-and-adolescents-an-overview/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>]. He or she should progress to 3 sets of 20 repetitions before the resistance is increased. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Rest periods</strong> &ndash; A rest period is the amount of rest between sets or between exercise sessions. The length of rest periods between sets contributes to the overall overload since shorter rest periods decrease the recovery of energy producing metabolic pathways and affect performance on subsequent sets.<br/><br/>One to three minutes of rest between sets is generally adequate; shorter rest periods are used to emphasize hypertrophy and longer rest periods to maximize strength. Most youth have difficulty resting more than one to two minutes between sets.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Frequency of training</strong> &ndash; Muscle groups should be given at least 24 hours of rest between exercise sessions. Thus, strength training in youth should be limited to two to three nonconsecutive days per week. Older adolescents who are highly motivated can strength-train four days per week, provided that they alternate muscle groups. In a meta-analysis of resistance training in children and adolescents, increased frequency of training was associated with increased strength gains [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/physical-activity-and-strength-training-in-children-and-adolescents-an-overview/abstract/69\" class=\"abstract_t\">69</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H28\"><span class=\"h3\">Adaptation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Adaptation is the primary reason for engaging in any activity, exercise, or conditioning program. The neuromuscular adaptations of strength training in youth include increased numbers and coordination of recruited motor units and improved firing rate or firing pattern of activated motor neurons [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/physical-activity-and-strength-training-in-children-and-adolescents-an-overview/abstract/68\" class=\"abstract_t\">68</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H13\" class=\"local\">'Strength'</a> above.)</p><p>In addition, regular physical activity, including a well-designed strength-training program, helps to optimize development of bone mass. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=calcium-requirements-in-adolescents#H15\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Calcium requirements in adolescents&quot;, section on 'Exercise'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H29\"><span class=\"h3\">Progression</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The progression of an exercise program is critical to safely and effectively meet the individual's goals and objectives. As strength increases, the original absolute resistance represents a lower workload relative to capacity. The overload must be modified to provide an effective stimulus for adaptation to continue.</p><p>The overload can be changed by increasing the resistance, the number of exercises performed for each muscle group, sets, repetitions, or frequency of training.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Before increasing the number of sets or resistance, participants should be able to demonstrate proper technique.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Resistance can be increased when the desired number of repetitions can be performed, when 20 repetitions becomes &quot;easy&quot;, or when the participant can complete three sets of 20 repetitions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/physical-activity-and-strength-training-in-children-and-adolescents-an-overview/abstract/11,41\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,41</a>]. Resistance can be increased in increments of 5 to 10 percent.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The addition of exercises for each muscle group adds variety to a program, emphasizes the overall objective of conditioning, and introduces new movement patterns and motor skills. Addition of new exercises should include the use of single-joint and multijoint exercises. Multiple-joint exercises are beneficial for the development of neuromuscular coordination and skill technique and require more balance and stabilization [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/physical-activity-and-strength-training-in-children-and-adolescents-an-overview/abstract/40,41\" class=\"abstract_t\">40,41</a>]. Participants should not be allowed to perform more complex exercises until less complex exercises are mastered [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/physical-activity-and-strength-training-in-children-and-adolescents-an-overview/abstract/11,40\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,40</a>].<br/><br/>Progression to performing two to three exercises per muscle group for one to three sets of 10 to 15 repetitions, performed three days per week, or three to four sets of six to eight repetitions, has been recommended [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/physical-activity-and-strength-training-in-children-and-adolescents-an-overview/abstract/11,41,56\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,41,56</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H30\"><span class=\"h3\">Maintenance</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The maintenance phase is the longest portion of any conditioning program. Eventually, the participant is satisfied with the adaptations, training effect, and new level of physical fitness, health, or performance, and increases in overload (progression) are no longer needed. Less total overload is necessary to maintain adaptations than to achieve the desired outcome. Duration of training can influence the benefit of strength training, since training interventions of longer duration are more beneficial than similar training programs of shorter duration [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/physical-activity-and-strength-training-in-children-and-adolescents-an-overview/abstract/69\" class=\"abstract_t\">69</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H31\"><span class=\"h3\">Reversal</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Youth participation in sports and conditioning programs is often spontaneous and sporadic. It is likely, therefore, that many youth will undergo periods of reduced training and activity. Following a reduction or withdrawal of strength training, strength and other adaptations regress to pretraining levels [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/physical-activity-and-strength-training-in-children-and-adolescents-an-overview/abstract/65,95\" class=\"abstract_t\">65,95</a>]. This phenomenon is often referred to as &quot;detraining&quot; and occurs in children as well as adults.</p><p>In children, the effects of detraining are confounded by the concomitant growth-related increases in strength. The precise nature of the detraining response in children and adolescents remains uncertain. However, changes in neuromuscular function probably play a significant role in the observed changes in strength or motor performance.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H32\"><span class=\"h2\">Olympic-style lifting</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The snatch and the clean-and-jerk are the two lifts included in the sport of weight lifting. In the snatch, a barbell is lifted from the ground to an arm's-length position overhead in one continuous movement. In the clean-and-jerk, the barbell is lifted from the ground to the shoulder and then to an arm&rsquo;s length position overhead in a two-part movement. Both lifts are performed rapidly and require a great deal of technique.</p><p>Olympic-style weight lifting movements can be used as an effective training modality to improve strength, power, and coordination [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/physical-activity-and-strength-training-in-children-and-adolescents-an-overview/abstract/41,96-99\" class=\"abstract_t\">41,96-99</a>]. The American Academy of Pediatrics suggests that children and adolescents avoid competitive weight lifting and power lifting until they reach physical and skeletal maturity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/physical-activity-and-strength-training-in-children-and-adolescents-an-overview/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. Others suggest that such lifts are appropriate for youth who demonstrate the maturity and desire to learn proper technique before using significant amounts of weight [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/physical-activity-and-strength-training-in-children-and-adolescents-an-overview/abstract/41,96,98,100\" class=\"abstract_t\">41,96,98,100</a>]. The amount of time and effort required to learn and practice technique may vary between participants.</p><p>With proper training and technique, weight lifting is safer than many other sports in which teenagers regularly participate [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/physical-activity-and-strength-training-in-children-and-adolescents-an-overview/abstract/96,98\" class=\"abstract_t\">96,98</a>]. The forces to which children are exposed in other sports and activities are often greater in duration and magnitude and typically occur in uncontrolled settings. The snatch and the clean-and-jerk are complex movements and require knowledgeable coaching and supervision. When technical mastery is emphasized, there is a decreased risk of injury.</p><p>Olympic-style lifts should not be attempted without proper training and supervision; this point cannot be overemphasized. The training program should include other lifts and forms of conditioning to provide overall training. The technique for the snatch and clean-and-jerk should be learned using a wooden pole, polyvinylchloride (PVC) pipe, or light weight-training bar. Resistance should not be increased until the child has developed the necessary neuromuscular coordination and skill to perform the lift correctly. Light to moderate intensities (less than 75 percent of the one repetition maximum) are recommended for youth.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H33\"><span class=\"h1\">SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Children should be encouraged to participate in regular physical activity in order to establish good health habits at an early age. A panel convened by the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends that school-age children participate in at least 60 minutes per day of moderate to vigorous physical activity.
