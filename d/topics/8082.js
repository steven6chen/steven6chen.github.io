The weakness is a manifestation of motor aura and occurs with other forms of aura that impair vision, speech, or sensation.

Migraine auras most often manifest as visual disturbances, but can also involve sensory, verbal, and rarely motor disturbances. Thus, hemiplegic migraine is an uncommon subtype of migraine with aura. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pathophysiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-migraine-in-adults#H203275055\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pathophysiology, clinical manifestations, and diagnosis of migraine in adults&quot;, section on 'Migraine aura'</a>.)</p><p>Hemiplegic migraine may be familial or sporadic, as discussed in the following section.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1735110\"><span class=\"h1\">PATHOPHYSIOLOGY AND GENETICS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The weakness that characterizes hemiplegic migraine is a manifestation of motor aura. The aura of hemiplegic migraine is most probably caused by cortical spreading depression, a self-propagating wave of neuronal and glial depolarization that spreads across the cerebral cortex. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pathophysiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-migraine-in-adults#H130649634\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pathophysiology, clinical manifestations, and diagnosis of migraine in adults&quot;, section on 'Cortical spreading depression'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H81876416\"><span class=\"h2\">Familial hemiplegic migraine</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The first three types of familial hemiplegic migraine account for some, but not all, of the patients who have familial hemiplegic migraine (see <a href=\"#H166228438\" class=\"local\">'Additional types'</a> below).

However, this causal relationship has been brought into doubt, in part because the presence of a coexisting mutation in one of the three known FHM genes was not fully excluded in all subjects with both a PRRT2 mutation and hemiplegic migraine [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hemiplegic-migraine/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. Thus, PRRT2 gene mutations are associated with a high degree of phenotypic variability within and between families. The same PRRT2 gene mutation may present with different episodic disorders, even within the same family. In addition, some patients with PRRT2 mutations have mixed phenotypes that combine features of several of these disorders [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hemiplegic-migraine/abstract/24,28\" class=\"abstract_t\">24,28</a>]. Future studies will be required to determine whether PRRT2 mutations are a cause of FHM.</p><p>While not an ion channel gene, PRRT2 encodes a protein that interacts with the synaptosomal-associated protein SNAP25 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hemiplegic-migraine/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>], which may play a role in regulating voltage-gated calcium channels [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hemiplegic-migraine/abstract/30,31\" class=\"abstract_t\">30,31</a>].</p><p>The known types of familial hemiplegic migraine account for only a small proportion of cases. The best available evidence comes from a 2007 Danish population-based study that included 44 families with FHM [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hemiplegic-migraine/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. Mutations in the CACNA1A or ATP1A2 genes were found in only 14 percent of families, and no SCN1A mutations were detected. In another study that examined 101 patients with hemiplegic migraine and no known mutation in CACNA1A, ATP1A2, and SCN1A, mutations in the PRRT2 gene were found in only 4 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hemiplegic-migraine/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. Therefore, it is likely that there are additional types of familial hemiplegic migraine caused by mutations in genes other than CACNA1A, ATP1A2, SCN1A, and PRRT2.</p><p>In addition to the established familial hemiplegic migraine genes, mutations in the SLC4A4 gene that encodes for the <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sodium-bicarbonate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">sodium bicarbonate</a> cotransporter, a known cause of proximal renal tubular acidosis (RTA) with ocular abnormalities, have been associated with familial forms of migraine in a few patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hemiplegic-migraine/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>]. The phenotype appears to be variable, and includes familial hemiplegic migraine with proximal RTA and typical migraine with or without aura.

Some cases of sporadic hemiplegic migraine are caused by one of the genetic mutations that cause familial hemiplegic migraine, due to either de novo mutations or inheritance from an asymptomatic parent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hemiplegic-migraine/abstract/33,34\" class=\"abstract_t\">33,34</a>]. In population- and clinic-based studies, mutations in the CACNA1A and the ATP1A2 genes have been identified in 10 to 20 percent of patients with sporadic hemiplegic migraine [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hemiplegic-migraine/abstract/6,34,35\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,34,35</a>]. However, in patients with severe sporadic hemiplegic migraine associated with additional neurologic manifestations, the frequency of these mutations may be much higher [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hemiplegic-migraine/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>].</p><p>One patient with sporadic hemiplegic migraine with seizures and ataxia was found to have a mutation in the SLC1A3 gene that encodes the glutamate transporter EAAT1 causing neuronal hyperexcitability [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hemiplegic-migraine/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1732712\"><span class=\"h1\">EPIDEMIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Hemiplegic migraine is a rare disorder. In a population study from Denmark, the estimated prevalence of hemiplegic migraine is 0.01 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hemiplegic-migraine/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>]. The familial and sporadic versions occur with equal prevalence [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hemiplegic-migraine/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>]. The average age of onset is 12 to 17 years (range 1 to 51 years) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hemiplegic-migraine/abstract/3,38\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,38</a>].</p><p>Like other forms of migraine, women have a higher prevalence of hemiplegic migraine, with female to male ratios ranging from 2.5:1 to 4.3:1 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hemiplegic-migraine/abstract/38-40\" class=\"abstract_t\">38-40</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1732719\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL MANIFESTATIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Hemiplegic migraine is characterized by migraine attacks with motor weakness during the aura phase. Attacks may variously include severe headache, scintillating scotoma, visual field defect, numbness, paresthesia, unilateral weakness, aphasia, fever, lethargy, coma, and seizures. The symptoms can last for hours to days, or rarely weeks, but most resolve completely.

Two or more auras are always experienced. Each one tends to evolve over 20 to 30 minutes and may take hours to gradually improve, typically beginning with a visual aura, and followed successively by sensory, motor, aphasic, and brainstem symptoms, usually in that order [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hemiplegic-migraine/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>]. The aura symptoms associated with migraine with brainstem aura (basilar-type migraine) (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=migraine-with-brainstem-aura-basilar-type-migraine\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Migraine with brainstem aura (basilar-type migraine)&quot;</a>) include vertigo, dysarthria, ataxia, bilateral visual, sensory or motor symptoms, hyperacusia, tinnitus, and diminished consciousness [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hemiplegic-migraine/abstract/38,40,42\" class=\"abstract_t\">38,40,42</a>].</p><p>Motor symptoms most often start in the hand and gradually spread up into the arm and then the face [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hemiplegic-migraine/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. The unilateral features of hemiplegic migraine may switch sides between or during attacks. However, bilateral motor signs occur in up to one-third of patients with familial hemiplegic migraine [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hemiplegic-migraine/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>], affecting both sides either in succession or simultaneously.

Severe attacks affect a variable proportion of patients in different reports, ranging from 1 percent in a population-based study of patients with familial hemiplegic migraine from Denmark [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hemiplegic-migraine/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>] to 33 percent in a study of patients with mutations in CACNA1A (ie, FHM1) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hemiplegic-migraine/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].

These differences may be related in part to the timing of the imaging studies, as there is evidence to suggest that migraine aura is initially associated with transient hypoperfusion followed by hyperperfusion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hemiplegic-migraine/abstract/75,79,81\" class=\"abstract_t\">75,79,81</a>].</p><p>Cerebellar atrophy is frequently observed in patients with FHM1 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hemiplegic-migraine/abstract/51,64\" class=\"abstract_t\">51,64</a>].

The key features for the diagnosis (see <a href=\"#H1734585\" class=\"local\">'Diagnostic criteria'</a> below) are the occurrence of episodic, reversible motor weakness as a manifestation of migraine aura in conjunction with at least one other kind of aura (visual, sensory, aphasic, or brainstem). Since motor aura is a necessary feature for the diagnosis, the clinician must establish as clearly as possible whether the patient actually experienced motor weakness as an aura symptom. Although seemingly straightforward, this determination is often challenging because patients may confuse or misinterpret ataxia or numbness as weakness.</p><p>A thorough family history is essential to distinguish familial from sporadic hemiplegic migraine. In some cases, the diagnosis will change from sporadic to familial hemiplegic migraine over time if a family member develops hemiplegic migraine [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hemiplegic-migraine/abstract/94\" class=\"abstract_t\">94</a>].</p><p>In cases where the diagnosis is uncertain, investigations including brain imaging (eg, brain MRI or CT), neurovascular studies (eg, MR angiography, CT, or ultrasound) electroencephalography, and spinal fluid analysis may be helpful to exclude other causes of weakness such as stroke and seizure (see <a href=\"#H1734634\" class=\"local\">'Differential diagnosis'</a> below), especially if the attacks are of recent onset, include prolonged symptoms, or do not have a family history of similar spells.</p><p>Genetic testing for mutations involving the genes that cause familial hemiplegic migraine (CACNA1A, ATP1A2, SCN1A, and PRRT2) may be most useful for patients with early onset severe sporadic hemiplegic migraine associated with nystagmus, seizures, or other atypical neurologic manifestations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hemiplegic-migraine/abstract/6,33\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,33</a>]. In addition, genetic testing may be helpful for cases of familial hemiplegic migraine when the attack severity or permanent neurologic manifestations diverge from those of affected relatives.

However, an earlier randomized controlled trial with 77 patients who had migraine with and without typical aura did not demonstrate any benefit of lamotrigine for migraine prophylaxis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hemiplegic-migraine/abstract/121\" class=\"abstract_t\">121</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The use of triptans for hemiplegic migraine is controversial (see <a href=\"#H625410\" class=\"local\">'Drugs of concern'</a> below).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Intranasal <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ketamine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ketamine</a> given at attack onset was associated with a reproducible decrease in the intensity and duration of aura in 5 of 11 patients with familial hemiplegic migraine [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hemiplegic-migraine/abstract/122\" class=\"abstract_t\">122</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In one patient with possible sporadic hemiplegic migraine and another with what was termed &quot;complicated migraine&quot; without hemiplegia, intravenous <a href=\"topic.htm?path=naloxone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">naloxone</a> (0.4 mg) was associated with resolution of the aura-like symptoms but not the headache pain within two minutes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hemiplegic-migraine/abstract/123\" class=\"abstract_t\">123</a>].</p><p/><p>We suggest initial therapy with either oral sustained-release <a href=\"topic.htm?path=verapamil-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">verapamil</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=flunarizine-united-states-not-available-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">flunarizine</a> (where available) or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acetazolamide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">acetazolamide</a> for patients with hemiplegic migraine who desire pharmacologic therapy because the attacks are frequent, prolonged, or debilitating. Sustained-release verapamil is started at 120 mg once daily and increased to 120 mg twice daily (total 240 mg daily). The dose can be further titrated up to 120 mg daily three times a day (total 360 mg daily) for most patients if needed. However, we suggest a maximum verapamil dose of 120 mg daily for small or elderly patients. The usual starting dose of flunarizine is 2.5 to 5 mg given once daily (in the evening), and the dose can be further titrated up to 10 mg per day as needed.

Lamotrigine is started at 25 mg daily with slow titration in 25 mg steps weekly or biweekly up to 100 mg per day if needed. Of concern, a benign rash may develop in up to 10 percent of patients during the initial one to two months of lamotrigine therapy and necessitates discontinuation of the drug; the risk of developing a life-threatening rash such as Stevens-Johnson syndrome is approximately 1 in 1000 adults. This risk is increased dramatically in children, leading to the recommendation that the drug not be used in patients under the age of 16 years.</p><p>Since hemiplegic migraine is a subset of migraine with aura, certain preventive medications commonly used to treat typical migraine with aura, including <a href=\"topic.htm?path=amitriptyline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">amitriptyline</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=topiramate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">topiramate</a>, and valproic acid [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hemiplegic-migraine/abstract/124\" class=\"abstract_t\">124</a>] may be beneficial, and we suggest them as alternatives if <a href=\"topic.htm?path=verapamil-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">verapamil</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=flunarizine-united-states-not-available-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">flunarizine</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acetazolamide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">acetazolamide</a>, or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lamotrigine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">lamotrigine</a> are ineffective or intolerable.

(See <a href=\"#H81875659\" class=\"local\">'Classification'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The aura of hemiplegic migraine is probably caused by cortical spreading depression, a self-propagating wave of neuronal and glial depolarization that spreads across the cerebral cortex. (See <a href=\"#H1735110\" class=\"local\">'Pathophysiology and genetics'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The first three types of familial hemiplegic migraine are channelopathies numbered according to the gene involved. FHM1 is caused by mutations in the CACNA1A gene, FHM2 by mutations in the ATP1A2 gene, and FHM3 by mutations in the SCN1A gene. Mutations in the PRRT2 gene also cause some cases of familial hemiplegic migraine. The known types of familial hemiplegic migraine account for only a small proportion of cases. (See <a href=\"#H81876416\" class=\"local\">'Familial hemiplegic migraine'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients who are the first member of their family to have hemiplegic migraine are classified as having sporadic hemiplegic migraine. Some cases of sporadic hemiplegic migraine are caused by one of the genetic mutations that cause familial hemiplegic migraine, due to either de novo mutations or inheritance from an asymptomatic parent. (See <a href=\"#H81876444\" class=\"local\">'Sporadic hemiplegic migraine'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Hemiplegic migraine is a rare disorder. (See <a href=\"#H1732712\" class=\"local\">'Epidemiology'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In addition to motor weakness during the aura phase, which is typically unilateral, the manifestations of hemiplegic migraine attacks may variously include severe headache, scintillating scotoma, visual field defect, numbness, paresthesia, aphasia, fever, lethargy, coma, and seizures. The symptoms can last for hours to days, or rarely weeks, but most resolve completely. (See <a href=\"#H1732719\" class=\"local\">'Clinical manifestations'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The diagnosis of hemiplegic migraine remains clinical. While formal diagnostic criteria require fully reversible aura symptoms, permanent neurologic deficits develop in occasional patients with hemiplegic migraine. The differential diagnosis of hemiplegic migraine primarily concerns cerebrovascular disease (eg, transient ischemic attack and ischemic or hemorrhagic stroke) and tumor. (See <a href=\"#H1732726\" class=\"local\">'Diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients with severe attacks of hemiplegic migraine (see <a href=\"#H91544380\" class=\"local\">'Severe attacks'</a> above) may require hospital care to treat fever, depressed consciousness or seizures. (See <a href=\"#H1732770\" class=\"local\">'Management'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>With the possible exception of agents that may theoretically cause or exacerbate ischemia (see <a href=\"#H625410\" class=\"local\">'Drugs of concern'</a> above), patients with hemiplegic migraine may be treated with the same abortive and preventive medications that are used for patients who have typical migraine with aura. For patients with hemiplegic migraine who desire pharmacologic therapy because the attacks are frequent, prolonged, or debilitating, we suggest initial treatment with either oral sustained-release <a href=\"topic.htm?path=verapamil-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">verapamil</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=flunarizine-united-states-not-available-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">flunarizine</a> (where available) or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acetazolamide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">acetazolamide</a> (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). For adult patients with hemiplegic migraine who do not improve with verapamil, flunarizine, or acetazolamide, and particularly for patients who have persistent aura symptoms that predominate over headache, we suggest <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lamotrigine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">lamotrigine</a> 25 mg daily with slow titration in 25 mg steps weekly or biweekly up to 100 mg per day as needed to reduce the aura symptoms and headache (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). Lamotrigine should be discontinued if a rash develops. (See <a href=\"#H977692\" class=\"local\">'Abortive and preventive medications'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients with hemiplegic migraine, we suggest <strong>not</strong> using beta blockers, triptans, or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ergotamine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ergotamine</a> derivatives because of theoretical concerns and anecdotal evidence that these medications may predispose to prolonged aura or ischemia.
