A further analysis has shown that for patients with an HRCT classified as possible UIP (no honeycombing), demographic information (eg, age, sex) and other radiographic features (eg, extent of reticular versus ground glass opacities) may help predict the presence of UIP [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-idiopathic-pulmonary-fibrosis/abstract/45\" class=\"abstract_t\">45</a>].

Characteristic features include diffuse ground glass opacities on high resolution computed tomography (HRCT); a reticular pattern and traction bronchiectasis may be seen, but honeycombing is generally absent.

Differentiating rheumatic disease-associated ILD from IPF is largely based on identifying clinical features that provide clues to the presence of rheumatic disease, such as arthritis, rheumatoid nodules, Raynaud phenomenon, skin changes (eg, sclerodactyly, increased skin thickness, digital ulcers), muscle weakness, and abnormal esophageal motility. On HRCT, features suggestive of rheumatic disease that would be atypical for IPF include pleural or pericardial effusion or thickening and esophageal abnormalities.

The HRCT pattern associated with asbestosis is similar to IPF, but pleural plaques, particularly with linear bands of calcification, are a clue to underlying asbestosis. A definitive diagnosis of asbestosis requires an appropriate occupational history and demonstration of asbestos fibers (usually in the form of ferruginated asbestos bodies) in the tissue specimen.
