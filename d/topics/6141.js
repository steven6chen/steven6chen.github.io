Pain at the myotendinous junction of these muscle groups is referred to as lateral and medial epicondylitis, respectively. Lateral epicondylitis is often called tennis elbow and medial epicondylitis, golfer's elbow. Although tennis and golf can cause these injuries, so can a number of other occupational and recreational activities.</p><p>Subacute and chronic symptoms of pain and disability at the lateral and medial epicondyles typically represent a tendinosis of the respective myotendinous group, and are referred to as elbow tendinosis. Other terms used to describe the constellation of symptoms at these locations include elbow tendinopathy, elbow tendonitis, and epicondylalgia. We refer to these conditions as medial and lateral epicondylitis throughout this topic review.</p><p>This topic will review the development, presentation, and management of epicondylitis. Other problems associated with elbow pain and the general treatment of tendinopathy are discussed separately.

The incidence may approach 1 to 3 percent in the general population, while the incidence in general practice is approximately 0.4 to 0.7 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epicondylitis-tennis-and-golf-elbow/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p>Smoking, obesity, age 45 to 54, repetitive movement for at least two hours daily, and forceful activity (managing physical loads over 20 kg) appear to be risk factors in the general population for the development of epicondylitis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epicondylitis-tennis-and-golf-elbow/abstract/1,3\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,3</a>]. Factors that correlate with a poorer prognosis include high physical strain at work, dominant side involvement, concomitant neck pain (with or without signs of nerve root involvement), duration of symptoms greater than three months, and severe pain at presentation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epicondylitis-tennis-and-golf-elbow/abstract/4,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,5</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5808248\"><span class=\"h2\">Tennis epidemiology and risk factors</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The elbow was the most commonly injured joint in a survey of 529 recreational USTA (United States Tennis Association) players, comprising approximately 20 percent of all injuries [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epicondylitis-tennis-and-golf-elbow/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. In this study, the prevalence of elbow injuries was 10.6 injuries per 100 players (average age 46.9 years), with an incidence of 0.6 injuries per 1000 hours played.</p><p>Risk increases with age. There is a 50 percent lifetime incidence of elbow injury among club players 30 years or older, with higher rates in players over 40 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epicondylitis-tennis-and-golf-elbow/abstract/7,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,8</a>]. The risk of injury is two to four times greater among those who play more than two hours daily [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epicondylitis-tennis-and-golf-elbow/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>], but there is no increased risk among those who play up to six hours weekly [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epicondylitis-tennis-and-golf-elbow/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].</p><p>Only one case of lateral epicondylitis was reported among over 700 players (including seniors) over three years at the French Open [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epicondylitis-tennis-and-golf-elbow/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. This supports the notion that tennis elbow occurs infrequently among advanced players, and is more common among recreational players, likely as a result of differences in technique. (See <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Mechanisms of injury'</a> below.)</p><p>According to an EMG study, variations in tennis racket grip size up to 0.25 inches (6.35 mm) smaller or larger than that measured by Nirschl criteria do not alter the forearm muscle firing patterns of one-handed backhands, and therefore may not represent a significant risk for tennis elbow [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epicondylitis-tennis-and-golf-elbow/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. The Nirschl criteria suggest that appropriate grip size is determined by the distance from the middle of the proximal palmar crease of the hand to the distal tip of the ring finger in inches.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL ANATOMY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The distal humerus has a medial humeral epicondyle and a lateral humeral epicondyle. The lateral humeral epicondyle serves as the bony common origin of the wrist extensors; the medial humeral epicondyle serves as the bony common origin of the wrist flexors. The epicondyles are extraarticular structures.</p><p>Injury to the extensor carpi radialis brevis muscle (ECRB) (felt at tip of lateral epicondyle) and occasionally, the extensor digitorum communis muscle (EDC) (felt just posterior and distal to tip of lateral epicondyle) constitutes lateral epicondylitis (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F99703\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef99703 \">figure 1</a>). Injury to the pronator teres and flexor carpi radialis muscles, which originate at the medial epicondyle (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F99697\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef99697 \">figure 2</a>), causes medial epicondylitis.</p><p>The elbow is the articulation between the ulna and radius and the humerus (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F66874\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef66874 \">figure 3</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F99715\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef99715 \">figure 4</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F97474\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef97474 \">figure 5</a>). The elbow joint is best palpated as the soft spot in the middle of a triangle formed by the lateral epicondyle, olecranon, and radial head (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F81857\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef81857 \">picture 1</a>). Forearm pronation makes it easier to palpate the radial head.</p><p>It is important to differentiate an effusion in this region, which represents intraarticular pathology or swelling posteriorly from olecranon bursitis, from the symptoms of lateral epicondylitis. (See <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'Clinical presentation and examination'</a> below and <a href=\"#H8\" class=\"local\">'Differential diagnosis'</a> below.)</p><p>Medial elbow stability is provided primarily by the anterior bundle of the medial collateral ligament. The ulnar nerve is exposed in the ulnar groove, which lies posterior and lateral to the medial epicondyle. The ulnar nerve can be compressed just distally in the cubital tunnel.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h1\">PATHOPHYSIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Epicondylitis represents a chronic tendinosis, rather than an acute inflammatory process, involving disorganized tissue and neovessels within the involved tendon. Researchers describe the process as angiofibroblastic tendinosis; few inflammatory cells are found in these lesions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epicondylitis-tennis-and-golf-elbow/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. Studies using grayscale ultrasonography and color Doppler followed by anesthetic injection suggest that vasculoneural growth in the common extensor origin is the likely source of pain in lateral epicondylitis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epicondylitis-tennis-and-golf-elbow/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. The extensor carpi radialis brevis muscle (ECRB) is most often involved. Targeting this degenerative tendinosis and neovascularization is the focus of emerging treatments. (See <a href=\"#H15\" class=\"local\">'Secondary management'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h1\">MECHANISMS OF INJURY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Repetitive or explosive athletic movements involving eccentric motion, in which the muscle-tendon unit is lengthened while contracting, may increase susceptibility to injury [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epicondylitis-tennis-and-golf-elbow/abstract/8,13-16\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,13-16</a>]. This should not be confused with isolated, controlled eccentric exercises done as part of a rehabilitation program. (See <a href=\"#H14\" class=\"local\">'Physical therapy and eccentric exercise'</a> below.)</p><p>Performing strenuous or exaggerated movements with degenerative or disorganized tissue further increases the risk of injury.</p><p>Occupational injuries associated with epicondylitis can involve repetitive motions in which the wrist frequently deviates from a neutral position (ie, not held straight) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epicondylitis-tennis-and-golf-elbow/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. A dose dependent relationship exists between the regular handling of loads over 20 kg and development of epicondylitis. A significant relationship between work tasks that involve vibrating tools (eg, jackhammer) and epicondylitis has yet to be demonstrated [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epicondylitis-tennis-and-golf-elbow/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Activity modification to limit repetitive motion, forceful tasks, and possibly vibration may reduce the risk of injury. (See <a href=\"#H9\" class=\"local\">'Initial management'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h1\">RISK REDUCTION IN TENNIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A number of factors, including poor stroke mechanics and inappropriate racquet type, predispose tennis players to developing epicondylitis.</p><p>Proper stroke mechanics are important to minimize the risk of epicondylitis and prevent recurrence after treatment. In one observational study, instruction on stroke modification and routine conservative therapy led to a resolution of symptoms in 90 percent of tennis players with symptom duration less than six months [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epicondylitis-tennis-and-golf-elbow/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. Correction of mechanics may require formal assessment by a tennis coach, physical therapist, or other appropriate professional.</p><p>The tennis serve provides a good example for understanding the importance of proper mechanics. Over half of the force generated for tennis serves should come from the hips and pelvis; excessive use of the wrist to generate force predisposes to injury [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epicondylitis-tennis-and-golf-elbow/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. Subsequent upper body force generation during serves should be much less, with the shoulder contributing approximately 21 percent, the elbow 15 percent, and the wrist 10 percent. Fluid sequential transmission of force (ie, proper kinetic chain integration) from the lower to the upper body and a knee bend greater than 10 degrees mitigate shoulder and elbow torque, reducing the risk of injury [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epicondylitis-tennis-and-golf-elbow/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. Isolation of the body's upper quarter in the performance of any overhand athletic maneuver (eg, tennis serve, baseball throw) reflects a breakdown in the smooth transfer of force from the lower to the upper body (ie, disruption in the kinetic chain).</p><p>A number of biomechanical faults increase the risk of epicondylitis among tennis players and should be corrected [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epicondylitis-tennis-and-golf-elbow/abstract/18,20\" class=\"abstract_t\">18,20</a>]. Examples include the following:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Continuous contraction of wrist extensors, insufficient follow through, and leading with the elbow are three common faults with the beginner's backhand (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F69399\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef69399 \">picture 2</a>). All three increase the load placed on forearm extensors.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Excessive forearm pronation with forehand strokes or in combination with wrist snap during serves creates a sudden eccentric load on forearm extensors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epicondylitis-tennis-and-golf-elbow/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Preparation for an advanced forehand tennis stroke often consists of a combination of extreme supination with ulnar deviation of the wrist, followed by a low to high trajectory, terminating with rapid and forceful wrist pronation to generate topspin (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F82708\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef82708 \">picture 3</a>). Such extreme supination, particularly with an exaggerated grip, may theoretically increase the risk for medial epicondylitis.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Excessive wrist extension either before impact or during follow-through of a backhand stroke increases the load on forearm extensors.</p><p/><p>Use of a one-handed backhand may increase the risk of developing tennis elbow compared with a two-handed backhand, although evidence is scant [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epicondylitis-tennis-and-golf-elbow/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. Wrist extensor activity with one and two handed backhands is fundamentally the same; however, the extra hand may limit end ranges of motion thereby reducing abnormal elbow and forearm movement and controlling terminal wrist extension [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epicondylitis-tennis-and-golf-elbow/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. Greater wrist extension and pronation create eccentric stress during impact and early follow through, which may account for the increased risk of the one-handed backhand [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epicondylitis-tennis-and-golf-elbow/abstract/23,24\" class=\"abstract_t\">23,24</a>].</p><p>No published trials demonstrate a causal relationship between racquet characteristics and the development of lateral epicondylitis. Nevertheless, many sports physicians and tennis pros believe that factors such as light weight, heavy head, and inappropriately small grip size increase the forces transferred to the forearm, thereby increasing the risk of lateral epicondylitis. Use of a racquet grip size up to 0.25 inches (6.35 mm) smaller or larger than that determined by the Nirschl criteria is appropriate (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F66638\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef66638 \">figure 6</a>).</p><p>Racquet shock absorbers to mitigate transmission of impact forces have not been shown to be effective in reducing vibrations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epicondylitis-tennis-and-golf-elbow/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. Other strategies that have theoretical but unsupported utility include lowering string tension and releasing grip tightness after impact to reduce transmission of forces to the wrist and elbow.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL PRESENTATION AND EXAMINATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients with epicondylitis typically complain of extraarticular medial or lateral elbow pain. The pain's severity can range from having a minimal effect on sports or work activities to severely impairing basic daily tasks and sleep. Symptoms are usually exacerbated by repetitive movements of the wrist and elbow. Nirschl characterizes seven stages of tendinopathy (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F56664\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef56664 \">table 1</a>)&nbsp;[<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epicondylitis-tennis-and-golf-elbow/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>].</p><p>Lateral epicondylitis is diagnosed clinically by the following findings:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Localized tenderness over the lateral epicondyle and proximal wrist extensor muscle mass (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F64356\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef64356 \">picture 4</a>)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pain with resisted wrist extension with the elbow in full extension (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F63260\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef63260 \">picture 5</a>)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pain with passive terminal wrist flexion with the elbow in full extension (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F77389\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef77389 \">picture 6</a>)</p><p/><p>Medial epicondylitis is diagnosed clinically by the following findings:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Localized tenderness over the medial epicondyle (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F55147\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef55147 \">picture 7</a>) and proximal wrist flexor muscle mass (the ulnar <span class=\"nowrap\">nerve/ulnar</span> groove and medial collateral ligament should not be tender)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pain with resisted wrist flexion with the elbow in full extension (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F75033\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef75033 \">picture 8</a>)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pain with passive terminal wrist extension with the elbow in full extension (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F63786\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef63786 \">picture 9</a>)</p><p/><p>Pain from either condition can be further elicited with resisted wrist pronation or supination and grip strength testing, particularly when the elbow is in full extension. Absence of increased pain does not preclude the diagnosis.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h1\">DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A number of conditions can cause focal medial or lateral elbow pain (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F73460\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef73460 \">table 2</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F52503\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef52503 \">table 3</a>). A focused history and examination, including a few special maneuvers when suggested by the history, can be used to differentiate among potential alternative diagnoses. General evaluation of the patient with elbow pain is discussed elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-of-elbow-pain-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation of elbow pain in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Intraarticular effusions or painful elbow motion may represent intraarticular pathology. Pain with forceful, active terminal extension may represent posterior osteoarthritis or valgus extension overload, which is seen in overhand athletes. Osteochondritis dissecans of the olecranon fossa can also cause pain with forceful terminal extension in overhead athletes. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=throwing-injuries-of-the-upper-extremity-clinical-presentation-and-diagnostic-approach#H78248421\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Throwing injuries of the upper extremity: Clinical presentation and diagnostic approach&quot;, section on 'Valgus extension overload (VEO) syndrome'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=osteochondritis-dissecans-ocd-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Osteochondritis dissecans (OCD): Clinical manifestations and diagnosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p>A history of blunt trauma (eg, fall) suggests the possibility of a fracture. Elbow radiographs should be obtained in such instances.</p><p>Neurologic conditions can cause unilateral elbow pain. Compression of the posterior interosseous nerve in the radial tunnel (ie, radial tunnel syndrome) often causes tenderness a few centimeters distal to the lateral epicondyle. Compression of the median nerve in the cubital tunnel (ie, cubital tunnel syndrome) often causes tenderness just distal to the medial ulnar groove. Pain or paresthesias from ulnar neuritis can be elicited by tapping over the ulnar nerve at the ulnar groove (ulnar nerve Tinel's sign), or by placing the elbow in full flexion (elbow flexion test). Pain with Spurling's maneuver may represent cervical radiculopathy, which can mimic elbow pain. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-upper-extremity-peripheral-nerve-syndromes\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of upper extremity peripheral nerve syndromes&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-cervical-radiculopathy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical features and diagnosis of cervical radiculopathy&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The Milking maneuver (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F68632\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef68632 \">picture 10</a>) places valgus stress on the medial (ie, ulnar) collateral ligament (MCL) of the elbow in a throwing position. Pain elicited by the test suggests MCL insufficiency in overhand athletes, although the characteristics of this test are not well studied [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epicondylitis-tennis-and-golf-elbow/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. Diffuse muscle tenderness in atypical patterns in patients with chronic symptoms may represent a myofascial pain complex. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=throwing-injuries-of-the-upper-extremity-clinical-presentation-and-diagnostic-approach#H78248407\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Throwing injuries of the upper extremity: Clinical presentation and diagnostic approach&quot;, section on 'Ulnar collateral ligament (UCL) injury'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-soft-tissue-rheumatic-disorders\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of soft tissue rheumatic disorders&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h1\">INITIAL MANAGEMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Once a clinical diagnosis of epicondylitis is made, our initial treatment consists of activity modification, counter force bracing, nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) if not contraindicated, and physical therapy (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F57758\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef57758 \">algorithm 1</a>). These initial steps are discussed immediately below; persistent or worsening pain despite appropriate management often prompts imaging and additional therapies. (See <a href=\"#H17\" class=\"local\">'Antiinflammatory treatments'</a> below and <a href=\"#H15\" class=\"local\">'Secondary management'</a> below.)</p><p>Two systematic reviews of randomized trials of the management of lateral epicondylitis reveal a wide range of treatment options, but little high quality evidence supporting any particular approach [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epicondylitis-tennis-and-golf-elbow/abstract/27,28\" class=\"abstract_t\">27,28</a>]. Most trials had significant limitations, including inadequate study design, small sample size, and limited statistical analysis. The management approach discussed below is based upon these limited studies and our clinical experience.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h2\">Observation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>If left untreated, symptoms associated with epicondylitis persist between six months and two years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epicondylitis-tennis-and-golf-elbow/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. For patients who can function adequately without intervention or who prefer conservative management, a &quot;wait and see&quot; approach may be reasonable. These patients must understand that rest alone may not lead to a resolution of symptoms and a recovery period of months to years may be necessary.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h2\">Modification of activity and biomechanics</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients should try to avoid activities that exacerbate symptoms. For athletes, correction of faulty mechanics must be part of their activity modification. (See <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'Risk reduction in tennis'</a> above.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h2\">Bracing</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>As part of our initial management of lateral epicondylitis, we apply a counter force brace (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F87063\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef87063 \">picture 11</a>). Counter force braces may provide benefit during the first six weeks following injury [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epicondylitis-tennis-and-golf-elbow/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>] and are easy to use and inexpensive. These braces are placed on the forearm approximately 6 to 10 centimeters distal to the elbow joint [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epicondylitis-tennis-and-golf-elbow/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>].</p><p>In a systematic review of the use of braces in epicondylitis, limited data prevented the authors from drawing firm conclusions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epicondylitis-tennis-and-golf-elbow/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. Nevertheless, counter force bracing may reduce tendon and muscle strain at the origin of the forearm extensor muscles, thereby relieving pain and improving function.</p><p>A controlled, observational, manufacturer-sponsored study of extensor carpi radialis brevis and extensor digitorum communis activity using electromyelograms (EMG) found that the application of a counterforce brace with an air-filled bladder significantly reduced muscle activity proximal to the brace [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epicondylitis-tennis-and-golf-elbow/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]. No such reduction was found in patients treated with a standard counterforce brace or no brace.</p><p>No significant differences in outcome were found at 26 and 52 weeks in one clinical trial in which patients were randomly assigned to initial treatment using a counterforce brace alone, physical therapy alone, or a combination of bracing and therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epicondylitis-tennis-and-golf-elbow/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Over the first six weeks, physical therapy led to better pain and disability scores than bracing alone. No placebo group was included.</p><p>New types of braces are being developed, but evidence of their effectiveness is scant. A small, manufacturer-supported trial of a dynamic extensor brace found improved function and reduced pain for up to 24 weeks among patients randomly assigned to treatment with the brace and standard care compared with those receiving standard care alone [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epicondylitis-tennis-and-golf-elbow/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h2\">Splints</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Some clinicians use volar splints to reduce activity of the wrist extensors and flexors during particularly painful episodes of epicondylitis. We do not recommend splinting except in the most severe cases. Splinting was not found to be more effective than counterforce bracing in a small randomized trial [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epicondylitis-tennis-and-golf-elbow/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>]. Furthermore, a multicenter, retrospective cohort study involving 4614 workers diagnosed with epicondylitis found that patients treated with splints had higher rates of limited duty, more medical visits, higher charges, and longer durations of treatment than those managed without splints [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epicondylitis-tennis-and-golf-elbow/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14\"><span class=\"h2\">Physical therapy and eccentric exercise</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>We have found well-designed physical therapy programs to be effective initial treatment for many patients with epicondylitis. Effective programs may include progressive eccentric and isometric strengthening, incorporating flexibility training and other modalities as needed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epicondylitis-tennis-and-golf-elbow/abstract/2,16,35-37\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,16,35-37</a>]. </p><p>Despite our clinical experience, studies of eccentric exercise programs show mixed results.

We believe inconsistencies in methodologic quality and the wide range of approaches to physical therapy in the studies reviewed account for this conclusion. </p><p>A number of studies in conditions, such as Achilles' tendinopathy, suggest that daily eccentric isokinetic strengthening exercises provide effective treatment for chronic tendinopathy. Extrapolating from such studies, some researchers advocate this rehabilitative approach for epicondylitis and we believe such exercises should be included in the physical therapy program. A systematic review of 12 studies (8 randomized trials) involving 334 patients with lateral epicondylitis found the available evidence to be limited in quality but concluded that &quot;the majority of consistent findings support the inclusion of eccentric exercise&quot; as part of treatment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epicondylitis-tennis-and-golf-elbow/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=achilles-tendinopathy-and-tendon-rupture\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Achilles tendinopathy and tendon rupture&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-the-management-of-overuse-chronic-tendinopathy#H6\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of the management of overuse (chronic) tendinopathy&quot;, section on 'Heavy load exercise'</a>.)</p><p>Eccentric exercise is the application of a load (ie, muscular contraction) during the lengthening of a muscle (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F60246\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef60246 \">picture 12</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F67934\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef67934 \">picture 13</a>). Application of this technique for epicondylitis involves holding a weight or a taut resistance band with the wrist extended and then flexing the wrist while maintaining tension in the wrist extensors (ie, eccentrically contracting the wrist extensors).</p><p>In one of the better controlled studies of this approach, researchers randomly assigned patients with chronic lateral epicondylitis to either standard physical therapy or to standard therapy plus an isokinetic eccentric strengthening program for the forearm supinators and wrist extensors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epicondylitis-tennis-and-golf-elbow/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. Patients in the eccentric training group demonstrated marked reductions in pain within one month, less disability, and greater improvement in tendon appearance on ultrasound compared with patients treated with standard physical therapy. Upon completion of the program, patients in the eccentric training group had no strength deficit of their wrist extensors and forearm supinators compared with the unaffected side. A similar albeit smaller trial reported significantly better outcomes in patients assigned to perform eccentric strengthening with a specially designed rubber bar (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SM%2F103629\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef103629 \">picture 14</a>) compared to patients who followed a standard physical therapy program without eccentric exercises [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epicondylitis-tennis-and-golf-elbow/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>]. </p><p>Standard physical rehabilitation of upper extremity sports injuries includes core strengthening and sports-specific movement exercises (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F82491\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef82491 \">picture 15</a>).

An alternative diagnosis revealed by imaging is managed appropriately; persistent epicondylitis can be treated with continued conservative treatment including physical therapy, antiinflammatory agents, nontraditional modalities, or surgical referral (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F69505\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef69505 \">algorithm 2</a>). Surgical referral is generally reserved for patients with severe symptoms who do not improve despite careful compliance with a well-designed physical therapy program for greater than six months.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H16\"><span class=\"h1\">RADIOGRAPHIC FINDINGS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Radiography is often unnecessary for the diagnosis and treatment of epicondylitis and associated tendinosis. For recalcitrant cases, however, we generally obtain a standard three-view elbow x-ray series, which should include an axial view if posterior elbow pain is present. The axial view is used to evaluate posterior osteophytes and calcifications within the tendons [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epicondylitis-tennis-and-golf-elbow/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>].</p><p>MRI may play a role in determining whether surgery is needed for treatment of chronic, recalcitrant symptoms of six months or longer duration. The presence of intermediate or high T2 signal intensity within the common flexor tendon or the presence of peritendinous soft tissue edema were the most specific findings of medial epicondylitis when compared with asymptomatic elbows in a small observational trial [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epicondylitis-tennis-and-golf-elbow/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>]. High signal on T2 images of the extensor carpi radialis brevis helped guide surgical treatment in a small study involving 11 cases of refractory lateral epicondylitis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epicondylitis-tennis-and-golf-elbow/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>].</p><p>Musculoskeletal ultrasound (MUS) can be used in chronic, recalcitrant epicondylitis to localize lesions prior to surgery or the use of injections or alternative treatments. In experienced hands, MUS can identify abnormal tendon appearance (eg, tendon thickening, partial tear at tendon origin, calcifications) and neovascularity when color flow Doppler is used [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epicondylitis-tennis-and-golf-elbow/abstract/43,44\" class=\"abstract_t\">43,44</a>].

As the scientific understanding of tendinopathy has developed, controversy surrounding the role of antiinflammatory medications in the treatment of epicondylitis and other chronic degenerative tendinopathies has grown. Examples of antiinflammatory treatment include icing, nonsteroidal antiinflammatory medicines, iontophoresis, and glucocorticoid injection. Ice in combination with an eccentric strength and flexibility program was no better than eccentric training alone for lateral epicondylitis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epicondylitis-tennis-and-golf-elbow/abstract/45\" class=\"abstract_t\">45</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Pathophysiology'</a> above.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H18\"><span class=\"h2\">Nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs)</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Although evidence is limited, a systematic review found that NSAIDs may reduce pain and improve function in the short-term (ie, six weeks) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epicondylitis-tennis-and-golf-elbow/abstract/46\" class=\"abstract_t\">46</a>]. We try to limit both the amount and duration of NSAID therapy, given the potential side effects of NSAIDs and our understanding of the pathophysiology of tendinopathy (see <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Pathophysiology'</a> above). Topical NSAIDs (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diclofenac-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">diclofenac</a> gel) may have limited benefit in acute epicondylitis, but studies are preliminary [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epicondylitis-tennis-and-golf-elbow/abstract/47\" class=\"abstract_t\">47</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H19\"><span class=\"h2\">Glucocorticoid injections</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Multiple trials and systematic reviews have found that glucocorticoid injection for lateral epicondylitis improves many short-term (six week) outcome measures [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epicondylitis-tennis-and-golf-elbow/abstract/48-50\" class=\"abstract_t\">48-50</a>], but does not prevent recurrence and may lead to worse long-term outcomes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epicondylitis-tennis-and-golf-elbow/abstract/35,50-54\" class=\"abstract_t\">35,50-54</a>]. For short-term relief of severe symptoms, glucocorticoid injection is a reasonable treatment option when used as part of a comprehensive management program including physical therapy (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F60436\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef60436 \">picture 16</a>). We do not advocate multiple injections. Injections for medial epicondylitis should be used judiciously due to the proximity of the ulnar nerve.</p><p>Trials of glucocorticoid injection in epicondylitis are limited [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epicondylitis-tennis-and-golf-elbow/abstract/49,55\" class=\"abstract_t\">49,55</a>]. In a typical study, 198 patients with lateral epicondylitis of at least six weeks duration without prior treatment were randomized to eight sessions of standard physical therapy, glucocorticoid injections, or observation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epicondylitis-tennis-and-golf-elbow/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>]. Patients in the glucocorticoid group showed the greatest improvement in symptoms at six weeks, but had high rates of recurrence at 52 weeks. Moreover, the glucocorticoid group performed significantly worse on all outcome measures in long-term follow up.</p><p>Another study of glucocorticoid injection involved a &quot;peppering&quot; technique in which the painful tendon is injected approximately 40 to 50 times [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epicondylitis-tennis-and-golf-elbow/abstract/56\" class=\"abstract_t\">56</a>]. The 120 patients in this study were randomly assigned to receive injections of 1 mL <a href=\"topic.htm?path=triamcinolone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">triamcinolone</a> plus 1 mL <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lidocaine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">lidocaine</a> or 2 mL of lidocaine. Most patients had excellent results at one year regardless of the medication or dose, suggesting that the technique of injection played an important role. The researchers speculate that the &quot;peppering&quot; technique promotes a beneficial inflammatory response. (See <a href=\"#H15\" class=\"local\">'Secondary management'</a> above.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H20\"><span class=\"h2\">Iontophoresis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Studies of iontophoresis are small and preliminary, but the technique may provide some short-term benefit. In one randomized controlled trial, patients treated with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dexamethasone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">dexamethasone</a> by iontophoresis noted significant improvement of symptoms at two days compared with placebo, but this benefit was lost at one month [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epicondylitis-tennis-and-golf-elbow/abstract/57\" class=\"abstract_t\">57</a>].

The mechanism for many of these treatments is not clearly understood. Tissue growth factors may play a role in some therapies. Other treatments are described as &quot;proinflammatory&quot;. Theoretically, proinflammatory treatments address disorganized tendon patterns, neovessels, and degenerative changes by stimulating an inflammatory response (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F78876\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef78876 \">table 4</a>). Many of these trials are of limited quality [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epicondylitis-tennis-and-golf-elbow/abstract/55\" class=\"abstract_t\">55</a>].</p><p>The mechanical and medicinal interventions described below are the subject of ongoing research.

According to two systematic reviews of studies of PRP in the treatment of chronic lateral epicondylitis, the majority of randomized trials report that PRP is not effective therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epicondylitis-tennis-and-golf-elbow/abstract/59,60\" class=\"abstract_t\">59,60</a>]. However, one systematic review and network meta-analysis looking at treatment with PRP, autologous blood (AB), or glucocorticoid injection for lateral epicondylitis reported relative improvements in pain following treatment with PRP and AB [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epicondylitis-tennis-and-golf-elbow/abstract/61\" class=\"abstract_t\">61</a>]. The review was limited by the small number of high quality studies. &#160;</p><p>The inconsistent results of individual trials are demonstrated by the following examples:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a randomized, double-blinded trial of 60 patients with chronic lateral epicondylitis (symptoms for minimum of three months), no significant difference in the reduction of pain or disability at three months was found in patients treated with PRP compared to those treated with glucocorticoid or placebo (saline) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epicondylitis-tennis-and-golf-elbow/abstract/62\" class=\"abstract_t\">62</a>]. In addition, PRP injection did not have a notable effect upon the ultrasound appearance of the involved tendons. The intended one year follow up was not possible due to the large number of patients in all groups who dropped out of the study. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a randomized, double-blinded trial of 100 patients with chronic lateral epicondylitis, those who received a PRP injection had significant and sustained improvement in function compared to those treated with a glucocorticoid injection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epicondylitis-tennis-and-golf-elbow/abstract/63,64\" class=\"abstract_t\">63,64</a>].

Some small controlled and observational studies of patients with refractory medial and lateral epicondylitis who received ultrasound-guided autologous blood injection plus dry-needling have reported improvements in symptoms and in the ultrasound appearance of involved tendons [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epicondylitis-tennis-and-golf-elbow/abstract/66,67\" class=\"abstract_t\">66,67</a>]. In a randomized, blinded trial of 30 patients with chronic lateral epicondylitis, autologous blood injections were found to elicit improvements at six months comparable to those achieved with saline plus <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lidocaine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">lidocaine</a> or glucocorticoid injections. Other studies report no significant improvement [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epicondylitis-tennis-and-golf-elbow/abstract/68\" class=\"abstract_t\">68</a>], and overall studies are of limited quality [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epicondylitis-tennis-and-golf-elbow/abstract/55\" class=\"abstract_t\">55</a>]. The relative importance of the inflammatory response stimulated by the blood and dry-needling or growth factors present in the blood remains unclear, as does the effectiveness of this treatment. A meta-analysis of studies comparing autologous blood and glucocorticoid injection for lateral epicondylitis found that glucocorticoid provided better immediate pain relief (2 to 4 weeks), but autologous blood products led to improved function and decreased pain and disability during the intermediate period (6 to 24 weeks) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epicondylitis-tennis-and-golf-elbow/abstract/69\" class=\"abstract_t\">69</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H24\"><span class=\"h2\">Ultrasound-guided percutaneous needle tenotomy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Needle tenotomy involves injecting local anesthetic and then using a needle under ultrasound guidance to fenestrate tendinotic tissue, break up calcifications, and if needed abrade the surface of underlying bone. The mechanism underlying this proposed technique remains unclear. An injection of glucocorticoid and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=bupivacaine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">bupivacaine</a> is performed following the procedure. Patients then perform passive stretching and standard physical therapy exercises at home. </p><p>In an observational, uncontrolled trial of the protocol described, 55 patients with chronic epicondylitis despite standard conservative treatment reported good or excellent outcomes at an average of 28 months [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epicondylitis-tennis-and-golf-elbow/abstract/70\" class=\"abstract_t\">70</a>].

Some patients may be able to return to work so long as aggravating activities can be avoided.

The patient must receive instruction and demonstrate proper mechanics before returning to full participation. A slow functional progression of tennis exercises allows for a safer return to sport following rehabilitation and is generally recommended prior to resuming competition (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F60005\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef60005 \">table 5</a>). (See <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'Risk reduction in tennis'</a> above.)</p><p>Some athletes can continue playing in a modified fashion while undergoing rehabilitation, provided they continue to improve. This approach is reasonable in players who experience pain only after matches. Modified play may include switching to a two-handed backhand, reducing string tension, and eliminating shots with exaggerated spin. Some players require complete rest from inciting activities during rehabilitation to ensure recovery.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"PATIENT_INFORMATION\"><span class=\"h1\">INFORMATION FOR PATIENTS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>UpToDate offers two types of patient education materials, &quot;The Basics&quot; and &quot;Beyond the Basics.&quot; The Basics patient education pieces are written in plain language, at the 5<sup>th</sup> to 6<sup>th</sup> grade reading level, and they answer the four or five key questions a patient might have about a given condition. These articles are best for patients who want a general overview and who prefer short, easy-to-read materials. Beyond the Basics patient education pieces are longer, more sophisticated, and more detailed. These articles are written at the 10<sup>th</sup> to 12<sup>th</sup> grade reading level and are best for patients who want in-depth information and are comfortable with some medical jargon.</p><p>Here are the patient education articles that are relevant to this topic. We encourage you to print or e-mail these topics to your patients.

Epicondylitis represents a chronic tendinosis, rather than an acute inflammatory process, involving disorganized tissue and neovessels. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Epidemiology and risk factors'</a> above and <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Mechanisms of injury'</a> above and <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Pathophysiology'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A number of factors, including poor stroke mechanics and inappropriate racquet type, predispose tennis players to developing epicondylitis (elbow tendinosis). (See <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'Risk reduction in tennis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients with epicondylitis (elbow tendinosis) typically complain of extraarticular medial or lateral elbow pain. Pain is exacerbated by contraction or passive flexion of either the wrist extensor muscles (lateral epicondylitis) or flexor muscles (medial epicondylitis). (See <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'Clinical presentation and examination'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A number of conditions can cause focal medial or lateral elbow pain (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F73460\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef73460 \">table 2</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F52503\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef52503 \">table 3</a>). (See <a href=\"#H8\" class=\"local\">'Differential diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Evidence supporting specific treatments for epicondylitis (elbow tendinosis) is scant. Once a clinical diagnosis is made, our initial treatment consists of activity modification, counter force bracing, nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) if not contraindicated, and physical therapy (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F57758\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef57758 \">algorithm 1</a>). Counter force bracing may reduce tendon and muscle strain at the origin of the forearm extensor muscles, thereby relieving pain and improving function. Well-designed physical therapy programs that include progressive eccentric strengthening are effective treatment for many patients with epicondylitis. (See <a href=\"#H9\" class=\"local\">'Initial management'</a> above and <a href=\"#H14\" class=\"local\">'Physical therapy and eccentric exercise'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Glucocorticoid injection for lateral epicondylitis improves many short-term (six week) outcome measures, but does not prevent recurrence and may lead to worse long-term outcomes. (See <a href=\"#H19\" class=\"local\">'Glucocorticoid injections'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In patients who do not improve with standard initial interventions, we often obtain imaging studies before resorting to other treatments. A number of potential therapies for tendon healing are under study and may provide benefit for some patients, but evidence is limited. (See <a href=\"#H21\" class=\"local\">'Other proposed treatments'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Indications for orthopedic referral include severe pain or marked dysfunction for six months or longer and failure of conservative management to improve symptoms or function over six months.
