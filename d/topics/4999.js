However, tumor invasion into vital structures <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> organs can result in substantial morbidity and may be fatal, especially in the case of intraabdominal desmoids arising in patients with familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP). Desmoid tumors are responsible for 9 to 11 percent of deaths among patients with FAP.

However, there is a significant risk of local recurrence, even after complete surgical resection. Increasingly, a multidisciplinary approach to management is being used, particularly among patients with an intraabdominal desmoid. Multimodality therapy can result in effective disease control in up to 96 percent of such patients with both FAP associated and sporadic desmoid tumors, even when the disease occurs at a difficult location, such as the intestinal mesentery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/desmoid-tumors-systemic-therapy/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>].</p><p>This topic review will discuss systemic therapy for desmoid tumors.

In one series, 57 percent of FAP patients undergoing surgery for a desmoid tumor of the intestinal mesentery required resection of multiple intestinal segments (compared with 23 percent of patients with sporadic desmoid tumors), and 38 percent required multiple procedures (compared with 16 percent of patients with sporadic tumors) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/desmoid-tumors-systemic-therapy/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Furthermore, surgery may provoke the development of desmoid tumors in patients with FAP [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/desmoid-tumors-systemic-therapy/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. In one series, the median interval to the development of a desmoid tumor after surgery in FAP patients is 2.3 years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/desmoid-tumors-systemic-therapy/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Finally, recurrences tend to be more frequent and aggressive with each surgical intervention, and some studies suggest a decreased response to systemic therapy after multiple surgical procedures [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/desmoid-tumors-systemic-therapy/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. A retrospective evaluation of outcomes in 62 patents with FAP and intraabdominal desmoids tumors showed that conservative management and surgery produced comparable outcomes (10-year rate of progression-free survival 49 versus 33 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/desmoid-tumors-systemic-therapy/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].</p><p>These observations have led many clinicians (including our group), the American Society of Colon and Rectal Surgeons (ASCRS), and a joint task force of the American Society of Clinical Oncology <span class=\"nowrap\">(ASCO)/Society</span> of Surgical Oncology (SSO) to advocate conservative management rather than initial resection for patients with Gardner syndrome and intraabdominal desmoid tumors that are large, are slow growing, involve the mesentery, or encase vessels <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> organs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/desmoid-tumors-systemic-therapy/abstract/6,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,7</a>]. We prefer to use noncytotoxic systemic therapy initially in the absence of significant symptoms or rapidly progressive disease. However, this is a controversial area, and some clinicians consider surgery to still be a standard approach for potentially resectable intraabdominal tumors in patients with FAP. This topic is addressed in more detail elsewhere.

The choice of initial therapy depends on the urgency of the clinical situation, whether the patient is symptomatic or not, the severity of symptoms, and the clinical scenario:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Aggressive systemic therapeutic options, such as combination chemotherapy, should be reserved for patients with an impending threat to either life or function, or who are severely symptomatic.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Other patients who qualify for systemic therapy should be managed by less toxic approaches, such as hormonal therapy, antiinflammatory therapy, or TKIs.

In some situations, the response may be delayed past the point of completion of the treatment regimen [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/desmoid-tumors-systemic-therapy/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].

The persistence of disease that is stable or minimally increased in size should not be considered a treatment failure during initial treatment. Symptomatic or functional improvement should be regarded as a reason to continue therapy when changes in the dimensions of the tumor are minimal or absent.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h1\">NONCYTOTOXIC APPROACHES</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Hormonal therapy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A potential role for female hormones in the pathogenesis of desmoid tumors is suggested by the finding that desmoids are more common in females than in males and by the occurrence of abdominal wall desmoids during pregnancy and their resolution with the cessation of hormonal influences.

However, this rule does not apply to desmoid tumors; chemotherapy is effective against these slowly growing, nonmetastasizing tumors.

Monotherapy appears to be fairly effective in controlling desmoid tumors, with response rates that exceed 75 percent in some series [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/desmoid-tumors-systemic-therapy/abstract/2,50\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,50</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H17\"><span class=\"h2\">Combination chemotherapy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In well-selected patients with rapidly progressive desmoid tumors for which other local and systemic therapy options have failed, combination chemotherapy can effectively achieve disease control.

Non-doxorubicin-based regimens use either combinations of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methotrexate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">methotrexate</a> (MTX) and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=vinblastine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">vinblastine</a> on a weekly schedule or other combinations of vinca alkaloids plus an alkylating agent.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H18\"><span class=\"h3\">Doxorubicin-containing combinations</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Doxorubicin-containing regimens have a higher response rate than monotherapy or non-anthracycline-containing regimens against desmoid tumors, but they are also more toxic [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/desmoid-tumors-systemic-therapy/abstract/53-59\" class=\"abstract_t\">53-59</a>]. <a href=\"topic.htm?path=doxorubicin-conventional-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Doxorubicin</a> plus <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dacarbazine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">dacarbazine</a> (DTIC) represents the most commonly used cytotoxic chemotherapy combination for desmoid tumors at our institution.

Almost all patients in these studies derived clinical benefit, and most responded with an objective complete or partial response, which were sustained. In some cases, the clinical &quot;response&quot; was sufficient to allow later surgical resection.</p><p>In the largest published series, 11 patients received <a href=\"topic.htm?path=doxorubicin-conventional-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">doxorubicin</a> (60 to 90 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/m<sup>2</sup>)</span> plus <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dacarbazine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">dacarbazine</a> (750 to 1000 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/m<sup>2</sup></span> infused continuously over a 72-hour period) for a median of five cycles [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/desmoid-tumors-systemic-therapy/abstract/54\" class=\"abstract_t\">54</a>]. Six of nine evaluable patients had an objective response (two complete, four partial). One complete responder died, two were lost to follow-up, and the remainder remained alive and progression free with follow-up ranging from 28 to 235 months postdiagnosis. Cardiac toxicity, myelosuppression, mucositis, and nausea are the most common side effects experienced with this regimen. A lower-dose regimen (doxorubicin 50 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/m<sup>2</sup></span> plus dacarbazine 600 to 700 mg per cycle) has been reported to provide disease control with a more favorable side effect profile, although experience with this regimen is limited to a few patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/desmoid-tumors-systemic-therapy/abstract/60\" class=\"abstract_t\">60</a>].</p><p>The optimal duration of chemotherapy is not known and is addressed below.

The two prospective phase II trials and one large retrospective study are described in detail:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In the adult phase II trial, MTX was administered at a dose of 30 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/m<sup>2</sup></span> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=vinblastine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">vinblastine</a> was administered at a dose of 6 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/m<sup>2</sup></span> (total dose rounded to 50 mg of MTX and 10 mg of vinblastine); both were given intravenously weekly for a median interval of one year [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/desmoid-tumors-systemic-therapy/abstract/61\" class=\"abstract_t\">61</a>]. Of the 30 patients, 21 (70 percent) had durable clinical benefit (including stable disease, partial and complete responses that did not progress on or off chemotherapy, with a median follow-up of 62 months). Nine patients progressed at a median 10 months after stopping therapy. Neutropenia was the predominant toxicity.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In the pediatric phase II trial, a lower rate of durable responses (30 percent) was seen, and they lasted a median of 43 months [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/desmoid-tumors-systemic-therapy/abstract/62\" class=\"abstract_t\">62</a>]. In this trial, 38 percent of patients progressed while receiving chemotherapy (compared with none in the adult trial), the majority of whom progressed at or before the first magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), scheduled at 12 weeks. Responses to treatment for desmoid tumors may take several months to evolve, and this slow response time may be responsible for the greater proportion of patients with &quot;early progression&quot; in the pediatric trial than in the adult trial.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">The median duration of therapy for all patients was 40 weeks (range 10 to 52). The best responses were a complete response in one patient, a partial response in four (objective response rate 19 percent), a minor response in three, and stable disease in 10. Treatment was complicated by neutropenia in 22 patients, which was grade 4 in five. In contrast, only two patients developed grade 1 sensory neuropathy.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>These results were confirmed in a 75-patient retrospective study that examined the use of MTX plus <a href=\"topic.htm?path=vinorelbine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">vinorelbine</a> (57 percent of patients), MTX plus <a href=\"topic.htm?path=vinblastine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">vinblastine</a> (40 percent), or vinorelbine alone (3 percent) in patients with progressive desmoid fibromatosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/desmoid-tumors-systemic-therapy/abstract/66\" class=\"abstract_t\">66</a>]. The best responses were a complete response in 1 percent, a partial response in 47 percent, and stable disease in 51 percent; the median duration of chemotherapy administration was 14 months, and the median number of cycles was 37.5. Eight patients discontinued therapy due to toxicity rather than disease progression. The median progression-free survival was 75 months (136 months in patients with a response). Retreatment at the time of disease progression off chemotherapy was attempted in 11 patients, with a partial response in four patients, stable disease in six patients, and progressive disease in one patient.</p><p/><p>For patients who develop neurotoxicity during therapy, a combination of MTX and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=vinorelbine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">vinorelbine</a> may be considered. In one small report, vinorelbine (used at a dose of 20 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/m<sup>2</sup></span> weekly) in combination with MTX (50 mg weekly) induced either a partial or complete response in 60 percent of patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/desmoid-tumors-systemic-therapy/abstract/67\" class=\"abstract_t\">67</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H20\"><span class=\"h1\">DURATION OF THERAPY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>For both cytotoxic and noncytotoxic agents, the duration of therapy should be based upon toxicity and response.

Although noncytotoxic agents are often continued indefinitely in the absence of toxicity, treatment breaks can be incorporated into the treatment plan, particularly if there are side effects. For cytotoxic therapy, dose-limiting toxicities tend to develop over time, and the duration of therapy will depend on the regimen:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Doxorubicin-based regimens are limited by cumulative cardiac toxicity and myelosuppression.

Retreatment with the same systemic therapy regimen may produce responses that are similar to the original response [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/desmoid-tumors-systemic-therapy/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>], but treatment-related toxicity and alternative strategies must be considered in the decision making.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"PATIENT_INFORMATION\"><span class=\"h1\">INFORMATION FOR PATIENTS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>UpToDate offers two types of patient education materials, &quot;The Basics&quot; and &quot;Beyond the Basics.&quot; The Basics patient education pieces are written in plain language, at the 5<sup>th</sup> to 6<sup>th</sup> grade reading level, and they answer the four or five key questions a patient might have about a given condition.

Despite being histologically benign, they are locally infiltrative and can cause death through invasion and destruction of adjacent vital structures and organs. (See <a href=\"#H1\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H23\"><span class=\"h2\">Indications for systemic therapy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Because desmoid tumors lack metastatic potential, they are primarily managed by local therapies, such as surgery and radiation. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=desmoid-tumors-epidemiology-risk-factors-molecular-pathogenesis-clinical-presentation-diagnosis-and-local-therapy#H17\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Desmoid tumors: Epidemiology, risk factors, molecular pathogenesis, clinical presentation, diagnosis, and local therapy&quot;, section on 'Treatment'</a>.)</p><p>The incorporation of systemic therapy is recommended for symptomatic patients who have either an unresectable tumor or a tumor for which resection is not possible without unacceptable morbidity (eg, an <span class=\"nowrap\">intraabdominal/mesenteric</span> tumor in a patient with familial adenomatous polyposis [FAP]). Systemic therapy is also indicated for patients with multiple locoregional recurrences despite adequate local therapy. (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Indications'</a> above.)</p><p>For asymptomatic patients with a low urgency for treatment, close observation is an alternative to initiation of systemic therapy.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H24\"><span class=\"h2\">Choice of therapy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Systemic therapy may be broadly classified into cytotoxic chemotherapy and less toxic therapies such as hormonal therapy, nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), and tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sorafenib-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">sorafenib</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=imatinib-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">imatinib</a>. The choice of therapy depends on the urgency of the clinical situation and symptoms. Our general approach to systemic therapy is outlined in the figure and summarized below (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F67503\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef67503 \">algorithm 1</a>). (See <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Choice of agent'</a> above.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For most symptomatic patients who require systemic therapy but are not highly symptomatic and do not have an impending threat to life or function, we suggest noncytotoxic therapy rather than cytotoxic chemotherapy (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). This generally includes most patients with FAP who have large, slowly growing intraabdominal desmoids that involve the mesentery or encase vessels <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> organs. The choice of hormonal therapy, an NSAID, or a TKI should be based upon the degree of symptomatology, and physician and patient preference.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Patients who are moderately symptomatic may be considered for TKIs because the level of symptomatology justifies the side effects produced by systemic therapy. In other patients with minimal symptoms, hormonal therapy and NSAIDs may be attempted initially to minimize side effects. If <a href=\"topic.htm?path=imatinib-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">imatinib</a> therapy is chosen, we suggest 400 mg daily. If <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tamoxifen-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">tamoxifen</a> is chosen, we generally start with tamoxifen 20 mg daily.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Responses in patients treated with noncytotoxic agents can take months to manifest, and therapy should be continued until progression, especially when there is symptomatic improvement. (See <a href=\"#H20\" class=\"local\">'Duration of therapy'</a> above and <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'Response evaluation during systemic therapy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">For nonsymptomatic patients, close observation is an alternative option to early initiation of systemic therapy. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We suggest <a href=\"topic.htm?path=imatinib-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">imatinib</a> or an alternative TKI rather than cytotoxic therapy in patients for whom hormonal approaches have failed, as long as there is no urgency to induce a response (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). Another option in this setting is an NSAID alone or the combined use of hormone therapy plus an NSAID. (See <a href=\"#H13\" class=\"local\">'Imatinib'</a> above and <a href=\"#H12\" class=\"local\">'Combined hormone plus antiinflammatory therapy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In clinical situations where there is urgency to induce a response, we suggest cytotoxic chemotherapy rather than noncytotoxic therapies (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). The choice of the chemotherapy regimen should be based upon the clinical situation and the ability of the patient to tolerate the adverse effects associated with each regimen. Although response rates are higher with doxorubicin-based combination chemotherapy (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=doxorubicin-conventional-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">doxorubicin</a> plus <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dacarbazine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">dacarbazine</a>) as compared with anthracycline monotherapy or weekly low-dose <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methotrexate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">methotrexate</a> plus a vinca alkaloid, toxicity is also worse, and it is not clear that progression-free survival is better.
