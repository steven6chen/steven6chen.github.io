Subsequent therapy depends upon the presence or absence of more extensive disease, histology, or other risk factors (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F112840\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef112840 \">algorithm 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F112243\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef112243 \">algorithm 2</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F114315\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef114315 \">algorithm 3</a>).</p><p>Whenever possible, a baseline sperm count and sperm banking should be performed prior to orchiectomy and further therapy. Semen cryopreservation should be made available to all men diagnosed with testicular cancer prior to instituting therapy if they wish to preserve fertility. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-staging-of-testicular-germ-cell-tumors#H18\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and staging of testicular germ cell tumors&quot;, section on 'Cryopreservation of sperm'</a>.)</p><p>For men who present with clinically advanced disease, we perform a radical orchiectomy prior to chemotherapy whenever possible. Despite this, there are some men who present with life-threatening advanced disease who undergo systemic chemotherapy prior to orchiectomy (&quot;delayed orchiectomy&quot;). In such patients, the diagnosis should be obtained by biopsy of a metastatic lesion prior to treatment. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=radical-inguinal-orchiectomy-for-testicular-germ-cell-tumors\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Radical inguinal orchiectomy for testicular germ cell tumors&quot;</a>.) </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1392152312\"><span class=\"h1\">SEMINOMA VERSUS NSGCT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The final pathology analysis is used to stratify testicular germ cell tumors (GCTs) into seminomas and nonseminomatous germ cell tumors (NSGCTs). These differ in clinical and biologic behavior. </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Seminomas are more likely to present with localized disease. Approximately 80 percent of men with seminomas present with stage I disease (limited to the testicle), while 15 percent have stage II disease (limited to retroperitoneal nodes) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F110731\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef110731 \">table 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F110732\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef110732 \">table 2</a>). Fewer than 5 percent of patients have spread beyond the retroperitoneal nodes at presentation.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Seminomas display relatively indolent growth and a longer natural history, and they rarely spread via the bloodstream beyond the retroperitoneal lymph nodes to other areas (eg, liver, lung, bones, or brain). Stage III metastases occur more frequently in men with NSGCTs.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Seminomas typically do not have marked elevation of serum beta-human chorionic gonadotropin (beta-hCG) and never have an elevated alpha-fetoprotein (AFP). Seminoma with an elevated serum AFP is considered a mixed GCT, and these cancers are treated as NSGCTs. In contrast, beta-hCG and AFP are elevated in the majority of men with NSGCTs.
