It is defined as a lymphoma of follicle center B cells, and virtually always demonstrates a growth pattern that is partially follicular. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=classification-of-the-hematopoietic-neoplasms\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Classification of the hematopoietic neoplasms&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The molecular pathogenesis of FL is a complex, multistep process during which a single follicular B cell acquires all of the genetic and epigenetic alterations needed for malignant transformation. The resultant tumor is usually comprised of a mixture of centrocytes (small cleaved follicular center cells) and centroblasts (large noncleaved follicular center cells). Some common steps in this pathway have been elucidated, particularly chromosomal rearrangements involving BCL-2 and certain somatic mutations, some of which are also seen in other non-Hodgkin lymphoma variants. These lesions typically persist and are joined by other acquired lesions in the not uncommon instance in which FL evolves into a more aggressive lymphoma, usually diffuse large B cell lymphoma, an event referred to as histologic transformation. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=histologic-transformation-of-follicular-lymphoma\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Histologic transformation of follicular lymphoma&quot;</a>.)</p><p>This review will discuss the pathobiology of FL in adults. In contrast, a different form of FL that mainly develops in children and adolescents appears to have distinctive clinical and pathologic features. The epidemiology, clinical presentation, pathologic features, diagnosis, treatment, and prognosis of FL are discussed separately. General aspects of the pathobiology of non-Hodgkin lymphoma are also discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-pathologic-features-diagnosis-and-prognosis-of-follicular-lymphoma\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations, pathologic features, diagnosis, and prognosis of follicular lymphoma&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=initial-treatment-of-limited-stage-i-ii-follicular-lymphoma\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Initial treatment of limited stage (I/II) follicular lymphoma&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-relapsed-or-refractory-follicular-lymphoma\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of relapsed or refractory follicular lymphoma&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-the-pathobiology-of-the-non-hodgkin-lymphomas\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of the pathobiology of the non-Hodgkin lymphomas&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H26244312\"><span class=\"h1\">CELL OF ORIGIN</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>FL is a heterogeneous clinicopathologic entity that has as a common feature an origin from germinal center B cells [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathobiology-of-follicular-lymphoma/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. The tumor is comprised of variable numbers of small, cleaved cells (centrocytes) and larger, blastoid cells (centroblasts) that morphologically resemble cells found in the light and dark zones of normal germinal centers, respectively. The germinal center ancestry of these cells is principally supported by the identification of somatic mutations in the variable region of the immunoglobulin genes (IgVH), which serves as a marker of germinal center transit [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathobiology-of-follicular-lymphoma/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>], the follicular growth pattern of the tumor cells in most cases, and the immunophenotype of the tumor cells, which in most respects closely resembles that of normal follicle center B cells. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-the-pathobiology-of-the-non-hodgkin-lymphomas#H38692429\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of the pathobiology of the non-Hodgkin lymphomas&quot;, section on 'B cell lymphoma'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H91137362\"><span class=\"h1\">PATHOGENESIS</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H91137370\"><span class=\"h2\">Overview</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The development of the majority of FL tumors in adults is dependent upon the overexpression of B cell <span class=\"nowrap\">leukemia/lymphoma</span> 2 (BCL-2) located on chromosome band 18q21. BCL-2 is an oncogene that blocks programmed cell death (apoptosis). As such, overexpression results in prolonged cell survival. BCL-2 overexpression in itself is not sufficient for FL development and other genetic lesions or host factors are required (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F56311\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef56311 \">figure 1</a>). (See <a href=\"#H26243882\" class=\"local\">'Other genetic lesions'</a> below.)</p><p>BCL-2 overexpression is virtually always the result of a translocation that places the BCL-2 gene under the control of immunoglobulin <span class=\"nowrap\">promoter/enhancer</span> elements. Of these, the t(14;18)(q32;q21) is most common and places BCL-2 under the control of the IgH locus, but variant translocations also occur that place BCL-2 under the control of the kappa or lambda immunoglobulin loci instead. (See <a href=\"#H26243875\" class=\"local\">'Translocations involving BCL-2'</a> below.)</p><p>These aberrations likely represent mistakes that occur during attempted antigen receptor gene diversification in normal B cells. In the bone marrow, pre-B cells rearrange the V(D)J segments of their immunoglobulin (Ig) loci to allow expression of IgM. This process, termed V(D)J recombination, requires the recombination activating genes RAG1 and RAG2. Subsequently, in the germinal center, antigen stimulated B cells undergo class-switch recombination (from IgM to IgG or IgA) and somatic hypermutation. Somatic hypermutation, a key component of the humoral immune response, is the process by which point mutations and small deletions or insertions are introduced at high frequency into the variable regions of immunoglobulin heavy chain genes. Both class switch recombination and somatic hypermutation require the enzyme activation-induced cytidine deaminase (AID).</p><p>The sequences found immediately adjacent to the points of DNA breakage and rejoining in <span class=\"nowrap\">BCL-2/Ig</span> translocations implicate <span class=\"nowrap\">RAG1/RAG2</span> in the process [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathobiology-of-follicular-lymphoma/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. It remains uncertain whether these RAG mediated breaks occur in pre-B cells or during antigen receptor gene &quot;editing&quot; in germinal center B cells. Cells bearing such rearrangements gain a selective advantage when the consequence is overexpression of an oncogene such as BCL-2. AID-mediated class-switching and somatic hypermutation are also error-prone, and it is strongly suspected that additional AID-dependent mutations introduced by these processes in germinal center B cells contribute to the development of FL. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-the-pathobiology-of-the-non-hodgkin-lymphomas#H3\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of the pathobiology of the non-Hodgkin lymphomas&quot;, section on 'Chromosomal translocations'</a>.) </p><p>Since FL often shows evidence of ongoing somatic hypermutation, it is possible that AID contributes to acquisition of additional mutations that are involved in histologic transformation of FL as well. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=histologic-transformation-of-follicular-lymphoma\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Histologic transformation of follicular lymphoma&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H26244320\"><span class=\"h2\">Aberrant BCL-2 expression</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H91137600\"><span class=\"h3\">BCL-2 action</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The B cell <span class=\"nowrap\">leukemia/lymphoma</span> 2 (BCL-2) gene encodes a 26-kDa integral membrane protein localized to the outer mitochondrial membrane and endoplasmic reticulum [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathobiology-of-follicular-lymphoma/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. In contrast to most proto-oncogenes, BCL-2 has little or no ability to promote cell cycle progression or cell proliferation, but rather raises the cellular apoptotic threshold, thereby inhibiting apoptosis (programmed cell death). Normally in germinal center B cells, BCL-2 expression is restricted to cells that, through the process of somatic hypermutation, by chance acquire Ig with high affinity for antigen; these cells are thought to then emerge from germinal centers as long-surviving memory B cells [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathobiology-of-follicular-lymphoma/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>] or to differentiate into plasma cells. This hypothesis is supported by data from mice bearing BCL-2 transgenes that show markedly protracted secondary immune responses and an extended lifetime for memory B cells in the absence of antigen [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathobiology-of-follicular-lymphoma/abstract/5,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,6</a>].</p><p>Apoptosis (programmed cell death) is essential for normal embryonic development, maintenance of tissue homeostasis, and development and function of the immune system. In contrast, processes that interfere with normal apoptosis promote cell survival and, potentially, oncogenesis. Apoptosis is regulated by a balance of pro-apoptotic factors and anti-apoptotic factors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathobiology-of-follicular-lymphoma/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pro-apoptotic factors &ndash; Two categories of pro-apoptotic factors exist, one consisting of multi-domain proteins (eg, BAX and BAK), and the second consisting of single BH3-domain only proteins (eg, BAD and BID). BAX and BAK are major initiators of apoptosis. The role of BH3-domain only proteins is still unsettled; they may contribute to apoptosis by inhibiting anti-apoptotic proteins (see below) or by directly activating BAX. Once activated, BAX and BAK form aggregates in the mitochondrial membrane that promote apoptosis by releasing cytochrome c from the mitochondria, which leads to the activation of caspase-9 followed by caspase-3, a so-called apoptotic executioner. Active caspase-3 proteolytically cleaves a number of key cellular proteins, including a negative regulatory unit of caspase activated DNase, an endonuclease that cleaves DNA and contributes to apoptosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathobiology-of-follicular-lymphoma/abstract/8-10\" class=\"abstract_t\">8-10</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Anti-apoptotic factors &ndash; BCL-2, BCL-XL and MCL-1 are examples of anti-apoptotic factors. Although the mechanism is not completely understood, these anti-apoptotic factors restrain the activity of pro-apoptotic proteins, such as BAX and BAK, and prevent the release of mitochondrial proteins, such as cytochrome c, thereby inhibiting apoptosis.</p><p/><p>FL demonstrates increased expression of the anti-apoptotic factors (BCL-2, BCL-XL, and MCL1) and very low or undetectable amounts of pro-apoptotic factors such as BAX and BAD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathobiology-of-follicular-lymphoma/abstract/11,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,12</a>]. This imbalance promotes cell survival.</p><p>How BCL-2 translocations contribute to the development of FL is complex and incompletely understood. It has long been known that <span class=\"nowrap\">BCL-2/IgH</span> translocations can be detected at low frequency (ie, one cell in 1000 to one cell in 10,000) in the germinal centers of a high fraction of normal individuals, almost none of whom will go on to develop FL [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathobiology-of-follicular-lymphoma/abstract/13,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,14</a>]. Similarly, highly sensitive methods can detect t(14;18) at low levels in the peripheral blood of some healthy individuals [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathobiology-of-follicular-lymphoma/abstract/15,16\" class=\"abstract_t\">15,16</a>]. One study found that these individuals carry this translocation within a population of atypical germinal center-type B cells that have phenotypic features of FL [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathobiology-of-follicular-lymphoma/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. These observations clearly indicate that <span class=\"nowrap\">BCL-2/IgH</span> translocations are not sufficient to cause FL, and that other genetic or epigenetic events are rate limiting for its development.</p><p>The natural history of persons with low levels of circulating clones resembling FL is not known. In one study, a highly sensitive PCR-based assay was able to identify <span class=\"nowrap\">IgH/BCL-2</span> fusion genes in a subset of patients up to 15 years before diagnosis of FL [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathobiology-of-follicular-lymphoma/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>].

These tumors have gene expression profiles that are distinct from BCL-2 expressing tumors and may be a different clinicopathologic entity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathobiology-of-follicular-lymphoma/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. BCL-2 negativity is most commonly seen in grade 3b FL, in which the tumor is comprised of solid sheets of centroblasts that grow in a follicular pattern [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathobiology-of-follicular-lymphoma/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-pathologic-features-diagnosis-and-prognosis-of-follicular-lymphoma#H11\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations, pathologic features, diagnosis, and prognosis of follicular lymphoma&quot;, section on 'Grade'</a>.)</p><p>The clinical course of grade 3b FL is generally more similar to that of diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL) than that of FL grades 1 and 2. One study using cytogenetics demonstrated that this morphologic subgroup includes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathobiology-of-follicular-lymphoma/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]: </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Tumors with the t(14;18) affecting BCL-2 </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Tumors with 3q27 rearrangements affecting BCL-6</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Tumors that lack either of these characteristic cytogenetic abnormalities</p><p/><p>The same molecular subdivisions exist in DLBCL, leading to the suggestion that the lymphomas with t(14;18) may be more similar to FL grades 1 and 2, while the other two subtypes are more closely related to de novo DLBCL [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathobiology-of-follicular-lymphoma/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. Although this series suggested that BCL-6 rearrangements and BCL-2 rearrangements are mutually exclusive in FL, subsequent studies have identified rare tumors with both rearrangements [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathobiology-of-follicular-lymphoma/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. In either case, BCL-6 expression may play a role in the pathogenesis of a subset of grade 3b FL. BCL-6 encodes a transcription factor that is essential for normal germinal center B cell development. Expression of BCL-6 in normal germinal center B cells down-regulates genes that sense DNA damage, such as the p53 tumor suppressor gene, which would otherwise trigger apoptosis in response to the physiologic DNA rearrangements of the germinal center, and also inhibits terminal B cell differentiation. This is described in more detail separately.

The need for additional factors is supported by the observation that BCL-2 transgenic mice develop a pattern of polyclonal hyperplasia of mature, long lived non-dividing B cells rather than clonal FL [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathobiology-of-follicular-lymphoma/abstract/5,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,6</a>]. With time, and analogous to the human disease, a fraction of BCL-2 transgenic mice develops aggressive, clonal large cell lymphomas, which have acquired additional genetic lesions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathobiology-of-follicular-lymphoma/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. Mechanisms beyond BCL-2 overexpression that are involved in the development of FL are largely unknown, but clues are emerging from deep sequencing of FL genomes and studies of the FL microenvironment. (See <a href=\"#H91138016\" class=\"local\">'Tumor microenvironment'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H26243882\"><span class=\"h2\">Other genetic lesions</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Approximately 90 percent of FL will demonstrate genetic alterations in addition to the t(14;18) translocation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathobiology-of-follicular-lymphoma/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. The most common of these are loss of 1p, 6q, 10q, and 17p and gains of chromosomes 1, 6p, 7, 8, 12q, X, and <span class=\"nowrap\">18q/dup</span>. As an example, deletions of chromosome 6 involving the long arm occur in approximately 20 percent of cases and have been associated with poor prognosis and survival in multiple studies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathobiology-of-follicular-lymphoma/abstract/29-31\" class=\"abstract_t\">29-31</a>]. Another region affected by both deletions and uniparental disomy and previously associated with poor prognosis is 1p36, shown to affect the TNFRSF14 gene [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathobiology-of-follicular-lymphoma/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>], which is also involved by point mutations in a subset of cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathobiology-of-follicular-lymphoma/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>]. In contrast, other proto-oncogenes involved in lymphomagenesis (eg, MYC, cyclin D1) are not involved in FL. However, about 5 to 15 percent of FLs have 3q27 abnormalities, involving the BCL-6 gene that is commonly involved in the pathogenesis of diffuse large B cell lymphoma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathobiology-of-follicular-lymphoma/abstract/26,27\" class=\"abstract_t\">26,27</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H174935843\" class=\"local\">'BCL-2 negative cases'</a> above.)</p><p>Efforts focused on genome sequencing have identified an unexpected role for mutation of histone-modifying genes or chromatin modifying genes in FL. Multiple studies have reported mutations in the following genes (listed in order of decreasing frequency): KMT2D, CREBBP, EZH2, EP300, HIST1H1E, KMT2C, ARID1A, and SMARCA4 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathobiology-of-follicular-lymphoma/abstract/33-41\" class=\"abstract_t\">33-41</a>]. The mechanism by which these genes promote FL remains to be elucidated, but early work looking at the hierarchy of these genetic aberrations has suggested that BCL-2 rearrangements and CREBBP mutations are early &quot;founding&quot; events, and that KMT2D and TNFRSF4 mutations occur later in the course, possibly as part of disease progression <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> development of drug resistance [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathobiology-of-follicular-lymphoma/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>]. Studies in mice have shown that disruption of KMT2D perturbs germinal center B cell development and accelerates the development of germinal center B cell derived lymphomas in BCL-2 transgenic mice, confirming that loss of KMT2D activity is lymphomagenic [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathobiology-of-follicular-lymphoma/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>]. In addition, several studies have reported recurrent mutations involving histone genes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathobiology-of-follicular-lymphoma/abstract/37,38,43,44\" class=\"abstract_t\">37,38,43,44</a>], further reinforcing the notion that abnormalities of chromatin have an important, albeit incompletely understood, role in the pathobiology of FL. </p><p>Other sequencing studies have identified recurrent mutations involving signaling pathways with important roles in B cell biology. One group of recurrent mutations is hypothesized to upregulate mTOR (mammalian target of rapamycin) signaling in FL cells. These mutations, which are found in approximately 15 to 20 percent of cases, may involve genes encoding components of vacuolar H<sup>+</sup>-ATPase, which is known to be necessary for amino acid-induced mTOR activation, or RRAGC, a guanine nucleotide binding protein that also regulates mTOR activation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathobiology-of-follicular-lymphoma/abstract/45\" class=\"abstract_t\">45</a>]. Somatic mutations also have been identified in genes that encode components of the B cell receptor (BCR) signaling pathway (eg, BTK, CD79B) in a subset of FL [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathobiology-of-follicular-lymphoma/abstract/43\" class=\"abstract_t\">43</a>]. BCR signaling directs many cellular processes including growth, differentiation, survival, and adhesion or cellular migration. The exact details depend upon numerous variables including the cellular maturation, the antigen ligated, and the microenvironment.</p><p>The number of additional genetic lesions increases with histologic grade, being most numerous with grade 3b histology. Over time, a significant fraction of FL evolves into an aggressive lymphoma with a diffuse large cell histology [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathobiology-of-follicular-lymphoma/abstract/46\" class=\"abstract_t\">46</a>]. This morphologic shift is associated with p53 loss-of-function mutations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathobiology-of-follicular-lymphoma/abstract/47-49\" class=\"abstract_t\">47-49</a>]. Rearrangements of 1q21-23 have been identified in a subset of FL during disease progression. In cases where t(1;22)(q22;q11) was identified, the target gene is FCGR2B, which encodes the IgG Fc receptor, FcgammaRIIB. Since FcgammaRIIB is involved in regulating B cell proliferation, deregulation is likely to be important in the progression of FL [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathobiology-of-follicular-lymphoma/abstract/50\" class=\"abstract_t\">50</a>].

It has been suggested that FL is an immunologically functional disease in which an interaction between the tumor cells and the microenvironment determines overall clinical behavior.</p><p>The role of the microenvironment is supported by gene expression profiling and immunophenotypic studies that have correlated patient survival with the expression pattern of the immune cells accompanying the lymphoma, rather than with the expression pattern of the lymphoma itself [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathobiology-of-follicular-lymphoma/abstract/56-59\" class=\"abstract_t\">56-59</a>]. Communication between the tumor cells and the microenvironment likely involves chemokines, chemokine receptors and adhesion molecules, the balance of which determines whether there is tumor cell growth promotion or inhibition [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathobiology-of-follicular-lymphoma/abstract/60,61\" class=\"abstract_t\">60,61</a>]. In one such interaction, endogenous lectins within the microenvironment interface with sugar moieties linked to immunoglobulins on the surface of FL tumor cells, resulting in activation of B cell receptor signaling pathways [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathobiology-of-follicular-lymphoma/abstract/62,63\" class=\"abstract_t\">62,63</a>]. Communication between the tumor cells and the microenvironment appears to be bidirectional. Signals from the tumor cells help to determine the composition of the cells in the surrounding area, which in turn support the growth and survival of the malignant cells [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathobiology-of-follicular-lymphoma/abstract/64,65\" class=\"abstract_t\">64,65</a>].</p><p>Comparisons of gene expression between purified FL cells and normal germinal center B cells have found upregulation of cell cycle mediators, B cell transcription factors, certain cytokines, and genes involved in cell-cell interactions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathobiology-of-follicular-lymphoma/abstract/66\" class=\"abstract_t\">66</a>]. These differences are consistent with a role for the microenvironment in tumor pathogenesis that requires further clarification. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-pathologic-features-diagnosis-and-prognosis-of-follicular-lymphoma#H75815126\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations, pathologic features, diagnosis, and prognosis of follicular lymphoma&quot;, section on 'Microenvironment'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H91138008\"><span class=\"h1\">HETEROGENEITY OF FL</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The diagnostic category of FL is heterogeneous in terms of morphology, genetics, and biologic behavior. However, it is generally unclear how these various morphologic variants relate to clinical outcome and response to therapy, and current efforts are focused on understanding how variation in the tumor microenvironment and gene expression affects FL pathobiology. As an example, BCL-2 negative tumors demonstrate a gene expression profile that is distinct from BCL-2 expressing tumors and may represent a different clinicopathologic entity. (See <a href=\"#H174935843\" class=\"local\">'BCL-2 negative cases'</a> above.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H30617521\"><span class=\"h1\">TRANSFORMATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Histologic transformation (HT) refers to the evolution of a clinically indolent non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL; eg, FL) to a clinically aggressive NHL (eg, diffuse large B cell lymphoma [DLBCL]) defined as those lymphomas in which survival of the untreated patient is measured in months. This is discussed in more detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=histologic-transformation-of-follicular-lymphoma\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Histologic transformation of follicular lymphoma&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H26244291\"><span class=\"h1\">SUMMARY</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Follicular lymphoma (FL) is the second most common histologic subtype of non-Hodgkin lymphoma. The molecular pathogenesis of FL is a complex, multistep process leading to the outgrowth of a malignant clone of germinal B cell origin (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F56311\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef56311 \">figure 1</a>). While some steps in this pathway have been elucidated, many remain unknown. (See <a href=\"#H26244312\" class=\"local\">'Cell of origin'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The development of the majority of FL tumors in adults is associated with the overexpression of B cell <span class=\"nowrap\">leukemia/lymphoma</span> 2 (BCL-2) located on chromosome band 18q21. BCL-2 is an oncogene that blocks programmed cell death (apoptosis). As such, overexpression results in prolonged cell survival. (See <a href=\"#H26244320\" class=\"local\">'Aberrant BCL-2 expression'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In the vast majority of cases, FL is associated with a translocation between the long arm of chromosome 18, the site of the BCL-2 oncogene, and one of the three immunoglobulin (Ig) genes. The most common translocation involves the Ig heavy chain gene resulting in the t(14;18)(q32;q21), found in approximately 85 percent of FL. (See <a href=\"#H26243875\" class=\"local\">'Translocations involving BCL-2'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Less than 10 percent of FL tumors lack BCL-2 translocations and fail to express BCL-2 proteins. BCL-2 negativity is most commonly seen in grade 3b FL, in which the tumor is comprised of solid sheets of centroblasts that nonetheless form a follicular pattern. (See <a href=\"#H174935843\" class=\"local\">'BCL-2 negative cases'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>BCL-2 overexpression in itself is not sufficient for FL development and other genetic lesions or host factors are required. Additional mechanisms for the development of FL are emerging from genetic studies, with initial studies pointing to important pathogenic roles for genetic lesions involving genes that regulate histone modifications, chromatin structure, transcription, and mTOR signaling, as well as the local host response that generates the tumor microenvironment. (See <a href=\"#H26244328\" class=\"local\">'Other mechanisms'</a> above.)</p><p/><p/></div><div id=\"topicAgreement\">Use of UpToDate is subject to the <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/legal/license\" class=\"licenseLink\" id=\"sla_in_page\">Subscription and License Agreement</a>.</div><div id=\"references\" class=\"headingAnchor\"><h1>REFERENCES</h1><ol id=\"reference\"><li class=\"breakAll\">Swerdlow SH, Campo E, Harris NL, et al.
