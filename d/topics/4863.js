But you can try having good sleep habits. This means that you:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Go to bed and get up at the same time every day.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Have drinks with caffeine in them only in the morning (these include coffee and tea).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Avoid alcohol.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Avoid smoking, especially in the evening.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Lose weight if you are overweight.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Exercise several days a week, but not right before bed.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Stay off your back when sleeping. (This is not always possible and does not always work.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Avoid looking at a phone or reading device (&quot;e-book&quot;) that gives off light before bed. This can make it harder to fall asleep.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H70877901\"><span class=\"h1\">Should I see a doctor or nurse?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>See a doctor or nurse if:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>You are often very sleepy in the daytime.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>You fall asleep in the middle of normal activities.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>You fall asleep in a dangerous situation, such as while driving.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>You see or hear things that are not really there.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>When you wake up, you can't move right away.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Your muscles feel weak if you laugh or get excited or angry.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H70877916\"><span class=\"h1\">Will I need tests?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Your doctor or nurse will decide which tests you should have. There are many different tests, but you might not need any. It depends on your age, other symptoms, and individual situation.</p><p>A &quot;sleep study&quot; is the most common test doctors use to find the cause of daytime sleepiness. For this test, you spend the night in a sleep lab at a hospital or doctor's office. You are hooked up to different machines that monitor your heart rate, breathing, and other body functions. The results of the test tell your doctor or nurse if you have a sleep disorder.</p><p>Your doctor or nurse might also ask you to keep a daily log for 1 to 2 weeks, where you keep track of how you sleep each night.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H70877931\"><span class=\"h1\">How is daytime sleepiness treated?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>That depends on what is causing your daytime sleepiness. Treatments can include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Lifestyle changes &ndash; These can include changing your work schedule, taking naps, losing weight, or avoiding caffeine and alcohol.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Devices you wear at night &ndash; These can help people with sleep apnea.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Medicines &ndash; These can help you stay awake in the daytime or sleep better at night.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Surgery &ndash; A few people with sleep apnea have surgery to treat it. But most people don't need surgery for daytime sleepiness.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H70877946\"><span class=\"h1\">Can daytime sleepiness be prevented?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>You can reduce your chances of daytime sleepiness by having good sleep habits. If your doctor or nurse prescribes medicine or a device to wear, use it exactly how he or she tells you.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H70877961\"><span class=\"h1\">What if my child gets daytime sleepiness?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In children, daytime sleepiness is usually caused by not sleeping enough at night or not having good sleep habits. Some medicines can also make your child sleepy in the daytime.</p><p>Children with daytime sleepiness can act differently from sleepy adults. For example, your child might:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Have trouble paying attention in school</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Be more active than usual</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Act angry or emotional</p><p/><p>If you think your child might have daytime sleepiness, talk to the doctor or nurse.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H70877976\"><span class=\"h1\">More on this topic</span></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=insomnia-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Insomnia (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=nocturnal-nighttime-leg-cramps-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Nocturnal (nighttime) leg cramps (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=restless-legs-syndrome-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Restless legs syndrome (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=sleep-apnea-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Sleep apnea (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=narcolepsy-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Narcolepsy (The Basics)</a></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=insomnia-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Insomnia (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=insomnia-treatments-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Insomnia treatments (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=sleep-apnea-in-adults-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Sleep apnea in adults (Beyond the Basics)</a></p></div><div id=\"reviewProcess\"><span>All topics are updated as new evidence becomes available and our <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/home/editorial-policy\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"policy policy_editorialpolicy\">peer review process</a> is complete.</span></div><div id=\"topicRetrievedDate\"><span class=\"emphasis\">This topic retrieved from UpToDate on: </span>Apr 02, 2018.</div><div id=\"disclaimer\">The content on the UpToDate website is not intended nor recommended as a substitute for medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.
