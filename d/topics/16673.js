These symptoms are especially common in patients with young-onset (eg, under the age of 50 years) Parkinson disease (PD). They are unique to levodopa and are not produced by the other antiparkinson drugs. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pharmacologic-treatment-of-parkinson-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pharmacologic treatment of Parkinson disease&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Patients typically experience a smooth and even response to the early stages of levodopa treatment. As the disease advances, however, the effect of levodopa begins to wear off approximately four hours after each dose, leaving patients anticipating the need for their next dose. This phenomenon has been explained by the observation that dopamine nerve terminals are able to store and release dopamine early in the course of disease, but with more advanced disease and increasing degeneration of dopamine terminals, the concentration of dopamine in the basal ganglia is much more dependent upon plasma levodopa levels. Plasma levels may fluctuate erratically because of the 90-minute half-life of levodopa and the frequently unpredictable intestinal absorption of this medication. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=motor-fluctuations-and-dyskinesia-in-parkinson-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Motor fluctuations and dyskinesia in Parkinson disease&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Motor fluctuations are alterations between periods of being &quot;on,&quot; during which the patient enjoys a good response to medication, and being &quot;off,&quot; during which the patient experiences symptoms of the underlying parkinsonism. Dyskinesia consists of abnormal involuntary movements that are usually choreic or dystonic, but when more severe, may be ballistic or myoclonic. Dyskinesia usually appears when the patient is &quot;on.&quot; They may occasionally occur in the form of painful dystonias when the patient is &quot;off.&quot;</p><p>Device-assisted and surgical treatments for patients with advanced PD who are experiencing motor fluctuations will be reviewed here.

However, the presence of early cognitive decline without frank dementia is not a clear exclusion. Rather, some patients with early cognitive impairment may benefit from advanced therapy, which does not require the frequent and accurate timing of oral medications [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/device-assisted-and-surgical-treatments-for-parkinson-disease/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].</p><p>Although an increased risk of suicide associated with DBS treatment is not firmly established, it seems prudent to screen candidates for DBS surgery and exclude those at high risk for suicide.

There are no randomized, controlled trials directly comparing these treatments. The available observational evidence and clinical experience suggests that DBS, continuous LCIG infusion, and CSAI are comparable for reducing &quot;off&quot; time, but the benefit is best established for DBS [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/device-assisted-and-surgical-treatments-for-parkinson-disease/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p>Some factors that may guide the choice among device-assisted therapies include the following observations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/device-assisted-and-surgical-treatments-for-parkinson-disease/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>DBS has the best evidence of efficacy from randomized, controlled trials and is less burdensome (apart from surgical lead and device implantation) because there are no lines, needles, or portable pumps to attend to. DBS is nondestructive, can be performed bilaterally with low neurologic morbidity, and can be modified over time to deal with changing or progressing patient symptoms. Disadvantages of DBS include the requirement for stereotactic brain surgery for electrode placement, surgical pulse generator implantation, the introduction of hardware with risk of infection, hemorrhage, or mechanical breakdown, and the need for periodic reprogramming. High cost is another disadvantage compared with thalamotomy or pallidotomy in resource-poor regions.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Continuous LCIG infusion is effective for reducing &quot;off&quot; time and increasing &quot;on&quot; time, although there are fewer data from randomized, controlled trials compared with DBS. Drawbacks to LCIG include the need for surgical placement of the percutaneous gastrojejunostomy tube, daily tube flushing, diligent stoma care, the requirement to wear a portable pump, and adverse effects including infection.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>CSAI is likewise effective for reducing &quot;off&quot; time and increasing &quot;on&quot; time, does not require surgery, and is the least invasive of the device-assisted therapies. However, there is less supporting evidence from randomized, controlled trials compared with DBS. Drawbacks to CSAI include the need for subcutaneous needle placement, skin care at injection sites, and the requirement to wear a portable pump. Long-term use may be limited by adverse effects, particularly the development of skin nodules.</p><p/><p>In nearly all cases, outcome of device-assisted therapy will only be as good as the best preoperative levodopa response. Generally, advanced device-assisted therapies do <strong>not</strong> help levodopa-unresponsive axial symptoms, which include postural instability, speech and swallowing problems, and freezing of gait in the &quot;on&quot; state [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/device-assisted-and-surgical-treatments-for-parkinson-disease/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. The impact of advanced therapies for nonmotor symptoms of PD is generally unproven, and high quality data are lacking.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h1\">DEEP BRAIN STIMULATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Deep brain stimulation (DBS) is the most frequently performed surgical procedure for the treatment of advanced PD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/device-assisted-and-surgical-treatments-for-parkinson-disease/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. Evidence from randomized, controlled trials shows that DBS of either the subthalamic nucleus (STN) or the globus pallidus (GPi) alleviates the motor fluctuations and dyskinesia associated with advanced PD.</p><p>Two downstream effects of nigral degeneration and dopamine deficiency in PD are excessive STN excitation of the internal GPi and excessive GPi inhibition of the thalamus. These, in turn, cause reduced thalamocortical activity, which is believed to mediate the symptoms of akinesia and rigidity. Pallidotomy reverses the excess pallidal inhibitory effect and improves parkinsonism by targeted ablation of the GPi. High frequency DBS suppresses neuronal activity and also activates efferent fiber pathways leaving the targeted nucleus.</p><p>Thalamotomy and pallidotomy are immediate in effect but irreversible. DBS makes no major lesion, but it requires intensive adjustments in the postoperative period and lifelong maintenance with need for battery replacement and risk of infection and hardware complications due to mechanical disruption. Since DBS produces a safe and entirely reversible physiologic effect without destroying brain tissue, DBS has largely replaced lesions (pallidotomy and thalamotomy) to suppress excessive GPi or STN activity.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Effectiveness in advanced PD</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Two prospective randomized, controlled trials that compared DBS with best medical therapy have shown that bilateral DBS improves motor function in selected patients with advanced typical PD and motor fluctuations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/device-assisted-and-surgical-treatments-for-parkinson-disease/abstract/6,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,7</a>].</p><p>One large multicenter, controlled trial (the Veterans Affairs-National Institutes of Health [VA-NIH]) with blinded assessment included 255 adults with advanced PD and motor complications [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/device-assisted-and-surgical-treatments-for-parkinson-disease/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. The mean age of subjects was 62 years (range 37 to 83), and the mean duration of PD medication use was 11 years. Patients were randomly assigned to either bilateral DBS (n = 121, with 60 to STN stimulation and 61 to GPi stimulation) or best medical therapy (n = 134). The following observations were reported:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For the primary outcome measure of &quot;on&quot; time without troubling dyskinesia at six months, patients in the DBS group (pooled STN and GPi stimulation) improved by a mean of 4.6 hours per day versus zero hours per day for the best medical therapy group (mean difference, 4.5 hours per day, 95% CI 3.7-5.4) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/device-assisted-and-surgical-treatments-for-parkinson-disease/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. In addition, patients in the DBS group had a significantly higher rate of clinically meaningful motor improvement (71 versus 32 percent) and improved quality of life, as assessed by the Parkinson Disease Questionnaire (PDQ39).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The rate of serious adverse events was significantly higher in the DBS group than in the best medical treatment group (40 versus 15 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/device-assisted-and-surgical-treatments-for-parkinson-disease/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. However, the excess in the DBS group was largely attributable to events related to the surgical procedure, such as postoperative headache and pain. The most common serious adverse event was infection at the surgical site in the DBS group (10 percent). Two deaths occurred in the DBS group; one was due to a fatal cerebral hemorrhage 24 hours after lead implantation, but the other was due to lung cancer in a patient who did not have implantation.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Many fewer adverse events were recorded during the four- to six-month epoch when only falls (generally not serious) and dystonia were significantly more common in the DBS group [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/device-assisted-and-surgical-treatments-for-parkinson-disease/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. It is unclear whether the increase in falls was related to the surgery itself or was a consequence of increased mobility and activity following DBS surgery. There were few permanent complications.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Compared with presurgical baseline, the DBS group had mildly diminished performance on several measures of cognitive function at follow-up, including working memory, processing speed, verbal fluency, and delayed recall, although the clinical significance of this is not clear [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/device-assisted-and-surgical-treatments-for-parkinson-disease/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. In contrast, the best medical treatment group showed slight gains on some of these measures. There were no significant changes from baseline to six-month follow-up for either treatment group in measures of depression or dementia.</p><p/><p>The results of the VA-NIH trial phase that directly compared bilateral STN with bilateral GPi stimulation for advanced PD are discussed below. (See <a href=\"#H9\" class=\"local\">'Subthalamic nucleus versus globus pallidus DBS'</a> below.)</p><p>The other multicenter trial was unblinded and evaluated 156 patients with advanced PD from Germany and Austria [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/device-assisted-and-surgical-treatments-for-parkinson-disease/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. Centers enrolled patients in pairs, with one patient from each pair randomly assigned to STN DBS and the other to best medical treatment. The following results were noted:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>DBS stimulation of the STN was associated with significant improvements at six months compared with medication alone in both quality of life, as assessed by the PDQ39, and in the off-medication motor score of the Unified Parkinson Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F68974\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef68974 \">table 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/device-assisted-and-surgical-treatments-for-parkinson-disease/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. The DBS group experienced a 4.4 hour gain in &quot;on&quot; time, essentially identical to the 4.6 hour gain reported for the DBS group in the VA-NIH study discussed above.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Serious adverse events were significantly more common with DBS than with medical treatment alone (13 versus 4 percent) and included a fatal intracerebral hemorrhage [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/device-assisted-and-surgical-treatments-for-parkinson-disease/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. In contrast with some earlier studies, cognitive and behavioral complications were infrequent and not significantly different between DBS and medical treatment groups. (See <a href=\"#H581723359\" class=\"local\">'Complications and adverse effects of DBS'</a> below.)</p><p/><p>Thus, these trials demonstrate that for patients with advanced PD, DBS of either the STN or the GPi is more effective for improving motor function and quality of life than best medical therapy, at least in the short-term [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/device-assisted-and-surgical-treatments-for-parkinson-disease/abstract/6,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,7</a>]. However, the benefit comes at the cost of an increased risk of complications related to surgery. Limitations of these trials include the lack of a sham surgery control group, and in the case of the German-Austrian trial [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/device-assisted-and-surgical-treatments-for-parkinson-disease/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>], the lack of blinded assessment.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h3\">Subthalamic nucleus versus globus pallidus DBS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Deep brain stimulation (DBS) of the subthalamic nucleus (STN) and globus pallidus (GPi) pars interna are both effective for improving PD motor symptoms including tremor and bradykinesia, and both appear to have similar safety. However, STN DBS is associated with greater reduction in antiparkinson medication doses. Supporting evidence comes from the multicenter, randomized VA-NIH and Netherlands SubThalamic and Pallidal Stimulation (NSTAPS) trials, which both directly compared STN DBS with GPi DBS [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/device-assisted-and-surgical-treatments-for-parkinson-disease/abstract/8,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,9</a>]. The results of these trials have to some extent alleviated earlier concerns that STN DBS might be associated with a higher rate of complications related to cognitive, mood, and behavioral problems.

The subjects were randomly assigned to either bilateral DBS of the STN plus medical therapy or to medical therapy alone. Compared with the medical therapy group, patients in the DBS group showed a statistically significant and clinically meaningful improvement in self-assessed quality of life (the primary endpoint) as measured by the change from baseline in the PDQ39 (+7.8 versus -0.2 for medical therapy alone, between group difference 8.0, 95% CI 4.2-11.9) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/device-assisted-and-surgical-treatments-for-parkinson-disease/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>].

Bilateral pallidal DBS can be performed more safely [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/device-assisted-and-surgical-treatments-for-parkinson-disease/abstract/67\" class=\"abstract_t\">67</a>].</p><p>Unilateral thalamotomy and DBS of the ventral intermediate nucleus of the thalamus can safely and effectively control tremor in selected cases of PD. However, they do not help bradykinesia, and since this typically becomes the most important symptom over time, internal globus pallidus (GPi) and STN should be considered the targets of choice in patients with PD, even if tremor is the main symptom [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/device-assisted-and-surgical-treatments-for-parkinson-disease/abstract/67\" class=\"abstract_t\">67</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H21\"><span class=\"h2\">Subthalamotomy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Because of the limited availability of DBS in some regions, subthalamotomy has been explored in several centers as a surgical option in PD.</p><p>Evidence from several uncontrolled and largely unblinded studies suggests that unilateral subthalamotomy is effective for the treatment of advanced PD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/device-assisted-and-surgical-treatments-for-parkinson-disease/abstract/71\" class=\"abstract_t\">71</a>]. Unilateral subthalamotomy appears to be as effective as bilateral subthalamotomy and has been associated with fewer adverse effects but produces shorter-lasting ipsilateral improvement [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/device-assisted-and-surgical-treatments-for-parkinson-disease/abstract/72\" class=\"abstract_t\">72</a>]. A prospective study comparing bilateral subthalamotomy, bilateral STN DBS, and unilateral subthalamotomy with contralateral STN DBS using unblinded ratings showed no significant differences among treatment groups in efficacy or adverse effects when assessed 12 months after surgery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/device-assisted-and-surgical-treatments-for-parkinson-disease/abstract/73\" class=\"abstract_t\">73</a>].</p><p>The main concern regarding subthalamotomy has been adverse neurologic effects. In a case series of 89 patients who underwent unilateral subthalamotomy, 52 (58 percent) experienced early contralateral dyskinesia that resolved over 4 to 12 weeks in 38 cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/device-assisted-and-surgical-treatments-for-parkinson-disease/abstract/72\" class=\"abstract_t\">72</a>]. However, dyskinesia remained unchanged for 14 patients (16 percent) and was severe in 8 of these, causing a combination of hemiballism and hemichorea that failed to improve even after stopping dopaminergic medications or treatment with dopamine antagonists. All eight patients required pallidotomy within four weeks to two years after subthalamotomy to eliminate dyskinesia.</p><p>When STN DBS was first introduced, it was believed that PD would protect against dyskinesia following STN surgery because of changes in striatopallidal circuits caused by nigrostriatal dopamine deficiency. Whereas persistent dyskinesia is rare after STN DBS, it is clearly common after subthalamotomy. There has been considerable debate concerning the role of lesion size and location on the risk of postoperative hemichorea-ballism.</p><p>In some cases, large lesions extending into fiber pathways dorsal to the STN appear to have protected against postoperative dyskinesia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/device-assisted-and-surgical-treatments-for-parkinson-disease/abstract/74\" class=\"abstract_t\">74</a>], while in other cases, large lesions have produced persistent dyskinesia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/device-assisted-and-surgical-treatments-for-parkinson-disease/abstract/75\" class=\"abstract_t\">75</a>]. Accessibility, reduced cost, and lack of hardware problems may make subthalamotomy advantageous over DBS in some parts of the world, but subthalamotomy remains an experimental treatment for advanced PD and should be carried out only at experienced centers.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"PATIENT_INFORMATION\"><span class=\"h1\">INFORMATION FOR PATIENTS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>UpToDate offers two types of patient education materials, &quot;The Basics&quot; and &quot;Beyond the Basics.&quot; The Basics patient education pieces are written in plain language, at the 5<sup>th</sup> to 6<sup>th</sup> grade reading level, and they answer the four or five key questions a patient might have about a given condition.

Patients with PD who may be appropriate candidates for these treatments should be referred for evaluation by a movement disorder specialist. (See <a href=\"#H888613501\" class=\"local\">'Approach to device-assisted treatment'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The choice among device-assisted therapies for PD is based mainly on individual patient characteristics, availability, and patient values and preferences. There are no randomized, controlled trials directly comparing these treatments. (See <a href=\"#H3531211888\" class=\"local\">'Selecting advanced therapy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>DBS has the best evidence of efficacy and is less burdensome (apart from surgical lead and device implantation) because there are no lines, needles, or portable pumps to attend to. DBS is nondestructive, can be performed with low neurologic morbidity, and can be modified over time to deal with changing or progressing symptoms. Disadvantages of DBS include the requirement for stereotactic brain surgery for electrode placement, surgical pulse generator implantation, the introduction of hardware with risks of infection, hemorrhage, or mechanical breakdown, and the need for periodic reprogramming. (See <a href=\"#H3531211888\" class=\"local\">'Selecting advanced therapy'</a> above and <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Deep brain stimulation'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>LCIG infusion is effective for reducing &quot;off&quot; time and increasing &quot;on&quot; time, although there are fewer data from randomized, controlled trials compared with DBS. Drawbacks to LCIG include the need for surgical placement of the percutaneous gastrojejunostomy tube, daily tube flushing, diligent stoma care, the requirement to wear a portable pump, and adverse effects including infection. (See <a href=\"#H3531211888\" class=\"local\">'Selecting advanced therapy'</a> above and <a href=\"#H1368721620\" class=\"local\">'Continuous levodopa-carbidopa intestinal gel infusion'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>CSAI is likewise effective for reducing &quot;off&quot; time and increasing &quot;on&quot; time, does not require surgery, and is the least invasive of the device-assisted therapies. However, there is less supporting evidence from randomized, controlled trials compared with DBS. Drawbacks to CSAI include the need for subcutaneous needle placement, skin care at injection sites, and the requirement to wear a portable pump. Long-term use may be limited by adverse effects, particularly the development of skin nodules. (See <a href=\"#H3531211888\" class=\"local\">'Selecting advanced therapy'</a> above and <a href=\"#H3902000227\" class=\"local\">'Continuous subcutaneous apomorphine'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Thalamotomy, pallidotomy, and subthalamotomy are potential treatment options for advanced PD in resource-poor regions or areas where device-assisted therapies are not affordable or available.
