There is a broad range of clinical severity associated with MFS and related disorders, ranging from isolated features of MFS to neonatal presentation of severe and rapidly progressive disease involving multiple organ systems [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/genetics-clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-marfan-syndrome-and-related-disorders/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Although many clinicians view the disorder in terms of classic ocular, cardiovascular, and musculoskeletal abnormalities (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F108185\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef108185 \">picture 1</a>), manifestations also include involvement of the lung, skin, and central nervous system. </p><p>The genetics, pathogenesis, clinical manifestations, and diagnosis of MFS and related disorders will be reviewed here. The management of patients with MFS and related disorders and issues related to pregnancy are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-marfan-syndrome-and-related-disorders\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of Marfan syndrome and related disorders&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pregnancy-and-marfan-syndrome\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pregnancy and Marfan syndrome&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">GENETICS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>MFS is a highly variable systemic tissue disorder with clinical characteristics similar to a variety of other hereditary disorders from which it should be distinguished. MFS is almost exclusively inherited in an autosomal dominant manner, although rare case reports have described recessive fibrillin 1 gene (FBN1) mutations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/genetics-clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-marfan-syndrome-and-related-disorders/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. While most individuals with MFS have an affected parent, 25 percent or more of probands have MFS as the result of a de novo mutation.</p><p>Most patients with the typical Marfan phenotype harbor mutations involving the gene (FBN1) encoding the connective tissue protein fibrillin-1 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/genetics-clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-marfan-syndrome-and-related-disorders/abstract/5-7\" class=\"abstract_t\">5-7</a>]. However, FBN1 mutations also cause a wide range of milder phenotypes that often show at least some overlap with the classic Marfan phenotype. (See <a href=\"#H17\" class=\"local\">'FBN1/2 phenotypes'</a> below.)</p><p>In a minority of cases (less than 10 percent) with typical Marfan phenotype, no mutation in FBN1 is identified [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/genetics-clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-marfan-syndrome-and-related-disorders/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Studies have suggested that at least some of these cases are due to a complete allele deletion, more complex rearrangements, or alterations in regulatory sequences involving the FBN1 gene. In some of these individuals with atypical presentations reminiscent of MFS, an inactivating mutation in a gene encoding for transforming growth factor-beta receptor (TGFBR) may be responsible. (See <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'TGFBR mutations'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">FBN1 mutations</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>FBN1 is a large gene (65 exons) located at chromosome 15q-21.1. The fibrillin-1 protein contains many cysteine-rich domains homologous to those observed in epidermal growth factor (EGF) and the latent transforming growth factor beta binding proteins (LTBPs) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/genetics-clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-marfan-syndrome-and-related-disorders/abstract/8,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,9</a>]. Fibrillin-1 is an important matrix component of both elastic and nonelastic tissues. It is the main constituent protein of extracellular microfibrils that are thought to contribute to the formation and maintenance of elastic fibers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/genetics-clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-marfan-syndrome-and-related-disorders/abstract/10,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,11</a>].</p><p>Since the first report of an FBN1 mutation in 1991, more than 1800 different mutations involving this protein have been registered for MFS and associated disorders in the Universal Mutation Database for FBN1 (<a href=\"http://www.umd.be/FBN1/&amp;token=RCgxz6poQN9XhMP5W1ykAHQL5mBrqMwOF4Scn1d8YnQ=&amp;TOPIC_ID=8150\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">UMD-FBN1</a>). The majority of the mutations are nonrecurrent and distributed throughout the gene without striking phenotype-genotype correlations. One possible exception involves apparent clustering of mutations between exons 24 and 32 associated with cases of severe rapidly progressive MFS (previously known as &ldquo;neonatal MFS&rdquo;) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/genetics-clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-marfan-syndrome-and-related-disorders/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. However, some patients with severe MFS lack mutations in this region and many patients with mutations in this region have classic or mild variants of MFS [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/genetics-clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-marfan-syndrome-and-related-disorders/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].</p><p>Of note, mutations in FBN1 have been identified in some patients with isolated features of the Marfan phenotype who do not have MFS [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/genetics-clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-marfan-syndrome-and-related-disorders/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H17\" class=\"local\">'FBN1/2 phenotypes'</a> below.)</p><p>Mutations involving a second fibrillin protein, fibrillin-2, a product of the FBN2 gene located on chromosome 5, have been described and are associated with a phenotype different from the Marfan phenotype.

Mutations in TGF-beta receptor 2 (TGFBR2) and TGFBR1 genes have been linked to the Marfan phenotype in some patients and may be responsible for up to 10 percent of cases with the Marfan phenotype [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/genetics-clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-marfan-syndrome-and-related-disorders/abstract/7,15,16\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,15,16</a>]. </p><p>Some individuals with TGFBR1 or TGFBR2 mutations have clinical features consistent with MFS, while others have features of one of two other syndromes: Loeys-Dietz syndrome (LDS) or familial thoracic aortic aneurysm (FTAA) syndrome. Autosomal dominant inheritance with variable penetrance has been observed in families with a variety of TGFBR mutations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/genetics-clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-marfan-syndrome-and-related-disorders/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. There are no apparent phenotype-genotype correlations and the identical mutations described as causing MFS are observed in patients and families with classic and severe LDS, including widespread and aggressive vascular disease. The clinical characteristics of these syndromes are discussed below. (See <a href=\"#H18\" class=\"local\">'TGFBR1/2 phenotypes'</a> below.)</p><p>Some experts have proposed that patients with the Marfan phenotype and TGFBR1 or TGFBR2 mutations be classified as having LDS (rather than MFS) as a means of highlighting the potential for more aggressive vascular disease than seen in MFS with an FBN1 mutation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/genetics-clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-marfan-syndrome-and-related-disorders/abstract/3,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,14</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Prenatal genetic testing</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Prenatal diagnostic testing is feasible if a disease-causing mutation has been identified in the family. However, the severity of disease in a child who inherits a mutant FBN1 (or <span class=\"nowrap\">TGFBR1/2)</span> gene is unpredictable. Linkage analysis and direct sequencing of the FBN1 (or <span class=\"nowrap\">TGFBR1/2)</span> genes from cells or tissue obtained by amniocentesis or chorionic villus sampling can be informative. Resources for genetic testing are discussed in more detail elsewhere. However, such analyses are time consuming and planning for them should ideally be done prior to conception.

Not all patients with suspected MFS require genetic testing given the cost and potential limitations. Mutation analysis of 93 patients with MFS found FBN1 mutations in 86 (93 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/genetics-clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-marfan-syndrome-and-related-disorders/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>].

The term cystic medial necrosis was coined by Erdheim to describe the lacunar appearance of medial degeneration in MFS; however no actual cysts or overt necrosis is present [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/genetics-clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-marfan-syndrome-and-related-disorders/abstract/19,20\" class=\"abstract_t\">19,20</a>]. Cystic medial necrosis and the other histologic findings are not specific for MFS, although greater elastin fragmentation has been described in patients with aortic root aneurysms with MFS compared to those without a connective tissue diagnosis; this distinction may not apply in patients with other vascular connective tissue disorders [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/genetics-clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-marfan-syndrome-and-related-disorders/abstract/19,20,23\" class=\"abstract_t\">19,20,23</a>]. The histologic changes are thought to reflect injury and repair [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/genetics-clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-marfan-syndrome-and-related-disorders/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h1\">PATHOGENESIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>How FBN1 or transforming growth factor-beta receptor mutations lead to disease is not well understood at a molecular level. Among the proposed mechanisms are alterations in:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A structural role of microfibrils in coordinating tissue morphogenesis, homeostasis, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> response to hemodynamic stress [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/genetics-clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-marfan-syndrome-and-related-disorders/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Increased bioavailability of transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/genetics-clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-marfan-syndrome-and-related-disorders/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>].</p><p/><p>Support for the importance of TGF-beta signaling comes from study of an animal model of an FBN1-targeted mouse model of MFS as well as clinical studies in which inhibition of TGF-beta attenuated the clinical manifestations of the disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/genetics-clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-marfan-syndrome-and-related-disorders/abstract/26-29\" class=\"abstract_t\">26-29</a>]. The administration of the angiotensin II type 1 receptor blocker <a href=\"topic.htm?path=losartan-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">losartan</a> (an antagonist of TGF-beta signaling) in a mouse model prevented aortic dilation and improved disease manifestations in the aortic wall and the lungs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/genetics-clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-marfan-syndrome-and-related-disorders/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. This effect was not due to altered hemodynamics since a similar benefit was not seen with a beta blocker, which is used clinically to slow the rate of aortic growth. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-marfan-syndrome-and-related-disorders#H8\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of Marfan syndrome and related disorders&quot;, section on 'Beta blocker'</a>.) Clinical evidence for this mechanism was provided by two randomized controlled trials in which losartan therapy reduced the rate of aortic root dilatation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/genetics-clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-marfan-syndrome-and-related-disorders/abstract/28,29\" class=\"abstract_t\">28,29</a>]. In addition, many conditions with pronounced clinical overlap with MFS are caused by primary mutations in genes encoding direct effectors <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> regulators of TGF-beta signaling, including Loeys-Dietz syndrome caused by heterozygous mutations in TGFBR1, TGFBR2, SMAD3, or TGFB2 (LDS1-4, respectively); and Shprintzen-Goldberg syndrome (SGS) caused by heterozygous loss-of-function mutations in SKI that encode a prototypical repressor of TGF-beta signaling.

Other symptoms and signs of MFS, such as joint hypermobility, are much more commonly seen in patients without the disease. Previous reliance on less specific features led to a tendency to over-diagnose MFS in index cases or family members. As a result, stringent criteria for the diagnosis of MFS (Ghent nosology) were proposed in 1996 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/genetics-clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-marfan-syndrome-and-related-disorders/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. These criteria relied on the recognition of both &quot;major&quot; and &quot;minor&quot; clinical manifestations involving the skeletal, cardiovascular, and ocular systems, and the dura [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/genetics-clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-marfan-syndrome-and-related-disorders/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>].

Although dilated, the aorta in MFS tends to be stiffer and less distensible than in controls, and these changes increase with age [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/genetics-clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-marfan-syndrome-and-related-disorders/abstract/35-38\" class=\"abstract_t\">35-38</a>].</p><p>Dilatation of the aorta is found in approximately 50 percent of young children with MFS and progresses with time. Approximately 60 to 80 percent of adult patients with MFS have dilatation of the aortic root (with normal range adjusted for patient body surface area and age) by echocardiography [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/genetics-clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-marfan-syndrome-and-related-disorders/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>], often accompanied by aortic regurgitation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/genetics-clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-marfan-syndrome-and-related-disorders/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>]. Importantly, all patients diagnosed with MFS using the revised criteria must have aortic root dilatation, a family history of aortic root dilatation, or an FBN1 mutation previously associated with aortic root dilatation, highlighting the strong predisposition for emergence of vascular disease. Dilatation may also involve other segments of the thoracic aorta, the abdominal aorta, the root of the pulmonary artery or even the carotid and intracranial arteries, although this is much less frequent than observed in LDS.</p><p>As recommended in the 2010 American College of <span class=\"nowrap\">Cardiology/American</span> Heart <span class=\"nowrap\">Association/American</span> Association for Thoracic Surgery thoracic aorta guidelines, echocardiography is recommended at initial diagnosis and at six months to assess the aortic root and ascending aorta in patients with MFS [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/genetics-clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-marfan-syndrome-and-related-disorders/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>]; the six-month echocardiogram is performed to confirm stability of the aortic dimension. The normal range for aortic diameter varies with body size and age, so nomograms and Z-scores are used to identify aortic dilatation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/genetics-clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-marfan-syndrome-and-related-disorders/abstract/14,32\" class=\"abstract_t\">14,32</a>]. Monitoring should be performed at least annually as discussed separately. Most centers perform cross-sectional aortic imaging with computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to confirm that the size of the ascending aorta measured by echocardiography is not underestimated, and also to identify aortic or vascular disease that is not appreciated by echocardiography. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-marfan-syndrome-and-related-disorders#H5\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of Marfan syndrome and related disorders&quot;, section on 'Monitoring MFS'</a>.)</p><p>Undiagnosed and untreated MFS is frequently associated with aortic dissection (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F86924\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef86924 \">image 2</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RADIOL%2F93363\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef93363 \">image 1D</a>). The dissection generally begins just above the coronary ostia and can extend the entire length of the aorta; it is a type I dissection in the DeBakey classification or a type A in the Dailey scheme. Approximately 10 percent of dissections begin distal to the left subclavian (type III or type B) but dissection is rarely limited to just the abdominal aorta. Many patients with MFS and aortic dissection have a family history of dissection. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-acute-aortic-dissection\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical features and diagnosis of acute aortic dissection&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The frequency with which MFS is responsible for aortic dissection was addressed in a review from the International Registry of Aortic Dissection (IRAD) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/genetics-clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-marfan-syndrome-and-related-disorders/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>]. The frequency varied with age.

Approximately 25 percent of patients with MVP have progressive disease as defined by the appearance or worsening of clinical symptoms of mitral regurgitation or worsening on echocardiography. In some of these cases, worsening of mitral regurgitation is due to spontaneous rupture of the chordae tendineae or the result of infective endocarditis. Heart failure attributable to mitral valve prolapse and regurgitation represents a major source of morbidity and mortality in young children with the most extreme and rapidly progressive presentation of MFS.
