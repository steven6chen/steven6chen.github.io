While initially limited, infection with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) has literally exploded over the past three decades to become the worst epidemic of the twentieth century. With more than 35 million fatalities, the AIDS epidemic now ranks alongside the influenza pandemic of the early 1900s and the Bubonic plague of the 14<sup>th</sup> century in terms of fatalities [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/global-epidemiology-of-hiv-infection/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. The impact of this disease on human suffering, cultures, demographics, economics, and even politics has been felt in nearly every society across the globe.</p><p>The initial optimism that followed the discovery of HIV, the development of diagnostic assays to help monitor the epidemic, the prophylaxis of opportunistic infections, the identification of effective antiretroviral drugs, and the prevention of perinatal transmission, has been tempered by the stark reality and magnitude of the global HIV pandemic. The epidemic continues to spread relentlessly into new areas and to consolidate in many other locations. In some countries in sub-Saharan Africa, the AIDS epidemic had caused a dramatic decline on life expectancy that may only now be rebounding with access to antiretrovirals.</p><p>This topic reviews worldwide statistics on the global HIV epidemic, modes of transmission, and the introduction of antiretroviral therapy (ART) into resource-limited settings.

Researchers believe that all the SIV strains infecting primates across Africa diverged from a common ancestor between 32,000 and 78,000 years ago [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/global-epidemiology-of-hiv-infection/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].</p><p>Several lines of evidence support zoonotic transmission of primate lentiviruses into humans [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/global-epidemiology-of-hiv-infection/abstract/6,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,8</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Similarities in viral genome between SIV and HIV</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Prevalence in the natural host</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Geographic association between the animal reservoir and emergence of human cases </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Plausible route of transmission</p><p/><p>Direct evidence of simian-to-human transmission is still missing, but is inferred by the known practice of hunting chimpanzees for food (&quot;bushmeat&quot;), particularly in western Africa [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/global-epidemiology-of-hiv-infection/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. Unlike other more readily transmitted zoonoses, important viral adaptations may have been required for HIV to infect humans. These adaptations may have included the acquisition of viral regulatory genes such as vpu, vif, nef, and tat, and structural genes, gag and env [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/global-epidemiology-of-hiv-infection/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. Observations from wild primate populations indicate that SIV, like HIV-1, is associated with progressive CD4 cell loss, lymphatic tissue destruction, and premature death [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/global-epidemiology-of-hiv-infection/abstract/9,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,10</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H62518\"><span class=\"h2\">Molecular epidemiology of HIV</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Worldwide, there are two types of HIV: HIV-1, which originated from SIV strains in apes, and HIV-2, which originated from an SIV strain in sooty mangabey monkeys. HIV-1, the most prominent type, is further divided phylogenetically into different groups and subtypes. The main clinical implications of these different types of HIV are that infection with HIV-2 appears to have a more indolent natural history than HIV-1 and is intrinsically resistant to certain antiretroviral agents. Different subtypes of HIV-1 may also differ in the rate of transmission or disease progression [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/global-epidemiology-of-hiv-infection/abstract/11-13\" class=\"abstract_t\">11-13</a>]. Additionally, the multiple types and groups pose challenges for development of an effective and inclusive vaccine.</p><p>HIV-1 consists of four distinct viral groups, each of which resulted from a different zoonotic transmission event [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/global-epidemiology-of-hiv-infection/abstract/14,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">14,15</a>]. Groups M, N, and O were transmitted from chimpanzees and group P from a gorilla. Group M (&quot;Main&quot;) HIV is considered the pandemic strain and comprises the vast majority of strains of HIV, whereas the other groups have much more limited geographical distribution [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/global-epidemiology-of-hiv-infection/abstract/8,16\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,16</a>]. Viruses from group M are subsequently divided into nine distinct subtypes or clades (A-D, F-H, J-K) and recombinants of the subtypes, termed circulating recombinant forms (CRF). Subtype C accounts for almost half of the HIV-1 infections worldwide and predominates in southern Africa and India (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F109484\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef109484 \">figure 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/global-epidemiology-of-hiv-infection/abstract/17,18\" class=\"abstract_t\">17,18</a>]. Subtype B predominates in North America, western and central Europe, the Caribbean, and Latin America. </p><p>Group O (&quot;Outlier&quot;) represents far fewer strains, approximately one percent of global infections, and is geographically limited to West Africa (specifically Cameroon, Gabon, and Equatorial Guinea). Group N <span class=\"nowrap\">(&quot;non-M/non-O&quot;)</span> is represented by very few isolates and has only been documented in Cameroon. Group P, a novel HIV virus closely related to SIV strains found in gorillas, was discovered in 2009 from a woman in Cameroon [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/global-epidemiology-of-hiv-infection/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. As of 2011, group P virus has been identified in only one other individual, also in Cameroon [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/global-epidemiology-of-hiv-infection/abstract/15,20\" class=\"abstract_t\">15,20</a>].</p><p>HIV-2 is estimated to cause approximately five percent of global HIV infections. HIV-2 is reported throughout the world. In particular, it is an important cause of infection in West Africa, and areas with historic ties to West Africa, such as Portugal, Spain, Goa, and India. The epidemiology of HIV-2 is discussed in detail elsewhere.

The epidemic has reached every country and nearly all populations throughout the world. Spread of the disease has been particularly alarming in resource-limited countries, especially sub-Saharan Africa and southeast Asia, but continues to threaten other populations in eastern Europe, Latin America, and the Caribbean.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">General statistics</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>By the end of 2015, the reported statistics on the global burden of HIV were the following [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/global-epidemiology-of-hiv-infection/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>36.7 million adults and children were living with <span class=\"nowrap\">HIV/AIDS</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>2.1 million people had been newly infected with HIV in that year</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>1.1 million people died of AIDS in that year</p><p/><p>The overall prevalence of HIV appears to have stabilized, or increased in some countries, likely due to increased survival of infected people because of antiretroviral treatment. However, the 2015 incidence of new HIV infections represents a decline of 38 percent from 2001, when there were 3.4 million new infections. </p><p>Nearly three quarters of the world's HIV-infected population are in sub-Saharan Africa. Countries in sub-Saharan Africa and the Caribbean have the highest national rates of adult HIV prevalence. As an example, in 2013, the adult HIV prevalence ranged from &lt;0.1 percent in the Middle East and north Africa to 4.7 percent in sub-Saharan Africa overall, and it exceeded 20 percent in some sub-Saharan countries, such as Botswana, Lesotho, and Swaziland [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/global-epidemiology-of-hiv-infection/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. Part of this disparity can be attributed to the maturity of the epidemics in Africa and the more recent introduction of HIV into some other areas of the world. </p><p>Children bear a substantial proportion of the burden of HIV, both directly and indirectly. An estimated 3.3 million children are living with <span class=\"nowrap\">HIV/AIDS</span> worldwide [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/global-epidemiology-of-hiv-infection/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. Of the 260,000 infants and children infected with HIV in 2012, 70 percent were born in sub-Saharan Africa, 25 percent in Southeast Asia, and the remainder in Latin America and the Caribbean [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/global-epidemiology-of-hiv-infection/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. Additionally, it is estimated that 25 million children have been orphaned by the premature death of both parents due to AIDS, placing enormous responsibilities on communities. With escalation of the epidemic in Southeast Asia and Eastern Europe, these numbers are only likely to increase, unless more aggressive prevention campaigns and interventions programs intercede to slow the pace of the epidemic.

The overall HIV prevalence rate in this region is 4.7 percent, and exceeds 20 percent in some countries [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/global-epidemiology-of-hiv-infection/abstract/3,22\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,22</a>]. Of the HIV-infected population within this region, 25 percent are in South Africa and 13 percent in Nigeria [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/global-epidemiology-of-hiv-infection/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. Nevertheless, the largest epidemics in sub-Saharan Africa (South Africa, Nigeria, Ethiopia, Zambia, and Zimbabwe) have either stabilized or are showing signs of decline, mainly due to a decrease in the incidence of HIV, which decreased by 33 percent from 2005 and 2013. Additionally, there has been an increase in the number of infected people accessing treatment, and the number of AIDS related death in the region decreased by 39 percent over the same time frame.</p><p>HIV infection in sub-Saharan Africa is generalized epidemic and is mostly related to heterosexual transmission. In 2015, women accounted for 50 percent of the HIV-infected adult population and 56 percent of new HIV infections in the region [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/global-epidemiology-of-hiv-infection/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. The gender discrepancy is particularly evident among adolescents; the HIV prevalence among females aged 15 to 19 is five times higher than that among males of the same age. Much of heterosexual transmission occurs between established partners. As an example, in a study of more than 4000 adult men and women in Rwanda and Zambia who underwent voluntary counseling and testing for HIV, an estimated 55 to 93 percent of new heterosexually-acquired HIV infections occurred within serodiscordant marital or cohabiting relationships [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/global-epidemiology-of-hiv-infection/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. Sex workers represent a high risk group in sub-Saharan Africa. In a systematic review, the estimated prevalence of HIV among female sex workers in the region was 11.8 percent; compared with the general female population, the odds of HIV infection in a sex worker was 13.5 (95% CI 10-18.1) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/global-epidemiology-of-hiv-infection/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. </p><p>Men who have sex with men may also represent a high risk group, but knowledge is limited [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/global-epidemiology-of-hiv-infection/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h2\">Latin America and the Caribbean</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>After sub-Saharan Africa, the Caribbean has the second highest HIV prevalence rates in the world [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/global-epidemiology-of-hiv-infection/abstract/3,22\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,22</a>]. Over 50 percent of the HIV-infected population in this region is in Haiti, although the highest HIV prevalence in the region is 3.2 percent, in the Bahamas. </p><p>In Latin America, of the estimated 2.0 million HIV-infected individuals reported at the end of 2015, approximately three-quarters were in Brazil, Colombia, Mexico, and Venezuela. The regional HIV prevalence in the adult population overall was estimated to be 0.4 percent.</p><p>The HIV epidemic is particularly pronounced among men who have sex with men (MSM) throughout Latin America and in certain Caribbean countries. In particular, approximately 30 percent of MSM in Jamaica are HIV-infected. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H854710284\"><span class=\"h2\">Asia</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Although the overall prevalence of HIV in Asia is low, approximately 0.6 percent, this still results in a substantial burden of disease, given that the region accounts for half the world&rsquo;s population. Of the estimated 5.1 million HIV-infected persons living in Asia, nearly half live in India [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/global-epidemiology-of-hiv-infection/abstract/3,22\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,22</a>]. </p><p>The estimates for India are based primarily on anonymous testing data from public clinics for prenatal care and for patients with other sexually transmitted infections (STIs) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/global-epidemiology-of-hiv-infection/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. Approximately 85 percent of HIV transmission in India is thought to be through sexual contact. Barriers to control of the epidemiologic include the lack of social acceptance of condoms and laws making homosexuality illegal and punishable by imprisonment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/global-epidemiology-of-hiv-infection/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>].</p><p>In China, the government estimates that over one million people are infected with HIV, which represents an HIV prevalence of approximately 0.05 percent of the general population [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/global-epidemiology-of-hiv-infection/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. Most cases are concentrated in five provinces: Guangdong, Guangxi, Xinjiang, Yunnan, and Henan, where residents became infected through contaminated equipment at a plasma donation center. Among new HIV infections in China, 49 percent are linked to drug use and approximately 50 percent to sexual transmission. In 2007, men who have sex with men (MSM) accounted for 12 percent of the 50,000 estimated new HIV infections in China; a significant association has also been found with an increasing prevalence of syphilis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/global-epidemiology-of-hiv-infection/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>].</p><p>A high HIV prevalence has also been found among MSM in other Asian countries including Cambodia (9 percent), Thailand (15 percent), and India (18 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/global-epidemiology-of-hiv-infection/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. High prevalence among sex workers is also a major contributor to the spread of HIV in this region, where it exceeds 20 percent in certain urban centers throughout Asia (eg, Mumbai, Hanoi) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/global-epidemiology-of-hiv-infection/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h2\">United States</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>At the end of 2014, an estimated 1.2 million persons in the United States were living with HIV infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/global-epidemiology-of-hiv-infection/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]. In 2014, there were an estimated 44,073 new HIV diagnoses, or 15 diagnoses per 100,000 persons. In the mid-to-late 1990s, advances in HIV treatments slowed the progression of HIV infection to AIDS and led to dramatic decreases in deaths among persons with AIDS living in the United States. Subsequently, from 2009 to 2014, the estimated numbers of new AIDS diagnoses decreased slightly (from 10.2 to 8.4 cases per 100,000 persons), as did the number of deaths from any cause among persons with HIV infection (from 6.2 to 5.5 deaths per 100,000 persons). By 2013, approximately 673,538 Americans died with an AIDS diagnosis since the first reported case, and 12,963 died in 2013.</p><p>Certain racial and ethnic minorities in the United States have a disproportionately high rate of HIV infection. In 2014, the rate of new HIV diagnoses was higher than average among African-Americans, Latinos, and individuals of multiple races at approximately 49, 18, and 15 infections per 100,000 persons, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/global-epidemiology-of-hiv-infection/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]. Reported rates of HIV infection in non-Hispanic black females are 19 times higher than rates among non-Hispanic white females. Black men who have sex with men (MSM) have a threefold greater odds of being HIV-infected than MSM of other races [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/global-epidemiology-of-hiv-infection/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>].</p><p>There is also substantial gender imbalance in HIV infection in the United States. Approximately 80 percent of the <span class=\"nowrap\">HIV/AIDS</span> diagnoses among adolescents and adults in 2014 were in males, primarily MSM. In fact, approximately 70 percent of all newly diagnosed HIV infections in the United States in 2014 were in MSM; this proportion represented a continual rise from previous years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/global-epidemiology-of-hiv-infection/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>]. Heterosexual contact is estimated to account for 24 percent of new HIV diagnoses.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H941025139\"><span class=\"h2\">Europe</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>By the end of 2015, there were 1.7 million HIV infections in the World Health Organization (WHO) European Region, which includes Russia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/global-epidemiology-of-hiv-infection/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>]. In that year, there were 190,000 new HIV diagnoses reported. This rate of new diagnoses represents a 57 percent increase compared with the rate in 2010. This increase is mainly due to increasingly high rates in eastern Europe, which was substantially higher than in western Europe. The highest rates were in Russia, Ukraine, and Estonia. In eastern Europe and central Asia, where only approximately 21 percent of HIV-infected individuals are treated, 47,000 people died of AIDS-related causes in 2015, an increase of 22 percent from 2010. </p><p>The predominant mode of transmission for new diagnoses differed by region. In western and central Europe, sexual transmission among MSM was the most common route, followed by heterosexual transmission. In contrast, in eastern Europe, heterosexual contact accounted for the most new diagnoses, followed by injection drug use. Transmission between MSM increased from 2004 to 2013 but remained overall uncommonly reported in that region, although transmission modes are unknown for about half of the cases in Russia. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H97770503\"><span class=\"h2\">Methods for establishing HIV incidence</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Establishing accurate estimations of HIV incidence through the use of assays that can distinguish recent from chronic infection is critical to identifying populations still at greatest risk of infection, which can help target public health efforts for testing, treatment, and prevention. In the United States, surveillance is based primarily on new HIV diagnoses, which does not distinguish whether the infection is new or just newly detected.</p><p>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) developed an innovative system designed to estimate the number of new HIV infections (or incidence, as opposed to new diagnoses) in the United States in a given year. This system estimates duration of infection based on results of the LAg HIV-1 capture enzyme immunoassay, which distinguishes recent infection (approximately 130 days after seroconversion) from chronic infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/global-epidemiology-of-hiv-infection/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>]. The use of other tests (specifically an antibody avidity assay, HIV viral load measurement, and CD4 cell count) to supplement results from the LAg immunoassay in a multi-assay algorithm can more accurately detect recent infection. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h1\">MODES OF TRANSMISSION DRIVING THE EPIDEMIC</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The major modes of acquiring HIV infection are [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/global-epidemiology-of-hiv-infection/abstract/36,37\" class=\"abstract_t\">36,37</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Sexual transmission, including via heterosexual and homosexual contact</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Parenteral transmission, predominantly among injection drug users (IDU)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Perinatal transmission</p><p/><p>The relative importance of these different modes of transmission in driving the HIV epidemic varies geographically and has evolved over time. </p><p>The risk of getting HIV varies widely depending on the type of exposure or behavior (such as sharing needles or having sex without a condom) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F60145\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef60145 \">table 1</a>). Some exposures to HIV carry a much higher risk of transmission than other exposures. For some exposures, while transmission is biologically possible, the risk is so low that it is not possible to put a precise number on it. However, risks add up over time so that even behavior with relatively small risk can add up over time and lead to a high lifetime risk of HIV infection.&nbsp;There may be a relatively small chance of acquiring HIV when engaging in a risk behavior with an infected partner only once, but if repeated many times, the overall likelihood of becoming infected after repeated exposures is much higher.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h2\">Sexual transmission</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>More than 80 percent of infections worldwide occur through heterosexual transmission, and over 50 percent of all HIV-infected people in the world are women [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/global-epidemiology-of-hiv-infection/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>]. These statistics reflect the situation in sub-Saharan Africa, which houses the majority of the world's HIV-infected population and where heterosexual transmission is the main contributor to the HIV epidemic.</p><p>In contrast, more men than women are infected with HIV in other parts of the world. This, in part, reflects the epidemic among men who have sex with men (MSM), who are 19 times more likely than the general population to be HIV-infected [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/global-epidemiology-of-hiv-infection/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. In some resource-rich settings, despite high rates of testing and access to ART, the incidence of HIV infection among MSM has increased while the incidence from other modes of transmission have trended downwards. As an example, in the United States, the number of newly diagnosed HIV infections attributed to MSM sexual contact increased from 2009 to 2015, while those attributed to injection drug use and heterosexual contact decreased [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/global-epidemiology-of-hiv-infection/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]. At the end of 2013, MSM transmission accounted for 68 percent of newly diagnosed HIV infections in the United States. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H854710502\"><span class=\"h2\">Injection drug use</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Outside of sub-Saharan Africa, injection drug use (IDU) accounts for approximately 30 percent of new HIV infections [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/global-epidemiology-of-hiv-infection/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. IDU is fueling HIV epidemics in central and eastern Europe and in some countries of Asia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/global-epidemiology-of-hiv-infection/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>]. It is also a major concern in industrialized nations and the Middle East. The vulnerability of this risk group and the rapidity with which HIV can spread through needle-sharing was reflected by a 2015 outbreak of HIV among injection drug users in a rural region of Indiana, where HIV had previously been only rarely reported [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/global-epidemiology-of-hiv-infection/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>]. Decades of experience within dozens of countries supports the effectiveness of needle exchange programs, in which injection drug users can trade in used needles for clean ones [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/global-epidemiology-of-hiv-infection/abstract/41,42\" class=\"abstract_t\">41,42</a>]. Across eight countries in eastern Europe and central Asia, a tripling of needle exchange program coverage between 2005 and 2010 was associated with reduced injecting risk behavior and reduced new HIV and hepatitis C virus infections. After ten years of needle exchange programs in Australia, the number of new HIV infections was reduced by up to 70 percent. Unfortunately, 43 percent of countries with documented injecting drug use do not have needle-syringe programmes in place.</p><p>A meta-analysis in 2008 examined the role of IDU as a cause of HIV transmission worldwide [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/global-epidemiology-of-hiv-infection/abstract/43\" class=\"abstract_t\">43</a>]. Prevalence estimates of IDU could be ascertained for 61 countries containing an estimated 77 percent of the world's population. Estimates suggest that 15.9 million people might inject drugs worldwide; the largest numbers of injectors were found in China, the United States, and Russia, where mid-estimates of HIV prevalence among injectors were 12, 16, and 37 percent, respectively. Furthermore, HIV prevalence among injecting drug users was 20 to 40 percent in five countries and over 40 percent in nine.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h2\">Mother-to-child transmission</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Over two million infants are born to HIV-infected women annually. These children are vulnerable to HIV transmission in utero, at birth, or through breastmilk. Mother-to-child transmission accounts for 90 percent of HIV infections among children worldwide. In the most affected countries in the world, such as in sub-Saharan Africa, 20 to 40 percent of pregnant women are HIV-infected, and one-third of their babies become infected [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/global-epidemiology-of-hiv-infection/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. Although antiretroviral use during pregnancy, at the time of delivery, and during breastfeeding can nearly eliminate transmission, only a minority (25 percent or less) of affected mothers are able to access appropriate antiretroviral treatment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/global-epidemiology-of-hiv-infection/abstract/23,44\" class=\"abstract_t\">23,44</a>].</p><p>The risk of perinatal transmission and the effect of antiretroviral use on that risk are discussed in detail elsewhere.

Overall, HIV prevalence has increased, likely because of improved survival among those who are treated, and incidence has decreased, likely as a result of decreased transmission with more widespread treatment. (See <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'General statistics'</a> above.)</p><p>The improvements in AIDS and non-AIDS related morbidity and mortality among HIV-infected individuals who are successfully treated with ART are discussed in detail elsewhere.

By this time, over 18 billion dollars had been allocated for ART care and prevention, mostly in developing countries. One analysis demonstrated that HIV funding was associated with a decline in all-cause mortality rates in the African countries where it had provided the greatest ART coverage [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/global-epidemiology-of-hiv-infection/abstract/45\" class=\"abstract_t\">45</a>]. The development of generic medications has also been an important advance in making ART available in resource-limited countries [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/global-epidemiology-of-hiv-infection/abstract/46\" class=\"abstract_t\">46</a>]. In December 2013, the UNAIDS Programme Coordinating Board called on UNAIDS to support country- and region-led efforts to establish new targets for HIV treatment scale-up beyond 2015. In response, stakeholder consultations on new targets have been held in all regions of the world. These targets by 2020 are: </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>90 percent of all people living with HIV will know their HIV status. </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>90 percent of all people with diagnosed HIV infection will receive sustained antiretroviral therapy. </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>90 percent of all people receiving antiretroviral therapy will have viral suppression.</p><p/><p>With international support, several resource-limited countries have been able to successfully provide widespread ART access. In Zambia, Rwanda, Botswana, and other countries, HIV treatment coverage either doubled or almost doubled from 2012 to 2015, reinforcing the feasibility of rapid scale-up. Especially encouraging is the rapid expansion of treatment services in certain fragile settings, such as the Democratic Republic of the Congo, where the proportion of people living with HIV receiving HIV treatment also doubled from 16 to 33 percent between 2012 and 2015. These encouraging results from diverse countries provide credibility to the attainment of the 90-90-90 targets. However, challenges remain and many countries are struggling to achieve the third 90 percent target [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/global-epidemiology-of-hiv-infection/abstract/47\" class=\"abstract_t\">47</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H18\"><span class=\"h2\">Access to ART</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Despite advances in ART provision, a large proportion of HIV-infected patients do not have access to or are otherwise not receiving ART [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/global-epidemiology-of-hiv-infection/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. In particular, the rate of ART use among HIV-infected children worldwide is especially low, only 24 percent in 2013. </p><p>Late access to ART has been associated with high early mortality rates [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/global-epidemiology-of-hiv-infection/abstract/48\" class=\"abstract_t\">48</a>]. In the Zambia study cited above, most mortality occurred within the first three months of starting therapy, consistent with the advanced stage of disease at presentation (mean CD4 cell count 143 <span class=\"nowrap\">cells/microL)</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/global-epidemiology-of-hiv-infection/abstract/47\" class=\"abstract_t\">47</a>]. In another community-based antiretroviral treatment program among 1340 HIV-infected patients in South Africa, more than 46 percent of the total mortality occurred after enrollment, but prior to the initiation of ART [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/global-epidemiology-of-hiv-infection/abstract/49\" class=\"abstract_t\">49</a>].</p><p>Reasons for suboptimal ART use despite availability include failure to test and diagnose HIV, failure to link and retain in care, stigma and misperceptions about HIV and its risks, and poor coordination of services. Even transportation costs can be a major barrier for patients trying to access ART. One study in Uganda demonstrated that home-based care can be less costly and as efficacious as clinic-based care in attaining viral suppression [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/global-epidemiology-of-hiv-infection/abstract/50\" class=\"abstract_t\">50</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H644143\"><span class=\"h1\">COINFECTIONS WITH HIV</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The epidemiology of HIV is intertwined with those of numerous other infectious disorders because of geographical overlap and the adverse impact of HIV-associated immunosuppression with the natural history of such infections.

HIV-1 and HIV-2 are the two types of HIV identified worldwide. HIV-1 is the more prominent type and consists of four distinct viral groups; group M is the most common and has worldwide distribution. Viruses from group M are divided into nine distinct subtypes and recombinants of the subtypes, which have varying geographic distribution (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F109484\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef109484 \">figure 1</a>).

The overall prevalence of HIV continues to increase in some countries with improved survival with antiretroviral treatment, but the incidence of new HIV infections has declined since 2000. (See <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Worldwide statistics'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Nearly three-quarters of the world's HIV-infected population is in sub-Saharan Africa where heterosexual transmission is the main contributor to the HIV epidemic. Elsewhere, other modes of infection are more important. Injection drug use is fueling HIV epidemics in central and eastern Europe and in some countries of Asia. In some resource-rich settings, including the United States, the incidence of HIV infection has been increasing among men who have sex with men despite general trends of decreasing incidence otherwise. (See <a href=\"#H11\" class=\"local\">'Modes of transmission driving the epidemic'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Marked advances in HIV antiretroviral therapy (ART) have resulted in significant changes in the survival rate and quality of life of HIV-infected individuals. Improving delivery of ART in resource-limited countries has been a primary focus of international efforts to combat the HIV epidemic. Despite advances in ART provision in such settings, a large proportion of HIV-infected patients still do not have access to or are otherwise not receiving ART.
