When evaluating patients with ventricular tachycardia (VT) and ventricular fibrillation (VF), several initial distinctions should be made. These include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Arrhythmia duration &ndash; sustained or nonsustained</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Arrhythmia morphology &ndash; monomorphic VT, polymorphic VT, or VF</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Associated symptoms &ndash; ranging from none to hemodynamic collapse and sudden cardiac arrest</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Associated cardiac disease</p><p/><p>Malignant arrhythmias usually occur in the presence of significant structural heart disease (eg, coronary heart disease with prior myocardial infarction, dilated cardiomyopathy, or hypertrophic cardiomyopathy). In this setting, ventricular arrhythmias carry a high risk of sudden cardiac death (SCD).</p><p>Less commonly, VT and VF occur in hearts that appear normal. In many such cases, however, the heart is in fact not normal, but rather has less visible abnormalities including derangements of cardiac ion channels or structural proteins. In these patients, ventricular arrhythmias also carry a high risk of SCD. Thus, a significant majority of patients with VT or VF have some form of underlying cardiac disease, are at increased risk for SCD, and require a thorough cardiac evaluation to exclude structural abnormalities and nonstructural disorders. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-of-the-survivor-of-sudden-cardiac-arrest\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation of the survivor of sudden cardiac arrest&quot;</a>.)</p><p>There are, however, some VT syndromes which occur in normal hearts that have a more benign prognosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/monomorphic-ventricular-tachycardia-in-the-absence-of-apparent-structural-heart-disease/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>]. These arrhythmias are sometimes referred to as idiopathic VT. Terminology and classifications vary, but three commonly cited syndromes are:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Repetitive monomorphic VT, which is also referred to as right ventricular outflow tract (RVOT) VT. This arrhythmia is due to triggered activity and is sensitive to <a href=\"topic.htm?path=adenosine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">adenosine</a>. An arrhythmia with similar characteristics that originates from the left ventricular outflow tract has also been described.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Paroxysmal sustained VT, which is sometimes considered a variant of RVOT VT.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Idiopathic left ventricular tachycardia, which originates from the posterior septum, is due to reentry, and is sensitive to <a href=\"topic.htm?path=verapamil-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">verapamil</a>.</p><p/><p>These arrhythmias have substrate and mechanisms that are different from the malignant arrhythmias that occur in both abnormal and apparently normal hearts. Thus, they should be considered distinct syndromes rather than well-tolerated forms of other ventricular arrhythmia syndromes. The diagnosis, characterization, and management of these monomorphic VTs will be reviewed here.</p><p>Sustained and nonsustained ventricular arrhythmias in patients with heart disease, and malignant ventricular arrhythmias in the absence of apparent structural heart disease are discussed in detail separately.

Historically, both VT and VF that occur in the absence of apparent heart disease have been referred to as idiopathic. However, with continual improvements in both the understanding of arrhythmia mechanisms and diagnostic methods, an increasing percentage of patients are now given a diagnosis (eg, Brugada syndrome, arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy [ARVC], and catecholaminergic polymorphic VT). In contrast to the syndromes discussed here, these disorders have an increased risk of sudden cardiac death (SCD).

(See <a href=\"#H20\" class=\"local\">'Radiofrequency ablation'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12026071\"><span class=\"h2\">Classification</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Multiple classification schemata for idiopathic VT appear in the literature. Investigations of idiopathic VT syndromes have focused for the most part on individual aspects of the syndrome (eg, clinical presentation, electrocardiographic appearance, electrophysiologic mechanism, response to antiarrhythmic agents); this approach has yielded a bewildering amount of often conflicting information. Despite this confusion, most investigators acknowledge the existence of at least three syndromes of idiopathic monomorphic VT:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Repetitive monomorphic VT, also called right ventricular outflow tract (RVOT) VT, is a triggered arrhythmia that is characterized by frequent short &quot;salvos&quot; of nonsustained VT. Less commonly, arrhythmias with similar characteristics and mechanisms originate from the LVOT, and these are considered a variant of RVOT VT.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Paroxysmal sustained VT, which also arises from the RV, and is sometimes considered a sustained variant of repetitive monomorphic VT.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Idiopathic left ventricular tachycardia, which differs from the LVOT variant of RVOT VT in both the mechanism (reentry) and site of origin (inferoapex or midseptum).</p><p/><p>These three syndromes effectively characterize the majority of patients with idiopathic monomorphic VT and often unite clinical presentation, ECG morphology, and anatomic location into recognizable syndromes (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F54842\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef54842 \">table 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/monomorphic-ventricular-tachycardia-in-the-absence-of-apparent-structural-heart-disease/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>]. In fact, however, idiopathic VT can arise from virtually any area of the heart, and other typical locations include the RV and LV inflow areas and the papillary muscles. The syndromes discussed in this section are by far the most frequently observed.</p><p>Bundle branch reentrant VT is a special form of monomorphic VT that typically occurs in patients with structural heart disease. Patients with BBRVT often have a baseline nonspecific conduction delay or left bundle branch block, and most have a prolonged His-to-ventricle time (ie, HV interval). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=bundle-branch-reentrant-ventricular-tachycardia\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Bundle branch reentrant ventricular tachycardia&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Idiopathic VT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Idiopathic VT has accounted for approximately 10 percent all patients referred for evaluation of VT [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/monomorphic-ventricular-tachycardia-in-the-absence-of-apparent-structural-heart-disease/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. The mean age of patients with idiopathic VT is less than that of patients with VT secondary to underlying heart disease.</p><p>It is important to recognize that not all VT that occurs in the apparent absence of structural heart disease is idiopathic VT. Distinguishing idiopathic VT from other monomorphic VT syndromes is important for several reasons:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Idiopathic VT is generally considered to have an excellent prognosis in terms of freedom from both the development of structural heart disease and arrhythmic death [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/monomorphic-ventricular-tachycardia-in-the-absence-of-apparent-structural-heart-disease/abstract/4-10\" class=\"abstract_t\">4-10</a>]. There are several exceptions to this generalization, however, and episodes of SCD can occur [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/monomorphic-ventricular-tachycardia-in-the-absence-of-apparent-structural-heart-disease/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Idiopathic VT often responds to antiarrhythmic drugs that would be unhelpful or even contraindicated in VT occurring in the setting of coronary heart disease.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Most idiopathic VT syndromes are now amenable to cure with catheter ablation techniques.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Other ventricular tachyarrhythmias</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In addition to monomorphic VT, both polymorphic VT and VF can occur in the absence of structural heart disease. In contrast to the generally good prognosis associated with idiopathic monomorphic VT, these syndromes are associated with an increased risk of SCD. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sudden-cardiac-arrest-in-the-absence-of-apparent-structural-heart-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Sudden cardiac arrest in the absence of apparent structural heart disease&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Polymorphic VT in the absence of structural heart disease occurs in two settings: with a prolonged QT interval in acquired or inherited long QT syndrome; and with a normal QT interval in usually familial disease, which is also called catecholaminergic polymorphic VT. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=congenital-long-qt-syndrome-epidemiology-and-clinical-manifestations\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Congenital long QT syndrome: Epidemiology and clinical manifestations&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=catecholaminergic-polymorphic-ventricular-tachycardia-and-other-polymorphic-ventricular-tachycardias-with-a-normal-qt-interval\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia and other polymorphic ventricular tachycardias with a normal QT interval&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>VF in the absence of structural heart disease or other reversible arrhythmic triggers (eg, ischemia or metabolic derangements) is also referred to as idiopathic. The diagnosis of idiopathic VF is considered only after all other causes of VF have been rigorously excluded. The rationale for this approach comes from autopsy studies of SCD in previously healthy individuals. These studies found an appreciable incidence of coronary heart disease (most without a previous history of chest pain), hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, myocarditis, and ARVC. Brugada syndrome is a specific cause of lethal ventricular arrhythmias in patients without structural heart disease; it is characterized by ST elevation in the anterior precordial leads on the resting surface electrocardiogram. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sudden-cardiac-arrest-in-the-absence-of-apparent-structural-heart-disease#H11\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Sudden cardiac arrest in the absence of apparent structural heart disease&quot;, section on 'Idiopathic VF'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=brugada-syndrome-clinical-presentation-diagnosis-and-evaluation\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Brugada syndrome: Clinical presentation, diagnosis, and evaluation&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h1\">DIAGNOSTIC EVALUATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>By definition, patients with idiopathic monomorphic VT have no detectable structural heart disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/monomorphic-ventricular-tachycardia-in-the-absence-of-apparent-structural-heart-disease/abstract/1,2,4-9\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2,4-9</a>]. Thus, the assessment of these patients focuses upon establishing the presence of a normal heart. The evaluation of the patient with sustained ventricular arrhythmias and sudden death is reviewed in detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sustained-monomorphic-ventricular-tachycardia-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-evaluation#H10017877\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Sustained monomorphic ventricular tachycardia: Clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and evaluation&quot;, section on 'Additional diagnostic evaluation'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-of-the-survivor-of-sudden-cardiac-arrest\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation of the survivor of sudden cardiac arrest&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">General approach</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>For the purposes of this review, the following summarizes findings that may be seen in patients with idiopathic monomorphic VT:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The resting ECG is typically normal between arrhythmia episodes, although some patients have temporary ECG repolarization abnormalities immediately after VT termination.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The signal averaged ECG recorded during sinus rhythm is usually normal, although abnormalities may be seen during VT [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/monomorphic-ventricular-tachycardia-in-the-absence-of-apparent-structural-heart-disease/abstract/6,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,11</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Functional studies of left ventricular (LV) and right ventricular (RV) performance during sinus rhythm are normal, although segmental wall motion abnormalities may be seen immediately after VT termination. In patients who have not had a recent episode of VT, abnormalities in ventricular function should suggest an alternative diagnosis. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-of-the-survivor-of-sudden-cardiac-arrest#H13\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation of the survivor of sudden cardiac arrest&quot;, section on 'Echocardiography'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">However, in rare cases, LV dysfunction can occur as a consequence of idiopathic VT, due to a tachycardia-induced cardiomyopathy. Such a myopathy can develop without persistent tachycardia if there are very frequent PVCs (ie, &gt;20,000 per day) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/monomorphic-ventricular-tachycardia-in-the-absence-of-apparent-structural-heart-disease/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. This is a very important condition to recognize, as the LV dysfunction is reversible with treatment of the arrhythmia.

Coronary angiography, which is considered in patients with minimally symptomatic arrhythmias only if the stress test suggests ischemia, should also be normal.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Cardiovascular magnetic resonance imaging (CMR) may reveal mild structural abnormalities of the RV in patients with RMVT, primarily involving the free wall (focal thinning, fatty infiltration, and wall motion abnormalities) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/monomorphic-ventricular-tachycardia-in-the-absence-of-apparent-structural-heart-disease/abstract/13-15\" class=\"abstract_t\">13-15</a>]. The significance of these changes is unclear, since there is a poor correlation between the origin of the RMVT and the site of the CMR abnormalities unless they are also present in the RVOT.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Limited data suggest that RV radionuclide myocardial perfusion imaging can distinguish between idiopathic monomorphic VT and VT due to an organic cause such as dilated cardiomyopathy, myocarditis, or ARVC [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/monomorphic-ventricular-tachycardia-in-the-absence-of-apparent-structural-heart-disease/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>RV biopsy, which is rarely performed, is usually normal, although a number of studies have reported abnormalities that are nonspecific and of no significant value [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/monomorphic-ventricular-tachycardia-in-the-absence-of-apparent-structural-heart-disease/abstract/17-19\" class=\"abstract_t\">17-19</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Distinction from ARVC</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>RMVT can be particularly difficult to distinguish from the more serious disorder, ARVC. Although ARVC is unlikely in patients who have a normal signal averaged electrocardiogram and normal imaging studies of RV size and function, the &quot;development&quot; of ARVC in patients thought to have idiopathic VT at presentation has been reported [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/monomorphic-ventricular-tachycardia-in-the-absence-of-apparent-structural-heart-disease/abstract/9,20\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,20</a>]. </p><p>Thus, the clinical boundaries between idiopathic RV tachycardia and ARVC may be difficult to establish in atypical cases. The findings on the ECG, signal averaged ECG, and electrophysiology (EP) studies may be helpful in making this distinction:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The resting ECG can be normal at presentation in approximately 40 percent of patients with ARVC.

In a cohort of 59 patients (17 with ARVC, 42 with RMVT), ECG features suggestive of ARVC included longer mean QRS duration in lead I (150 versus 123 msec in RMVT), precordial transition in lead V6 (18 versus 0 percent in RMVT), and at least one lead with QRS notching (65 versus 21 percent in RMVT) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/monomorphic-ventricular-tachycardia-in-the-absence-of-apparent-structural-heart-disease/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The signal averaged ECG in the time domain is typically abnormal in ARVC, but usually normal in idiopathic RV tachycardia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/monomorphic-ventricular-tachycardia-in-the-absence-of-apparent-structural-heart-disease/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>On EP study, four findings are seen in most patients with ARVC but are rare in idiopathic RV tachycardia: inducible VT by programmed stimulation; multiple VT morphologies; fractionated diastolic electrograms during VT or sinus rhythm at the VT site of origin or other RV sites; and regions of low amplitude and prolonged duration on intracardiac electrograms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/monomorphic-ventricular-tachycardia-in-the-absence-of-apparent-structural-heart-disease/abstract/23-25\" class=\"abstract_t\">23-25</a>].

At a mean follow-up of 7.5 years, three patients died suddenly; none was taking antiarrhythmic drugs at the time. The SCD events may have been due to RMVT itself, although patients with other syndromes now known to be malignant may have been included (eg, Brugada syndrome, arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy).

In contrast to the first study, the coupling interval of the VPBs in patients who developed malignant arrhythmias was not different from that in 85 other patients with RMVT who did not have malignant arrhythmias.

The high frequency in the above study (16 of 101 patients) is probably a substantial overestimate due to referral bias. In addition, it is possible that some cases categorized as polymorphic VT were simply the common form of RVOT VT in which QRS morphology varied during the tachycardia due to fluctuations in loading conditions.

Furthermore, patients with paroxysmal sustained VT appear to respond to antiarrhythmic agents, particularly <a href=\"topic.htm?path=adenosine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">adenosine</a>, in a manner similar to patients with RMVT, although data are limited [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/monomorphic-ventricular-tachycardia-in-the-absence-of-apparent-structural-heart-disease/abstract/72\" class=\"abstract_t\">72</a>].</p><p>Because of these similarities, it is not clear if paroxysmal sustained VT is a distinct clinical syndrome. Compared with nonsustained RMVT, this disorder is more often symptomatic and less often exercise-provoked. It is also more frequently induced by programmed stimulation, although <a href=\"topic.htm?path=isoproterenol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">isoproterenol</a> may facilitate induction in some cases.</p><p>On the other hand, some investigators dispute the existence of paroxysmal sustained VT as a syndrome distinct from RMVT. One study, for example, found that 58 percent of patients with RMVT had at least one episode of sustained VT [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/monomorphic-ventricular-tachycardia-in-the-absence-of-apparent-structural-heart-disease/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. In addition, electrophysiologic studies may reproduce sustained VT in patients who present with only nonsustained VT (particularly during <a href=\"topic.htm?path=isoproterenol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">isoproterenol</a> infusion) or vice versa. It has also been suggested that the incidence of sudden cardiac death in RMVT is actually due to overlap with paroxysmal sustained VT. For these reasons, the two syndromes are occasionally considered together as idiopathic right ventricular tachycardia, or simply as RMVT.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H22\"><span class=\"h1\">IDIOPATHIC LEFT VENTRICULAR TACHYCARDIA</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Idiopathic left ventricular tachycardia (ILVT) was first described in 1979 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/monomorphic-ventricular-tachycardia-in-the-absence-of-apparent-structural-heart-disease/abstract/73\" class=\"abstract_t\">73</a>].

Less commonly, ventricular tachycardia (VT) and ventricular fibrillation (VF) occur in hearts that appear normal but in fact, contain less visible abnormalities including derangements of cardiac ion channels or structural proteins. Idiopathic VT syndromes, including repetitive monomorphic VT, paroxysmal sustained VT, and idiopathic left ventricular tachycardia, occur in structurally normal hearts and have a more benign prognosis. (See <a href=\"#H1\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Idiopathic VT syndromes account for approximately 10 percent all patients referred for evaluation of VT, with the mean age of patients with an idiopathic VT being less than that of patients with VT secondary to underlying heart disease. Distinguishing an idiopathic VT syndrome from other monomorphic VT syndromes is important given the far better prognosis, greater array of antiarrhythmic drug options, and amenability to cure with ablation. (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Idiopathic VT'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The diagnostic evaluation to establish the presence and type of heart disease in patients with sustained VT generally includes various invasive and noninvasive techniques, depending in part upon the clinical history and presentation. These include electrocardiography (ECG), echocardiography, exercise treadmill testing, signal averaged ECG, coronary angiography, endomyocardial biopsy, or magnetic resonance imaging. (See <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'General approach'</a> above and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sustained-monomorphic-ventricular-tachycardia-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-evaluation#H10017877\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Sustained monomorphic ventricular tachycardia: Clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and evaluation&quot;, section on 'Additional diagnostic evaluation'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Repetitive monomorphic VT (RMVT), also called right ventricular outflow tract (RVOT) VT, is a triggered arrhythmia that is characterized by frequent short &quot;salvos&quot; of nonsustained VT. The most common symptoms associated with RMVT are palpitations and lightheadedness, typically occurring during or immediately after exercise or emotional stress, although a significant proportion of patients are asymptomatic. Most RMVT episodes have a characteristic ECG appearance with left bundle branch block appearance and an inferior axis. (See <a href=\"#H9\" class=\"local\">'Repetitive monomorphic VT'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Treatment decisions for RMVT should consider that many patients are young and otherwise healthy, and as a result, ablative therapy may be preferable to chronic administration of antiarrhythmic drugs. RMVT can be terminated with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=adenosine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">adenosine</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=verapamil-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">verapamil</a>, and beta blockers, with verapamil and beta blockers also often used as first-line agents to prevent recurrence. While class I and III antiarrhythmic drugs are effective in many patients, catheter ablation is frequently preferred given its high success rate and low rate of associated complications. (See <a href=\"#H18\" class=\"local\">'Treatment of RMVT'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Paroxysmal sustained VT is another clinical syndrome of idiopathic VT that resembles RMVT in many ways.

ILVT has a right bundle branch block morphology with a left superior frontal plane axis and a relatively narrow QRS duration (typically 0.12 to 0.14 sec). <a href=\"topic.htm?path=verapamil-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Verapamil</a> is usually effective in the treatment of ILVT, both for the termination of acute episodes and the prevention of recurrence.
