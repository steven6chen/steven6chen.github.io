In resource-rich settings, increasingly effective and better tolerated agents are becoming available to treat infection and reduce complications. However, because it is frequently asymptomatic, many individuals do not know they have chronic HCV infection (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-natural-history-of-chronic-hepatitis-c-virus-infection\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and natural history of chronic hepatitis C virus infection&quot;</a>). As an example, in the United States, an estimated 50 percent of individuals with chronic HCV infection are unaware of their diagnosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/screening-for-chronic-hepatitis-c-virus-infection/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Failure to identify infected individuals is a major bottleneck to linkage to care and successful control of HCV [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/screening-for-chronic-hepatitis-c-virus-infection/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Thus, screening asymptomatic patients who may have an increased likelihood of being infected with HCV is an important step toward improving the detection and ultimately treatment of infected individuals.</p><p>Screening for HCV generally focuses on testing those who have an individual risk factor for exposure, who have evidence of liver disease, and who belong to certain demographic groups that have a high-prevalence of infection.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H602289604\"><span class=\"h2\">Benefit of early detection</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>With the availability of highly effective, well-tolerated, all-oral antiviral regimens, the vast majority of HCV-infected individuals can be successfully treated with only mild side effects. Identification and successful treatment of infected HCV individuals prior to the development of complications result in decreased all-cause mortality, liver-related death, need for liver transplantation, hepatocellular carcinoma rates, and liver-related complications. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=patient-evaluation-and-selection-for-antiviral-therapy-for-chronic-hepatitis-c-virus-infection#H1317635295\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Patient evaluation and selection for antiviral therapy for chronic hepatitis C virus infection&quot;, section on 'Rationale for treatment'</a>.)</p><p>However, without screening, many HCV-infected individuals are identified late. As an example, in a large observational cohort study of over 6,000 HCV-infected individuals in the United States engaged in a health system and with a defined date of HCV diagnosis, 17 percent had a &quot;late diagnosis&quot; of HCV defined by presence of cirrhosis at the time of diagnosis <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> hepatic decompensation before or within one year of diagnosis, despite being in health care a mean of six years prior to diagnosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/screening-for-chronic-hepatitis-c-virus-infection/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Late diagnosis was associated with hospitalization and death. Late diagnosis has also been associated with rising rates of hepatocellular cancer requiring liver transplantation in individuals born between 1945 and 1965 in the United States (ie, baby boomers) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/screening-for-chronic-hepatitis-c-virus-infection/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H20869936\"><span class=\"h2\">Risk for exposure</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The majority of patients diagnosed with HCV infection have some identifiable risk factor that increases the likelihood of exposure to the virus. As an example, in the 1998 to 2002 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey, in which a representative sample of noninstitutionalized individuals in the United States is tested for HCV infection, any history of injection drug use, a history of blood transfusion before 1992, or the presence of an abnormal serum ALT level identified 85 percent of HCV RNA positive participants aged 20 to 59 years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/screening-for-chronic-hepatitis-c-virus-infection/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. </p><p>In a systematic review of three observational studies that evaluated HCV screening among high-prevalence populations (4.6 to 8.3 percent HCV prevalence), screening strategies based on the presence of at least one of several risk factors were associated with sensitivities of greater than 90 percent and numbers needed of 9 to 18 to identify one case [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/screening-for-chronic-hepatitis-c-virus-infection/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. Risk factors were common in these high-prevalent populations; restricting screening to only those with a history of injection drug use would have lowered the number needed to screen but missed up to two-thirds of infected patients. Among a lower prevalence population (1 percent), which also had a lower prevalence of risk factors, the sensitivity of risk-based screening was 90 percent, with a number needed to screen of 2.4. The risks included in the screening strategies varied by study, but most included injection drug use, blood transfusion before 1992, sexual intercourse with an injection drug user, and abnormal liver enzyme levels. </p><p>Individuals may be directly exposed to HCV in other ways, such as from a needlestick during care of an HCV-infected patient or through perinatal exposure of infants of HCV-infected women. Risk factors for the transmission of HCV are discussed in detail elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epidemiology-and-transmission-of-hepatitis-c-virus-infection#H3\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Epidemiology and transmission of hepatitis C virus infection&quot;, section on 'Transmission'</a>.)</p><p>Risk factor-based screening is especially important among individuals with the potential to transmit infection to others. These include injection drug users as well as pregnant women and women of childbearing potential. Nevertheless, several studies have suggested that pregnant women often don't receive appropriate HCV screening despite risk factors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/screening-for-chronic-hepatitis-c-virus-infection/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=vertical-transmission-of-hepatitis-c-virus#H2\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Vertical transmission of hepatitis C virus&quot;, section on 'Incidence'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H20869985\"><span class=\"h2\">Elevated transaminases</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Elevated liver enzymes are not a risk factor, per se, for HCV transmission, although a fair proportion of patients with unexplained persistently elevated aminotransferases are HCV-infected. In a study of a large cohort of patients enrolled in one of several health care organizations, of the 28,000 patients who had two or more elevated ALT levels and were subsequently tested for HCV, 8.2 percent had a positive HCV test, compared with 3.2 percent among the 6400 tested who had only had one isolated ALT elevation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/screening-for-chronic-hepatitis-c-virus-infection/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Evaluation for chronic HCV infection is a component of the work-up for elevated transaminases. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=approach-to-the-patient-with-abnormal-liver-biochemical-and-function-tests#H19409354\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Approach to the patient with abnormal liver biochemical and function tests&quot;, section on 'Evaluation of mildly or moderately elevated aminotransferases'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H435410072\"><span class=\"h2\">High-prevalence groups</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Certain patient populations have a higher prevalence of HCV infection, partly because they contain a relatively high proportion of individuals who have known or occult risk factors for exposures to HCV. Targeted screening for these groups in general, regardless of the individual patient&rsquo;s risk factors, may improve the detection of HCV-infected persons, as screening based on individual risk alone does not identify a substantial proportion of the infected population. </p><p>Risk-based testing falls short for several reasons. Many individuals with HCV infection do not remember or report having specific risk factors for infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/screening-for-chronic-hepatitis-c-virus-infection/abstract/8,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,9</a>]. As an example, in an analysis of data from a national health survey, 45 percent of individuals with evidence of HCV infection reported no known exposure risk [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/screening-for-chronic-hepatitis-c-virus-infection/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. Additionally, even among individuals who do have high risk exposure to HCV, many remain untested, as illustrated by a study in which 72 percent of 1033 injection drug users who had a reactive HCV antibody test when tested during trial enrollment were previously unaware of their diagnosis. Similarly, in a study of the rate of HCV screening within a managed care network that included over 550,000 adults, only 29 percent of those who had at least one identifiable HCV risk factor underwent testing for HCV [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/screening-for-chronic-hepatitis-c-virus-infection/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>].</p><p>Even among patients who have documentation of elevated transaminases, an objective finding not subject to limitations of patient recall and reporting, the rate of HCV testing is suboptimal. In a study of patients seen at four large health care organizations throughout the United States, only 44 percent of those who had two or more elevated alanine aminotransferase (ALT) values were subsequently tested for HCV [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/screening-for-chronic-hepatitis-c-virus-infection/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p>High prevalence groups include those born in the United States between 1945 and 1965, HIV-infected individuals, dialysis patients, and incarcerated individuals.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H20869930\"><span class=\"h3\">1945 to 1965 birth cohort</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In the United States, several organizations have recommended screening patients born between 1945 and 1965 regardless of the presence of specific risk factors because of a high prevalence of HCV infection within this group. This was recommended by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in 2012 and endorsed by the United States Preventive Services Task Force in 2013 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/screening-for-chronic-hepatitis-c-virus-infection/abstract/8,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,11</a>].</p><p>In the United States, surveillance data have suggested that individuals born between 1945 and 1965 represent a disproportionate percentage of the total population of chronically HCV-infected adults. In the National Health and Nutrition Examination Surveys (NHANES), in which participants chosen according to an algorithm to produce a representative sample of the noninstitutionalized population of the United States are tested for antibodies to HCV and viral RNA if positive, the majority of anti-HCV positive participants are born between 1945 and 1964 (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F90110\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef90110 \">figure 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/screening-for-chronic-hepatitis-c-virus-infection/abstract/5,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,12</a>]. In a study of NHANES data from 2003 to 2010, individuals born between 1945 and 1964 accounted for 81 percent of the total estimated population of chronically HCV-infected adults [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/screening-for-chronic-hepatitis-c-virus-infection/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. The prevalence of HCV RNA positivity among individuals in this birth cohort is estimated at 2.6 percent, six times higher than individuals born in other years. </p><p>Thus, performing routine screening on patients born within these two decades regardless of the presence of risk factors will target a large proportion of the chronically infected HCV population in the United States [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/screening-for-chronic-hepatitis-c-virus-infection/abstract/13-15\" class=\"abstract_t\">13-15</a>]. As an example, in a study of over 4700 patients presenting to an urban emergency department in Maryland, antibody testing of excess blood samples identified 204 patients with undocumented HCV infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/screening-for-chronic-hepatitis-c-virus-infection/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. Of those, 26 percent would have been identified by risk-based testing (history of injection drug use or HIV infection), whereas an additional 49 percent would have been identified by screening based on birth between 1945 and 1965.</p><p>Clinical efforts to improve birth cohort screening also appear to enhance HCV diagnosis rates. In an analysis of three randomized controlled trials, repeated mailings inviting birth cohort patients to undergo HCV testing, electronic medical record alerts to remind clinicians to test birth cohort patients, and direct solicitation of birth cohort patients following an office visit were 8, 2.6, and 5 times more likely, respectively, to identify HCV infections compared with usual care [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/screening-for-chronic-hepatitis-c-virus-infection/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. </p><p>Birth-cohort screening may not be cost effective in countries where the prevalence of HCV is lower [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/screening-for-chronic-hepatitis-c-virus-infection/abstract/17,18\" class=\"abstract_t\">17,18</a>].

In contrast to the low efficiency of sexual transmission of HCV in general, growing evidence has revealed a substantial risk of sexual HCV transmission among HIV-infected men who have sex with men. Additionally, coinfection is associated with higher rates of fibrosis progression, decompensated liver disease, and liver-related morbidity and mortality compared with infection with HCV alone. These issues are discussed in detail elsewhere.

Thus, we advocate routine screening for HCV in correctional facilities [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/screening-for-chronic-hepatitis-c-virus-infection/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2960433858\"><span class=\"h2\">High prevalence countries</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In some regions, the overall prevalence of HCV infection is high enough to warrant screening in the general population.

In making the updated recommendation, the USPSTF noted that the high accuracy of diagnostic tests for HCV, the improved efficacy of antiviral therapy with the introduction of newer agents, and the association of sustained virologic response with a substantial reduction in morbidity and mortality together provided indirect evidence for a moderate clinical benefit to screening for HCV.

Various antibody tests are available, including laboratory based immunoassays, rapid tests that can be performed at the point-of care, and tests performed on specimens that the patient can collect at home. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diagnosis-and-evaluation-of-chronic-hepatitis-c-virus-infection#H1128802934\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Diagnosis and evaluation of chronic hepatitis C virus infection&quot;, section on 'Antibody testing'</a>.)</p><p>A reactive antibody test should be followed by a HCV RNA test. A nonreactive antibody test generally indicates the absence of chronic HCV infection. However, immunocompromised patients (eg, dialysis or HIV infected patients) may lack detectable levels of anti-HCV antibodies despite having a HCV infection, and thus testing for HCV RNA despite a nonreactive antibody test is important to exclude infection. This screening approach follows the algorithm for the diagnosis of chronic HCV infection, which is discussed in detail elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diagnosis-and-evaluation-of-chronic-hepatitis-c-virus-infection#H692855539\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Diagnosis and evaluation of chronic hepatitis C virus infection&quot;, section on 'Diagnosis and testing approach'</a>.)</p><p>For infants born to HCV-infected mothers, we typically delay screening until after 18 months of age to ensure that anti-HCV antibodies detected in the child do not represent maternal antibodies that had crossed the placenta. If an earlier diagnosis is desired, an HCV RNA test can be performed in the first year of life. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=vertical-transmission-of-hepatitis-c-virus#H11\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Vertical transmission of hepatitis C virus&quot;, section on 'Diagnosis'</a>.)</p><p>For patients who have had a very recent exposure (eg, needlestick), acute HCV infection may be a possibility and is not well detected by screening methods for chronic HCV infection. In such cases, additional testing, including immediate and longitudinal HCV RNA and liver enzyme testing may be warranted. The diagnosis of acute HCV infection is discussed in detail elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-treatment-of-acute-hepatitis-c-virus-infection-in-adults#H2\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and treatment of acute hepatitis C virus infection in adults&quot;, section on 'Diagnosis'</a>.)</p><p>Some patients who already have a reactive HCV antibody test (eg, from a prior infection that spontaneously cleared or was successfully treated) may warrant continued screening because of ongoing risk factors, as below. In such cases, an HCV RNA test is used to detect reinfection. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H285050178\"><span class=\"h1\">SCREENING FREQUENCY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The frequency of screening for HCV infection depends on the indication. For patients who do not have ongoing risk factors for HCV, eg, patients screened because of their birth year or a history of transfusion prior to 1992, one-time screening is sufficient. </p><p>Ongoing screening is appropriate for patients who have continued risk factors, such as individuals with ongoing injection drug use, HIV-infected men who have sex with men, or long-term partners of HCV-infected individuals. However, the frequency and method of testing for such individuals are unclear as there are no studies evaluating the optimal interval for repeat HCV screening. Every 6 to 12 months is a reasonable interval. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H435410425\"><span class=\"h1\">BLOOD DONOR SCREENING</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Volunteer blood donors are initially screened for risk factors through a questionnaire. Donated blood is then screened for HCV using ELISA for anti-HCV antibodies. In addition, pooled samples of donated blood or blood products are screened with nucleic acid testing (NAT), an ultrasensitive amplification-based technique to detect HCV RNA. If a pool tests positive, then the individual donor units are tested. This identifies donors who are HCV-infected but anti-HCV negative, such as those with acute HCV infection. Only seronegative and NAT negative units are released. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3226478921\"><span class=\"h1\">SOCIETY GUIDELINE LINKS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Links to society and government-sponsored guidelines from selected countries and regions around the world are provided separately.

In resource-rich settings, increasingly effective and better tolerated agents are becoming available to treat infection and reduce complications. Because HCV infection is frequently asymptomatic, screening patients who may have an increased likelihood of being infected with HCV is an important step toward improving the detection and ultimately the treatment of infected individuals. (See <a href=\"#H1644736009\" class=\"local\">'Rationale for screening'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Screening for HCV generally focuses on testing those who have an individual risk factor for exposure, who have evidence of liver disease, and who belong to certain demographic groups that have a high-prevalence of infection, including individuals born in the United States between 1945 and 1965. (See <a href=\"#H20869936\" class=\"local\">'Risk for exposure'</a> above and <a href=\"#H20869985\" class=\"local\">'Elevated transaminases'</a> above and <a href=\"#H435410072\" class=\"local\">'High-prevalence groups'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Several organizations have provided guidelines for who should be tested for HCV infection. Our screening recommendations are generally consistent with those made by expert and public health organizations in the United States. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Patient selection'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Specifically, we screen the following patients for chronic HCV infection (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F98092\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef98092 \">table 1</a>):</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Those with a history of illicit injection drug use or intranasal cocaine use, even if only used once</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Those who received potentially contaminated blood products or tissue</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Those who belong to a high prevalence group (including those born between 1945 and 1965 and living in the United States) </p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Those who have other potential prior exposure to HCV, or who have the potential for transmission (eg, organ donation)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">HCV testing is also warranted for those with clinical or biochemical evidence of chronic liver disease (eg, persistently elevated alanine aminotransferase) or extrahepatic manifestations that have been associated with chronic HCV infection.
