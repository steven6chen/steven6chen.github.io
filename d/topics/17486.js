TRALI has been defined by both a National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI) working group as well as a Canadian Consensus Conference, as new acute lung injury <span class=\"nowrap\">(ALI)/acute</span> respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) occurring during or within six hours after blood product administration (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F64212\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef64212 \">table 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transfusion-related-acute-lung-injury-trali/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>]. When a clear temporal relationship to an alternative risk factor for <span class=\"nowrap\">ALI/ARDS</span> coexists, a formal diagnosis of TRALI cannot be made. In these circumstances, the diagnostic terminology to be used is either &quot;possible TRALI&quot; or the more recently endorsed term &quot;transfused ARDS&quot; [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transfusion-related-acute-lung-injury-trali/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].</p><p>Prior to the institution of TRALI risk mitigation strategies, plasma components and apheresis platelet concentrates conferred the highest risk of TRALI per component. Currently, due to transfusion of a much larger number of red cell units compared with plasma and platelets, the largest number of TRALI-related deaths in the United States and other developed countries occur with red blood cell transfusion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transfusion-related-acute-lung-injury-trali/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H15\" class=\"local\">'Prevention'</a> below.)</p><p>The epidemiology, pathogenesis, risk factors, clinical features, management, and prevention strategies for TRALI are presented here.

However, the true incidence of TRALI is not known, largely due to poor syndrome recognition, the reliance on passive reporting rather than active surveillance strategies, and the inclusion of cases that did not meet the NHLBI or Canadian Consensus Conference definitions of TRALI in some reports [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transfusion-related-acute-lung-injury-trali/abstract/9-13\" class=\"abstract_t\">9-13</a>]. Additionally, due to the contribution of specific recipient risk factors, TRALI incidence is also likely to depend on the population of interest. As an example, estimates suggest that the rate of TRALI in critically ill populations may reach 5 to 8 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transfusion-related-acute-lung-injury-trali/abstract/14,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">14,15</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H1588938\" class=\"local\">'Recipient risk factors'</a> below.) </p><p>Importantly, the incidence of TRALI has decreased dramatically following the institution of TRALI mitigation strategies for transfused plasma and platelet components that were instituted in the mid to late 2000s. (See <a href=\"#H15\" class=\"local\">'Prevention'</a> below.)</p><p>As an illustration of this, TRALI cases were identified using a prospective systematic method at a rate of 0.0081 percent (ie, 1 in 12,345) in the year 2009 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transfusion-related-acute-lung-injury-trali/abstract/16,17\" class=\"abstract_t\">16,17</a>]. This was substantially lower than the incidence rate of 0.0257 percent (ie, 1 in 3891) in the year 2006, determined with the same case detection strategies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transfusion-related-acute-lung-injury-trali/abstract/16,17\" class=\"abstract_t\">16,17</a>]. Even though case surveillance in this study was active and prospective, under-reporting still may have occurred, as has been the case with other published estimates [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transfusion-related-acute-lung-injury-trali/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. </p><p>TRALI is the leading cause of transfusion-related mortality in the United States [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transfusion-related-acute-lung-injury-trali/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].

However, evidence from large hemovigilance networks suggests higher mortality rates in the range of 13 to 21 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transfusion-related-acute-lung-injury-trali/abstract/9,19-21\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,19-21</a>]. A prospective study reported a mortality rate of 17 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transfusion-related-acute-lung-injury-trali/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. Not surprisingly, the mortality rate for <span class=\"nowrap\">TRALI/possible</span> TRALI in critically ill populations appears substantially higher, in the range of 35 to 58 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transfusion-related-acute-lung-injury-trali/abstract/14,15,22\" class=\"abstract_t\">14,15,22</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1588910\"><span class=\"h1\">RISK FACTORS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Specific risk factors for TRALI can be divided conceptually into recipient risk factors and blood component risk factors.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1588938\"><span class=\"h2\">Recipient risk factors</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>TRALI has been reported to occur in essentially all age groups and equally in both sexes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transfusion-related-acute-lung-injury-trali/abstract/23-25\" class=\"abstract_t\">23-25</a>]. The presence of an underlying condition such as recent surgery, cytokine treatment, massive blood transfusion, and active infection have been implicated in some, but not all, studies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transfusion-related-acute-lung-injury-trali/abstract/5,19,20,24,26-31\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,19,20,24,26-31</a>].

In another study evaluating critically ill patients in a medical ICU, sepsis, liver disease, and a history of alcohol abuse were more common in transfusion recipients who developed <span class=\"nowrap\">TRALI/possible</span> TRALI than in transfused controls without respiratory compromise [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transfusion-related-acute-lung-injury-trali/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. A Medicare database review (over 11 million patients, 2556 with a TRALI diagnosis code) identified modestly higher rates of TRALI in recipients of platelet or plasma-containing products rather than red blood cells; females versus males; whites versus non-whites; and individuals with postinflammatory pulmonary fibrosis, smoking, or other medical illnesses in the prior six months [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transfusion-related-acute-lung-injury-trali/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]. Many of these recipient factors (chronic alcohol abuse, smoking, shock prior to transfusion, positive fluid balance prior to transfusion) were confirmed to be associated with possible TRALI in a subsequent nested case-control study specifically evaluating risk factors for possible <span class=\"nowrap\">TRALI/transfused</span> ARDS [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transfusion-related-acute-lung-injury-trali/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H17014590\"><span class=\"h2\">Blood component risk factors</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Virtually all blood components have been associated with TRALI.

The volume of plasma passively infused that results in TRALI is unknown, but may be as small as 10 to 20 mL [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transfusion-related-acute-lung-injury-trali/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>]. Further studies have demonstrated a role for female sex and increased parity of the donor in the risk for TRALI [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transfusion-related-acute-lung-injury-trali/abstract/17,41-43\" class=\"abstract_t\">17,41-43</a>].

In aggregate, the available evidence suggests that the duration of red blood cell storage is not a major risk factor in the development <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> severity of TRALI. </p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">PATHOGENESIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The generally accepted theory for TRALI pathogenesis is that it occurs via a <strong>two-hit</strong> mechanism [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transfusion-related-acute-lung-injury-trali/abstract/5,50,51\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,50,51</a>]. </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Neutrophil sequestration and priming</strong> &ndash; The first hit involves neutrophil sequestration and priming in the lung microvasculature, due to recipient factors such as endothelial injury. Priming refers to shifting of neutrophils to a state where they will respond to an otherwise innocuous or weak signal [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transfusion-related-acute-lung-injury-trali/abstract/52\" class=\"abstract_t\">52</a>]. Endothelial cells are thought to be responsible for both the neutrophil sequestration (through adhesion molecules) and priming (through cytokine release). Generally these events are coupled and exist prior to the transfusion, although there may be circumstances in which they can occur as a result of the transfusion. (See <a href=\"#H1588938\" class=\"local\">'Recipient risk factors'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Neutrophil activation</strong> &ndash; The second hit is<strong> </strong>activation of recipient neutrophils by a factor in the blood product. Activation is associated with the release from neutrophils of cytokines, reactive oxygen species, oxidases, and proteases that damage the pulmonary capillary endothelium. This damage causes inflammatory (non-hydrostatic) pulmonary edema. Transfused factors responsible for host neutrophil activation can include antibodies in the blood component directed against recipient antigens, or soluble factors such as bioactive lipids that can activate neutrophils. Donor anti-leukocyte antibodies can bind to antigens on recipient neutrophils or possibly to other cells such as monocytes or pulmonary endothelial cells; this is referred to by some authors as immune TRALI [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transfusion-related-acute-lung-injury-trali/abstract/53-57\" class=\"abstract_t\">53-57</a>]. Bioactive lipids and other soluble factors in the transfused blood component can act as biological response modifiers (BRMs); TRALI resulting from these non-antibody BRMs is sometimes referred to as non-immune TRALI [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transfusion-related-acute-lung-injury-trali/abstract/51\" class=\"abstract_t\">51</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H17014590\" class=\"local\">'Blood component risk factors'</a> above.)</p><p/><p>Clinical observations supporting the two-hit theory come from retrospective studies demonstrating that most transfused blood products containing HLA antibody do not cause TRALI, even if a cognate recipient antigen is present [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transfusion-related-acute-lung-injury-trali/abstract/58\" class=\"abstract_t\">58</a>]. In retrospective studies, TRALI was detected in only 2.9 percent of individuals who received blood products from donors previously implicated in causing TRALI [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transfusion-related-acute-lung-injury-trali/abstract/44,58-61\" class=\"abstract_t\">44,58-61</a>]. </p><p>In one case of fatal TRALI, the implicated donor was a multiparous female who had made 290 previous plasma apheresis donations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transfusion-related-acute-lung-injury-trali/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. Of 36 patients who had received her plasma in the prior two years, 15 experienced transfusion reactions with pulmonary symptoms, and 21 (58 percent) did not, again highlighting that factors from the transfusion alone are insufficient to cause TRALI. In this case, the donor had antibodies against a leukocyte antigen (HNA-3a) present in more than 95 percent of the general population that has been associated with severe often fatal TRALI cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transfusion-related-acute-lung-injury-trali/abstract/62\" class=\"abstract_t\">62</a>]. In another case, TRALI occurred in a recipient of a single lung transplant only in the transplanted lung, and one of the blood products the donor received contained anti-HLA Class I antibodies that matched an HLA antigen present only in the transplanted lung [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transfusion-related-acute-lung-injury-trali/abstract/63\" class=\"abstract_t\">63</a>].</p><p>The proportion of TRALI caused by antibodies versus BRMs remains undetermined and is likely to vary by the type of component transfused, with antibody-mediated mechanisms explaining the majority of the cases due to plasma, and non-immune BRMs responsible for most cases from red blood cell transfusion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transfusion-related-acute-lung-injury-trali/abstract/20,64,65\" class=\"abstract_t\">20,64,65</a>]. The widely stated statistic that 80 to 85 percent of TRALI cases are due to the antibody-mediated mechanism is likely influenced by publication bias [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transfusion-related-acute-lung-injury-trali/abstract/66\" class=\"abstract_t\">66</a>]. Of note, a case series comparing BRM-mediated TRALI with antibody-mediated TRALI suggests that BRM-mediated TRALI is a less severe condition [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transfusion-related-acute-lung-injury-trali/abstract/51\" class=\"abstract_t\">51</a>].</p><p>A second model related to the two-hit theory is the threshold model. This model agrees that two hits are usually necessary for TRALI, but allows for the possibility that in some cases the second hit is so strong that an initial priming event is not required [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transfusion-related-acute-lung-injury-trali/abstract/51,67-69\" class=\"abstract_t\">51,67-69</a>]. This theory explains TRALI cases that have occurred in otherwise healthy individuals who have received fresh frozen plasma (FFP) as a treatment for reversing <a href=\"topic.htm?path=warfarin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">warfarin</a> anticoagulation.</p><p>Several observations support the role of neutrophils as the major effector cells in TRALI. Neutrophil activation occurs in animal models of TRALI [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transfusion-related-acute-lung-injury-trali/abstract/70-75\" class=\"abstract_t\">70-75</a>]. Transient neutropenia indicative of pulmonary sequestration has been seen in patients in the early phase of TRALI, whereas TRALI is rarely seen in neutropenic patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transfusion-related-acute-lung-injury-trali/abstract/44,76-80\" class=\"abstract_t\">44,76-80</a>]. In an autopsy case, postmortem examination within two hours of TRALI onset revealed aggregates of neutrophils within the pulmonary capillaries associated with inflammatory edema and endothelial injury [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transfusion-related-acute-lung-injury-trali/abstract/81\" class=\"abstract_t\">81</a>].</p><p>Multiple mechanisms of neutrophil activation in TRALI have been proposed. As an example, antibodies to human leukocyte antigen (HLA) Class I and human neutrophil antigens (HNA) may bind to recipient neutrophils and trigger their activation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transfusion-related-acute-lung-injury-trali/abstract/67,68,82,83\" class=\"abstract_t\">67,68,82,83</a>]. It has been known for years that female donors, due to exposure to fetal alloantigens during pregnancy, have a much higher prevalence of anti-HLA antibodies than do male donors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transfusion-related-acute-lung-injury-trali/abstract/84,85\" class=\"abstract_t\">84,85</a>]. While anti-HNA antibodies account for only a small percentage of TRALI cases from most countries (&lt;5 percent), in Germany these constitute a higher percentage (28 percent in one series) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transfusion-related-acute-lung-injury-trali/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. Antibodies directed against the HNA 3a antigen have been associated with a substantial number of severe or fatal TRALI cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transfusion-related-acute-lung-injury-trali/abstract/86,87\" class=\"abstract_t\">86,87</a>]. </p><p>TRALI can also be associated with donor antibodies directed against HLA Class II, which is primarily expressed on antigen-presenting cells [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transfusion-related-acute-lung-injury-trali/abstract/52,68\" class=\"abstract_t\">52,68</a>]. These antibodies may bind to HLA Class II antigens on monocytes, causing release of cytokines that in turn activate primed neutrophils [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transfusion-related-acute-lung-injury-trali/abstract/83,88-90\" class=\"abstract_t\">83,88-90</a>]. </p><p>When the second hit for neutrophil activation is a BRM rather than an antibody, the BRM is believed to activate neutrophils directly. Most of the work implicating these substances has come from in vitro and animal studies, and has implicated lysophosphatidylcholines (from white blood cells and platelets), neutral lipids (from the breakdown of red cell membranes), ceramide, and soluble CD40 ligand (which accumulates in stored platelet concentrates) in neutrophil activation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transfusion-related-acute-lung-injury-trali/abstract/5,27,50,73,74,91-94\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,27,50,73,74,91-94</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL PRESENTATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The characteristic clinical presentation of TRALI is the sudden onset of hypoxemic respiratory insufficiency during or shortly after the transfusion of a blood product (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F64212\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef64212 \">table 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transfusion-related-acute-lung-injury-trali/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>].

As an example, in a retrospective study of 49 TRALI cases, the most common signs and symptoms and their approximate frequencies were as follows [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transfusion-related-acute-lung-injury-trali/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]: &#160; </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Hypoxemia: in an intubated patient this could manifest as a change in oxygenation or increased oxygen requirements (100 percent, by definition) </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pulmonary infiltrates on chest radiography (100 percent, by definition; the cardiac silhouette is classically normal)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>If previously intubated, pink frothy airway secretions from the endotracheal tube (56 percent)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Fever (33 percent)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Hypotension (32 percent)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Cyanosis (25 percent)</p><p/><p>Other reports have also noted tachypnea, tachycardia, and elevated peak and plateau airway pressures in intubated patients.

TRALI is a clinical diagnosis made using the criteria outlined by the NHLBI&rsquo;s working group on TRALI as well as the Canadian Consensus Conference on TRALI (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F64212\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef64212 \">table 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transfusion-related-acute-lung-injury-trali/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>]. These criteria require the presence of <strong>new</strong> acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) occurring during or within six hours after blood product administration, documented by hypoxemia and an abnormal chest radiograph. Hypoxemia is documented when oxygen saturation is &le;90 percent on room air or the <span class=\"nowrap\">PaO2/FIO2</span> ratio is &lt;300 mmHg, although other signs of hypoxia can also satisfy this criterion. Frontal chest radiograph must demonstrate bilateral pulmonary infiltrates. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=noncardiogenic-pulmonary-edema#H3\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Noncardiogenic pulmonary edema&quot;, section on 'Definition of noncardiogenic pulmonary edema'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acute-respiratory-distress-syndrome-clinical-features-and-diagnosis-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Acute respiratory distress syndrome: Clinical features and diagnosis in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p>When a clear temporal relationship to an alternative risk factor for ARDS coexists, a formal diagnosis of TRALI cannot be made. In these circumstances, &quot;possible TRALI&quot; or the more recently endorsed &quot;transfused ARDS&quot; is the more appropriate diagnosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transfusion-related-acute-lung-injury-trali/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Use of these separate diagnostic categories (ie, TRALI and possible <span class=\"nowrap\">TRALI/transfused</span> ARDS) allows for their separate reporting in surveillance systems, which may facilitate differential approaches to donor investigation and management, as well as targeting research programs to either (or both) groups of patients. (See <a href=\"#H1592582\" class=\"local\">'Differential diagnosis'</a> below.)</p><p>When TRALI is suspected, the treating physician should evaluate the recipient&rsquo;s vital signs, assess the extent of hypoxemia, and obtain a chest radiograph. Pulse oximetry is often sufficient, but arterial blood gas analysis may be warranted in more severe cases. Consideration of the likelihood of other potential causes for the respiratory distress (eg, cardiovascular compromise, anaphylaxis, sepsis, exacerbation of underlying lung disease or atelectasis) should guide appropriate clinician-initiated laboratory testing. (See <a href=\"#H1592582\" class=\"local\">'Differential diagnosis'</a> below.)</p><p>When a transfusion reaction such as TRALI is suspected, the transfusion should be stopped immediately and the case should be promptly reported to the hospital transfusion medicine <span class=\"nowrap\">service/blood</span> bank. Based on the details of the case, the blood bank will initiate a transfusion reaction workup, which will usually include drawing a sample from the patient for appropriate laboratory tests. These may include complete blood count, bilirubin, haptoglobin, direct antiglobulin (Coombs) test, brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) or N-terminal (NT)-Pro-BNP, and HLA antigen typing. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=natriuretic-peptide-measurement-in-heart-failure\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Natriuretic peptide measurement in heart failure&quot;</a>.)</p><p>If TRALI is suspected, the blood bank will compile a list of blood products transfused within the previous six hours and forward this list to the blood supplier. The blood supplier will then follow its procedures to recall these donors and initiate testing for HLA and possibly HNA antibodies. However, these results will not be available for several weeks. If a donor with an HLA or HNA antibody that matches a cognate antigen in the recipient is identified, some authors have proposed further classifying the case as &quot;TRALI, antibody-mediated&quot; [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transfusion-related-acute-lung-injury-trali/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Identifying the implicated donor(s) and deferring that individual from future high plasma volume donation requires cooperation between the clinician (to provide accurate clinical information), the hospital transfusion medicine service, and the blood supplier. (See <a href=\"#H15\" class=\"local\">'Prevention'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1592582\"><span class=\"h1\">DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The differential diagnosis of TRALI includes other conditions that can manifest with respiratory distress following transfusion. This includes other causes of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) as well as other transfusion reactions. These conditions are described in more detail in the following sections. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H17314495\"><span class=\"h2\">Possible TRALI/Transfused ARDS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A formal diagnosis of TRALI requires the absence of temporal relationships with additional risk factors for ARDS, such as aspiration, pneumonia, sepsis, toxic inhalation, lung contusion, trauma, burn injury, or pancreatitis. A diagnosis of TRALI cannot be made when clinical criteria for TRALI are met but additional risk factors for ARDS are also present (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F64212\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef64212 \">table 1</a>). In these circumstances, the terms &quot;possible TRALI&quot; or &quot;TRALI with other ALI risk factors&quot; have previously been used. More recently, the term &quot;transfused ARDS&quot; has been proposed (but not universally accepted), based in part upon observations that clinical outcomes in this group of patients tend to resemble those in non-transfused patients with ARDS. In addition, studies suggest that in this setting, recipient factors may be more closely associated with the development of lung injury than factors directly related to the blood component(s) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transfusion-related-acute-lung-injury-trali/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].</p><p>Although massive transfusion has historically been recognized as a risk factor for ARDS, a diagnosis of TRALI should be made in this circumstance provided that no other ARDS risk factors were present. In a prospective series of 145 consecutive patients with possible <span class=\"nowrap\">TRALI/transfused</span> ARDS, recipient risk factors for ARDS were more frequent than were transfusion factors, suggesting that in many cases of possible <span class=\"nowrap\">TRALI/transfused</span> ARDS, the transfusion may be incidental to the clinical syndrome [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transfusion-related-acute-lung-injury-trali/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H17314533\"><span class=\"h2\">TACO</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Transfusion-associated circulatory overload (TACO) is another cause of transfusion-related respiratory insufficiency. Though it is most commonly reported in elderly patients and small children, TACO can occur in all age ranges. Additional risk factors for TACO include compromised cardiac function, positive fluid balance, renal dysfunction, emergency surgery, and rapid blood product administration [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transfusion-related-acute-lung-injury-trali/abstract/97\" class=\"abstract_t\">97</a>]. TACO appears to occur more frequently in surgical or intensive care settings, where large fluid volumes and blood are administered. Characteristic features and differentiating factors for TRALI versus TACO are shown in the table (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F86939\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef86939 \">table 2</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transfusion-related-acute-lung-injury-trali/abstract/98\" class=\"abstract_t\">98</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=transfusion-associated-circulatory-overload-taco\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Transfusion-associated circulatory overload (TACO)&quot;</a>.)</p><p>As a general rule, TRALI is more likely to be associated with fever, hypotension, and exudative pulmonary infiltrates, and less likely to respond to diuresis. In contrast, TACO is more likely to be associated with findings suggesting volume overload (eg, positive fluid balance, elevated jugular venous pressure, elevated pulmonary artery occlusion pressure) or poor cardiac function (eg, history of congestive heart failure, reduced left ventricular ejection fraction, or diastolic dysfunction). Similarly, elevated systolic blood pressures near the time of dyspnea onset, a widened pulmonary vascular pedicle width or increased cardiothoracic ratio on chest radiography, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> increased circulating levels of brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) or N-terminal (NT)-Pro-BNP suggest a diagnosis of TACO rather than TRALI [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transfusion-related-acute-lung-injury-trali/abstract/99-105\" class=\"abstract_t\">99-105</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=natriuretic-peptide-measurement-in-heart-failure\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Natriuretic peptide measurement in heart failure&quot;</a>.) </p><p>Differentiating TRALI from TACO can be a significant challenge, particularly as both may coexist [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transfusion-related-acute-lung-injury-trali/abstract/99,106,107\" class=\"abstract_t\">99,106,107</a>]. In such cases, pulmonary findings may be due to a combination of hydrostatic (eg, TACO) and non-hydrostatic (eg, TRALI) lung edema. Indeed, studies show that approximately 30 percent of ARDS patients have at least mild evidence of left atrial hypertension [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transfusion-related-acute-lung-injury-trali/abstract/108\" class=\"abstract_t\">108</a>]. In these circumstances, ARDS is diagnosed in the presence of fluid overload based on clinical judgment that the degree of fluid overload is not sufficient to explain the extent of hypoxemia and pulmonary infiltrates. This type of mixed picture may be more likely to occur in intensive care unit (ICU) patients.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13037582\"><span class=\"h2\">Other causes of ARDS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>ARDS may be present prior to the initiation of transfusion therapies or may arise more than six hours after a transfusion episode. In these cases, ARDS is the more appropriate diagnosis. Of note, a consensus conference has recommended eliminating the term ALI, which has historically described lung injury with less severe hypoxemia (ie, PaO<sub>2</sub><span class=\"nowrap\">/FiO<sub>2</sub></span> &lt;300 but &gt;200). Rather, it is now recommended that such cases be classified as &quot;mild ARDS&quot; [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transfusion-related-acute-lung-injury-trali/abstract/109\" class=\"abstract_t\">109</a>]. In such cases, it is recognized that the administration of blood products may in fact contribute to ARDS development even though a formal diagnosis of TRALI cannot be made.

Hemolytic reactions are typically due to ABO incompatibility, and pink serum or hemoglobinuria may be seen due to intravascular hemolysis. The direct antiglobulin (Coombs) test will be positive in hemolytic reactions, but not in TRALI. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hemolytic-transfusion-reactions#H354742\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Hemolytic transfusion reactions&quot;, section on 'Acute hemolytic reactions'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Anaphylaxis</strong> &ndash; Anaphylaxis can cause respiratory distress similar to TRALI, but anaphylaxis is more often associated with airway signs and symptoms such as stridor, cough, wheezing, nasal congestion, and bronchospasm. Anaphylaxis is also more often associated with a new rash, gastrointestinal symptoms such as nausea <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> vomiting, and shock. Notably, however, the latter may be seen in TRALI as well. The cause of most transfusion-associated anaphylactic reactions is unknown, but one recognized etiology is transfusion of IgA-containing products to an IgA deficient recipient who has antibodies to IgA.

Evidence for an active infectious process (leukocytosis, fever, positive microbiology) suggests the diagnosis of sepsis or septic shock rather than TRALI. Transfusion-associated sepsis is generally associated with the administration of bacterially contaminated platelets. In this case, evaluation of the transfusion by the blood bank will typically identify a contaminating microorganism.

(See <a href=\"#H9\" class=\"local\">'Diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p>Management of the patient with either TRALI or possible <span class=\"nowrap\">TRALI/transfused</span> ARDS is supportive, with oxygen supplementation for the correction of hypoxemia being the cornerstone of treatment. Non-invasive respiratory support with continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) or bilevel positive airway pressure (BiPAP) may be sufficient in less severe cases, but endotracheal intubation with invasive mechanical ventilation is often required [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transfusion-related-acute-lung-injury-trali/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. The available evidence suggests that most patients who develop either TRALI or possible <span class=\"nowrap\">TRALI/transfused</span> ARDS will require ventilatory support (approximately 70 to 80 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transfusion-related-acute-lung-injury-trali/abstract/6,14,15,110\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,14,15,110</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11655890\"><span class=\"h2\">Ventilation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There have been no prospective clinical investigations on strategies for managing mechanical ventilation in patients with TRALI, and it is generally believed that ventilator management should be guided by the same principles used in patients with other forms of ARDS [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transfusion-related-acute-lung-injury-trali/abstract/111\" class=\"abstract_t\">111</a>]. The successful application of more extreme life support interventions, such as extracorporeal membrane oxygenation, has also been described in TRALI [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transfusion-related-acute-lung-injury-trali/abstract/112\" class=\"abstract_t\">112</a>].

The initial goal of hemodynamic management is to ensure adequate end-organ perfusion. This may be achieved with fluid resuscitation <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> vasoactive support. Caution should be taken with early empiric administration of diuretic therapy, as it may result in hypotension in those who were initially hemodynamically stable [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transfusion-related-acute-lung-injury-trali/abstract/18,114\" class=\"abstract_t\">18,114</a>].

However, the efficacy of corticosteroids has not been tested in prospective clinical studies, and the limited anecdotal evidence is unconvincing. Thus, we do not recommend the routine use of corticosteroids when TRALI is suspected. Moreover, due to evidence suggesting harm when initiating corticosteroids late in the course of ARDS (&gt;14 days after syndrome onset) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transfusion-related-acute-lung-injury-trali/abstract/18,114,118\" class=\"abstract_t\">18,114,118</a>], we advise against the use of corticosteroid therapy when the lung injury is fully established and has been present for more than two weeks.

Importantly, however, individuals should <strong>not </strong>receive plasma-containing blood products from the implicated donor [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transfusion-related-acute-lung-injury-trali/abstract/121-124\" class=\"abstract_t\">121-124</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H17314915\"><span class=\"h1\">PROGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Initial descriptions detailing the clinical course for TRALI suggested quick resolution of hypoxemia, generally within 24 to 48 hours of symptom onset [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transfusion-related-acute-lung-injury-trali/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. However, the majority of patients who develop TRALI will require ICU admission and ventilator support [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transfusion-related-acute-lung-injury-trali/abstract/14,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">14,15</a>]. For those requiring mechanical ventilation, these early reports described a mean duration of ventilatory support lasting approximately 40 hours [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transfusion-related-acute-lung-injury-trali/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. In contrast, subsequent evidence suggests that most cases will require respiratory support for a longer period (eg, approximately 3 to 10 days) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transfusion-related-acute-lung-injury-trali/abstract/14,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">14,15</a>]. These more contemporary data frequently report composite outcomes from cases of TRALI and possible <span class=\"nowrap\">TRALI/transfused</span> ARDS and limit the study population to the critically ill. Such cases are likely to represent the more severe end of the clinical spectrum. In contrast, milder cases of TRALI <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> possible <span class=\"nowrap\">TRALI/transfused</span> ARDS may go undiagnosed or unreported.

In reality, the number of donors investigated may be more limited and the laboratory work-up performed by transfusion services may vary depending upon the number of donors in a case; the availability of donor samples; the availability of neutrophil antibody testing, which is restricted to a few specialty laboratories in the US; and the availability of a recipient sample for HLA antigen typing [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transfusion-related-acute-lung-injury-trali/abstract/1,127,128\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,127,128</a>].

Furthermore, most blood banks will defer an implicated donor from any type of blood donation; this is particularly true if the donor has anti-HNA 3a [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transfusion-related-acute-lung-injury-trali/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p>In addition, several general blood donor management strategies are in use to reduce the incidence of TRALI [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transfusion-related-acute-lung-injury-trali/abstract/1,9,39,127,129-141\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,9,39,127,129-141</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Adherence to current guidelines of blood component utilization, especially for plasma, to decrease recipient exposure to transfused units.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Deferral of donors implicated in a TRALI reaction.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For high plasma volume components (eg, FFP, plasma frozen within 24 hours of phlebotomy [FP-24], plasma, cryo-reduced [cryo-poor] plasma, apheresis platelets, buffy coat derived platelet pools resuspended in plasma from a single donor, and whole blood), selection of donors who are less likely to be alloimmunized to leukocytes.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Use of pooled solvent detergent plasma as an alternative to FFP.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Testing of parous apheresis donors of platelets or plasma for anti-HLA antibodies.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11655925\"><span class=\"h2\">Deferral of multiparous female donors</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>It has been well established that donors implicated in TRALI cases are more likely to be female and more likely to be multiparous [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transfusion-related-acute-lung-injury-trali/abstract/17,42,43\" class=\"abstract_t\">17,42,43</a>]. These factors resulted in the implementation of TRALI risk mitigation policies during the mid to late 2000s throughout most of Europe and the United States, in which transfusable plasma units were predominantly obtained from male donors, thereby avoiding the transfusion of plasma units from female donors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transfusion-related-acute-lung-injury-trali/abstract/9,12,132-134,142\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,12,132-134,142</a>]. This policy is feasible for plasma transfusion because the number of plasma units derived from whole blood or apheresis collections is in excess of demand. In contrast, this policy is not feasible for apheresis platelet transfusion where restriction of units to male donors would seriously jeopardize the platelet supply.</p><p>The importance of these policies is illustrated by a large multicenter study conducted under the auspices of the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI) Retrovirology and Donor Epidemiology Program II (REDS-II) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transfusion-related-acute-lung-injury-trali/abstract/140\" class=\"abstract_t\">140</a>]. This study, known as the Leukocyte Antibody Prevalence Study (LAPS), used modern flow cytometry techniques to assess the prevalence of HLA antibodies in almost 8000 volunteer blood donors. There was a dose-response increase in the frequency of anti-HLA antibodies according to parity, from 1.7 percent for never pregnant females to 32.2 percent for four or more pregnancies. Donors who themselves had received a blood transfusion, males, and never pregnant female donors all showed very low frequency of anti-HLA antibodies (in the range of 1 to 2 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transfusion-related-acute-lung-injury-trali/abstract/140,143\" class=\"abstract_t\">140,143</a>]. These data suggest that TRALI risk mitigation programs do not need to exclude plasma from never pregnant females or from donors with a previous transfusion history [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transfusion-related-acute-lung-injury-trali/abstract/134\" class=\"abstract_t\">134</a>].

In the three years prior to introduction of the sex-based TRALI risk reduction policies, plasma accounted for 48 percent of the fatal cases reported to Food and Drug Administration (FDA), compared with 27 percent in the four years following their implementation (2008 to 2011). Similarly, cases of suspected TRALI from plasma reported to<sup> </sup>the American Red Cross National Hemovigilance Program decreased from a rate of approximately 20 probable TRALI cases per million plasma components in 2006 to approximately four per million plasma components in 2008.

In contrast, the TRALI incidence rate from FFP transfusion was 1 in 31,000 units. The absence of TRALI following transfusion of <span class=\"nowrap\">S/D</span> plasma has been attributed to the pooling of plasma from many different donors, resulting either in dilution of anti-HLA antibodies or in binding of such antibodies by soluble HLA antigens [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transfusion-related-acute-lung-injury-trali/abstract/135,137\" class=\"abstract_t\">135,137</a>].

It is the leading cause of transfusion-related mortality in the United States. (See <a href=\"#H17314915\" class=\"local\">'Prognosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>TRALI can be seen following transfusion of any type of blood component in any patient. Historically, the blood components most likely to cause TRALI were those with a high concentration of donor plasma (due to antibodies to human leukocyte and human neutrophil antigens). Risk mitigation strategies have dramatically reduced the risk of plasma-associated TRALI, and currently the majority of TRALI cases are associated with transfusion of red blood cells (RBC). (See <a href=\"#H1588903\" class=\"local\">'Epidemiology'</a> above and <a href=\"#H15\" class=\"local\">'Prevention'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A &quot;two-hit&quot; hypothesis for the pathogenesis of TRALI holds that recipient neutrophils are primed for activation by virtue of the patient's underlying clinical condition. The second hit involves activation of these neutrophils by pre-formed anti-leukocyte antibodies or biological response modifiers contained in the transfused product. In rare cases, the transfused product may provide both hits. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Pathogenesis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The characteristic clinical presentation of TRALI is the sudden onset of hypoxemic respiratory insufficiency during or shortly after the transfusion of a blood product. Patients with TRALI often have frothy airway secretions (if intubated), fever, cyanosis, and hypotension. When TRALI is suspected, the treating physician should stop the transfusion, evaluate the recipient's vital signs, assess the extent of hypoxemia, and obtain a chest radiograph. (See <a href=\"#H8\" class=\"local\">'Clinical presentation'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>TRALI is a clinical diagnosis. It should be considered whenever a patient develops hypoxemic respiratory distress during or within six hours after transfusion of any blood product. The criteria set forth by the United States National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute and the Canadian Consensus Conference panels should be considered sufficient to establish the diagnosis of TRALI (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F64212\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef64212 \">table 1</a>). These criteria require the presence of <strong>new</strong> acute lung injury <span class=\"nowrap\">(ALI)/acute</span> respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) occurring during or within six hours after blood product administration. (See <a href=\"#H9\" class=\"local\">'Diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The differential diagnosis of TRALI includes other conditions that can manifest with respiratory distress following transfusion. This includes other causes of ARDS as well as other transfusion reactions. The distinction between TRALI and TACO is important for proper management (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F86939\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef86939 \">table 2</a>). Since a confirmed diagnosis of TRALI has implications for blood suppliers, the terms &quot;possible TRALI&quot; or &quot;transfused ARDS&quot; should be used for patients who meet clinical criteria for TRALI but have additional risk factors for ARDS. (See <a href=\"#H1592582\" class=\"local\">'Differential diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Management of the patient with TRALI includes immediate discontinuation of the transfusion and reporting to the blood bank that TRALI is suspected. Therapy is supportive with supplemental oxygen and ventilatory support with lung protective strategies when clinically indicated. Although the risk for mortality is significant, patients who survive a TRALI episode are generally expected to recover completely. (See <a href=\"#H11\" class=\"local\">'Treatment'</a> above and <a href=\"#H17314915\" class=\"local\">'Prognosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Prevention of TRALI involves deferring donors implicated in a case of TRALI from future platelet apheresis, plasma apheresis, and possibly also whole blood donation. Donations from multiparous women are most likely to contain anti-leukocyte antibodies. Most developed countries have adopted a policy of supplying transfusable plasma products (plasma, platelets, and whole blood) exclusively or predominantly from male donors, female donors with no prior pregnancy, or from donors who test negative for HLA-antibodies.
