A study published in 2012 reported that recipients managed with glucocorticoids experienced a 2.9 percent bone loss at the spine over the first six months after kidney transplantation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bone-disease-after-renal-transplantation/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Following an initial period of rapid bone loss, bone loss may continue at a slower rate or stabilize. One longitudinal study of 70 renal transplant recipients published in 1996 reported a mean rate of bone loss of 1.7 percent per year over a mean time of 8.1 years after transplantation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bone-disease-after-renal-transplantation/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. However, more contemporary studies suggest that after the first posttransplant year, on average, bone density remains stable [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bone-disease-after-renal-transplantation/abstract/5-9\" class=\"abstract_t\">5-9</a>].</p><p>Bone loss is principally due to a reduction in trabecular bone mass, although cortical bone may also be affected [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bone-disease-after-renal-transplantation/abstract/1,2,10-14\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2,10-14</a>]. Fractures can occur in either peripheral or central locations, although some evidence suggests that peripheral fractures (involving hands, ankles, and feet) may be more common [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bone-disease-after-renal-transplantation/abstract/15-17\" class=\"abstract_t\">15-17</a>].</p><p>Bone loss after renal transplantation is primarily related to the use of glucocorticoids and other immunosuppressive medications [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bone-disease-after-renal-transplantation/abstract/1,2,5,10,11,18-20\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2,5,10,11,18-20</a>] but may also reflect changes associated with prior renal osteodystrophy. Other risk factors include hyperparathyroidism, diabetes mellitus, posttransplant metabolic acidosis, and receiving a <span class=\"nowrap\">kidney/pancreas</span> transplant [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bone-disease-after-renal-transplantation/abstract/1,13,21-23\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,13,21-23</a>]. Persistent hyperparathyroidism may contribute to the higher fracture risk in renal transplant recipients compared with other solid organ recipients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bone-disease-after-renal-transplantation/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=persistent-hyperparathyroidism-after-renal-transplantation\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Persistent hyperparathyroidism after renal transplantation&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Additional risk factors include those present in the general population, including low testosterone levels in males (which may be induced by glucocorticoids and uremia), genetic predisposition (eg, white race, small body habitus, positive family history), lifestyle factors (eg, smoking and lack of exercise), and impaired nutrition due, for example, to low dietary calcium intake or excess alcohol ingestion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bone-disease-after-renal-transplantation/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. As in nontransplant patients, the use of proton pump inhibitors has also been associated with an increased risk of hip fracture among renal transplant recipients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bone-disease-after-renal-transplantation/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>].

Glucocorticoids are directly toxic to osteoblasts and lead to increased osteoclast activity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bone-disease-after-renal-transplantation/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. Glucocorticoids also have other effects that promote negative calcium balance and osteoporosis. These effects include decreased calcium absorption in the gut, reduced gonadal hormone production, diminished insulin-like growth factor 1 production, decreased sensitivity to parathyroid hormone (PTH), increased activity of nuclear factor kappa-beta ligand (RANKL), and increased osteoclastogenesis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bone-disease-after-renal-transplantation/abstract/1,21,28\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,21,28</a>]. The lower rates of bone loss following kidney transplantation documented in recent years may reflect the lower doses of glucocorticoids used to treat these patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bone-disease-after-renal-transplantation/abstract/3,11,13,18\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,11,13,18</a>].

Osteoporosis increases the risk of fractures. (See <a href=\"#H794446939\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Bone loss occurs rapidly following kidney transplantation and is primarily related to the use of glucocorticoids and other immunosuppressive medications. Other risk factors include hyperparathyroidism, diabetes mellitus, metabolic acidosis, and receiving a <span class=\"nowrap\">kidney/pancreas</span> transplant. (See <a href=\"#H25305084\" class=\"local\">'Pathogenesis and risk factors'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We screen all renal transplant candidates for osteoporosis and fracture risk prior to transplantation. We use dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry (DXA) to assess bone mineral density (BMD) of the hip, spine, and forearm. In addition, we measure serum parathyroid hormone (PTH) and 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels, obtain imaging of the thoracic and lumbar spine to assess for existing vertebral fractures, and assess for the presence of traditional and posttransplant risk factors for fracture. (See <a href=\"#H4202106985\" class=\"local\">'Our approach to screening and monitoring renal transplant candidates'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">At two to four weeks after transplantation, or when renal allograft function stabilizes, we measure serum calcium, phosphate, PTH, and 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels. In addition, we obtain fasting morning serum concentrations of bone turnover markers (BTMs), including C-telopeptide crosslink (CTX) and bone-specific alkaline phosphatase. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Based upon our initial pre- and posttransplant evaluations, we consider the following patients to be at <strong>high</strong> risk of incident fracture: patients with a history of pretransplant low-trauma fracture or radiologic evidence of vertebral fracture; patients with osteoporosis; and patients with osteopenia who have one or more clinical risk factors for fracture <strong>or</strong> will receive glucocorticoids as part of their maintenance immunosuppression regimen.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>In patients who are determined to be at high risk of incident fracture, we monitor DXA annually in order to assess the stability of BMD and the response to treatment</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>In patients who are <strong>not</strong> determined to be at high risk of incident fracture, we rescreen by DXA every two years and use preventive measures</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The optimal approach to the prevention of bone loss and fractures among renal transplant recipients is unknown. Among <strong>all</strong> transplant recipients who have a normal BMD or osteopenia, we encourage lifestyle changes, maintain the lowest possible glucocorticoid dose, and treat persistent hyperparathyroidism. Provided that serum calcium is normal, we treat with calcium and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=vitamin-d3-cholecalciferol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">vitamin D3</a>. (See <a href=\"#H3876243803\" class=\"local\">'Our approach to the prevention of osteoporosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Among transplant recipients with osteopenia who are considered to be at <strong>high</strong> risk for incident fracture, some, but not all, contributors to this topic would treat with additional prophylactic therapies (including bisphosphonates, active vitamin D analogs, and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=teriparatide-recombinant-human-parathyroid-hormone-1-34-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">teriparatide</a>), guided by a posttransplant assessment of bone turnover biomarkers. (See <a href=\"#H163752480\" class=\"local\">'Bisphosphonates'</a> above and <a href=\"#H3756452397\" class=\"local\">'Active vitamin D analogs'</a> above and <a href=\"#H4253293914\" class=\"local\">'Teriparatide'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Among transplant patients with osteopenia who are <strong>not</strong> considered to be at high risk for incident fracture <strong>and</strong> have evidence of normal or high bone turnover, some, but not all, contributors to this topic would treat with an active vitamin D analog.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">However, other authors and editors of this topic do <strong>not </strong>use bisphosphonates or active vitamin D analogs to prevent bone loss in renal transplant recipients, regardless of their fracture risk, until renal osteodystrophy has been optimally managed and persistent hyperparathyroidism (if present) has been treated. This approach allows the remodeling bone sufficient time to reach a new steady state before an antiresorptive agent is administered. Both of these approaches are based upon the clinical experience of the contributors, and there is little high-quality evidence to support one approach over the other. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The treatment of patients who are diagnosed with osteoporosis prior to or at the time of transplantation is the same as that of nontransplant candidate chronic kidney disease (CKD) patients with osteoporosis. (See <a href=\"#H3868385457\" class=\"local\">'Patients with osteoporosis before transplantation'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The optimal approach to transplant recipients who develop osteoporosis after transplantation (&gt;12 months posttransplant) is not known. Our approach is based upon our clinical experience rather than upon well-designed, randomized trials among transplant recipients. (See <a href=\"#H2699340355\" class=\"local\">'Patients with osteoporosis after transplantation'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Among all transplant recipients who have evidence of osteoporosis and are not hypercalcemic, we administer calcium and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=vitamin-d3-cholecalciferol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">vitamin D3</a>. We use the lowest possible dose of glucocorticoids to prevent rejection. We treat persistent hyperparathyroidism and severe hypophosphatemia before considering additional medical therapies for osteoporosis. We repeat bone density testing 12 months after treating hyperparathyroidism and severe hypophosphatemia.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Patients who have low BMD and no evidence of hyperparathyroidism and hypophosphatemia may require additional medical therapy with antiresorptive therapies. We select patients for treatment with antiresorptive therapies based upon our assessment of the risk of low bone turnover (adynamic bone disease), using a combination of serum PTH and bone alkaline phosphatase. If low-turnover bone disease cannot be excluded by PTH and bone alkaline phosphatase, a bone biopsy may be necessary. (See <a href=\"#H527219872\" class=\"local\">'Role of bone biopsy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Among patients who have low-turnover bone disease excluded (by biochemical testing or bone biopsy), we give a bisphosphonate. <a href=\"topic.htm?path=alendronate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Alendronate</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=risedronate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">risedronate</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ibandronate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ibandronate</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pamidronate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">pamidronate</a>, and zoledronate have all been used in clinical trials in renal transplant recipients. <a href=\"topic.htm?path=denosumab-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Denosumab</a> is an alternative option for patients with osteoporosis and low glomerular filtration rate (GFR) who cannot receive bisphosphonates or for those who have not responded to vitamin D or bisphosphonate therapy. The selection of an optimal agent and initial doses is the same for transplant recipients as for CKD patients with a comparable GFR.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Osteonecrosis (avascular or ischemic necrosis) is probably the most debilitating of the musculoskeletal complications following transplantation. Factors that contribute to osteonecrosis include defects in mineral metabolism (induced by uremia and immunosuppressive medications) and glucocorticoids. Osteopenia and preexisting hyperparathyroidism may also contribute. (See <a href=\"#H1821612876\" class=\"local\">'Osteonecrosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In addition to osteopenia and osteonecrosis, a different bone pain syndrome has been described in patients receiving <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cyclosporine-ciclosporin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cyclosporine</a> (and, perhaps, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tacrolimus-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">tacrolimus</a>) and is often temporally related to increased plasma cyclosporine levels.
