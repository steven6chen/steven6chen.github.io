Patients with <em>S. aureus</em> bacteremia can develop a broad array of complications that may be difficult to recognize initially and can increase morbidity. Mortality rates of 20 to 40 percent have been described [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-approach-to-staphylococcus-aureus-bacteremia-in-adults/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>]. Mortality appears to be higher with methicillin-resistant (MRSA) compared with methicillin-sensitive <em>S. aureus</em> (MSSA) bacteremia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-approach-to-staphylococcus-aureus-bacteremia-in-adults/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>].</p><p>Treatment failure (ie, death within 30 days following treatment, persistent bacteremia &gt;10 days after initiation of appropriate therapy, or recurrence of bacteremia within 60 days of discontinuing therapy) is fairly common in patients with <em>S. aureus</em> bacteremia, particularly in the setting of infection due to MRSA [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-approach-to-staphylococcus-aureus-bacteremia-in-adults/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].</p><p>Issues related to the clinical approach to <em>S. aureus</em> bacteremia in adults will be reviewed here. Issues related to clinical manifestations of <em>S. aureus</em> infection are discussed separately. The epidemiology, risk factors, and complications of <em>S. aureus</em> bacteremia and treatment of methicillin-resistant or vancomycin-resistant <em>S. aureus</em> infections are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-of-staphylococcus-aureus-infection-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations of Staphylococcus aureus infection in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H21662697\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL APPROACH</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The clinical approach to <em>S. aureus</em> bacteremia consists of careful history and physical examination, infectious disease consultation, and diagnostic evaluation including echocardiography and additional imaging as needed.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H21662703\"><span class=\"h2\">History and physical examination</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A careful history and physical examination is essential. For circumstances in which the source of bacteremia is uncertain, patients should be questioned carefully regarding potential portals of entry including recent skin or soft tissue infection and presence of indwelling prosthetic devices (including intravascular catheters, orthopedic hardware, and cardiac devices).</p><p>Patients should also be questioned regarding symptoms that may reflect metastatic infection, which can occur in up to 30 percent of cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-approach-to-staphylococcus-aureus-bacteremia-in-adults/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. These include bone or joint pain (particularly back pain, suggesting vertebral osteomyelitis, discitis, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> epidural abscess), protracted fever <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> sweats (suggestive of endocarditis), abdominal pain (particularly left upper quadrant pain, which may reflect splenic infarction), costovertebral angle tenderness (which may reflect renal infarction or psoas abscess), and headache (which may reflect septic emboli).</p><p>The physical examination should include careful cardiac examination for signs of new regurgitant murmurs or heart failure. A vigorous search should be undertaken for the clinical stigmata of endocarditis, including evidence of small and large emboli with special attention to the fundi, conjunctivae, skin, and digits. A neurologic evaluation should be undertaken for evidence of focal neurologic impairment; it is also important as a baseline examination should neurologic deficits develop later. These issues are discussed further separately.

Metastatic seeding may occur within the first few days of hospitalization, although in some cases it may not come to clinical attention for several weeks. In several case series, only 39 percent of 133 patients with bacteremic <em>S. aureus</em> vertebral osteomyelitis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-approach-to-staphylococcus-aureus-bacteremia-in-adults/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>] and 57 percent of 35 patients with epidural abscess [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-approach-to-staphylococcus-aureus-bacteremia-in-adults/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>] had a diagnosis on admission related to the spine. Failure to identify such complications of <em>S. aureus </em>bacteremia may lead to catastrophic complications (eg, death, paralysis) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-approach-to-staphylococcus-aureus-bacteremia-in-adults/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>] or relapsing bacteremia due to inadequate treatment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-approach-to-staphylococcus-aureus-bacteremia-in-adults/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H21662710\"><span class=\"h2\">Infectious disease consultation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Bedside infectious disease consultation is an important component of management for patients with <em>S. aureus</em> bacteremia and should occur whenever feasible [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-approach-to-staphylococcus-aureus-bacteremia-in-adults/abstract/9-17\" class=\"abstract_t\">9-17</a>]. In one retrospective study comparing bedside consultation with telephone consultation for management of 342 patients with <em>S. aureus</em> bacteremia, bedside consultation was associated with a significantly lower 90-day mortality (9 versus 29 percent; odds ratio [OR] 0.25; 95% CI 0.13-0.51) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-approach-to-staphylococcus-aureus-bacteremia-in-adults/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. Another study noted that, even among patients treated with an appropriate duration of therapy, significantly fewer relapses were observed among those who received bedside consultation (6 versus 18 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-approach-to-staphylococcus-aureus-bacteremia-in-adults/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>].</p><p>Several other studies have also demonstrated that bedside consultation by an infectious diseases specialist is associated with better outcomes including fewer deaths, fewer relapses, and lower readmission rates than telephone consultation or no consultation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-approach-to-staphylococcus-aureus-bacteremia-in-adults/abstract/12-14\" class=\"abstract_t\">12-14</a>]. These findings underscore the importance of serial examinations evaluating for metastatic infection <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> clues to the source of bacteremia.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12011336\"><span class=\"h2\">Diagnostic evaluation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In general, blood cultures positive for <em>S. aureus</em> should be respected as a clinically significant finding that should prompt clinical evaluation and initiation of empiric therapy. All patients with <em>S. aureus</em> bacteremia should undergo echocardiography to evaluate for presence of endocarditis. Additional diagnostic imaging should be tailored to findings on history and physical examination.

Transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) should be performed first [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-approach-to-staphylococcus-aureus-bacteremia-in-adults/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]; identification of a vegetation on TTE usually obviates the need for transesophageal echocardiography (TEE), although TTE is not sufficient for ruling out infective endocarditis (IE) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-approach-to-staphylococcus-aureus-bacteremia-in-adults/abstract/20,21\" class=\"abstract_t\">20,21</a>]. The results of echocardiography are useful even when the study is negative, as the absence of IE may impact decisions about the duration of antimicrobial therapy. In one series including 103 patients with <em>S. aureus</em> bacteremia, the diagnosis of endocarditis was established by TTE and TEE in 7 versus 25 percent of cases, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-approach-to-staphylococcus-aureus-bacteremia-in-adults/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>].</p><p>The indications for TEE in patients with <em>S. aureus</em> bacteremia and no evidence of vegetation on TTE are controversial. TEE is substantially more sensitive than TTE for identification of valvular vegetation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-approach-to-staphylococcus-aureus-bacteremia-in-adults/abstract/21,23-25\" class=\"abstract_t\">21,23-25</a>]; it is most sensitive when performed five to seven days after the onset of bacteremia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-approach-to-staphylococcus-aureus-bacteremia-in-adults/abstract/26,27\" class=\"abstract_t\">26,27</a>]. In the setting of high clinical suspicion for IE and a negative echocardiogram, a repeat study is warranted. However, TEE has associated costs and risks.

Empiric treatment consists of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=vancomycin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">vancomycin</a> (15 to 20 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg/dose</span> every 8 to 12 hours, not to exceed 2 g per dose); <a href=\"topic.htm?path=daptomycin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">daptomycin</a> (6 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> intravenously once daily) is an acceptable alternative agent.

There are data suggesting that administration of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=vancomycin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">vancomycin</a> monotherapy with deescalation to a beta-lactam agent may result in worse outcomes than empiric treatment for both MRSA and MSSA among patients with the highest risk of morbidity and mortality from <em>S. aureus</em> infections [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-approach-to-staphylococcus-aureus-bacteremia-in-adults/abstract/35,38,39\" class=\"abstract_t\">35,38,39</a>], including patients with severe sepsis, probable endocarditis, or presence of a prosthetic or intravascular device [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-approach-to-staphylococcus-aureus-bacteremia-in-adults/abstract/35,40\" class=\"abstract_t\">35,40</a>]. However, a retrospective study including more than 5000 patients with MSSA bacteremia who received empiric monotherapy with a beta-lactam or vancomycin noted no difference in all-cause 30-day mortality, even though there was a significantly better outcome for the same cohort of patients who received definitive therapy with a beta-lactam from day 4 to 14 of treatment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-approach-to-staphylococcus-aureus-bacteremia-in-adults/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>].

(See <a href=\"#H21662697\" class=\"local\">'Clinical approach'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients should be questioned regarding potential portals of entry, presence of indwelling prosthetic devices, and symptoms that may reflect metastatic infection. These include bone or joint pain (particularly back pain, suggesting vertebral osteomyelitis, discitis, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> epidural abscess) and protracted fever <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> sweats (suggestive of endocarditis). (See <a href=\"#H21662703\" class=\"local\">'History and physical examination'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The physical examination should include cardiac examination for signs of new murmurs or heart failure. A search should be undertaken for clinical stigmata of endocarditis, including evidence of small and large emboli. Serial bedside examinations are critical for detection of complications that may develop after initial evaluation and during the course of treatment. (See <a href=\"#H21662703\" class=\"local\">'History and physical examination'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We recommend bedside infectious disease consultation for management of patients with <em>S. aureus</em> bacteremia (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=2\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1B</a>); this is a critical component of management for patients with <em>S. aureus</em> bacteremia and is associated with better outcomes including fewer deaths, fewer relapses, and lower readmission rates. (See <a href=\"#H21662710\" class=\"local\">'Infectious disease consultation'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In general, blood cultures positive for <em>S. aureus</em> should be respected as a clinically significant finding that should prompt clinical evaluation and initiation of empiric therapy. All patients with <em>S. aureus</em> bacteremia should undergo echocardiography to evaluate for presence of endocarditis. Additional diagnostic imaging should be tailored to findings on history and physical examination. (See <a href=\"#H12011336\" class=\"local\">'Diagnostic evaluation'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In the setting of blood cultures with gram-positive cocci prior to availability of culture and susceptibility data, we suggest administration of empiric antimicrobial therapy with activity against methicillin resistant <em>S. aureus </em>(MRSA; rather than empiric therapy with activity against both MRSA and methicillin-susceptible <em>S. aureus </em>[MSSA]) (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=5\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2B</a>).

(See <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Methicillin-susceptible S. aureus (MSSA)'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We recommend <strong>NOT</strong> combining low-dose aminoglycosides with antistaphylococcal penicillins or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=vancomycin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">vancomycin</a> for treatment of <em>S. aureus</em> bacteremia (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=2\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1B</a>).
