It is also useful for monitoring the efficacy of treatment and permits the definitive diagnosis of tumors.</p><p>A liver biopsy is usually performed after a thorough, noninvasive clinical evaluation in patients with chronically (greater than six months) elevated liver biochemical tests. The pertinent clinical information should be made available to the pathologist so that the histopathological findings can be interpreted in the appropriate clinical context [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/interpretation-of-liver-biopsy-specimens/abstract/1-3\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-3</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=approach-to-the-patient-with-abnormal-liver-biochemical-and-function-tests\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Approach to the patient with abnormal liver biochemical and function tests&quot;</a>.)</p><p>This topic review will focus on the interpretation of liver biopsy specimens. The examples presented show typical histologic features of each disease entity. Methods to obtain a liver biopsy and histologic scoring systems for chronic liver disease are described elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=approach-to-liver-biopsy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Approach to liver biopsy&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=transjugular-liver-biopsy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Transjugular liver biopsy&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=histologic-scoring-systems-for-chronic-liver-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Histologic scoring systems for chronic liver disease&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1763618055\"><span class=\"h1\">SEGMENTAL ANATOMY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The liver can be divided into right and left lobes, each of which has its own blood supply. The right lobe comprises 50 to 70 percent of the liver mass (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F81897\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef81897 \">figure 1</a>). The liver can be further subdivided into eight segments based upon the segmental hepatic arterial supply and distribution. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1763618062\"><span class=\"h1\">LOBULE AND ACINAR MODELS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Two conceptual models have been proposed relating to the architecture of the hepatic parenchyma. Terminal portal veins and hepatic venules interdigitate between sinusoids. The &quot;lobule&quot; model considers the terminal hepatic venules, which are also known as the central <span class=\"nowrap\">vein/venules,</span> to be the center of the hepatic microcirculation. Thus, this area is known as the centrilobular zone, whereas in the &quot;acinar&quot; model (also known as the Rappaport classification) is considered to represent the periphery of the acinus (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F59968\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef59968 \">figure 2</a>). </p><p>An appealing feature of the acinar model is that the blood supply to an area of hepatic parenchyma and the bile duct draining it are all located in one &quot;portal triad.&quot; The acinus consists of a cluster of hepatocytes (approximately 2 mm in diameter) that are grouped around terminal branches of a hepatic arteriole and portal venule. Blood from a branch of the portal vein and hepatic artery enter the acinus in the portal and periportal regions, flow through the hepatic sinusoids, and drain into a terminal hepatic venule.</p><p>The acinar model also defines areas or &quot;zones&quot; representing gradients where the nutrient and oxygen content of the hepatic microcirculation differ. The center of the acinus (periportal) is known as zone 1, the periphery (perivenular) as zone 3, and the region in between as zone 2 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/interpretation-of-liver-biopsy-specimens/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. Zone 1 receives blood with the highest levels of oxygen and nutrients compared with zone 3. Thus, zone 3 is particularly vulnerable to circulatory insults.</p><p>Hepatocytes within these zones are adapted to their micro-location. Zone 1 hepatocytes have high oxidative activities and contain many large mitochondria. Their dominant processes include gluconeogenesis, beta oxidation of fatty acids, amino acid catabolism, ureagenesis, cholesterol synthesis, and bile acid secretion. By contrast, zone 3 hepatocytes are more involved with glycolysis and lipogenesis.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H180144294\"><span class=\"h1\">PRINCIPLES OF EVALUATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>An initial step in evaluating a liver biopsy is a visual inspection of the adequacy of the sample and the type and quality of staining. A needle core liver biopsy samples only about <span class=\"nowrap\">1/50,000</span> of the liver and thus is always vulnerable to sampling variability. Nevertheless, it is generally agreed that the specimen should be at least 15 mm in length and contain six to eight complete portal tracts [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/interpretation-of-liver-biopsy-specimens/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. Longer specimens improve reliability of grading for fibrosis and histologic activity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/interpretation-of-liver-biopsy-specimens/abstract/4,6,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,6,7</a>].</p><p>Standard staining of specimens typically includes hematoxylin and eosin (H&amp;E) or Masson or Gomori trichrome stains. H&amp;E staining colors the nuclei of cells blue, while other structures appear as various hues of pink or red. The trichrome stain is useful for evaluating the amount of fibrous tissue and aids in the assessment of chronic liver injury. The connective tissue (ie, fibrosis or cirrhosis) appears as various shades of blue or purple. Poor staining can occur and can be recognized with experience. It can be appreciated even before looking at the slides under a microscope, and the adequacy of the specimen can generally be gauged by looking at the slide. Gross examination of the slides will also aid in evaluating not just the adequacy of the tissue, but also in determining the presence of fragmentation. The latter finding suggests advanced <span class=\"nowrap\">fibrosis/cirrhosis</span>.</p><p>Special staining may occasionally be performed when evaluating for specific disorders [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/interpretation-of-liver-biopsy-specimens/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. In some institutions, Perls' Prussian blue stain for presence of iron is routinely performed. Some of the histochemical stains used include periodic acid-Schiff with diastase digestion to confirm the presence of alpha-1 antitrypsin inclusions, oil red O staining performed on fresh frozen specimens in patients with suspected acute fatty liver of pregnancy or Reye syndrome, stains for copper (eg, rhodanine) in patients with suspected Wilson disease, and reticulin stains (for type III collagen) in patients in whom a detailed evaluation of the liver microarchitecture, hepatocyte necrosis, and regeneration are desired. Reticulin staining has become standard in some laboratories and is also utilized to assess collapse of the reticulin framework indicative of severe hepatocyte loss, as well as to diagnose idiopathic noncirrhotic portal hypertension.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1763618401\"><span class=\"h1\">HISTOLOGIC PATTERNS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The biopsy specimens described below are grouped, as much as possible, according to the pathophysiology of the underlying disease. </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The first section includes diseases that are characterized by damage to hepatocytes. These diseases are usually associated with greatly elevated levels of serum aminotransferases. Bilirubin levels may be elevated in patients who have extensive damage to hepatocytes. Included in this section are cases of acute viral hepatitis, chronic hepatitis C, fulminant hepatic failure due to drug toxicity, autoimmune hepatitis, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acetaminophen-paracetamol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">acetaminophen</a> toxicity, acute Budd-Chiari syndrome, and patients with left- and right-sided heart failure. (See <a href=\"#H278983613\" class=\"local\">'Hepatocellular injury'</a> below.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The next section includes patients with metabolic forms of liver disease and fatty liver and thus includes cases of hemochromatosis, alcoholic hepatitis and cirrhosis, and nonalcoholic fatty liver disease, in particular nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH). (See <a href=\"#H4622205\" class=\"local\">'Metabolic liver disease and fatty liver'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The third section includes patients who presented with a fever of unknown etiology in whom a percutaneous liver biopsy established the diagnosis. It also includes examples of hepatic malignancy. (See <a href=\"#H4622213\" class=\"local\">'Fever of unknown origin and malignancy'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The fourth section includes patients with cholestatic liver diseases, examples of which are bile duct obstruction secondary to choledocholithiasis, iatrogenic chronic bile duct obstruction after cholecystectomy, primary biliary cholangitis, and primary sclerosing cholangitis. (See <a href=\"#H4622221\" class=\"local\">'Cholestatic liver disease'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The fifth section is focused on the diagnosis of noncirrhotic portal hypertension, with particular emphasis on idiopathic noncirrhotic portal hypertension (previously referred to by many names, including nodular regenerative hyperplasia and obliterative portal venopathy). There has been increased awareness of this entity following a US Food and Drug Administration advisory regarding <a href=\"topic.htm?path=didanosine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">didanosine</a> use in HIV. Diagnosis is challenging on a liver biopsy, and clinical information regarding the presence of portal hypertension is often necessary for a definitive diagnosis. (See <a href=\"#H319644167\" class=\"local\">'Noncirrhotic portal hypertension'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The final section is a quiz. It presents brief case histories and diagnostic histologic finding that should allow a diagnosis to be made. (See <a href=\"#H3047697688\" class=\"local\">'A clinical and histologic quiz'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H278983621\"><span class=\"h1\">NORMAL LIVER BIOPSY</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1763618069\"><span class=\"h2\">Normal liver, low power</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A needle liver biopsy was obtained in a 45-year-old man being worked up for living liver donation for his 19-year-old son with a failed Kasai procedure (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F108833\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef108833 \">picture 1</a>).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1763618076\"><span class=\"h2\">Normal liver, high power</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A wedge liver biopsy was obtained from a 27-year-old woman during a sleeve gastrectomy for morbid obesity.

She developed nausea, anorexia, and jaundice. Her bilirubin level was 8.7 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> (149 <span class=\"nowrap\">micromol/L)</span> and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) 1100 international <span class=\"nowrap\">unit/L</span>. Her urologist planned surgery, assuming that her sudden worsening was caused by a renal cell carcinoma. However, a liver biopsy demonstrated acute lobular hepatitis, and surgery was canceled (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F93214\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef93214 \">picture 3</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F93215\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef93215 \">picture 4</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F93216\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef93216 \">picture 5</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F93217\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef93217 \">picture 6</a>).

A biopsy was performed to rule out an autoimmune hepatitis flare or EBV hepatitis and revealed drug-induced liver injury (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F108835\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef108835 \">picture 8</a>).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1763618104\"><span class=\"h2\">Acute viral hepatitis with very high ALT levels</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A 22-year-old nurse was seen by her doctor because of the onset of nausea, anorexia, right upper quadrant discomfort, and jaundice. She had cared for an eight-year-old boy who had died of acute hepatitis one month earlier. Her ALT was 7500 international <span class=\"nowrap\">unit/L,</span> her serum bilirubin was 10.3 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> (176 <span class=\"nowrap\">micromol/L),</span> and her international normalized ratio (INR) was 1.1. A liver biopsy was obtained and was consistent with severe acute hepatitis (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F93218\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef93218 \">picture 9</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F93219\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef93219 \">picture 10</a>). The patient made a rapid and uneventful recovery. </p><p>Although ALT levels are of little prognostic value in patients with acute hepatitis, very high levels often alarm clinicians. The only blood test that is of prognostic importance in patients with acute viral hepatitis is the INR. The normal INR in this patient made it highly unlikely that she would develop acute liver failure. One possible cause of the very high ALT level was that all of the liver cell necrosis occurred in a very short period of time, several days, rather than being spread over several weeks.

Her ALT was 680 international <span class=\"nowrap\">unit/L,</span> bilirubin 55 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> (941 <span class=\"nowrap\">micromol/L),</span> and INR 1.1. A percutaneous liver biopsy was done because of the very high bilirubin level (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F93220\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef93220 \">picture 11</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F110856\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef110856 \">image 1</a>). She initially denied having taken any drugs, medications, or herbal supplements. There were no signs of hemolysis, and her renal function was normal. Hemolysis and renal insufficiency may elevate serum bilirubin levels in jaundiced patients. The biopsy was consistent with acute cholestatic hepatitis. Upon further questioning, the patient admitted to taking herbal teas. She was advised to stop taking the tea immediately, and the patient made an uneventful recovery. As in the previous patient with a very high ALT level, the only blood test that is prognostically important is the INR.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1763618118\"><span class=\"h2\">Chronic hepatitis C virus infection</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A 21-year-old man with ongoing intravenous drug use was found to have persistently elevated levels of ALT, 50 to 100 international <span class=\"nowrap\">unit/L</span>. Serum bilirubin, albumin, and INR were normal. He was asymptomatic.

She recalled that she tired much more readily during the prior year and often went to bed after dinner and slept more than she used to. She had no other symptoms. Her ALT was 386 international <span class=\"nowrap\">unit/L,</span> and her serum bilirubin was 4.8 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> (82 <span class=\"nowrap\">micromol/L)</span>. Her INR, serum albumin, and alkaline phosphatase were normal. Tests for hepatitis A, B, and C were negative. A percutaneous liver biopsy showed stage 3 fibrosis on the METAVIR scale and presence of bridging necrosis (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F108836\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef108836 \">picture 14</a>). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=histologic-scoring-systems-for-chronic-liver-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Histologic scoring systems for chronic liver disease&quot;</a>.)</p><p>She was treated with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prednisone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">prednisone</a> and then with prednisone plus <a href=\"topic.htm?path=azathioprine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">azathioprine</a> for a presumptive diagnosis of autoimmune chronic hepatitis. The ALT decreased to the 100 international <span class=\"nowrap\">unit/L</span> range but never normalized, while her serum bilirubin stayed in the 2 to 3 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> (34 to 51 <span class=\"nowrap\">micromol/L)</span> range.

Convinced that he had terminal cancer of the pancreas and desiring a definitive diagnosis,<strong> </strong>he persuaded a surgeon to perform an exploratory laparotomy. The pancreas was normal, but his liver was beefy, red, and enlarged.

Supportive measures were continued, but her condition continued to worsen, and she died of liver failure. Her illness occurred 15 years before liver transplantation became available.</p><p>The clinical findings and liver biopsy findings, microvesicular fatty infiltration, were diagnostic of Reye syndrome (often called white liver disease because of the liver's color at autopsy). Although never proven with a prospective clinical trial, the disease was almost certainly caused by <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aspirin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">aspirin</a>'s effects on fat metabolism in a susceptible host. Because of the suspected relationship between aspirin and Reye syndrome, aspirin use was sharply curtailed in children, and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acetaminophen-paracetamol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">acetaminophen</a> was used in its place. This coincided with a virtual disappearance of Reye syndrome, and sadly, with an increased incidence of liver failure due to acetaminophen toxicity. Epidemiologic studies have demonstrated an almost perfect relationship between the cessation of aspirin use and a disappearance of Reye syndrome. Microvesicular fatty infiltration is caused by free fatty acids accumulating in the liver rather than neutral triglyceride. Free fatty acids are toxic to the liver, and neutral triglycerides are not. Microvesicular fatty infiltration can only be demonstrated on liver biopsy by staining fresh frozen specimens with special fat stains, such as oil red O. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acute-toxic-metabolic-encephalopathy-in-children#H3222085568\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Acute toxic-metabolic encephalopathy in children&quot;, section on 'Reye syndrome'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3047697710\"><span class=\"h2\">Case 3</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A 14-year-old girl was diagnosed with &quot;juvenile cirrhosis&quot; after she complained of abdominal swelling.

A liver biopsy was performed after her ascites had responded to treatment with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=furosemide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">furosemide</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=spironolactone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">spironolactone</a>. There were numerous periportal eosinophilic inclusion bodies in a cirrhotic liver that were seen best after periodic acid-Schiff staining (PAS) and diastase digestion (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F93342\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef93342 \">picture 103</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F93343\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef93343 \">picture 104</a>). </p><p>Immunohistologic staining indicated that the inclusions were alpha-1 antitrypsin (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F109597\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef109597 \">picture 105</a>). The patient had the Pizz genotype and had alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency. It is unclear why some patients with this genotype develop early onset emphysema, some cirrhosis, some both diseases, and some remain well. The emphysema is caused by digestion of elastin in the lung, particularly in heavy smokers. It is caused by the lack of alpha-1 antitrypsin that normally neutralizes elastase and trypsin, which are released by activated neutrophiles in the lung. The liver disease is caused by the toxic effects of alpha-1-antiptrypsin on hepatocytes. Affected hepatocytes synthesize alpha-1 antitrypsin but cannot secrete it normally because the protein is improperly folded. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-natural-history-of-alpha-1-antitrypsin-deficiency\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and natural history of alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3047697717\"><span class=\"h2\">Case 4</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A 58-year-old woman was found to have an enlarged firm liver that was felt 10 cm below the right costal margin and an enlarged spleen that was felt 2 cm below the left costal margin. The patient had a 14-year history of rheumatoid arthritis, which had led to marked deformities of her hands, wrists, ankles, elbows and shoulders. Blood tests were normal, except for an elevation of her serum alkaline phosphatase (523 international <span class=\"nowrap\">unit/L)</span> and a decreased serum albumin (2.8 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/dL</span> [28 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/L])</span>. A diagnostic biopsy was obtained (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F93345\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef93345 \">picture 106</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F93346\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef93346 \">picture 107</a>). </p><p>The biopsy was diagnostic of amyloid liver disease. The hepatocytes were compressed and distorted by amyloid deposits. It seemed remarkable that the patient's ALT, AST, and serum bilirubin levels remained normal in the face of such liver pathology. One of the clinicians caring for the patient, a trainee in liver disease at the time, had been reluctant to perform a liver biopsy because of his belief that the patient had amyloidosis, for which there was no treatment, and that she might bleed from the biopsy. The attending clinician was concerned that the patient might have metastatic liver disease and insisted that a biopsy be done. The patient bled six units after the biopsy and was treated conservatively with abdominal compression and blood transfusions. Review of the liver unit records indicated that there had been eight previous liver biopsies done in patients who had amyloid liver disease and that three had bled, suggesting that liver biopsy should be avoided in patients with suspected amyloid liver disease. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=gastrointestinal-amyloidosis-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-management\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Gastrointestinal amyloidosis: Clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and management&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3047697724\"><span class=\"h2\">Case 5</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A 35-year-old man was seen because of intermittent elevations of his total and direct bilirubin levels. These episodes tended to occur at the time of intercurrent upper respiratory infections. Bilirubin levels were as high as 5 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> (85.5 <span class=\"nowrap\">micromol/L)</span> during these episodes and then decreased to values that were slightly above normal. ALT, AST, and alkaline levels remained normal, and there was no pruritus that accompanied his clinical jaundice. A diagnostic liver biopsy was obtained (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F93347\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef93347 \">picture 108</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F93348\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef93348 \">picture 109</a>).</p><p>The biopsy was normal except for striking deposits of lipofuscin, a finding common in Dubin-Johnson syndrome, the patient's diagnosis. These deposits stain positively with PAS. Iron stains are negative. It can be difficult to distinguish lipofuscin from hemosiderin in liver biopsy specimens without special stains. However, iron granules are typically denser in periportal regions with a decreasing gradient towards the centrilobular zones, whereas lipofuscin is more concentrated in centrilobular zones. Lipofuscin deposits can be so dense that they darken the gross appearance of the liver. Because of this finding, the disorder was once called &quot;Black Liver Disease.&quot; (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=inherited-disorders-associated-with-conjugated-hyperbilirubinemia#H3\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Inherited disorders associated with conjugated hyperbilirubinemia&quot;, section on 'Dubin-Johnson syndrome'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3047697731\"><span class=\"h2\">Case 6</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A 59-year-old man was admitted to the hospital because of recurrent bleeding from esophageal varices. He had no history of liver disease. Physical examination was normal except for striking splenomegaly. All of his liver function tests were normal. A percutaneous liver biopsy was read as normal (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F70777\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef70777 \">picture 110</a>). The patient failed to respond to medical treatment, required daily blood transfusions, and was eventually taken to the operating room to have a portacaval shunt.</p><p>An experienced vascular surgeon noted that the patient's spleen was unusually large and pale. It looked quite different from the spleens of the many patients with cirrhosis on whom he had performed portacaval shunts. Because of this, he biopsied the spleen and awaited the results of the pathologist's examination of a frozen specimen. It was diagnostic of Gaucher's Disease. A splenectomy was performed instead of a portacaval shunt. The patient recovered fully and did not rebleed. Review of his earlier percutaneous liver biopsy found several typical Gaucher cells that had not been noticed. They had the characteristic crinkled tissue paper appearance caused by the accumulation of glucocerebroside in Kupffer cells and macrophages. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=gaucher-disease-pathogenesis-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Gaucher disease: Pathogenesis, clinical manifestations, and diagnosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3047697738\"><span class=\"h2\">Case 7</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A 29-year-old Puerto Rican woman had repeated hospital admissions because of bleeding from esophageal varices. Despite multiple bleeds and many blood transfusions, her liver function was well preserved, and she had never had an episode of hepatic encephalopathy. After this biopsy (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F109598\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef109598 \">picture 111</a>), she had a successful distal splenorenal shunt, recovered uneventfully, and has not rebled.</p><p>The biopsy is diagnostic of <em>Schistosoma mansoni</em>. A schistosome egg is seen at the center of a granuloma in a portal triad. Liver function is typically well preserved in this form of presinusoidal portal hypertension. Eggs are laid in the walls of the intestines, enter the portal vein, and are trapped in the small branches of the portal veins in the portal triads of the liver. The trapped eggs typically cause a granulomatous reaction, and eventually portal hypertension develops. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epidemiology-pathogenesis-and-clinical-manifestations-of-schistosomiasis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Epidemiology, pathogenesis, and clinical manifestations of schistosomiasis&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3047697745\"><span class=\"h2\">Case 8</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A 60-year-old man was admitted to the hospital in 1975 because of unexplained jaundice and a 25-pound weight loss. He recalled that he had avoided sun exposure from the time of adolescence because exposure to sunlight caused his skin to become red and pruritic. His serum bilirubin was 11.4 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> (194.9 <span class=\"nowrap\">micromol/L),</span> his alkaline phosphatase was 104 international <span class=\"nowrap\">unit/L,</span> his ALT was 140 international <span class=\"nowrap\">unit/L,</span> his AST was 204 international <span class=\"nowrap\">unit/L,</span> and his albumin was 2.3 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/dL</span> (23 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/L)</span>. A percutaneous liver biopsy was diagnostic. It showed cirrhosis with severe interface and parenchymal hepatitis and widespread liver cell necrosis (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F109599\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef109599 \">picture 112</a>). He failed to respond to supportive measures and eventually died of liver failure.</p><p>The biopsy findings are nonspecific. However, his history of avoiding sunlight because it caused his skin to redden and become pruritic was characteristic of erythropoietic protoporphyria. Examination of an H&amp;E-stained slide under polarized light demonstrated numerous red &quot;Maltese crosses&quot; (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F78587\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef78587 \">picture 113</a>). These are caused by the high concentrations of protoporphyrin within the liver and are thought to be pathognomonic of this disease. The finding of greatly elevated protoporphyrin levels in his red blood cells confirmed the diagnosis. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=erythropoietic-protoporphyria-and-x-linked-protoporphyria\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Erythropoietic protoporphyria and X-linked protoporphyria&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H24907691\"><span class=\"h1\">SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The histopathologic examination of the liver can provide otherwise unobtainable information regarding its structural integrity and the type and degree of injury <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> fibrosis that affect the liver.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The examples presented show typical histologic features of each disease entity. Methods to obtain a liver biopsy and histologic scoring systems for chronic liver disease are described elsewhere.

Terminal portal veins and hepatic venules interdigitate between sinusoids. The &quot;lobule&quot; model considers the terminal hepatic venules to be the center of the hepatic microcirculation, while the &quot;acinar&quot; model (also known as the Rappaport classification) considers it to represent the periphery (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F59968\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef59968 \">figure 2</a>). (See <a href=\"#H1763618062\" class=\"local\">'Lobule and acinar models'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">The acinar model also defines areas or &quot;zones&quot; representing gradients where the nutrient and oxygen content of the hepatic microcirculation differ. The center of the acinus (periportal) is known as zone 1, the periphery (perivenular) as zone 3, and the region in between as zone 2. Zone 1 receives blood with the highest levels of oxygen and nutrients compared with zone 3. Thus, zone 3 is particularly vulnerable to circulatory insults.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>An initial step in evaluating a liver biopsy is a visual inspection of the adequacy of the sample and the type and quality of staining.
