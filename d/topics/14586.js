Among those with rheumatic disease, optimal management can only be achieved if clinicians recognize relevant psychosocial factors and utilize psychosocial interventions that influence these factors. A review of the relationships between psychosocial factors and patient adaptation in three common rheumatologic disorders: rheumatoid arthritis (RA), osteoarthritis (OA), and fibromyalgia (FM), is presented in this topic review.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">NEGATIVE PSYCHOSOCIAL FACTORS ASSOCIATED WITH ADAPTATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The major psychosocial factors that negatively influence adaptation to chronic rheumatic diseases include depression and anxiety, history of abuse and psychiatric diagnoses, exposure to stressors, and disturbance in sleep patterns. It is generally agreed that patients' beliefs about their illnesses and coping strategies may aid adaptation to rheumatic disease. However, our understanding of these positive influences is relatively meager compared with knowledge about the negative psychosocial factors noted above. We will discuss the negative factors as well as two relatively positive psychosocial factors, ie, self-efficacy and optimism. We conclude by examining the effects of psychosocial interventions on adaptation among patients with rheumatic disease.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Depression and anxiety</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Depression and anxiety are negative psychological states that are frequently observed in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA), fibromyalgia (FM), osteoarthritis (OA), and ankylosing spondylitis (AS):</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The frequency of depression and anxiety disorders diagnosed among patients with RA ranges from 14 to 42 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/psychosocial-factors-and-rheumatic-disease/abstract/2-5\" class=\"abstract_t\">2-5</a>]. Among female patients with RA who committed suicide, 90 percent had a depressive disorder [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/psychosocial-factors-and-rheumatic-disease/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The frequency of lifetime diagnoses of major depression and anxiety disorders in patients with FM ranges from 26 to 71 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/psychosocial-factors-and-rheumatic-disease/abstract/7-9\" class=\"abstract_t\">7-9</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Significant levels of depression are found in 14 to 23 percent of patients with OA [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/psychosocial-factors-and-rheumatic-disease/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The prevalence of clinical anxiety or depression is also substantial in those with AS; among 110 such patients these psychologic disorders were present in 25 and 15 percent, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/psychosocial-factors-and-rheumatic-disease/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>].</p><p/><p>The prevalence of these psychological disorders is substantially greater in patients with these rheumatologic conditions than among the general population [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/psychosocial-factors-and-rheumatic-disease/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. This may reflect an interaction between stress engendered by rheumatic disease and an underlying genetic predisposition to anxiety or depression [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/psychosocial-factors-and-rheumatic-disease/abstract/13-16\" class=\"abstract_t\">13-16</a>].</p><p>It should not be surprising, then, that the presence of depression or anxiety is associated with relatively poor patient adaptation to stressors associated with chronic rheumatic disease. Patients with RA who experience depression report significantly higher levels of pain, greater number of painful joints, and poorer functional ability. In addition, patients with RA and depression spend significantly more days in bed than those who are not depressed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/psychosocial-factors-and-rheumatic-disease/abstract/17,18\" class=\"abstract_t\">17,18</a>]. Two independent longitudinal studies have shown that RA patients' scores on self-report measures of depression are significantly associated with a higher frequency of health care visits to physicians [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/psychosocial-factors-and-rheumatic-disease/abstract/17,19\" class=\"abstract_t\">17,19</a>]. In addition, the presence of clinically significant comorbid depression is associated with an increased mortality rate [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/psychosocial-factors-and-rheumatic-disease/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>].</p><p>Similar relationships are also observed among patients with OA. A one-year longitudinal study of health maintenance organization patients with OA found that self-reports of well-being were significantly associated with health care utilization rates, even after controlling for age and prior health care system usage [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/psychosocial-factors-and-rheumatic-disease/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. </p><p>Minority patients have relatively low (a) expectations of the pain-related outcomes of total joint arthroplasty and (b) willingness to consider undergoing this procedure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/psychosocial-factors-and-rheumatic-disease/abstract/22,23\" class=\"abstract_t\">22,23</a>].</p><p>FM frequently is referred to as a stress-related disorder. However there appear to be complex relationships among exposure to stressors, depressive symptoms, and pain that are not entirely consistent across investigations, as examples:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A 12-week longitudinal study showed that, among patients with FM and those with knee OA, increases in negative affect over one week are associated with increases in reports of pain intensity over subsequent weeks. Conversely, positive affects predict lower levels of pain in subsequent weeks [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/psychosocial-factors-and-rheumatic-disease/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. During weeks characterized by elevated levels of interpersonal stressors, patients with FM display steeper declines in positive affect than patients with knee OA [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/psychosocial-factors-and-rheumatic-disease/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. Patients with FM, compared with those with knee OA, also report greater increases in clinical pain intensity following both negative mood induction and exposure to stressors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/psychosocial-factors-and-rheumatic-disease/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. However, exposure to stressors does not enhance clinical pain among patients without negative mood. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Depressed mood may interfere with treatment response among patients with FM. This was illustrated by the finding that, even after controlling for variables such as sex, age, time since onset of symptoms, sleep disturbance, and fatigue; depressed mood at baseline continued to serve as a significant predictor of sustained widespread pain following treatment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/psychosocial-factors-and-rheumatic-disease/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>].</p><p/><p>These discrepant findings may be due to differences among the studies in methods used to assess exposure to stressors, depression, and pain (ie, physical examination and patient self-report versus telephone interview).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">History of psychiatric disorders</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>It was noted above that depressive symptoms are associated with poorer psychosocial adaptation among patients with RA and OA (see <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Depression and anxiety'</a> above). However, a history of major depressive disorder (MDD) is associated with poorer adaptation even among patients who are not currently depressed. For example, nondepressed patients with RA and a history of major depression, compared with those without prior depressive episodes, exhibit greater associations between increases in pain and impaired mood [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/psychosocial-factors-and-rheumatic-disease/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>].</p><p>There are complex relationships among psychiatric disorders and FM. Two studies have provided evidence of aggregation of MDD among first-degree relatives of women with FM [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/psychosocial-factors-and-rheumatic-disease/abstract/29,30\" class=\"abstract_t\">29,30</a>]. These findings suggest that FM and MDD may share family- or genetically-mediated risk factors. Indeed, a substantial proportion of patients with FM currently meet criteria for MDD or have a history of MDD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/psychosocial-factors-and-rheumatic-disease/abstract/7,31\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,31</a>]. However, a recent, community-based investigation revealed that women with FM, compared with those without FM, were characterized by higher rates of lifetime anxiety disorders (especially posttraumatic stress disorder and obsessive-compulsive disorder); these groups, however, did not differ with regard to lifetime history of MDD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/psychosocial-factors-and-rheumatic-disease/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>].</p><p>Regardless of the inconsistent findings produced by clinic-based and community-based investigations, it has been shown that a lifetime history of psychiatric disorders is an important determinant of health care-seeking behavior among persons with FM. A cross-sectional investigation using a structured psychiatric interview reliably differentiated patients with FM from both community residents with FM who had not sought treatment for their pain (nonpatients) and healthy community residents without FM (controls) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/psychosocial-factors-and-rheumatic-disease/abstract/7,31\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,31</a>]. The mean number of lifetime psychiatric diagnoses among patients with FM was nearly three times greater than those of the other two groups. Moreover, MDD and anxiety disorders were found most frequently among the patients with FM (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RHEUM%2F62023\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef62023 \">table 1</a>). Psychiatric morbidity did not distinguish non-patients from healthy controls.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Exposure to stressors</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Rheumatologic disorders produce numerous stressors that may influence patient adaptation to their disease. These include activity limitations and functional impairments in the home and workplace, financial hardships produced by loss of income and high health care costs, changes in physical appearance, and altered social relationships [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/psychosocial-factors-and-rheumatic-disease/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. In one study, approximately one-half of patients with RA reported dysfunction in social interaction, communication with others, and emotional behavior [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/psychosocial-factors-and-rheumatic-disease/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>]. Approximately 60 percent experienced at least one major psychosocial change related to family functioning, such as increased arguments with spouses, changes in the health of family members, and sexual dysfunction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/psychosocial-factors-and-rheumatic-disease/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>]. It has been consistently noted that criticism from spouses is associated with poorer psychological adjustment among RA patients, whereas strong marital relationships tend to modulate the association between stress and increases in disease activity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/psychosocial-factors-and-rheumatic-disease/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>].</p><p>Increases in daily stressors lead to increases in joint tenderness, global pain ratings, and altered immune system responses [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/psychosocial-factors-and-rheumatic-disease/abstract/35-38\" class=\"abstract_t\">35-38</a>]. Abnormalities in the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis are involved in the association between stress and disease activity in patients with RA [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/psychosocial-factors-and-rheumatic-disease/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>]. </p><p>Exposure to stressors also may lead to cognitive distortions associated with poor adaptation to rheumatic disease. One such distortion, &quot;learned helplessness,&quot; is characterized by emotional, motivational, and cognitive deficits in adaptive coping to stressful situations. These deficits arise because of the belief that no viable solutions are available to eliminate or reduce the underlying source of stress [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/psychosocial-factors-and-rheumatic-disease/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Learned helplessness</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The importance of helplessness beliefs in adaptation to rheumatologic disorders has been demonstrated in many studies. Increasing levels of helplessness are associated with high levels of pain, depression, and functional disability among patients with RA, both at baseline and over follow up periods of up to three years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/psychosocial-factors-and-rheumatic-disease/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>]. Baseline levels of helplessness also predict greater flare activity in patients with RA [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/psychosocial-factors-and-rheumatic-disease/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>]. High levels of helplessness may mediate the relationship between low formal education level and greater mortality in RA independent of demographic factors, clinical symptoms, and comorbid conditions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/psychosocial-factors-and-rheumatic-disease/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=disease-outcome-and-functional-capacity-in-rheumatoid-arthritis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Disease outcome and functional capacity in rheumatoid arthritis&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Abuse</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A history of sexual <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> physical abuse represents one stressor that may have a very strong influence on adaptation to rheumatic disease. In an early study, between 53 and 67 percent of rheumatology clinic patients with FM reported one or more incidents of sexual or physical abuse during childhood or adulthood [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/psychosocial-factors-and-rheumatic-disease/abstract/43\" class=\"abstract_t\">43</a>]. Patients with histories of abuse, in comparison with nonabused patients, reported significantly higher levels of pain and functional disability as well as significantly greater frequencies of physician visits for medical problems other than FM. The abused patients also reported using a significantly greater number of medications for pain than non-abused patients.</p><p>Among participants in a community-based study of women, individuals with FM, compared with those without FM, more frequently reported they had been raped and more frequently met classification criteria for posttraumatic stress disorder [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/psychosocial-factors-and-rheumatic-disease/abstract/44\" class=\"abstract_t\">44</a>]. However, these two groups of women did not differ in their reports of other forms of sexual or physical abuse. This investigation also revealed that women who reported they had been raped, compared with those who reported no history of sexual or physical abuse, were eight times more likely to report pelvic pain and 3.7 times more likely to report <span class=\"nowrap\">jaw/face</span> pain, even after controlling for the effect of widespread pain.</p><p>Nevertheless, women who reported forms of sexual or physical abuse other than rape were no more likely than those without histories of abuse to report pelvic pain or pain in any other body region (ie, <span class=\"nowrap\">jaw/face,</span> head, lower back) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/psychosocial-factors-and-rheumatic-disease/abstract/45\" class=\"abstract_t\">45</a>]. These findings suggest that, although various forms of sexual and physical abuse may be associated with greater health care seeking behavior among patients with FM, rape is most strongly associated persistent pain. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Sleep disturbance</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>High frequencies of sleep disturbances have been documented in patients with RA, FM, and OA possibly due to painful joints and surrounding soft tissues [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/psychosocial-factors-and-rheumatic-disease/abstract/46\" class=\"abstract_t\">46</a>]. The sleep disturbance observed in patients with FM has been the most thoroughly studied. These patients frequently show a specific anomaly of sleep brain wave patterns, namely an intrusion of alpha waves during non-REM delta (ie, slow wave) sleep [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/psychosocial-factors-and-rheumatic-disease/abstract/47\" class=\"abstract_t\">47</a>]. This &quot;alpha-delta&quot; sleep anomaly, which is associated with local tenderness, pain, and stiffness, may also be induced by emotionally arousing environmental events. In healthy persons, noise-induced disruption of non-REM delta sleep directly leads to the alpha-delta sleep anomaly as well as to onset of musculoskeletal pain and negative mood changes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/psychosocial-factors-and-rheumatic-disease/abstract/47\" class=\"abstract_t\">47</a>]. A return to undisturbed sleep in these healthy persons is followed by normalized sleep physiology and alleviation of symptoms. Thus, disturbed sleep may play a role in symptom production and amplification in FM but the precise physiologic mechanism underlying the relationship has not yet been identified.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h1\">PSYCHOSOCIAL FACTORS THAT MAY POSITIVELY INFLUENCE ADAPTATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There is considerable evidence that patients' beliefs about their abilities to control or influence their symptoms are associated with adaptation to rheumatologic disorders. The relationship between learned helplessness and poor adaptation has been discussed above (see <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'Learned helplessness'</a> above). Two relatively positive beliefs associated with adaptation to rheumatic disease and pain responses, ie, self-efficacy and optimism will be discussed below. These beliefs may influence patients' abilities to effectively use various coping strategies to reduce clinical symptoms and psychological distress.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h2\">Self-efficacy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Self-efficacy represents a belief that one can perform specific behaviors to achieve specific health-related goals. Whereas learned helplessness tends to represent a relatively consistent belief regarding a wide array of symptoms, an individual may vary with respect to self-efficacy beliefs concerning different behaviors. As an example, a patient with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) may have high self-efficacy for pacing her daily activities to reduce pain and fatigue, but may display low self-efficacy for performing water-based exercises to improve physical function [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/psychosocial-factors-and-rheumatic-disease/abstract/48\" class=\"abstract_t\">48</a>].</p><p>Increases in self-efficacy are associated with improvements in depression, pain, and disease activity among RA patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/psychosocial-factors-and-rheumatic-disease/abstract/49\" class=\"abstract_t\">49</a>]. Lower self-efficacy in patients with chronic painful disorders is associated with the presence of symptoms of depression, longer duration of pain, more widespread pain, and lack of employment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/psychosocial-factors-and-rheumatic-disease/abstract/50\" class=\"abstract_t\">50</a>].</p><p>Among patients with fibromyalgia (FM), high self-efficacy for pain is correlated with a high pain threshold and pain tolerance levels [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/psychosocial-factors-and-rheumatic-disease/abstract/51\" class=\"abstract_t\">51</a>]. It is associated with low frequencies of pain behavior.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h2\">Optimism</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Optimism represents a stable tendency to believe that one will experience good, rather than bad, outcomes across a wide array of situations in life [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/psychosocial-factors-and-rheumatic-disease/abstract/52\" class=\"abstract_t\">52</a>]. Among patients with disorders similar to FM, such as temporomandibular disorder, higher levels of optimism are associated with greater ischemic pain tolerance levels [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/psychosocial-factors-and-rheumatic-disease/abstract/53\" class=\"abstract_t\">53</a>].</p><p> Among patients with knee osteoarthritis (OA), high levels of optimism are an independent predictor of expectations of recovery from revision of total joint arthroplasty [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/psychosocial-factors-and-rheumatic-disease/abstract/54\" class=\"abstract_t\">54</a>]. The most frequently used measure of optimism is the Life Orientation Test or LOT [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/psychosocial-factors-and-rheumatic-disease/abstract/55\" class=\"abstract_t\">55</a>]. This 10-item measure is characterized by good internal and test-retest reliability as well as convergent and discriminative validity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/psychosocial-factors-and-rheumatic-disease/abstract/55,56\" class=\"abstract_t\">55,56</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h2\">Coping strategies</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Current psychosocial interventions for patients with rheumatologic disorders are designed to foster the development of high levels of self-efficacy for adaptive behaviors related to pain, affective distress, and function through training in and rehearsal of these behaviors in the patients' home, social, and work environments. Many of these adaptive behaviors may be considered as coping strategies.</p><p>Coping behaviors are defined as those activities that are performed to manage environmental and internal demands that tax or exceed a patient's resources [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/psychosocial-factors-and-rheumatic-disease/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. The coping process consists of several stages. These include the appraisal of the threat associated with a particular stressor, performing the adaptive behaviors or coping strategies that may control the effects of the stressor, evaluating the outcomes produced by these behaviors and, if necessary, performing alternative coping responses.</p><p>Coping strategies may be categorized as either direct action or palliative strategies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/psychosocial-factors-and-rheumatic-disease/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Direct action strategies consist of behaviors that contribute to the removal of the stressor whereas palliative strategies are responses that diminish the negative impact of the stressor. As an example, a patient with RA who experiences a flare in disease activity may seek treatment from her physician (direct action) or use relaxation or other cognitive distractors (palliative action) to better control the impact of pain associated with the flare.</p><p>Passive coping strategies, such as catastrophizing (eg, believing that if medication is not effective, no other remedy will effectively control pain and other symptoms) and escapist fantasies (eg, hoping that pain will get better someday) are correlated with high levels of pain and psychological distress in patients with RA, OA, and FM [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/psychosocial-factors-and-rheumatic-disease/abstract/57-59\" class=\"abstract_t\">57-59</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h2\">Acceptance</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Acceptance of chronic pain is a coping strategy that includes both direct action and passive components that may be particularly helpful to patients with FM. This strategy involves (a) acceptance that it is unlikely that <span class=\"nowrap\">medical/behavioral</span> treatments will completely eliminate one's pain; (b) acceptance of the need to shift one's attention from pain to non-pain aspects of life; and (c) such acceptance does not signify personal failure.</p><p>Indeed, acceptance of persistent pain may be necessary for individuals to stop searching for treatments that provide complete relief of pain and begin to adopt changes in their behavior that may help them to better manage persistent pain and improve their quality of life. A study of a small group of patients with fibromyalgia revealed that scores on a measure of pain acceptance [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/psychosocial-factors-and-rheumatic-disease/abstract/60\" class=\"abstract_t\">60</a>] was negatively associated with ratings of pain severity and catastrophizing and was positively associated with mental health scores on the SF-36 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/psychosocial-factors-and-rheumatic-disease/abstract/61\" class=\"abstract_t\">61</a>]. A subsequent study of patients with chronic pain revealed that higher levels of acceptance were associated with less attention to pain, greater engagement with daily activities, higher motivation to complete activities, and higher self-efficacy regarding performance of daily activities [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/psychosocial-factors-and-rheumatic-disease/abstract/62\" class=\"abstract_t\">62</a>].</p><p>The relationships between coping responses and brain function in patients with RA and FM have been studied in controlled laboratory conditions. Positron emission tomography and functional magnetic resonance imaging of functional brain activity reveal that healthy persons respond to acute pain evoked on one side of the body with increases in regional cerebral blood flow in the contralateral thalamus, anterior cingulate cortex, and the somatosensory cortex.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14\"><span class=\"h1\">PSYCHOSOCIAL INTERVENTIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Given the relationships that have been documented among adaptation, patients' beliefs, and coping strategies, several psychosocial interventions have been developed to try to improve health status. These therapies highlight the following three components:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patient education</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Coping skills training</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Relapse prevention</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15\"><span class=\"h2\">Education</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The primary purposes of the educational component are to present a credible rationale for the treatment intervention, to elicit the active collaboration of patients and spouses or other caregivers with the therapist, and to help patients and spouses begin to alter negative perceptions regarding their abilities to adapt to the consequences of their disease. During this phase of treatment, it is particularly important to encourage the patients and spouses to adopt the belief that they can learn the skills necessary to cope better with the patients' illness-related problems.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H16\"><span class=\"h2\">Coping skills training</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The purpose of the coping skills training component is to help patients and spouses engage actively in the process of learning new coping strategies (eg, relaxation, pacing of activity and rest periods during the day) and cognitions that will enhance self-efficacy, reduce perceptions of helplessness, and help them better manage disease-related problems. Patients and their spouses are encouraged to practice and consolidate their new cognitive and behavioral coping skills, and to apply these effectively in their home and work environments.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H17\"><span class=\"h2\">Relapse prevention</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients are encouraged to maintain use of their coping skills and treatment gains following termination of the intervention in order to prevent relapses. Typically, relapses occur when patients' symptoms begin to increase in intensity and their perceptions of control of symptoms are diminished [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/psychosocial-factors-and-rheumatic-disease/abstract/63\" class=\"abstract_t\">63</a>]. During these episodes, patients may experience psychological distress and show reduced or maladaptive strategies for coping with their symptoms. Training should include [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/psychosocial-factors-and-rheumatic-disease/abstract/63\" class=\"abstract_t\">63</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Identification of the early signs of relapse, such as increases in pain or depression</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Rehearsal of cognitive and behavioral skills for coping with these early relapse signs</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Provision of self-rewards for effective performance of coping responses to prevent potential relapse</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H18\"><span class=\"h1\">OUTCOMES PRODUCED BY PSYCHOSOCIAL INTERVENTIONS</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H19\"><span class=\"h2\">Rheumatoid arthritis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Most of the well-designed studies of psychosocial interventions for patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) have examined the effects of cognitive behavioral therapies on pain and other health status variables, relative to those produced by attention-placebo conditions and usual care [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/psychosocial-factors-and-rheumatic-disease/abstract/64-67\" class=\"abstract_t\">64-67</a>]. All of these interventions have emphasized training in relaxation and coping skills, such as stress management, avoidance of catastrophizing, and positive reinforcement of healthy behavior, to enhance perceptions of control or self-efficacy. These interventions, relative to attention-placebo, have produced statistically significant improvements in the following parameters:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Reductions in pain ratings or displays of pain behavior</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Reductions in joint counts</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Improvements in patients' ratings of helplessness or self-efficacy</p><p/><p>A National Institutes of Health panel described cognitive behavioral therapies as an effective treatment for arthritis pain [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/psychosocial-factors-and-rheumatic-disease/abstract/67\" class=\"abstract_t\">67</a>]. These improvements and a reduction in medical service costs may persist for 12 to 15 months after treatment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/psychosocial-factors-and-rheumatic-disease/abstract/66-68\" class=\"abstract_t\">66-68</a>]. However, these interventions do not reduce functional disability, such as the ability to perform daily physical activities. </p><p>Cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) can also improve psychological functioning. A randomized trial compared internet based CBT plus standard care with standard care alone in 133 patients with RA [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/psychosocial-factors-and-rheumatic-disease/abstract/69\" class=\"abstract_t\">69</a>]. CBT included weekly to biweekly email contact with a therapist and lasted an average of 26 weeks. Postintervention, patients were assessed for one year, during which symptoms of depression and anxiety improved more in patients who received CBT. &#160;</p><p>The use of educational interventions alone has little effect on pain [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/psychosocial-factors-and-rheumatic-disease/abstract/70\" class=\"abstract_t\">70</a>]. As an example, the use of telephone counseling failed to reduce pain or other symptoms of RA [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/psychosocial-factors-and-rheumatic-disease/abstract/71\" class=\"abstract_t\">71</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nonpharmacologic-therapies-and-preventive-measures-for-patients-with-rheumatoid-arthritis#H3\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Nonpharmacologic therapies and preventive measures for patients with rheumatoid arthritis&quot;, section on 'Patient education and counseling'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H20\"><span class=\"h2\">Osteoarthritis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Cognitive behavioral therapy interventions that emphasize coping skills training are well-established psychosocial treatments for patients with osteoarthritis (OA) of the knee; they produce positive effects independent of those observed following traditional medical management and patient education. As an example, cognitive behavioral therapy interventions reduced pain and psychological distress among patients with OA of the knee followed for six months [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/psychosocial-factors-and-rheumatic-disease/abstract/72,73\" class=\"abstract_t\">72,73</a>]. There also is evidence that the active participation of spouses in treatment protocols enhances patient outcomes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/psychosocial-factors-and-rheumatic-disease/abstract/74,75\" class=\"abstract_t\">74,75</a>]. In addition, exercise training combined with spouse-assisted, cognitive-behavioral therapy is required to produce improvements in patient function [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/psychosocial-factors-and-rheumatic-disease/abstract/75\" class=\"abstract_t\">75</a>].</p><p>The Arthritis Self-Management Program (ASMP) is a standardized intervention that is offered through a large number of local chapters of the Arthritis Foundation. It is designed to enhance patients' perceptions of self-efficacy for pain, disability, and other arthritis symptoms. Numerous studies have documented the efficacy of the ASMP, although it never has been compared with an attention-placebo control. One outcome study using the ASMP in patients with OA and RA found significant improvements in pain self-efficacy, pain ratings, arthritis-related physician visits, and medical costs, all of which persisted up to four years after treatment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/psychosocial-factors-and-rheumatic-disease/abstract/76\" class=\"abstract_t\">76</a>]. Telephone counseling interventions among patients with OA also result in a significant reduction in functional disability [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/psychosocial-factors-and-rheumatic-disease/abstract/77\" class=\"abstract_t\">77</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-moderate-to-severe-knee-osteoarthritis#H2178769028\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of moderate to severe knee osteoarthritis&quot;, section on 'Psychological interventions'</a>.)</p><p>A similar intervention, utilizing a cognitive behavioral therapeutic approach with physiotherapists serving as educators, was significantly more effective than usual care for Dutch patients with osteoarthritis of the hip or knee [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/psychosocial-factors-and-rheumatic-disease/abstract/78\" class=\"abstract_t\">78</a>]. This approach may be particularly useful for relative young (age 40 to 60 years) patients with arthritis.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H21\"><span class=\"h2\">Fibromyalgia</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Given the largely negative findings produced by randomized, attention-placebo controlled trials, cognitive behavioral therapy must be considered as an experimental therapy for the management of patients with fibromyalgia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/psychosocial-factors-and-rheumatic-disease/abstract/79,80\" class=\"abstract_t\">79,80</a>]. It should be noted that one study produced evidence that cognitive-behavioral therapy, compared with standard medical care, produced significant improvements in patents' reports of physical function on the SF-36 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/psychosocial-factors-and-rheumatic-disease/abstract/81\" class=\"abstract_t\">81</a>]. However, this investigation did not control for the nonspecific effects (eg, increased attention) associated with cognitive behavioral therapy. </p><p>Meditation may help patients with fibromyalgia. As an example, an eight-week randomized trial (n = 148 patients) compared meditation with CBT [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/psychosocial-factors-and-rheumatic-disease/abstract/82\" class=\"abstract_t\">82</a>]. Meditation consisted of weekly group meetings lasting two hours and daily self-practice of meditation; CBT consisted of weekly group sessions as well as homework between sessions. Improvement of fibromyalgia symptoms, pain, sleep, depression, anxiety, and ability to work (paid or voluntary) improved more with meditation than CBT. In addition, the benefits persisted at the six-month follow-up, and the average daily time spent meditating was associated with outcomes.</p><p>The greater frequency of psychiatric disorders in patients with fibromyalgia compared with those with OA or RA may explain the lower success rate for this therapy in this patient population [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/psychosocial-factors-and-rheumatic-disease/abstract/83\" class=\"abstract_t\">83</a>]. Nevertheless, combining cognitive-behavioral interventions with pharmacologic therapies that improve pain and mood in patients with fibromyalgia may produce more positive outcomes. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=initial-treatment-of-fibromyalgia-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Initial treatment of fibromyalgia in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H260811245\"><span class=\"h1\">SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Psychosocial factors affect patients' abilities to cope with chronic illnesses such as rheumatoid arthritis (RA), osteoarthritis (OA), and fibromyalgia (FM).

Psychosocial factors that may positively influence adaptation include self-efficacy, optimism, coping behaviors (that involve processes such as appraisal of the threat associated with a particular stressor, performing behaviors that control the effects of the stressor, evaluating the outcomes produced by these behaviors and, if necessary, performing alternative coping responses), and acceptance. (See <a href=\"#H9\" class=\"local\">'Psychosocial factors that may positively influence adaptation'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Interventions that may increase adaptation and improve health status are available.

These improvements and a reduction in medical service costs may persist for 12 to 15 months after treatment.
