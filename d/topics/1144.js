It can also arise in patients with post-traumatic cavernous sinus thrombosis. Because the venous system of the eye and orbit drain into the cavernous sinus, elevated pressure within this structure leads to ocular and orbital congestion. In patients with this condition, the ocular surface vessels appear tortuous (termed &quot;corkscrew&quot;) and dilated with concomitant chemosis (edema of the conjunctiva) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F93902\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef93902 \">picture 22</a>). Retinal vessel distension and high intraocular pressure is typically present as well.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span><strong>Conjunctival laceration</strong> &ndash; A conjunctival laceration results from a penetrating injury to the ocular surface and clinically presents as a full thickness defect in the conjunctiva. Often, there are associated conjunctival abnormalities, including chemosis and subconjunctival hemorrhage (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F79392\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef79392 \">picture 23</a>).

Differentiating between partial and full thickness injuries may be difficult because some full thickness lacerations may be self-sealing. If intraocular contents are extruding or drawn to the inner aspect of the wound, an open globe injury is assured (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F82383\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef82383 \">picture 11</a>).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span><strong>Corneal foreign bodies</strong> &ndash; Corneal foreign bodies that are deeply embedded or full thickness (ie, intraocular foreign bodies) should be left in place.

Slit lamp examination provides the ability to detect microhyphema and to measure directly the millimeter distance between the inferior limbus and the top of the erythrocyte layer in an erect patient. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=traumatic-hyphema-clinical-features-and-diagnosis#H4976280\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Traumatic hyphema: Clinical features and diagnosis&quot;, section on 'Clinical Features'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=slit-lamp-examination#H19\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Slit lamp examination&quot;, section on 'Cells and flare'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">In the absence of an extensive hyphema, the examiner can also make a quick assessment of anterior chamber depth by shining a penlight at eye level from the lateral aspect (temporal or lateral canthus). In the normal patient, the iris is flat and will be fully illuminated. In patients with a shallow anterior chamber, which can be a sign of an anterior open globe injury, the iris will be only partially illuminated with a shadow cast nasally.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">In addition, abnormalities of the iris and lens should be identified as follows:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span><strong>Iris </strong>&ndash; Sphincter tears may be evident at the pupil margin as small notches and may lead to permanent mydriasis.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\">Traumatic iritis may accompany a traumatic hyphema. Inflammation of the iris causes pain, photophobia, alteration in pupillary sphincter response to light, and perilimbal conjunctival injection. White blood cells and flare may be seen on slit lamp examination of the anterior chamber. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=traumatic-hyphema-clinical-features-and-diagnosis#H714238293\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Traumatic hyphema: Clinical features and diagnosis&quot;, section on 'Iris'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\">Iridodialysis refers to tearing of the outer circumference of a portion of the iris from its attachment at the iris <span class=\"nowrap\">root/scleral</span> spur (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F68851\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef68851 \">picture 24</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F80212\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef80212 \">picture 25</a>).

Opacification of the lens (cataract), can result from closed or open globe injuries and appears as a whitening of the pupil acutely or chronically after eye trauma (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F104558\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef104558 \">picture 16</a>).

Often, loss of the lens posteriorly can be difficult to appreciate in normal, healthy, young patients due to its natural clarity. Damage to the lens zonules can result in abnormal lens mobility (phacodonesis) or in frank lens subluxation. The lens can dislocate forward into the anterior chamber, fall backward into the vitreous cavity, or merely subluxate in its normal plane.

When visualization cannot be obtained, evaluating the red reflex can be helpful for ruling out serious posterior segment pathology. In the absence of a relative afferent pupillary defect, a uniform reflex that is symmetric between the two eyes can effectively exclude significant vitreous hemorrhage or large retinal detachments.</p><p>Color vision testing with standard color plates is a sensitive indicator of optic nerve damage but is not typically performed in the emergency department.

Once an open globe is excluded, the intraocular pressure can be easily and accurately evaluated by applanation tonometry (eg, Tono-Pen) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F104577\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef104577 \">picture 28</a>). Normal intraocular pressure varies between 10 and 21 mmHg and comparison between the traumatized and non-traumatized eye is helpful.</p><p>Increased intraocular pressure may be seen in patients with hyphema, OCS, orbital hematoma, or a carotid-cavernous fistula and warrants emergency consultation with an ophthalmologist.

The lower lid is pulled down, and a fluorescein impregnated paper strip is moistened with saline or topical anesthetic, allowing a drop to run off into the eye or the inferior cul-de-sac. When the patient blinks, the dye is distributed over the ocular surface. Alternatively, the strip is gently swiped against the bulbar or tarsal conjunctiva below the cornea and the patient is allowed to blink to distribute the fluorescein.

The affinity is quite high, so very little fluorescein is necessary. The stained abrasion can often be seen as yellowish with the naked eye. Visualization is enhanced by the use of a cobalt blue filter (available on any ophthalmoscope or slit lamp) or a Wood's lamp. Foreign bodies may not stain, although the exposed edge of epithelium at the edge of the foreign body typically does. Clinicians who are examining with a slit lamp can look for a Seidel sign (streaming of leaking aqueous humor through the fluorescein coating the ocular surface), which, if present, indicates penetrating trauma.
