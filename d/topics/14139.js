Prenatal care is not a single intervention; instead, it represents a series of assessments and interventions over time that is variously applied by different practitioners. The &quot;quality&quot; of prenatal care and the effect of individual components on outcome are thus difficult to measure.</p><p>After the initial prenatal assessment and patient counseling, prenatal care is directed at ongoing evaluation of the health status of both mother and fetus, anticipation of problems, and intervention, if possible, to prevent or minimize morbidity. This topic will discuss prenatal care in the second and third trimesters. Prenatal issues related to the first visit and first trimester are reviewed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prenatal-care-initial-assessment\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Prenatal care: Initial assessment&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H21417058\"><span class=\"h1\">FREQUENCY OF PRENATAL VISITS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Observational data suggest that prenatal care saves lives compared to no prenatal care [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prenatal-care-second-and-third-trimesters/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>] and show an association between the number of antenatal visits <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> early gestational age at the initiation of care and pregnancy outcomes, after controlling for confounding factors (eg, length of gestation) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prenatal-care-second-and-third-trimesters/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. However, there are limited data as to what constitutes the optimal number and frequency of prenatal visits, or the optimal content of those visits. </p><p>In the United States, the typical intervals for prenatal visits for nulliparous women with uncomplicated pregnancies are every 4 weeks until 28 weeks of gestation, every 2 weeks from 28 to 36 weeks, and then weekly until delivery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prenatal-care-second-and-third-trimesters/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Parous women with uncomplicated medical and obstetrical histories can be seen less frequently. Women with problems are seen more frequently, depending on the nature of the problems. According to this schedule, an uncomplicated pregnancy where the first visit is at six weeks of gestation and the last visit is at 41 weeks will comprise 16 prenatal visits. While the above visit schedule is commonly followed, it requires significant effort and planning on the part of the patient without clear evidence of benefit. </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a cohort study of over 7200 women with low-risk pregnancies, there were no differences in neonatal intensive care unit admissions, five-minute Apgar score &lt;7, neonatal demise, or small for gestational age infants among women who had more than 10 prenatal visits and those who had 10 or fewer prenatal visits [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prenatal-care-second-and-third-trimesters/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. While the women in the high utilization group were 33 percent more likely to undergo induction of labor and 50 percent more likely to have a cesarean delivery than the women in the low utilization group, there are insufficient data to conclude a causal relationship. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For women with high risk pregnancies by various criteria, randomized trials comparing routine with enhanced prenatal care (eg, extra office visits, health education, home visits, telephone contact, psychosocial support) have not reported significantly improve outcome with enhanced care [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prenatal-care-second-and-third-trimesters/abstract/5,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,6</a>]. </p><p/><p>The National Institute of Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) suggests a reduced frequency of visits: 10 appointments for nulliparous women and 7 appointments for parous women, and each visit should have a specific <span class=\"nowrap\">purpose/goal</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prenatal-care-second-and-third-trimesters/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. This approach takes into account the cost and time constraints of modern society and lack of proven efficacy of frequent prenatal visits in randomized trials. </p><p>The 2016 World Health Organization (WHO) antenatal care guidelines suggest a minimum of eight antenatal visits for all women, regardless of parity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prenatal-care-second-and-third-trimesters/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. The WHO advises one visit in the first trimester, two in the second trimester, and five in the third trimester. This represents a four-visit increase from prior recommendations in response to a 2015 systematic review that reported a 15 percent increase in perinatal deaths for women with low risk pregnancies in middle- and lower-income countries who had reduced antenatal visits (typically fewer than five visits) compared with more visits [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prenatal-care-second-and-third-trimesters/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2242499\"><span class=\"h2\">Higher risk pregnancies</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A normal healthy woman with an uncomplicated pregnancy is generally considered low risk. Although there is no precise definition for higher risk pregnancy, it generally includes women who do not meet the definition of low risk because of medical or surgical conditions, past or current obstetrical complications, or social or demographic factors (eg, old or young maternal age, lack of social support, grand multiparity [&ge;4 to 6 births]). There is consensus that these women need additional care during pregnancy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prenatal-care-second-and-third-trimesters/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].</p><p>Prenatal care for women with multiple gestations is presented separately.

(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=syphilis-in-pregnancy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Syphilis in pregnancy&quot;</a>.) Retesting for HIV in the third trimester (&le;36 weeks of gestation) is recommended for women at increased risk for acquiring HIV infection, in areas of high HIV prevalence, and for women who declined testing earlier in pregnancy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prenatal-care-second-and-third-trimesters/abstract/25,27\" class=\"abstract_t\">25,27</a>]. The basis of this recommendation is that appropriate intervention peripartum can significantly reduce perinatal transmission. A conventional or rapid test can be used in the third trimester.

The only patients who are excluded from screening are those with GBS bacteriuria earlier in the current pregnancy or those who gave birth to a previous infant with invasive GBS disease. These latter patients are not included in the screening recommendation because they should receive intrapartum antibiotic prophylaxis regardless of the colonization status. Intrapartum chemoprophylaxis of colonized women has been proven to reduce the incidence of early-onset neonatal GBS.

ECV has been proven to have a high degree of safety and success at this gestational age, but can be initiated earlier (34 to 35 weeks) to improve the success rate. Earlier ECV will probably reduce the cesarean delivery rate, but the safety of ECV performed before 36 weeks is less well-established.
