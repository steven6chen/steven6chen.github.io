There is no general tissue or organ restriction, nor is there a gender or age predominance like that seen in autoimmune diseases affecting the general population<em>.</em></p><p>Autoimmune cytopenias, endocrinopathies, enteropathy, arthritis, hepatitis, glomerulonephritis, lupus-like systemic manifestations, and many other disorders can develop in patients with PID, and autoimmunity can develop at any age and at any stage in the course of the PID. The development of autoimmune disorders does not necessarily mean that the PID is more severe. Likewise, the autoimmune disorders in PID patients are not necessarily more severe than those observed in patients without PID. However, the quality of life and outcome of PID patients with autoimmune or inflammatory complications, even after stem cell transplantation, are worse for patients with PID compared with those without PID [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/autoimmunity-in-patients-with-primary-immunodeficiency/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].</p><p>Patients with PID can develop autoimmunity in the strict sense (ie, specific autoantibody-mediated organ destruction), like that seen in the cytopenias or autoimmune hepatitis. Alternatively, autoreactive cellular immune mechanisms (due to a lack of self-tolerance) and hyperinflammation (based on positive feedback loops of ineffective immune cells via secreted mediators) may cause self-destruction rather than protection. It is unclear why autoimmunity affects one specific organ in one PID and another organ in a different PID [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/autoimmunity-in-patients-with-primary-immunodeficiency/abstract/6-10\" class=\"abstract_t\">6-10</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H374900286\"><span class=\"h2\">Autoimmune disorders in common forms of PID</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Some PIDs are associated with specific autoimmune diseases, and an awareness of these patterns allows clinicians to monitor patients more effectively.

As an example, infants with immune dysregulation, polyendocrinopathy, enteropathy, X-linked (IPEX) syndrome often present with intractable diarrhea and failure to thrive, with signs and symptoms of allergic inflammation affecting multiple systems (eg, eczema, food allergy, eosinophilia, elevated total and antigen-specific immunoglobulin E [IgE]) within the first year of life. Severe forms of IPEX may develop neonatal type 1 diabetes mellitus, and many patients also develop thyroiditis. Other examples would be severe early-onset inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) (ie, at toddler age) or a lupus-like autoimmunity syndrome before adolescence.

ITP became chronic and progressed to autoimmune pancytopenia. Generalized lymphadenopathy prompted a lymph node biopsy, which revealed findings consistent with autoimmune lymphoproliferative syndrome (ALPS).

In contrast, monogenic diseases, which sometimes result in defects in a specific immune process or pathway, can provide insight into how immunologic tolerance is normally established and maintained, as well as illustrate the consequences of defective tolerance (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F104453\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef104453 \">table 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/autoimmunity-in-patients-with-primary-immunodeficiency/abstract/36-38\" class=\"abstract_t\">36-38</a>].</p><p>One group has categorized some of the known PID disorders into defects in different overlapping immunologic pathways or processes that underlie autoimmunity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/autoimmunity-in-patients-with-primary-immunodeficiency/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>]. In addition to this oversimplified construct, some monogenic defects impact several pathways simultaneously. Examples of PIDs affecting each pathway are provided.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Defects in central T cell tolerance</strong> &ndash; Central T cell tolerance results from the deletion of autoreactive T cells during development in the thymus (negative selection). This process involves interaction of developing T cells with thymic stromal cells and requires the product of the autoimmune regulator (<em>AIRE) </em>gene, which is essential for intrathymic presentation of autologous antigens. Mutations in <em>AIRE</em> result in defective presentation of self-antigens in the thymus. More than 70 mutations in <em>AIRE</em> have been identified that result in the disorder autoimmune polyendocrinopathy with candidiasis and ectodermal dystrophy (APECED), which is characterized by autoimmune disease affecting multiple organs and susceptibility to candidiasis (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F104453\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef104453 \">table 1</a>).

In some patients with common variable immunodeficiency (CVID), mutations in <em>TNFRSF13B</em> (tumor necrosis factor receptor superfamily member 13B) lead to defects in <strong>t</strong>ransmembrane <strong>a</strong>ctivator and <strong>c</strong>alcium-modulator and cyclophilin ligand (CAML) <strong>i</strong>nteractor (TACI), a molecule that is important in class-switch recombination, as well as in plasma cell differentiation and antibody production.

Patients with AID deficiency classically present with normal or elevated immunoglobulin M (IgM) and low immunoglobulin G (IgG) and immunoglobulin A (IgA), lymphadenopathy with enlarged germinal centers, and recurrent bacterial infections. A subset develops autoimmune cytopenias, Crohn disease, or SLE.

Foxp3 is a member of the forkhead box P family of transcription factors and is fundamental to the function of Tregs. Its gene is located on the X chromosome, and when defective, male infants develop autoimmune enteropathy, endocrinopathy, and severe eczematous dermatitis.

The products of recombinase-activating genes 1 and 2 (<em>RAG1</em> and <em>RAG2</em>) mediate the creation of double-stranded DNA breaks at the sites of recombination and signal sequences during T and B cell receptor gene rearrangement. When severely defective, a T-B-NK+ SCID (T cell-negative, B cell-negative, natural killer cell-positive severe combined immunodeficiency) results, while hypomorphic defects lead to T and B cells that survive but are oligoclonal and often self-reactive. Hypomorphic <em>RAG</em> mutations have been detected in multiple PIDs, including Omenn syndrome, idiopathic CD4 lymphocytopenia, and specific antibody deficiency. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=combined-immunodeficiencies#H4018211\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Combined immunodeficiencies&quot;, section on 'Hypomorphic RAG1 and RAG2 mutations'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Defects in apoptosis</strong> &ndash; Once activated, an immune response must also be downregulated when the threat to the host has been neutralized. Defects in apoptosis pathways lead to uncontrolled lymphoproliferation, with lymphadenopathy, hepatosplenomegaly, autoimmune organ damage, cytopenias, and increased risk of lymphoma. Autoimmune lymphoproliferative syndrome (ALPS) presents in young children, usually as some combination of <span class=\"nowrap\">lymphadenopathy/splenomegaly/hepatomegaly,</span> autoimmune disease (cytopenias), and lymphoma. Flow cytometry shows elevated numbers of T cells in peripheral blood and tissue specimens that express the <span class=\"nowrap\">alpha/beta</span> T cell receptor but lack both CD4 and CD8 <span class=\"nowrap\">(alpha/beta</span> double-negative T cells) , elevated levels of interleukin-10 (IL-10) in blood, increased levels of vitamin B12, and defective Fas-mediated apoptosis in vitro. Multiple autoantibodies are characteristic. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=autoimmune-lymphoproliferative-syndrome-alps-clinical-features-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Autoimmune lymphoproliferative syndrome (ALPS): Clinical features and diagnosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Hyperactivation of lymphocytes</strong> &ndash; Defects in molecules in the activation pathways of T and B cells may result in hyperactivation, immune dysregulation, and lymphoproliferation. Specific disorders include activating mutations in phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K), deletions in the autoinhibitory domain of phospholipase C-gamma-2 (PLC-gamma-2), and protein kinase C-delta deficiency. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=combined-immunodeficiencies#H24580444\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Combined immunodeficiencies&quot;, section on 'Activated PI3K-delta syndrome'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Increased activation of type 1 interferon pathways</strong> &ndash; Type 1 interferons (IFN-alpha and IFN-beta), when given therapeutically, can promote autoimmunity. The causative mechanisms of this adverse effect are not fully understood but include inhibition of Tregs, enhanced major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II antigen expression with subsequent activation of T helper lymphocytes by autoantigens, and induction of proinflammatory cytokines. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=principles-of-interferon-therapy-in-liver-disease-and-the-induction-of-autoimmunity#H4\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Principles of interferon therapy in liver disease and the induction of autoimmunity&quot;, section on 'Interferon-induced autoimmunity'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Monogenic defects that result in increased production of type 1 interferons include gain-of-function mutations in signal transducer and activator of transcription-1 (STAT1), a signaling protein in the pathway initiated by binding of IFN-alpha or IFN-beta to its receptor. Patients present with chronic mucocutaneous candidiasis and an array of autoimmune disorders. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=chronic-mucocutaneous-candidiasis#H8501601\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Chronic mucocutaneous candidiasis&quot;, section on 'STAT1 defects associated with CMCC'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Defects in early complement components</strong> &ndash; Defects in the early complement components (ie, C1q, <span class=\"nowrap\">C1r/s,</span> C2, and C4) are all associated with a greatly increased risk of developing SLE. Some patients have increased susceptibility to infection as well. These complement proteins function as acute-phase reactants and are important for opsonization of immune complexes and apoptotic cells. In patients with a deficiency, self-antigens are more likely to induce autoimmunity. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=inherited-disorders-of-the-complement-system#H6\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Inherited disorders of the complement system&quot;, section on 'Specific disorders'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Defective removal of cell debris</strong> &ndash; Similar to defects in early complement components, defects in phagocyte Fc receptors (Fc-gamma-RII and Fc-gamma-RIII), variants in C-reactive protein (CRP), and defects in the receptor for C3bi on monocytes, all impair normal removal of cell debris and apoptotic cells by phagocytes. These defects have been identified in some patients with SLE [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/autoimmunity-in-patients-with-primary-immunodeficiency/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=an-overview-of-the-innate-immune-system#H5719882\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;An overview of the innate immune system&quot;, section on 'Homeostasis in the innate immune system'</a>.)</p><p/><p>A discussion of the known mechanisms of more common autoimmune diseases is found separately.

Examples include inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), granuloma formation, lymphoproliferation, and hemophagocytosis.</p><p>Chronic <span class=\"nowrap\">IBD/enteropathy</span> is a typical example of immune dysregulation in PID [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/autoimmunity-in-patients-with-primary-immunodeficiency/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>]. Specifically, colitis may be observed as a consequence of immune dysregulation in disorders with defective interleukin-10 (IL-10) and interleukin-21 (IL-21) signalling [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/autoimmunity-in-patients-with-primary-immunodeficiency/abstract/29,30\" class=\"abstract_t\">29,30</a>]. In the colitis associated with chronic granulomatous disease (CGD), the impaired ability of neutrophils to digest phagocytosed material results in secretion of proinflammatory cytokines and the attraction and activation of ever more incompetent leukocytes, yielding granulomata [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/autoimmunity-in-patients-with-primary-immunodeficiency/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]. In immune dysregulation, polyendocrinopathy, enteropathy, X-linked (IPEX) syndrome, autoantibodies against various gut antigens are thought to be involved, in addition to the lack of direct T cell suppression by Tregs.</p><p>Lymphoproliferation (generalized lymphadenopathy, splenomegaly), another possible manifestation of immune dysregulation, can also result from multiple mechanisms. It is pathognomonic in ALPS but also a common symptom in CD27 or CD70 deficiency, IL-2-inducible kinase (ITK) deficiency, X-linked lymphoproliferative (XLP) disorders (types 1 and 2), X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis (XIAP), and CVID [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/autoimmunity-in-patients-with-primary-immunodeficiency/abstract/7,13,41-46\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,13,41-46</a>]. Lymphoproliferation and lymphoma (Hodgkin and non-Hodgkin lymphoma) are often Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-associated. Of note, lymphadenopathy and splenomegaly may also be triggered by unspecified infections (not only EBV) in CVID and in almost any other PID and are not always primarily attributable to immune dysregulation.</p><p>Primary or familial hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis syndromes also belong to the group of disorders with immune dysregulation and are usually caused by genes involved in cellular cytotoxicity pathways of cytotoxic T effector and natural killer (NK) cells [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/autoimmunity-in-patients-with-primary-immunodeficiency/abstract/12,47\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,47</a>]. Secondary hemophagocytic syndrome, lymphoproliferation, and lymphoma in the context of PIDs may be infection-triggered (most often EBV or another DNA virus) and characteristically occur in T-B cell communication defects like XLP and <span class=\"nowrap\">CD27/CD70</span> deficiency [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/autoimmunity-in-patients-with-primary-immunodeficiency/abstract/45,46,48-50\" class=\"abstract_t\">45,46,48-50</a>]. However, other mechanisms of malignant transformation, like the underlying lymphocyte maturation defect, may also contribute to the development of lymphoma in this group of PIDs. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-hemophagocytic-lymphohistiocytosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical features and diagnosis of hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H100035067\"><span class=\"h1\">MONITORING FOR AUTOIMMUNITY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>It is helpful to understand the associations between specific PIDs and autoimmune disorders (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F104453\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef104453 \">table 1</a>). Monitoring for these diseases can be accomplished with a periodic review of systems. In some cases, the patient can be educated about the most common signs of the most dangerous autoimmune conditions. If a new sign or symptom consistent with autoimmunity or immune dysregulation emerges, cooperation with the respective subspecialties, such as hematology, endocrinology, gastroenterology, and infectious diseases, should occur without delay.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H127903\"><span class=\"h2\">Considering alternative etiologies</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>When assessing a patient with PID for possible autoimmunity, it is important to begin with a broad differential diagnosis, since infectious diseases, adverse effects of medications, and malignancies can mimic autoimmune processes:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Viral and other infections may lead to myelosuppression and (pan)cytopenia, enterocolitis, or generalized lymphadenopathy and hepatosplenomegaly [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/autoimmunity-in-patients-with-primary-immunodeficiency/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. Mycobacterial infections may lead to granuloma formation. DNA viruses, norovirus, and <em>Campylobacter</em> and <em>Salmonella </em>(in some PIDs) are typical micro-organisms that may cause acute or chronic infection with cytopenia, enteropathy, or hepatitis.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Certain drugs given to patients with PID are myelotoxic or hepatotoxic and may lead to a clinical picture of cytopenia or hepatitis (eg, antibiotics, antiviral drugs, anticonvulsants, antipyretics, or immunosuppressants).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Malignancies, especially lymphomas, can be misinterpreted as &quot;normal (polyclonal)&quot; lymphoproliferation. In the setting of rapidly evolving or persistent <span class=\"nowrap\">lymphadenopathy/lymphoproliferation,</span> a patient should be referred to a <span class=\"nowrap\">hematology/oncology</span> specialist. A histopathologic assessment of lymph node <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> bone marrow tissue, including analyses of clonality and Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) integration, might be required to confirm or exclude lymphoma.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H127909\"><span class=\"h1\">THERAPIES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Most autoimmune diseases in patients with a PID are managed with the same therapies that are used in patients without PID. In some cases, the treatment required to control the autoimmune process may cause secondary immunodeficiency and further increase the risk of infection or malignancy. However, untreated autoimmune disease or chronic tissue damage due to uncontrolled inflammation may cause even equal or greater harm. Cross-specialty cooperation is invaluable when such therapies are required.</p><p>Some treatments seem overtly counterintuitive, such as the use of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=rituximab-intravenous-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">rituximab</a> to eliminate autoreactive B cells in a patient with an underlying antibody deficiency. One example is the use of rituximab to control autoimmune hemolytic anemia (AIHA) in patients with common variable immunodeficiency (CVID). Another example is the use of T cell immunosuppression in a patient with a combined immunodeficiency. When such therapies are required, it is helpful to ensure that the patient understands the treatment strategy and is informed about specific risks and complications of the medications that are to be used.</p><p>Ultimately, allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation may be curative in certain severe monogenetic PIDs with autoimmunity, if no targeted therapies are available (as is the case in most PIDs). In the future, gene therapy may represent another approach to cure an increasing number of these disorders.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H432672738\"><span class=\"h1\">SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Dysregulation of immune processes in primary immunodeficiency (PID) can lead to classic autoimmune disorders, chronic inflammation of the gut and other tissues, granuloma formation, lymphoproliferation and focal or diffuse lymphocytic organ infiltration, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> hemophagocytosis.

Most common autoimmune disorders, such as rheumatoid arthritis or systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), are complex polygenic phenotypes. In contrast, monogenic diseases, which often affect a specific immune process or pathway, can provide insight into how immunologic tolerance is normally established and maintained, as well as illustrate the consequences of defective tolerance.
