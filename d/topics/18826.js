A study analyzed primary care health records from England from 2001 to 2014 and matched over 8,000 children and adolescents (aged 10 to 19 years) who had an episode of self-harm with a cohort of children and adolescents without self-harm [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/whats-new-in-psychiatry/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Compared with the control group, children and adolescents who harmed themselves were three times more likely to eventually die from natural causes and nine times more likely to die from unnatural causes, including suicide, or alcohol and drug poisoning. Thus, children and adolescents should receive treatment for any episode of self-harm.

The guideline emphasizes the importance of appropriate diagnosis of MCI in order to assess for reversible causes of cognitive impairment, help patients and families understand the cause of their cognitive concerns, discuss prognostic implications with regard to dementia risk, and help plan for the future. Neuropsychological testing is recommended in patients who screen positive for MCI by history and brief office-based cognitive testing. An assessment for functional impairment is essential to help distinguish MCI from dementia.

In a randomized trial of 77 patients with mild Alzheimer disease (AD), <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methylphenidate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">methylphenidate</a> improved apathy scores compared with placebo over a 12-week treatment period [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/whats-new-in-psychiatry/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Adverse effects were similar between groups. These results add support to low-dose methylphenidate as an option in patients with persistent and distressing apathy despite a cholinesterase inhibitor and treatment of depression.

The intervention is widely used to treat depressive syndromes despite the lack of evidence that it is beneficial. In a review of three short-term randomized trials comparing active with sham cranial electrical stimulation in 66 patients with unipolar or bipolar depressive syndromes, there was little to no evidence of benefit [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/whats-new-in-psychiatry/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. UpToDate suggests that patients with depression receive standard treatments, such as pharmacotherapy, psychotherapy, electroconvulsive therapy, and transcranial magnetic stimulation.

In a one-week outpatient trial comparing intranasal esketamine with placebo as an adjunct to oral antidepressants in 67 patients with treatment-resistant depression, improvement in depression was greater with each dose of esketamine than placebo [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/whats-new-in-psychiatry/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. The beneficial effect was rapid in onset, dose-related, and appeared to be sustained. Additional trials are warranted for this investigational drug, which is more easily administered than intravenous ketamine.

In a meta-analysis of patient-level data from eight randomized trials comparing a single intravenous infusion of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ketamine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ketamine</a> with control (either saline or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=midazolam-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">midazolam</a>) in 167 patients with active or passive suicidal ideation, improvement of suicidal ideation was greater with ketamine than the control treatments, and the clinical effect was moderate to large [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/whats-new-in-psychiatry/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. Improvement with ketamine began within one day of treatment and persisted for up to seven days. Ketamine remains an investigational treatment due to the limited evidence of efficacy and questions concerning patient selection and frequency of administration.

We suggest screening for depression in post-acute coronary syndrome patients, and that screening be implemented with services in place to ensure follow-up for diagnosis and treatment.

Adding to this body of literature, a retrospective database study of over one million surgical patients without a history of opioid misuse or ongoing opioid use identified opioid misuse (ie, opioid dependence, abuse, or overdose) in 0.6 percent of patients after surgery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/whats-new-in-psychiatry/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. The total duration of opioid prescription was the strongest predictor of misuse. Each prescription refill was associated with a 44 percent increase in the rate of misuse, and each additional week of opioid use increased the risk of misuse by 20 percent. While the risk of opioid misuse after surgery is low, the absolute number of patients affected is large because of the volume of surgery performed.

Ohio disseminated practice guidelines to emergency clinicians aimed at reducing inappropriate use [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/whats-new-in-psychiatry/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. The guidelines called for patient education of opioid analgesic risks and benefits, review of patients' prescription history in the state&rsquo;s database, limiting prescriptions to a three-day supply, and referring patients for ongoing pain management. Dissemination of the guidelines was associated with a 12 percent reduction in emergency clinicians' prescribing of opioid analgesics statewide.

Two recent trials comparing daily sublingual buprenorphine with monthly LAI naltrexone found minimal differences in abstinence rates. In one, relapse rates in participants successfully inducted onto medication did not differ between treatment groups (52 versus 56 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/whats-new-in-psychiatry/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. The other trial found LAI naltrexone to be noninferior to buprenorphine in the proportion of opioid-negative urine drug tests [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/whats-new-in-psychiatry/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. LAI naltrexone is a treatment option for opioid use disorder and may offer advantages for patients who do not respond to agonist treatment, cannot adhere to a daily medication, or are in a safety-sensitive occupation that does not permit concurrent agonist treatment.

However, a new randomized trial, also in veterans with PTSD in greater number than in the other trials combined, failed to show benefits from prazosin [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/whats-new-in-psychiatry/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. Based on our clinical experience, we continue to suggest prazosin for PTSD-associated sleep disruption or nightmares, either as monotherapy or in conjunction with a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor or a serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor for other PTSD symptoms. Further research is needed to investigate whether subgroups of this population are uniquely responsive to prazosin.
