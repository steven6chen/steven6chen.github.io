The AIS-PT is expensive (approximately $2950), and results are applicable only to certain Caucasian patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/adolescent-idiopathic-scoliosis-management-and-prognosis/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>].

Mean AIS-PT scores did not differ between patients with and without curve progression to &gt;40&deg; or spinal fusion; nor was there a difference in curve progression between patients with high-risk and low-risk AIS-PT scores.

The CTLSO is more difficult to hide under clothes and less well-tolerated by patients.

Many sports can be played while wearing the brace, but it may be removed for sports that cannot be performed while wearing it (eg, swimming, gymnastics). In the past, wearing the brace 23 hours per day was recommended. However, in the BrAIST trial, 93 percent of patients who wore their brace an average of &ge;12.9 hours per day had a successful outcome (ie, Cobb angle &lt;50&deg; at skeletal maturity) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/adolescent-idiopathic-scoliosis-management-and-prognosis/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Adherence to brace wear can be monitored with temperature or pressure sensors embedded in the brace. Several studies demonstrate that patients may not adhere to the bracing schedule and patient-reported brace wear may be overestimated [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/adolescent-idiopathic-scoliosis-management-and-prognosis/abstract/36,58-60\" class=\"abstract_t\">36,58-60</a>].

Awareness of monitoring and counseling may increase adherence [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/adolescent-idiopathic-scoliosis-management-and-prognosis/abstract/61\" class=\"abstract_t\">61</a>]. In a small randomized trial, adherence to an 18-hour schedule was greater among patients who were told that their adherence was being monitored with a temperature sensor than among those who were not told (85.7 percent versus 56.5 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/adolescent-idiopathic-scoliosis-management-and-prognosis/abstract/62\" class=\"abstract_t\">62</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Monitoring</strong> &ndash; Patients who are treated with braces should be seen immediately after the first fitting to make sure that the brace fits appropriately [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/adolescent-idiopathic-scoliosis-management-and-prognosis/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. The author of this topic review typically obtains the first in-brace radiograph to determine curve-correction after four weeks, but there is no accepted standard. Some surgeons prefer to get the initial in-brace radiograph within a few days of the first fitting. Patients whose in-brace Cobb angle is at least 20 percent lower than the prebrace Cobb angle measurement have an increased chance of successful bracing [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/adolescent-idiopathic-scoliosis-management-and-prognosis/abstract/63\" class=\"abstract_t\">63</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">After the initial in-brace radiograph, we monitor brace treatment clinically and radiographically every six months. During these visits, brace fit should be assessed and radiographs (in or out of brace) should be obtained to assess curve progression [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/adolescent-idiopathic-scoliosis-management-and-prognosis/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. There is no consensus on the best way to monitor the scoliosis in patients wearing a brace. The BrAIST study obtained radiographs in the brace. If obtaining out-of-brace radiographs, we generally ask the patient to remove the brace the night before the study, but there is no accepted standard. In a small observational study, maximum change in Cobb angle was achieved after at least 120 minutes out of the brace [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/adolescent-idiopathic-scoliosis-management-and-prognosis/abstract/64\" class=\"abstract_t\">64</a>]. Progression of the Cobb angle of &ge;5&deg; despite adequate bracing is a poor prognostic sign that surgery may be necessary. If documented curve progression is observed, the brace should be carefully assessed to be sure it still fits properly, and adherence to the bracing schedule should be confirmed. (See <a href=\"#H15\" class=\"local\">'Surgery'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Discontinuation</strong> &ndash; Brace use should be continued until the end of growth, typically one to two years postmenarche with a Risser grade 4 to 5 for girls and until a Risser grade 5 for boys. Some practitioners wean brace usage to nighttime (sleeping) only, and some simply discontinue it. The author of this topic review suggests that her patients wean brace use over six months. However, patients often discontinue use on their own.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Patients typically have clinical and radiologic follow-up six months after discontinuation of the brace and then yearly for several years. There is often a several-degree increase of the curve in the months just following discontinuation of the brace, which quickly stabilizes. However, if the Cobb angle progresses to &ge;50&deg; surgery may be warranted.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Adverse effects</strong> &ndash; Adverse effects of bracing may include psychosocial effects (eg, diminished self-esteem, disturbed peer relationships), skin irritation, disturbed sleep, restriction of physical and recreational activities, and difficulty finding clothes that fit properly [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/adolescent-idiopathic-scoliosis-management-and-prognosis/abstract/29,65-67\" class=\"abstract_t\">29,65-67</a>]. Studies demonstrating the frequency of these effects are lacking [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/adolescent-idiopathic-scoliosis-management-and-prognosis/abstract/66\" class=\"abstract_t\">66</a>]. There is a single case report of compressive injury to the dorsal scapular nerve resulting in scapular winging in 15-year-old girl after incorrect use of a thoracolumbar orthosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/adolescent-idiopathic-scoliosis-management-and-prognosis/abstract/68\" class=\"abstract_t\">68</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15\"><span class=\"h2\">Surgery</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The primary goal of surgical treatment of AIS is prevention of curve progression through spinal fusion, but there is limited evidence regarding this outcome.

In a multicenter study of the outcomes of surgical treatment, patients reported improved self-image, function, and level of activity on validated measures two years after surgery for AIS [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/adolescent-idiopathic-scoliosis-management-and-prognosis/abstract/72\" class=\"abstract_t\">72</a>].</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Indications</strong> &ndash; Surgical correction is indicated for skeletally immature patients with curves with Cobb angle &ge;50&deg; and some skeletally immature patients with Cobb angle between 40 and 50&deg;. Surgical correction also is an option for skeletally mature patients with Cobb angle &ge;50&deg;. Surgery also may be warranted for patients with lumbar curves with marked trunk shift. (See <a href=\"#H790748312\" class=\"local\">'Cobb angle &ge;50 degrees'</a> above and <a href=\"#H790748291\" class=\"local\">'Cobb angle 40 to 49 degrees'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Procedures</strong> &ndash; Procedures for correction of scoliosis involve spinal fusion, which may be performed posteriorly or anteriorly. Achieving bony fusion is the most important aspect of surgery, and either autograft or allograft may be used [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/adolescent-idiopathic-scoliosis-management-and-prognosis/abstract/73\" class=\"abstract_t\">73</a>]. The off-label use of bone morphogenic protein (a group of purified proteins that stimulate bone growth) rather than autograft or allograft is not routinely indicated.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span><strong>Posterior spinal fusion and instrumentation and bone grafting</strong> &ndash; Posterior spinal fusion (PSF) with instrumentation and bone grafting is the most common surgical procedure for AIS. In older patients with very stiff curves, it is sometimes necessary to release the anterior intervertebral soft tissues before PSF. This can sometimes be done thoracoscopically [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/adolescent-idiopathic-scoliosis-management-and-prognosis/abstract/74\" class=\"abstract_t\">74</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\">Contemporary implants for PSF are &quot;segmental&quot;: a variety of hooks, screws, and wires are used to attach contoured rods to the spine at multiple vertebrae, or &quot;segments&quot; (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F70369\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef70369 \">image 2</a>). The original implants for PSF were straight stainless steel rods connected to the cephalad and caudad regions of the spine with simple hooks (Harrington rods). Segmental instrumentation gives the surgeon greater control over the position and rotation of the spine [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/adolescent-idiopathic-scoliosis-management-and-prognosis/abstract/75\" class=\"abstract_t\">75</a>]. The increased stability of segmental instrumentation permits early mobilization with ambulation the day after surgery without external support such as a body cast or brace.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span><strong>Anterior spinal fusion and instrumentation</strong> &ndash; Anterior spinal fusion (ASF) and instrumentation may be performed for thoracolumbar and lumbar scoliosis. The convex side of the spine is exposed anteriorly (often with the assistance of a general surgeon) by a thoracotomy <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> retroperitoneal approach. The curve is corrected by shortening the convex side of the deformity.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\">The purported advantages of the anterior approach include less blood loss, lower risk of neurologic injury (because of correction by shortening instead of distraction), and no disturbance of the paraspinal muscles. Disadvantages include increased complexity and decreased pulmonary function if the thoracic cavity is entered <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> the diaphragm is opened [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/adolescent-idiopathic-scoliosis-management-and-prognosis/abstract/76\" class=\"abstract_t\">76</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\">With improvements in PSF instrumentation and techniques, there are relatively few indications for isolated ASF and it is rarely performed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/adolescent-idiopathic-scoliosis-management-and-prognosis/abstract/77\" class=\"abstract_t\">77</a>]. In a retrospective comparison, patients treated with posterior instrumentation and fusion for lumbar curves had better outcomes and shorter hospital stays than those treated with anterior instrumentation and fusion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/adolescent-idiopathic-scoliosis-management-and-prognosis/abstract/78\" class=\"abstract_t\">78</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span><strong>Thoracoscopic ASF</strong> &ndash; Anterior instrumentation of the thoracic spine may be performed thoracoscopically. The potential advantages of video-assisted thoracoscopic ASF over posterior spinal fusion with thoracic pedicle screws include reduced blood loss, fewer total levels fused, and the preservation of nearly one caudad fusion level. The disadvantages include increased operative time and slightly less improvement in pulmonary function [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/adolescent-idiopathic-scoliosis-management-and-prognosis/abstract/79\" class=\"abstract_t\">79</a>]. Thorascopic anterior instrumentation is technically demanding and applicable to a limited number of curves.

Some patients prefer to be seen every one to two years; others prefer to be seen only as needed.</p><p>We do not obtain serial radiographs for asymptomatic patients following surgical correction of AIS. In a series of 451 consecutive patients who had surgical correction of scoliosis (73 percent with AIS), findings on routine radiographs rarely altered clinical management in patients who were asymptomatic [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/adolescent-idiopathic-scoliosis-management-and-prognosis/abstract/95\" class=\"abstract_t\">95</a>]. However, some surgeons obtain infrequent follow-up radiographs, typically at the first postoperative visit, then at one and two year follow-up, and as needed if the patient presents with signs or symptoms indicative of a postoperative problem.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H22\"><span class=\"h1\">OUTCOME</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Several studies have examined the long-term outcomes of AIS treated with observation, bracing, or surgery. Because surgical methods have changed over time, the longer-term outcomes for patients treated surgically reflect <span class=\"nowrap\">procedures/implants</span> that are no longer used. Twenty-year follow-up is available for patients treated with Harrington rods, but only 5- to 10-year follow-up for patients with segmental instrumentation.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Curve progression</strong> &ndash; Scoliosis can continue to progress after skeletal maturity in untreated patients, particularly in those with curves measuring &gt;40&deg; at the end of growth. Curves &gt;50&deg; generally progress one degree per year after skeletal maturity. Curves measuring &le;30&deg; at the end of growth typically do not progress [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/adolescent-idiopathic-scoliosis-management-and-prognosis/abstract/6,23-26\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,23-26</a>].

Two-thirds of the curves progressed, with an average rate of 0.75 to 1 degree per year. Factors related to progression after skeletal maturity included severity of curve at diagnosis (curves with Cobb angles &gt;30&deg; tended to progress, whereas smaller curves did not) and curve location (increased risk with thoracic curves).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Curves also may progress after bracing or surgery. In one study, patients who were treated with surgery or bracing were followed for an average of 22 to 23 years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/adolescent-idiopathic-scoliosis-management-and-prognosis/abstract/70\" class=\"abstract_t\">70</a>].

It is typically accompanied by a variable degree of rotation of the spinal column. Adolescent idiopathic scoliosis (AIS) is scoliosis with Cobb angle &ge;10&deg; (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F62495\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef62495 \">image 1</a>), age of onset &ge;10 years, and no underlying etiology (eg, congenital, neuromuscular, syndromic). (See <a href=\"#H275133030\" class=\"local\">'Terminology'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Curves progress in approximately two-thirds of skeletally immature patients before the patient reaches skeletal maturity. The magnitude of progression is increased in patients younger than 12 years, girls compared with boys, girls who are premenarchal, curves with initial Cobb angle &ge;20&deg;, thoracic curves, double curves, and patients at Risser grade 0 or 1 (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F74751\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef74751 \">figure 1</a>).

Adolescents with AIS and low risk for progression (ie, postmenarchal girls, boys older &ge;15 years) may be followed by their primary care provider if the provider is comfortable doing so. (See <a href=\"#H275133269\" class=\"local\">'Indications for referral'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The goal of the treatment of AIS is a curve with a Cobb angle of &lt;40&deg; at skeletal maturity. Options for treatment include observation, bracing, and surgery. Management is individualized according to the magnitude of the curve (Cobb angle or scoliometer measurement), remaining growth potential, best estimate of risk for progression, and patient and family preferences.
