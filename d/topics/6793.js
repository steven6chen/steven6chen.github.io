It may be the initial, and possibly only, sign of an underlying androgen disorder, the cutaneous manifestations of which may also include acne and male-pattern balding (androgenetic alopecia). The most common cause of hirsutism is polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). In some cases, hirsutism is mild and requires only reassurance and local (nonsystemic) therapy, while in others it causes significant psychological distress and requires more extensive therapy.</p><p>The evaluation and laboratory testing of hirsutism will be discussed here, while its pathophysiology, causes, and treatment are discussed elsewhere (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F65205\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef65205 \">table 1</a>).

Hair growth can be graded as either normal or excessive based upon the Ferriman-Gallwey score. (See <a href=\"#H124279391\" class=\"local\">'Ferriman-Gallwey score'</a> below.)</p><p>Hirsutism is an important clinical problem because:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>It affects approximately 5 to 10 percent of women [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-premenopausal-women-with-hirsutism/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>It is associated with significant emotional distress and depression [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-premenopausal-women-with-hirsutism/abstract/4-6\" class=\"abstract_t\">4-6</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>It is usually an indication of an underlying endocrine disorder (most commonly polycystic ovary syndrome [PCOS]) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F65205\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef65205 \">table 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-premenopausal-women-with-hirsutism/abstract/2,7-9\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,7-9</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-of-polycystic-ovary-syndrome-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations of polycystic ovary syndrome in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p>Elevated serum concentrations of androgens in women are referred to as hyperandrogenemia, which can manifest as hyperandrogenism: hirsutism, acne, androgenetic alopecia, and virilization. Hirsutism, defined as excessive growth of terminal hair in women in a male-like pattern, is the most commonly used clinical diagnostic criterion of hyperandrogenism [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-premenopausal-women-with-hirsutism/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>]. Virilization, which is rare, occurs only with severe hyperandrogenism and includes deepening of the voice and clitoromegaly.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H124279391\"><span class=\"h2\">Ferriman-Gallwey score</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>We suggest using a simple and commonly used method to grade hair growth that makes use of the modified scale of Ferriman and Gallwey, derived from a population study of white women in England [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-premenopausal-women-with-hirsutism/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. It is the most widely used method to quantify hair growth, particularly in trials of pharmacologic therapy for hirsutism. Using this method, nine androgen-sensitive sites are graded from 0 to 4 (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F66629\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef66629 \">figure 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-premenopausal-women-with-hirsutism/abstract/1,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,10</a>]. The criteria for identifying hirsutism using the Ferriman-Gallwey score are variable because the expression of hair growth varies among <span class=\"nowrap\">racial/ethnic</span> groups, as follows:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A Ferriman-Gallwey score &gt;8 is considered abnormal for black or white women, a reasonable cutoff based upon data from two population studies in which only 5 percent of women had scores higher than 7 or 8 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-premenopausal-women-with-hirsutism/abstract/1,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,11</a>]. In one study, however, many women with lower scores (&gt;3) had evidence of an underlying androgen excess disorder [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-premenopausal-women-with-hirsutism/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Scores between 8 and 15 are usually considered to be mild hirsutism, 16 to 25 moderate, and scores &gt;25 severe hirsutism.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For Mediterranean, Hispanic, and Middle Eastern women, a Ferriman-Gallwey score &ge;9 to 10 is considered abnormal and for Asian women, a score &ge;2 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-premenopausal-women-with-hirsutism/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H462317084\"><span class=\"h3\">Limitations</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>We use the Ferriman-Gallwey score to assess the severity of hirsutism at baseline and at follow-up visits to monitor response to pharmacologic therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-premenopausal-women-with-hirsutism/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. However, there are a number of limitations to the Ferriman-Gallwey score in clinical practice [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-premenopausal-women-with-hirsutism/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Many clinicians are unfamiliar with the Ferriman-Gallwey score and are therefore unlikely to use it.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Most women have been using cosmetic measures (shaving, plucking), especially on the face, by the time they see a clinician, so their Ferriman-Gallwey score at baseline may not be an accurate reflection of the severity and distribution of their hair growth. However, details about the distribution and severity of facial hair (before cosmetic measures were used) can be obtained from the patient. In addition, nonfacial skin is less often shaved or plucked and therefore may reflect the actual hirsutism status better.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The expression of hair growth varies among <span class=\"nowrap\">racial/ethnic</span> groups. Most East Asian women have little body hair, white and African-American women have an intermediate amount, and most Mediterranean, South Asian, and Middle Eastern women have substantially greater quantities of body hair, even though serum androgen concentrations are similar in all groups [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-premenopausal-women-with-hirsutism/abstract/15-17\" class=\"abstract_t\">15-17</a>]. A much lower Ferriman-Gallwey score (&gt;2) is considered to be abnormal in Asian women than other groups as they are less likely to manifest hirsutism resulting from androgen excess [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-premenopausal-women-with-hirsutism/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pathophysiology-and-causes-of-hirsutism#H5\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pathophysiology and causes of hirsutism&quot;, section on 'Ethnicity'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>There is only a modest correlation between the quantity of hair growth and serum androgen levels [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-premenopausal-women-with-hirsutism/abstract/7,18\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,18</a>]. This is thought to result from the fact that stimulation of hair growth from the follicle does not depend solely on circulating androgen concentrations but also upon local factors and variability in end-organ sensitivity to circulating androgens [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-premenopausal-women-with-hirsutism/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pathophysiology-and-causes-of-hirsutism#H3817270433\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pathophysiology and causes of hirsutism&quot;, section on 'Role of androgens'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Intraobserver agreement appears to be relatively good when using the modified Ferriman-Gallwey score [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-premenopausal-women-with-hirsutism/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>], but interobserver agreement appears to be poor [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-premenopausal-women-with-hirsutism/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Many women with low scores seek treatment because they are as distressed by their hair growth as women with high scores. In one study of black and white women, most with a score &gt;3 considered themselves to be hirsute [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-premenopausal-women-with-hirsutism/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. Women's self-ratings of hirsutism using the Ferriman-Gallwey score tend to be higher than clinician ratings [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-premenopausal-women-with-hirsutism/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. Therefore, treatment decisions are often based upon the degree to which the hirsutism affects the patient's well-being and not just on the severity score.

Although this diagnosis will not alter the approach to managing hirsutism in most cases, it is important for future genetic counseling when pursuing fertility. If her partner has NCCAH (which is asymptomatic in adult males) or is a heterozygote carrier, there is a risk that their offspring could have classic 21-hydroxylase deficiency (the severe form of the disease).

(See <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Physical examination'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Laboratory evaluation should include serum androgens in all women with hirsutism. The choice of additional tests is based upon the patient's presentation (time of onset, pace of progression, presence or absence of virilization, and menstrual cycle status). As noted, 75 to 80 percent of women who present with hirsutism have PCOS, but it is essential to identify those who have a more serious cause (androgen-secreting tumors and ovarian hyperthecosis).

This is not always the case, however, as adolescent girls with PCOS often take oral contraceptives (OCs) for irregular periods <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> for acne, which may mask or delay the recognition of hirsutism. Women with NCCAH due to 21-hydroxylase deficiency and idiopathic hirsutism have a similar age of symptom onset.

(See <a href=\"#H253046823\" class=\"local\">'Definition'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A simple and commonly used method to grade hair growth makes use of the modified scale of Ferriman and Gallwey, which grades nine androgen-sensitive sites on a scale from 0 to 4 (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F66629\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef66629 \">figure 1</a>). (See <a href=\"#H124279391\" class=\"local\">'Ferriman-Gallwey score'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Although women with hirsutism typically present because of cosmetic concerns, the majority also have an underlying endocrine disorder (most commonly polycystic ovary syndrome [PCOS]) that should be identified. (See <a href=\"#H519314618\" class=\"local\">'Goals'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The most important goal of the evaluation is to identify the most serious causes of hirsutism, including androgen-secreting ovarian and adrenal tumors. Features that suggest a possible androgen-secreting tumor include (see <a href=\"#H519314618\" class=\"local\">'Goals'</a> above):</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Recent onset, short duration (typically less than one year), progressive worsening of hirsutism</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Onset in the third decade of life or later, rather than near puberty</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Signs of virilization, including frontal balding, acne, clitoromegaly, increased muscle mass, and deepening of the voice</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We suggest measuring serum androgens in all women with hirsutism. The choice of tests is based upon the patient's presentation (time of onset, pace of progression, presence or absence of virilization, and menstrual cycle status) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F115056\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef115056 \">algorithm 1</a>). As noted, 75 to 80 percent of women who present with hirsutism have PCOS, but it is essential to identify those who have a more serious cause (androgen-secreting tumors and ovarian hyperthecosis). (See <a href=\"#H10\" class=\"local\">'Biochemical testing'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The best test for evaluating hyperandrogenism (and the most robust assay) is serum total testosterone. (See <a href=\"#H10\" class=\"local\">'Biochemical testing'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Some women with hirsutism seek advice when they are already receiving pharmacotherapy, usually oral contraceptives (OCs). Measuring serum androgens is not useful in this setting because OCs suppress serum gonadotropins and ovarian androgen, most importantly, testosterone. Biochemical evaluation is usually not necessary unless the patient is experiencing severe or rapid worsening of her hirsutism in spite of OCs (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F115056\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef115056 \">algorithm 1</a>). More commonly, the patient has had an inadequate response to OCs alone so a second medication is added, usually <a href=\"topic.htm?path=spironolactone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">spironolactone</a>. (See <a href=\"#H620415983\" class=\"local\">'Women already taking pharmacologic therapy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For women with severe hyperandrogenemia (see <a href=\"#H291833767\" class=\"local\">'Additional evaluation for severe hyperandrogenemia'</a> above):</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>We suggest a transvaginal ultrasound if the serum total testosterone concentration is &ge;150 <span class=\"nowrap\">ng/dL</span> (5.2 <span class=\"nowrap\">nmol/L)</span> (see <a href=\"#H291833774\" class=\"local\">'Pelvic ultrasonography'</a> above). If the ultrasound is negative, an adrenal computed tomography (CT) scan should be performed.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>We also suggest an adrenal CT scan to look for an adrenal androgen-secreting tumor if the serum dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate (DHEAS) concentration is &ge;700 <span class=\"nowrap\">mcg/dL</span> (18.9 <span class=\"nowrap\">micromol/L)</span>. (See <a href=\"#H291833781\" class=\"local\">'Adrenal imaging'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Combined ovarian and adrenal vein sampling (selective venous sampling) is sometimes performed for further evaluation in women with high serum testosterone concentrations (testosterone &gt;150 <span class=\"nowrap\">ng/dL</span> [5.2 <span class=\"nowrap\">nmol/L]),</span> as well as normal pelvic ultrasonography and adrenal imaging.
