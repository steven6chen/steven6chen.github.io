New-onset diabetes after transplant (NODAT) is associated with increased mortality and morbidity and, in particular, higher rates of cardiovascular disease and infection, which are the leading causes of death in renal transplant recipients.</p><p>This topic reviews the epidemiology, risk factors, and clinical implications of NODAT, as well as recommendations for screening and management. Issues relating to renal transplantation and combined kidney-pancreas transplantation in patients with preexisting diabetes are discussed elsewhere.

Updated recommendations from an international consensus meeting were published in 2014 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/new-onset-diabetes-after-transplant-nodat-in-renal-transplant-recipients/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. The use of various definitions prior to these publications made it difficult to assess the incidence of NODAT and the importance of different risk factors. (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Epidemiology'</a> below and <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Risk factors'</a> below.)</p><p>These guidelines use standard World Health Organization (WHO) and American Diabetes Association (ADA) criteria for the diagnosis of diabetes mellitus and impaired glucose tolerance [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/new-onset-diabetes-after-transplant-nodat-in-renal-transplant-recipients/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-presentation-and-diagnosis-of-diabetes-mellitus-in-adults#H3\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical presentation and diagnosis of diabetes mellitus in adults&quot;, section on 'Diagnostic criteria'</a>.)</p><p>Diabetes mellitus after transplantation may be diagnosed at any time after transplantation by any of the following, all of which are the same as diagnostic criteria for nontransplant patients:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Symptoms of diabetes plus random plasma glucose &ge;200 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> (11.1 <span class=\"nowrap\">mmol/L)</span>. Symptoms include polyuria, polydipsia, and unexplained weight loss.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Fasting plasma glucose &ge;126 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> (7.0 <span class=\"nowrap\">mmol/L)</span>. Fasting is defined as no caloric intake for at least eight hours. An abnormal fasting blood glucose should be confirmed on another day.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Two-hour plasma glucose &ge;200 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> (11.1 <span class=\"nowrap\">mmol/L)</span> during an oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT). The test should be performed as described by the WHO, using a glucose load containing the equivalent of 75 g anhydrous glucose dissolved in water.</p><p/><p>Subdiabetic hyperglycemia, also called &quot;prediabetes,&quot; includes impaired fasting glucose <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> impaired glucose tolerance and is diagnosed by a fasting plasma glucose between 100 and 125 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> (5.6 and 6.9 <span class=\"nowrap\">mmol/L)</span> or a two-hour plasma glucose between 140 and 199 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> (7.8 and 11.0 <span class=\"nowrap\">mmol/L)</span> during an OGTT, respectively, according to ADA guidelines. Of note, the normal range of fasting plasma glucose differs according to ADA and WHO criteria; an abnormal fasting glucose is defined as &ge;100 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> (5.6 <span class=\"nowrap\">mmol/L)</span> by the ADA and &ge;110 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dl</span> (6.1 <span class=\"nowrap\">mmol/L)</span> by the WHO (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-presentation-and-diagnosis-of-diabetes-mellitus-in-adults#H3\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical presentation and diagnosis of diabetes mellitus in adults&quot;, section on 'Diagnostic criteria'</a>). Among transplant recipients, the lower threshold advocated by the ADA is more sensitive in identifying patients at risk for NODAT [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/new-onset-diabetes-after-transplant-nodat-in-renal-transplant-recipients/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H35235284\" class=\"local\">'Posttransplant screening'</a> below.)</p><p>The two-hour OGTT is more sensitive than the fasting blood glucose for detecting subdiabetic hyperglycemia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/new-onset-diabetes-after-transplant-nodat-in-renal-transplant-recipients/abstract/6,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,7</a>]. However, the OGTT is somewhat impractical, associated with expense, and the results generally do not alter transplant candidacy or posttransplant management. Thus, we do not recommend that it be used for screening or management pre- or posttransplant. (See <a href=\"#H23\" class=\"local\">'Management'</a> below.)</p><p>The HbA1c is not recommended for diagnosis before three months following transplantation, because the test may not be valid until new hemoglobin has been synthesized and glycated for the appropriate period in the diabetogenic posttransplant setting [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/new-onset-diabetes-after-transplant-nodat-in-renal-transplant-recipients/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. After three months posttransplant, a HbA1c &ge;6.5 percent can be used to diagnose diabetes by ADA criteria, with a HbA1c of 5.7 to 6.4 percent consistent with prediabetic state [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/new-onset-diabetes-after-transplant-nodat-in-renal-transplant-recipients/abstract/8,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,9</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">EPIDEMIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The reported incidence of NODAT is variable and must be interpreted in the context of definition used, time from transplant, study population, and immunosuppressive agents used for individual studies. Studies that were published prior to the development of the consensus definition described above reported rates ranging from 7 to 46 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/new-onset-diabetes-after-transplant-nodat-in-renal-transplant-recipients/abstract/10-13\" class=\"abstract_t\">10-13</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Definition'</a> above.)</p><p>Several studies have provided incidence estimates of NODAT defined by the 2003 international consensus guidelines, including the use of the oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/new-onset-diabetes-after-transplant-nodat-in-renal-transplant-recipients/abstract/5,6,14-16\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,6,14-16</a>]. A substantial number of patients who were classified as having NODAT in these reports became normoglycemic without any medical therapy, suggesting that their hyperglycemia was transient and that incidence was overestimated in these reports. However, even transient perioperative hyperglycemia may suggest a higher risk for the future development of NODAT (see <a href=\"#H1083105939\" class=\"local\">'Impaired glucose tolerance and perioperative hyperglycemia'</a> below). Overall, studies that use the current criteria for diagnosis suggest that up to one-third of nondiabetic kidney transplant recipients develop persistently impaired glucose metabolism by six months posttransplantation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/new-onset-diabetes-after-transplant-nodat-in-renal-transplant-recipients/abstract/5,6,16,17\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,6,16,17</a>]. Based on Organ Procurement and Transplant <span class=\"nowrap\">Network/Scientific</span> Registry of Transplant Recipients <span class=\"nowrap\">(OPTN/SRTR)</span> data, the prevalence of NODAT at one year following transplantation appears to have decreased from 12 percent in 2005 to approximately 5 percent in 2012 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/new-onset-diabetes-after-transplant-nodat-in-renal-transplant-recipients/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>].</p><p>The incidence of NODAT is higher among transplant recipients than the incidence of new-onset diabetes among dialysis patients. As an example, in a comparative analysis, new-onset diabetes was lower among dialysis patients on a transplant waitlist compared with transplant recipients who were receiving either <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cyclosporine-ciclosporin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cyclosporine</a> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tacrolimus-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">tacrolimus</a> (6 versus 18 and 30 percent, respectively) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/new-onset-diabetes-after-transplant-nodat-in-renal-transplant-recipients/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. The higher incidence of NODAT among recipients receiving tacrolimus compared with cyclosporine has been noted in other studies and is ascribed to the more toxic effect of tacrolimus on islet cells.

In one study of 173 patients, for example, there was a significant relationship between <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prednisolone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">prednisolone</a> dose and two-hour serum glucose levels measured for oral glucose tolerance tests (OGTTs) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/new-onset-diabetes-after-transplant-nodat-in-renal-transplant-recipients/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>]. The risk of developing NODAT was 5 percent per 0.01 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> per day increase in prednisolone dose. The progressive reduction in daily glucocorticoid dose may explain the significantly lower rates of NODAT compared with those reported several decades ago (46 percent in 1979) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/new-onset-diabetes-after-transplant-nodat-in-renal-transplant-recipients/abstract/10,34-36\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,34-36</a>].</p><p>However, complete glucocorticoid withdrawal has not been clearly shown to reduce the incidence of NODAT, as trials comparing glucocorticoid withdrawal with glucocorticoid continuation have not produced consistent results [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/new-onset-diabetes-after-transplant-nodat-in-renal-transplant-recipients/abstract/37,38\" class=\"abstract_t\">37,38</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In one trial, 615 renal transplant recipients at low immunologic risk for rejection were randomly assigned to one of three different immunosuppressive regimens: <a href=\"topic.htm?path=basiliximab-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">basiliximab</a> induction with long-term maintenance glucocorticoids (2.5 to 5 mg of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prednisolone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">prednisolone</a> daily), basiliximab induction with rapid glucocorticoid withdrawal (within eight days of transplant), or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=antithymocyte-globulin-rabbit-derived-thymoglobulin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">rabbit antithymocyte globulin</a> (rATG) induction with rapid glucocorticoid withdrawal [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/new-onset-diabetes-after-transplant-nodat-in-renal-transplant-recipients/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>]. All patients received extended-release <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tacrolimus-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">tacrolimus</a> capsules and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=mycophenolate-mofetil-cellcept-and-enteric-coated-mycophenolate-sodium-myfortic-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">mycophenolate</a> mofetil (MMF) as maintenance immunosuppression. At 12 months, the incidence of NODAT was lower in both glucocorticoid withdrawal arms compared with the glucocorticoid maintenance arm (24 and 23 versus 39 percent). It is important to note that the overall rates of NODAT in this study were significantly higher than those typically reported for renal transplant recipients receiving these immunosuppressive regimens.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>However, in a longer randomized control trial of glucocorticoid withdrawal in kidney transplant patients, the overall incidence of NODAT requiring therapy at five years was similar between patients in the glucocorticoid-withdrawal arm (21.5 percent) versus the glucocorticoid-continuation arm (5 mg of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prednisone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">prednisone</a> daily, 20.9 percent), although the proportion of patients requiring insulin was lower in the glucocorticoid-withdrawal arm (4 versus 12 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/new-onset-diabetes-after-transplant-nodat-in-renal-transplant-recipients/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>]. In another study, although insulin sensitivity increased among patients who had <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prednisolone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">prednisolone</a> decreased from 16 to 9 mg daily, complete withdrawal of glucocorticoids did not significantly affect insulin sensitivity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/new-onset-diabetes-after-transplant-nodat-in-renal-transplant-recipients/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>]. </p><p/><p>A significant percentage of patients suffer an episode of acute rejection following glucocorticoid withdrawal, requiring reinstitution of glucocorticoid therapy, often with high-doses; pulsed high-dose glucocorticoid therapy for acute rejection increased the risk for NODAT [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/new-onset-diabetes-after-transplant-nodat-in-renal-transplant-recipients/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>]. Thus, adjustment of immunosuppression therapy aimed at improving glucose tolerance must be weighed against the risk of allograft rejection.
