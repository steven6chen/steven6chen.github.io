For most pediatric patients, osmolar therapy with either <a href=\"topic.htm?path=mannitol-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">mannitol</a> or hypertonic saline is initially effective [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/elevated-intracranial-pressure-icp-in-children-management/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. When combined treatment is given with both agents, hypertonic saline administration helps to offset the hyponatremia and hypovolemia that frequently follow the rapid diuresis associated with mannitol treatment. On the other hand, mannitol helps to offset potential worsening of vasogenic cerebral edema that may occur with prolonged use of hypertonic saline as described below.</p><p>The hyperosmolar strategy for treating cerebral edema relies on the principle of &quot;osmotic reflection coefficient&quot; and the Starling equilibrium across a capillary membrane [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/elevated-intracranial-pressure-icp-in-children-management/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. A membrane that is impermeable to ions and molecules, such as the intact blood-brain barrier, has a reflection coefficient of 1, whereas a freely permeable membrane has a coefficient of 0. Administration of hypertonic saline or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=mannitol-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">mannitol</a> creates an osmotic gradient that causes free water to come out of the extracellular space and pass into the circulation. This effect leads to shrinkage of brain volume and a reduction in ICP. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pathophysiology-and-etiology-of-edema-in-adults#H3\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pathophysiology and etiology of edema in adults&quot;, section on 'Capillary hemodynamics'</a>.)</p><p>However, the reflection coefficient is not constant with some pathologic processes. For example, in patients with vasogenic cerebral edema caused by tumors, intracranial hematomas, infarcts, cerebral abscesses, or other central nervous system infections (eg, meningitis or encephalitis), there is an expected fall in the reflection coefficient for sodium (decrease from 1 to 0). In such patients, prolonged and repeated dosing of intravenous 3 percent hypertonic saline is not without risk: It will eventually have limited effect and may even worsen the edema as the blood brain barrier fails [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/elevated-intracranial-pressure-icp-in-children-management/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. Thus, for patients with vasogenic cerebral edema, it is appropriate to start with 3 percent hypertonic saline to gain acute control, but <a href=\"topic.htm?path=mannitol-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">mannitol</a> should also be introduced because it typically maintains a higher reflection coefficient due to its higher molecular weight relative to sodium and can reestablish the osmotic gradient.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2040001164\"><span class=\"h4\">Mannitol</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There is limited evidence to compare <a href=\"topic.htm?path=mannitol-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">mannitol</a> with hypertonic saline for intracranial hypertension.

A gap that exceeds this threshold indicates that uncleared mannitol remains in the circulation and increases the risk of nephrotoxicity and reverse osmotic shift (ie, movement of mannitol through the damaged blood brain barrier with a worsening of cerebral edema).

These adverse effects are more common with chronic or high-dose administration, and patients who receive mannitol in this manner should be monitored carefully Serum osmolarity, serum electrolytes, and renal function should be measured at least every six to eight hours, preferably before administration of the next dose. In addition, when administered chronically and in high doses, mannitol may cross the injured blood-brain barrier at the site of the cerebral lesion and cause an exacerbation of cerebral edema referred to as rebound ICP elevation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/elevated-intracranial-pressure-icp-in-children-management/abstract/14,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">14,15</a>].</p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=mannitol-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">Mannitol</a> acts by establishing an osmotic gradient between plasma and parenchymal tissue, resulting in a net reduction in brain water content [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/elevated-intracranial-pressure-icp-in-children-management/abstract/16-19\" class=\"abstract_t\">16-19</a>]. Mannitol has a rapid onset of action and maintains its effect for a period of 1.5 to 6 hours.

An intravenous bolus dose is distributed throughout the extracellular fluid within three minutes, except in areas protected by the intact blood-brain barrier (BBB). There is an acute rise in extracellular osmolality in body tissues because mannitol (molecular weight 182, reflection coefficient of 0.9 at the BBB) causes an influx of water from the intracellular compartment; this restores osmotic equilibrium between the intracellular and extracellular compartments at a higher volume than before the drug was given [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/elevated-intracranial-pressure-icp-in-children-management/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. This water shift dilutes and lowers serum sodium concentration. Subsequent renal clearance of mannitol from the circulation produces an osmotic diuresis and elimination of free water, further raising total body osmolality and serum sodium concentration. The net effect of the initial single dose of mannitol is no change or small net rise in total body osmolality. However, repeated dosing of mannitol over 48 hours, with coadministration of isotonic saline, will lead to a consistent rise in serum osmolality and serum sodium concentration.
