It is a small, T-shaped device that a doctor or nurse puts in your uterus by going through your vagina and cervix (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F80271\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef80271 \">figure 1</a>). These devices are made of flexible plastic and have 2 thin plastic strings that hang out of the cervix. They are very small &ndash; a little more than 1 inch (2.5 cm) in width and length.</p><p>An IUD is one of the safest, most effective methods for preventing pregnancy. It is a good choice for women or teens who do not want to get pregnant for at least 1 year.</p><p>Some women use IUDs for reasons other than birth control. For example, 1 type of IUD can be used to treat heavy, painful periods. The other type can be used to prevent pregnancy if it is put in within 5 days after a woman has sex without birth control. This is known as &quot;emergency contraception.&quot;</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H100749018\"><span class=\"h1\">What are the different types of IUDs?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There are 2 types of IUDs available in the United States. One type releases copper, and the other type releases the hormone progestin.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Copper-containing IUD &ndash; There is only 1 copper-containing IUD. It is called Paragard (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F86255\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef86255 \">picture 1</a>) and can stay in your uterus for up to 10 years to prevent pregnancy. Some women who use it get heavier or longer periods than they had before getting the IUD. Paragard also can be used for emergency contraception.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Progestin-releasing IUD &ndash; There are 4 progestin-releasing IUDs, called Mirena, Kyleena, Skyla, and Liletta. Mirena (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F74378\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef74378 \">picture 2</a>) and Kyleena can stay in your uterus for up to 5 years to prevent pregnancy. Liletta can stay in place for up to 4 years, and Skyla can stay in place for up to 3 years. Many women who use progestin-releasing IUDs have lighter, less painful periods than they had before getting the IUD. Some women stop getting a period at all, but this is not harmful and does not need to be treated. Regular periods return when the device is taken out.</p><p/><p>Other types of IUDs are also available outside of the United States.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H100749069\"><span class=\"h1\">What are the benefits of using an IUD?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The benefits of using an IUD include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>IUDs are very effective. Fewer than 1 in 100 women who use these devices get pregnant during the first year of using them.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>You do not have to remember to do anything or take any birth control medicines on a regular basis.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>IUDs have few side effects.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>IUDs do not contain estrogen, a hormone that some women can't or don't want to take.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>If you decide you want to get pregnant, you can have the IUD taken out.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>If you use an IUD for several years, it costs less overall than many other types of birth control. That's because there are no costs after you have it inserted.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>There is evidence that using an IUD lowers your risk of getting cervical cancer.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H100749086\"><span class=\"h1\">What are the downsides of an IUD?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The downsides of an IUD include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Unlike condoms, an IUD does not protect you against infections you can catch during sex, called &quot;sexually transmitted diseases&quot; or &quot;STDs.&quot; But you and your partner can use a condom to prevent spreading infections.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>There is a small chance the IUD will come out during your period. If this happens, you will need a new IUD. If you see your IUD in your underwear, on your pad, or in the toilet, call your doctor or nurse.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The initial cost is higher than the cost of other methods. But, there are no more costs after it is inserted.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Only a doctor or nurse can insert or remove an IUD.</p><p/><p>You should not get an IUD if you recently had an infection that spread to your uterus and other nearby organs, called a &quot;pelvic infection.&quot; STDs such as chlamydia and gonorrhea can cause pelvic infections.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H100749103\"><span class=\"h1\">Which type of IUD is best for me?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Your nurse or doctor can help you choose the right IUD for you. Paragard might be a good choice if you:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Want or need to avoid hormones. &#160;</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Want to avoid big changes in your period, such not having any periods or bleeding or spotting when you might not expect it.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Want birth control for up to 10 years</p><p/><p>Mirena, Kyleena, Skyla, or Liletta might be a good choice if you:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Have heavy, painful periods. These IUDs can make your periods lighter and less painful.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Want birth control for up to 5 years, depending on which device you choose</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H100749120\"><span class=\"h1\">Does it hurt to have an IUD put in?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>You will likely feel some discomfort and slight cramping after the nurse or doctor puts the IUD into your uterus. Women who have not had a baby often feel more discomfort than women who have had a baby. The cramps generally go away within a day. Over-the-counter pain medicines like <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ibuprofen-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">ibuprofen</a> (sample brand names: Advil, Motrin) or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=naproxen-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">naproxen</a> (sample brand name: Aleve) can help cramps go away faster. </p><p>After the IUD is in place, you should not be able to feel it.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H100749137\"><span class=\"h1\">Should I see a doctor or nurse?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>If you have an IUD, see your doctor or nurse right away if:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>You have bad pain in your lower belly</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Your period is late or very different from normal</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>You cannot feel the string of the IUD or if the string seems shorter than usual</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>You think your IUD might have moved or fallen out</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>You had sex with someone who has or might have an STD, or you think you have an STD</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>You have an unexplained fever</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H100749152\"><span class=\"h1\">More on this topic</span></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=choosing-birth-control-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Choosing birth control (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=emergency-contraception-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Emergency contraception (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=hormonal-birth-control-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Hormonal birth control (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=long-acting-methods-of-birth-control-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Long-acting methods of birth control (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=sterilization-for-women-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Sterilization for women (The Basics)</a></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=long-acting-methods-of-birth-control-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Long-acting methods of birth control (Beyond the Basics)</a></p></div><div id=\"reviewProcess\"><span>All topics are updated as new evidence becomes available and our <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/home/editorial-policy\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"policy policy_editorialpolicy\">peer review process</a> is complete.</span></div><div id=\"topicRetrievedDate\"><span class=\"emphasis\">This topic retrieved from UpToDate on: </span>Apr 02, 2018.</div><div id=\"disclaimer\">The content on the UpToDate website is not intended nor recommended as a substitute for medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.
