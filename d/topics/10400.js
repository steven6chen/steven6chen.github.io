In general, worsening airflow limitation (lower forced expiratory volume in one second [FEV<sub>1</sub>]) is associated with an increasing risk of COPD exacerbation, although airflow limitation alone does not provide a good assessment of exacerbation risk [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-exacerbations-of-chronic-obstructive-pulmonary-disease/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. </p><p>Other potential contributors to an increased risk of exacerbations include the following:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Severity of COPD and history of prior</strong> <strong>exacerbations</strong> &ndash; In the prospective Evaluation of COPD Longitudinally to Identify Predictive Surrogate Endpoints (ECLIPSE) study, 2138 patients with moderate to severe COPD (GOLD stages 2, 3, or 4 (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F82690\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef82690 \">table 2</a>)) were followed for three years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-exacerbations-of-chronic-obstructive-pulmonary-disease/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. The single best predictor of exacerbations was a history of prior exacerbations, regardless of COPD severity.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">The GOLD guidelines suggest using a combination of an individual's FEV<sub>1</sub>, history of exacerbations, history of hospitalization for exacerbation, and symptoms to assess the exacerbation risk [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-exacerbations-of-chronic-obstructive-pulmonary-disease/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. The number of exacerbations in the previous 12 months is stratified: a history of zero or one exacerbation suggests a low future risk of exacerbations, while two or more suggest a high future risk [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-exacerbations-of-chronic-obstructive-pulmonary-disease/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. The severity of lung function impairment is stratified based on the postbronchodilator FEV<sub>1</sub>, using the GOLD classification of airflow limitation (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F82690\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef82690 \">table 2</a>).

In the ECLIPSE study noted above, the occurrence of two or more exacerbations in a year was associated with a history of GERD or heartburn [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-exacerbations-of-chronic-obstructive-pulmonary-disease/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. A similar observation was made in a case-control study that assessed the presence of GERD symptoms and frequency of COPD exacerbations in 80 patients with COPD. The presence of GERD symptoms was associated with an increased risk of COPD exacerbations (RR 6.55, 95% CI 1.86-23.11) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-exacerbations-of-chronic-obstructive-pulmonary-disease/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. However, in an observational study of 638 patients with stable COPD, therapy with proton pump inhibitors did not decrease the risk for severe exacerbations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-exacerbations-of-chronic-obstructive-pulmonary-disease/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. Additional studies are needed to determine whether GERD contributes to the development of COPD exacerbations.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Pulmonary hypertension</strong> &ndash; Secondary pulmonary hypertension may be an additional risk factor for COPD exacerbations. In a follow-up to the ECLIPSE study, chest computed tomography scans were used to compute the ratio of the diameter of the pulmonary artery to the diameter of the aorta (PA:A ratio) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-exacerbations-of-chronic-obstructive-pulmonary-disease/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. In the study, a PA:A ratio greater than 1 was an independent risk factor for a future severe exacerbation (OR 3.44, 95% CI 2.78-4.25). Notably, a PA:A ratio &gt;1 suggests the presence of pulmonary hypertension, although it does not clarify the cause of pulmonary hypertension (eg, hypoxemia due to COPD or other lung disease, left heart failure, sleep apnea). The clinical usefulness of this observation in terms of treatment decisions is unclear.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H718081943\"><span class=\"h1\">TRIGGERS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Respiratory infections are estimated to trigger approximately 70 percent of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) exacerbations (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F70203\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef70203 \">table 3</a>). Viral and bacterial infections cause most exacerbations, whereas atypical bacteria are a relatively uncommon cause [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-exacerbations-of-chronic-obstructive-pulmonary-disease/abstract/12,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,13</a>]. The remaining 30 percent are due to environmental pollution, pulmonary embolism, or have an unknown etiology [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-exacerbations-of-chronic-obstructive-pulmonary-disease/abstract/1,14-16\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,14-16</a>].

The relationship between COPD exacerbation and pulmonary embolism was illustrated by a meta-analysis of five observational studies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-exacerbations-of-chronic-obstructive-pulmonary-disease/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. Among the 550 patients having a COPD exacerbation, the prevalence of pulmonary embolism was 20 percent. The prevalence was even higher (25 percent) among those hospitalized. An important limitation of the meta-analysis was its inability to determine whether the pulmonary embolism was the cause of the COPD exacerbation, a result of the COPD exacerbation, or a mere bystander.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H199602937\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL MANIFESTATIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The clinical manifestations of exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) range from a mild increase in dyspnea or productive cough to respiratory failure due to acute respiratory acidosis or hypoxemia.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H718081955\"><span class=\"h2\">Medical history</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>By definition, patients present with the acute onset or worsening of respiratory symptoms, such as dyspnea, cough, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> sputum production, over several hours to days.

If present, decreased mental status could reflect hypercapnia or hypoxemia and asterixis could indicate increased hypercapnia.</p><p>Attention should also be paid to physical findings that might suggest a comorbidity or alternate diagnosis, such as fever, hypotension, bibasilar fine crackles and peripheral edema.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h1\">EVALUATION AND DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The goals of the initial evaluation of a patient with a suspected exacerbation of COPD are to confirm the diagnosis, identify the cause (when possible), assess the severity, and determine whether comorbidities are contributing. &#160;</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H199603465\"><span class=\"h2\">Initial evaluation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The choice of specific tests is guided by the severity of the exacerbation and the particular associated clinical findings. (See <a href=\"#H199602937\" class=\"local\">'Clinical manifestations'</a> above.)</p><p>For patients with a mild exacerbation (absence of resting dyspnea or respiratory distress, preserved ability to perform activities of daily living), who do not require emergency department treatment, the evaluation may be limited to clinical assessment and possibly pulse oxygen saturation. </p><p>For patients who require emergency department care, the evaluation should generally include the following (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F65420\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef65420 \">table 1</a>):</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Assessment of pulse oxygen saturation</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A chest radiograph to exclude pneumonia, pneumothorax, pulmonary edema, pleural effusion </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Laboratory studies (eg, complete blood count and differential, serum electrolytes and glucose)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Arterial blood gas analysis, if acute or acute-on-chronic respiratory acidosis is suspected or if ventilatory support is anticipated. Concern about acute-on-chronic hypercapnia might be prompted by a history of prior elevation in arterial tension of carbon dioxide (PaCO<sub>2</sub>), an elevated serum bicarbonate (perhaps reflecting compensation for chronic hypercapnia), or the presence of severe airflow obstruction (eg, GOLD III or IV (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F82690\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef82690 \">table 2</a>)).</p><p/><p>Additional tests are obtained depending on the clinical evaluation of the patient. Often an electrocardiogram and cardiac troponins are obtained to evaluate tachycardia or potential myocardial ischemia. Studies such as a plasma brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) to assess for heart failure and a D-dimer to assess for thromboembolic disease are obtained, as indicated by features such as crackles on chest auscultation, peripheral edema, suggestive chest radiographic findings (vascular congestion, pleural effusion), or risk factors for thromboembolism.

Rapid antigen and immunofluorescence testing are useful screening tests for influenza infection, but have limited sensitivity; polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based testing is more sensitive and specific. In addition, PCR diagnostic panels have been developed that can detect multiple respiratory viruses (eg, influenza, adenovirus, parainfluenza virus, respiratory syncytial virus, human metapneumovirus, coronavirus, and rhinovirus) simultaneously, although the exact indications for their use in COPD exacerbations are not clear.

The importance of considering these alternate diagnoses was illustrated in an autopsy study of 43 patients with COPD who died within 24 hours of admission for a COPD exacerbation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-exacerbations-of-chronic-obstructive-pulmonary-disease/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. The primary causes of death were heart failure, pneumonia, pulmonary thromboembolism, and COPD in 37, 28, 21, and 14 percent, respectively. A chest radiograph will differentiate among several of these possibilities (eg, heart failure, pneumonia, pneumothorax); a clear chest radiograph may be a clue to pulmonary embolism, especially when dyspnea and hypoxemia are more prominent than cough or sputum production. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H199603161\"><span class=\"h1\">TRIAGE TO HOME OR HOSPITAL</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>An important step in the initial evaluation is to determine whether the patient needs hospitalization or can be safely managed at home.

However, these trials excluded sicker patients with an impaired level of consciousness, respiratory acidosis (arterial pH &lt;7.35), acute electrocardiographic or chest radiographic changes, or coexisting medical morbidities. Although care at home is feasible in highly selected patients without these characteristics, implementation requires a dedicated support team to conduct ongoing clinical assessments and provide home care.

(See <a href=\"#H1\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above.).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We recommend that all patients having a COPD exacerbation receive inhaled short-acting bronchodilator therapy (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=2\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1B</a>). Short-acting beta-adrenergic agonists (SABA, eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=albuterol-salbutamol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">albuterol</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=levalbuterol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">levalbuterol</a>) are the mainstay of therapy; a short-acting anticholinergic agent (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ipratropium-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ipratropium</a>) may be used as an alternative, or in combination with the SABA. For more severe exacerbations, the combination is usually preferred. (See <a href=\"#H9\" class=\"local\">'Beta adrenergic agonists'</a> above and <a href=\"#H10\" class=\"local\">'Anticholinergic agents'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We recommend that all patients having a COPD exacerbation receive systemic glucocorticoids (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=1\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1A</a>). A reasonable dose for patients not requiring intensive care unit admission is <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prednisone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">prednisone</a> 40 to 60 mg orally once daily, or the equivalent, for 5 to 14 days. (See <a href=\"#H11\" class=\"local\">'Systemic glucocorticoids'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Antibiotics are indicated for many patients having a COPD exacerbation.

We suggest that supplemental oxygen be titrated to a target of 88 to 92 percent pulse oxygen saturation, rather than using high-flow, untitrated oxygen (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=5\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2B</a>). (See <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'Oxygen therapy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Noninvasive ventilation (NIV) improves numerous clinical outcomes and is the preferred method of ventilatory support in many patients with an acute exacerbation of COPD. Invasive mechanical ventilation is required in patients with respiratory failure who fail NIV, do not tolerate NIV, or who have contraindications to NIV. Both NIV and invasive mechanical ventilation for patients with an exacerbation of COPD are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=noninvasive-ventilation-in-acute-respiratory-failure-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Noninvasive ventilation in acute respiratory failure in adults&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=invasive-mechanical-ventilation-in-acute-respiratory-failure-complicating-chronic-obstructive-pulmonary-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Invasive mechanical ventilation in acute respiratory failure complicating chronic obstructive pulmonary disease&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Several measures have been shown to reduce COPD exacerbations, including smoking cessation, pulmonary rehabilitation, proper use of medications (including metered dose inhaler technique), and vaccination against seasonal influenza and pneumococcus.
