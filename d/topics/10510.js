The psychological complications generally take the form of adjustment disorder, depressed mood, anxiety, impoverished life satisfaction, or loss of self-esteem. The patients most at risk for depression and other psychiatric illness have advanced disease, a prior psychiatric history, poorly controlled pain, and other life stressors or losses.</p><p>In addition to these psychiatric conditions, non-specific distress and anxiety are very common in cancer patients, in addition to formal psychiatric diagnoses. Distress is the summation of multiple psychological, social, and spiritual factors. If severe enough, distress can interfere with the patient's ability to deal effectively with the illness, its symptoms, and the complications of treatment.</p><p>Specific issues regarding the management of psychiatric illness in patients with cancer are reviewed here. The diagnosis of these disorders is discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diagnosis-of-psychiatric-disorders-in-patients-with-cancer\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Diagnosis of psychiatric disorders in patients with cancer&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">ADJUSTMENT DISORDER</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The identification and diagnosis of adjustment disorder is not straightforward, but is important since many of these patients will benefit from counseling. Physicians attempting to identify individuals who could benefit from counseling should focus upon a lack of patient flexibility [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-psychiatric-disorders-in-patients-with-cancer/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>]. Those who develop adjustment disorder may be more rigid in their thinking and determined to address their cancer-related problems in the same manner as they have for prior stressors. If the old coping and problem-solving strategies fail, the person may begin to exhibit depressed mood and anxiety associated with adjustment disorder. In contrast, patients who successfully adapt typically have a flexible style [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-psychiatric-disorders-in-patients-with-cancer/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].</p><p>People with adjustment disorder have positive outcomes when they are treated with brief psychotherapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-psychiatric-disorders-in-patients-with-cancer/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. Early treatment using counselors, nurses, and other staff is helpful before the problem expands to the point of requiring more intensive care.</p><p>Psychotherapy for adjustment disorder addresses cancer-related stressors directly by teaching enhanced coping skills, focusing upon immediate problems in living caused by the disease. Establishing social support networks and psychoeducation are also important [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-psychiatric-disorders-in-patients-with-cancer/abstract/5,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,6</a>]. Informal support groups and more formal group therapy are highly effective for improving quality of life and decreasing depression and anxiety symptoms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-psychiatric-disorders-in-patients-with-cancer/abstract/7,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,8</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">DEPRESSION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The sections below discuss management and treatment of depression in patients with cancer. Treatment of major depression in the general population is discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=unipolar-major-depression-in-adults-choosing-initial-treatment\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Unipolar major depression in adults: Choosing initial treatment&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=unipolar-depression-in-adults-treatment-of-resistant-depression\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Unipolar depression in adults: Treatment of resistant depression&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H346950\"><span class=\"h2\">Prevention</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Pharmacotherapy can prevent onset of depression in patients with cancer. A 16-week randomized trail compared <a href=\"topic.htm?path=escitalopram-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">escitalopram</a> (10 or 20 mg per day) with placebo in 125 patients who were about to commence treatment for newly diagnosed or recurrent stage II to IV epidermoid cancer of the head and neck, and were not receiving treatment for depression or anxiety, and did not meet criteria for major depression [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-psychiatric-disorders-in-patients-with-cancer/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. The incidence of depression (scores on the <a href=\"http://www.ids-qids.org/&amp;token=AbH+hNktKLX8VTnqmXK1LfJBNn9U4RcpqwI3mddoyYg=&amp;TOPIC_ID=4853\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">Quick Inventory of Depressive Symptomatology-Self Rated</a> &ge;11) was less in patients treated with active drug (10 versus 25 percent). However, there was a trend for a greater rate of dropout due to adverse effects of study medication in patients who received escitalopram. Although it is reasonable to prophylactically prescribe antidepressants for some patients (eg, those with a prior history of depression), we generally monitor patients instead, based upon our judgement that additional studies are needed to confirm the results.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8601851\"><span class=\"h2\">Collaborative care</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Outpatients with cancer and mild to moderate unipolar major depression can benefit when treatment of depression occurs within the context of collaborative care (also called integrated care). Collaborative care involves treating patients with a team that usually includes a primary care clinician who prescribes antidepressants; a case manager, such as a nurse, who helps facilitate and implement treatment (which may include psychotherapy), as well as monitor treatment (using measurement-based care); and a mental health specialist, such as a psychiatrist, who provides consultation and supervision. </p><p>Evidence supporting the use of collaborative care for treating unipolar major depression in outpatients with cancer includes multiple randomized trials. As an example, a meta-analysis of five open-label randomized trials compared usual care plus collaborative care with usual care alone for treatment of depressive syndromes in patients with cancer (mixed type and stage; n &gt;1700) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-psychiatric-disorders-in-patients-with-cancer/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. Collaborative care interventions lasted 3 to 12 months and included antidepressants and psychotherapy (eg, problem solving therapy). The trials found that 12 months after treatment was initiated, improvement was greater among patients who received collaborative care, and the clinical benefit was moderate. However, heterogeneity across studies was substantial. </p><p>Additional information about collaborative care is discussed in the context of treating adult depression in the primary care setting. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=unipolar-depression-in-adult-primary-care-patients-and-general-medical-illness-evidence-for-the-efficacy-of-initial-treatments#H84010413\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Unipolar depression in adult primary care patients and general medical illness: Evidence for the efficacy of initial treatments&quot;, section on 'Collaborative care'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Pharmacotherapy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Pharmacologic interventions are the mainstay of management for patients with moderate to severe levels of depression; antidepressants are safe and effective in this setting. These drugs can alleviate depressive affect, emotional lability, irritability, and social withdrawal [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-psychiatric-disorders-in-patients-with-cancer/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. Medication also may help increase an individual's ability to participate in rehabilitation services and improve overall functioning.</p><p>Evidence supporting the use of antidepressants includes randomized trials. As an example, a systematic review of trials conducted exclusively in cancer patients found that mianserin (not available in the United States) and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=paroxetine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">paroxetine</a> were beneficial and well tolerated for treating depressive syndromes such as major depression [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-psychiatric-disorders-in-patients-with-cancer/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. In a subsequent systematic review, a meta-analysis of two trials (n = 90 patients with major depression) compared antidepressants with placebo and found no advantage for antidepressants; however, heterogeneity across studies was so large that it suggests that the results may not be meaningful [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-psychiatric-disorders-in-patients-with-cancer/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=systematic-review-and-meta-analysis#H78553636\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Systematic review and meta-analysis&quot;, section on 'Heterogeneity'</a>.)</p><p>Patients with early stage cancer are similar to the typical patient who needs an antidepressant; patients with cancer can be safely and effectively treated with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and other classes of antidepressants, using similar dose titrations as the physically healthy population. In patients with more advanced disease and increased levels of physical distress, the pharmacologic management is more complex and challenging. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=unipolar-major-depression-in-adults-choosing-initial-treatment\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Unipolar major depression in adults: Choosing initial treatment&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h3\">Antidepressant selection</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Selection of an antidepressant depends upon a number of factors.

(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cancer-pain-management-adjuvant-analgesics-coanalgesics#H874772198\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Cancer pain management: Adjuvant analgesics (coanalgesics)&quot;, section on 'Antidepressants'</a>.) Thus, patients who are experiencing pain, particularly neuropathic pain, may benefit from these agents alone or in combination with other drugs.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients with cardiovascular disease and older patients should take drugs that cause the least orthostatic hypotension (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fluoxetine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">fluoxetine</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sertraline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">sertraline</a>).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients with slow intestinal motility or urinary retention, or with stomatitis secondary to chemotherapy or radiotherapy, should receive medications with the least anticholinergic effects (eg, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors). </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients at risk for seizures or who may have a lower seizure threshold because of other medications are more safely treated with agents that will not exacerbate the problem (eg, neuroleptics). Virtually any antidepressant can have a small effect on lowering the seizure threshold.

As an example, sedation may be useful to the agitated patient who is anxious and cannot sleep, while the side effect of activation may be useful to the hypersomnolent, withdrawn patient with lethargy. In addition, some antidepressants stimulate appetite, a useful effect when appetite is decreased.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h3\">Tricyclic antidepressants</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs) have been used frequently in the cancer setting (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F53818\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef53818 \">table 2</a>). The TCAs should be started at a low dose (10 to 25 mg at bedtime) and increased slowly by 10 to 25 mg increments every one to two days until a beneficial effect is achieved. This slow titration is especially important for debilitated patients with advanced disease. Patients with cancer may exhibit a therapeutic response to the TCAs at lower doses than physically healthy individuals [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-psychiatric-disorders-in-patients-with-cancer/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. Serial plasma drug levels can be utilized to monitor the effective and safe administration of the drugs, minimizing the risk of side effects or toxicity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-psychiatric-disorders-in-patients-with-cancer/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. A cardiac history and electrocardiogram should be obtained prior to prescribing TCAs since these drugs can have an adverse effect on cardiac rhythm [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-psychiatric-disorders-in-patients-with-cancer/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>].</p><p>The tertiary amines (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=imipramine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">imipramine</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=amitriptyline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">amitriptyline</a>, and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=doxepin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">doxepin</a>) tend to sedate patients, stimulate appetite, and cause anticholinergic side effects (eg, dry mouth, blurred vision, constipation, nausea, urinary retention, and tachycardia). Their metabolites, the secondary amines (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=desipramine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">desipramine</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nortriptyline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">nortriptyline</a>) are less sedating and less anticholinergic.

A larger double-blind study suggested that fluoxetine (20 mg daily) was superior to placebo in improving depression and overall quality of life in outpatients with advanced cancer [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-psychiatric-disorders-in-patients-with-cancer/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>].</p><p>SSRIs cause fewer problems with cardiac arrhythmias, hypotension, and anticholinergic effects than the TCAs (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F62488\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef62488 \">table 1</a>). In addition, the SSRIs generally have less sedative, autonomic, and anticholinergic effects.</p><p>The SSRIs may increase blood levels of other drugs by dislodging them from blood proteins. They also inhibit the cytochrome P450 isoenzymes. Thus, blood levels of any medications that are metabolized by the P450 system may be increased.

Patients with depression and severe fatigue or psychomotor slowing, for example, may gain the most from the use of TCAs, SSRIs, or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=mirtazapine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">mirtazapine</a> plus psychostimulants. Patients with depression and anxiety or insomnia may gain the most from the combination of TCAs and SSRIs, or an SSRI with mirtazapine.</p><p>Many antidepressants require weeks to reach peak efficacy. Thus, augmentation with another medication directed at the most distressful symptom not only leads to a quicker benefit to the patient, but also may improve compliance. This symptom driven approach is particularly helpful in patients with advanced cancer in whom treatment is often complex, but immediate relief of symptom distress is a priority.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h2\">Psychosocial interventions</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients with cancer and depression are often reacting to the burden of the illness and the effect it has on their lives. Psychosocial interventions are used to help individuals, families, and groups. The general objective of this therapy is to improve coping skills through educational, behavioral, or psychodynamic approaches.</p><p>The benefits of psychotherapy in patients with advanced incurable cancer were addressed in a Cochrane review [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-psychiatric-disorders-in-patients-with-cancer/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. In six trials (292 patients in the psychotherapy arm, and 225 in the control arm), psychotherapy was associated with a significant decrease in depression score when compared to treatment as usual. However, there were no randomized trials that focused on psychotherapy in cancer patients with clinically diagnosed depression.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h3\">Crisis intervention</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Clinicians working in oncology rely primarily upon short-term supportive psychotherapy based on a crisis intervention model to help patients with depressive symptomatology. Crisis intervention is a process of actively influencing psychosocial functioning during a period of disequilibrium. It is directed at alleviating the immediate impact of disruptive stressful events. The aim is to reduce emotional distress while working toward strengthening the patient's psychological and social resources. Crisis therapy is generally time limited and asserts clear-cut goals [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-psychiatric-disorders-in-patients-with-cancer/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>].</p><p><span class=\"nowrap\">Supportive/crisis</span> intervention psychotherapy involves clarifying information and answering questions about the illness and its treatment, correcting misunderstanding, and giving reassurance about the situation. Describing common reactions to illness may help the patient and family to normalize their experience. The patients' usual adaptive strategies should be explored and strengths supported as needed in adjustment. Patients are encouraged to discuss how they feel about their lifestyle modifications, family role changes, and fears of dependency and abandonment. Themes of loss and anticipatory grief are also explored. Patients often experience loss of good health, body integrity, and self-esteem, along with losses secondary to cancer (eg, financial, social, and occupational). Therapy seeks to improve a sense of control and morale. When the focus of treatment changes from cure to palliation, it is important for patients to know that they will not be abandoned and that their comfort, pain control, and dignity will receive continued attention.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h3\">Cognitive-behavioral therapy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Cognitive-behavioral techniques are often integrated into depression therapy and are very useful and effective. These approaches explore patients' beliefs about the cancer diagnosis and its treatment in order to elicit irrational or unhelpful thoughts that lead to feelings of helplessness and hopelessness. Therapy then leads to the correction of these maladaptive thoughts along with providing new coping skills (eg, relaxation). Both group and individual treatment are effective for reducing depressive symptoms and distress and improving quality of life [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-psychiatric-disorders-in-patients-with-cancer/abstract/12,28,29\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,28,29</a>].</p><p>Cognitive-behavioral interventions help patients allay exaggerated fears by encouraging them to consider different possible outcomes for their situation. Helping the patient focus upon aspects of the disease and its treatment that they have control over and encouraging behavior modification that will keep them involved and positive could provide a better quality of life.</p><p>In addition, the benefits of cognitive-behavioral interventions appear to persist for years. As an example, a study examined patients who received surgery for early-stage breast cancer (n = 100) and participated in a randomized trial that compared cognitive-behavioral stress management (10 weeks of group therapy) with a psychoeducational seminar control condition (one day) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-psychiatric-disorders-in-patients-with-cancer/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. Assessments several years (median 11 years) after treatment found that there were fewer depressive symptoms in the group that received active treatment, and the clinical difference was medium to large.</p><p>Relaxation techniques and imagery may enhance any of these therapeutic interventions. Simple focused breathing exercises, meditation, and progressive muscle relaxation can be used to lessen the episodic anxiety that many cancer patients experience. Pleasant imagery, such as visualizing a gentle stream flowing through a beautiful landscape, may also ease the tension that some patients feel.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14\"><span class=\"h3\">Support groups</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Support groups are important adjunctive intervention modalities for cancer patients and family members who are distressed. Hospitals and community organizations will often sponsor groups that are professionally run <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> self-help. The professionally run groups usually use educational, supportive, or cognitive-behavioral methods, while lay groups focus upon education, practical advice and modeling, and serve as a source of mutual support and advocacy.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13287737\"><span class=\"h3\">Creative arts therapy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>For cancer patients, adjunctive creative arts therapies (eg, art, dance, drama, music, and writing) appear to modestly reduce depressive symptoms during treatment, but the benefit dissipates during follow-up. A meta-analysis of 11 randomized trials compared creative arts therapies with a control condition (no treatment, waiting list, or usual care) as add-on treatment in 584 patients with cancer (primarily breast or blood) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-psychiatric-disorders-in-patients-with-cancer/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]. There was a significant but clinically small benefit favoring the active intervention. However, an analysis of posttreatment follow-up effects (5 trials, 246 patients) found that depressive symptoms were comparable in both groups. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15\"><span class=\"h1\">ANXIETY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Treatment of anxiety in patients with cancer involves the combination of psychotherapy and a range of anxiolytic medications. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=generalized-anxiety-disorder-in-adults-epidemiology-pathogenesis-clinical-manifestations-course-assessment-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Generalized anxiety disorder in adults: Epidemiology, pathogenesis, clinical manifestations, course, assessment, and diagnosis&quot;</a>.) Pharmacotherapy in patients with more advanced illness includes the judicious use of benzodiazepines, neuroleptics, antihistamines, antidepressants, and opioid analgesics [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-psychiatric-disorders-in-patients-with-cancer/abstract/32,33\" class=\"abstract_t\">32,33</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H16\"><span class=\"h2\">Pharmacotherapy</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H17\"><span class=\"h3\">Benzodiazepines</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Benzodiazepines are frequently prescribed for short-term treatment of anxiety disorders [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-psychiatric-disorders-in-patients-with-cancer/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>]. The shorter acting benzodiazepines such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lorazepam-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">lorazepam</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=alprazolam-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">alprazolam</a>, and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=oxazepam-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">oxazepam</a>, are safest in patients with cancer since they are least likely to lead to toxic accumulation due to impaired metabolism in debilitated patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-psychiatric-disorders-in-patients-with-cancer/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>]. Lorazepam and oxazepam are metabolized by conjugation in the liver and are therefore the safest choice in patients with hepatic disease.</p><p>The disadvantage of using short-acting benzodiazepines is that patients often experience breakthrough anxiety or end of dose failure. Such patients may benefit from switching to longer acting benzodiazepines such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diazepam-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">diazepam</a> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clonazepam-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">clonazepam</a>; we have found clonazepam to be particularly useful in this setting. We also frequently switch patients from <a href=\"topic.htm?path=alprazolam-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">alprazolam</a> to clonazepam when attempting to taper off the former. Clonazepam may have additional uses in patients with organic mood disorders who have symptoms of mania, and as an adjuvant analgesic in patients with neuropathic pain [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-psychiatric-disorders-in-patients-with-cancer/abstract/36,37\" class=\"abstract_t\">36,37</a>].</p><p>Fears of causing respiratory depression should not prevent the clinician from using adequate doses of benzodiazepines to control anxiety. The likelihood of respiratory depression is minimized with shorter acting drugs and small dose increments; ultimately the switch can be made to longer acting drugs. Common dosage regimens include: <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lorazepam-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">lorazepam</a> 0.5 mg to 2.0 mg PO, IV or IM, every three to six hours; <a href=\"topic.htm?path=alprazolam-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">alprazolam</a> 0.25 mg to 1.0 mg PO, three to four times daily; <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diazepam-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">diazepam</a> 2.5 mg to 10 mg PO, PR, IM, or IV every 3 to 6 hours; <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clonazepam-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">clonazepam</a> 1 to 2 mg PO, two to three times daily. However, clinicians should generally avoid using benzodiazepines in conjunction with opioids.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H18\"><span class=\"h3\">Other anxiolytics</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Low-dose second-generation antipsychotics such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=olanzapine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">olanzapine</a> (eg, 1.25 to 2.5 mg once or twice per day) and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=quetiapine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">quetiapine</a> (eg, 12.5 or 25 mg once or twice per day) can be useful in the treatment of anxiety when benzodiazepines are not sufficient for symptom control [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-psychiatric-disorders-in-patients-with-cancer/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>]. Antipsychotics are also indicated when psychotic symptoms such as delusions or hallucinations accompany anxiety. Neuroleptics are probably the safest class of anxiolytics in patients for whom there is a legitimate concern of respiratory depression or compromise.</p><p>Methotrimeprazine (10 mg to 20 mg every four to eight hours, IM, IV, or SC) is a phenothiazine with unique analgesic and anxiolytic properties that is often used for the treatment of pain and anxiety in patients with advanced cancer [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-psychiatric-disorders-in-patients-with-cancer/abstract/38,39\" class=\"abstract_t\">38,39</a>]. Its side effects include sedation, anticholinergic symptoms, and hypotension. Intravenous administration by slow infusion is preferable to avoid problems with hypotension.</p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=hydroxyzine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Hydroxyzine</a> is an antihistamine with mild anxiolytic, sedative, and analgesic properties. It is particularly useful when treating anxious cancer patients with pain. A dose of 100 mg administered parenterally has analgesic potency equivalent to 8 mg of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=morphine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">morphine</a>, and also potentiates the analgesic effects of morphine [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-psychiatric-disorders-in-patients-with-cancer/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>]. As an anxiolytic, 25 mg to 50 mg of hydroxyzine every four to six hours PO, IV, or SC is effective.</p><p>The atypical antipsychotics are useful in the treatment of both &quot;functional&quot; and &quot;organic&quot; anxiety syndromes, especially in older <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> frail patients. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=generalized-anxiety-disorder-in-adults-epidemiology-pathogenesis-clinical-manifestations-course-assessment-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Generalized anxiety disorder in adults: Epidemiology, pathogenesis, clinical manifestations, course, assessment, and diagnosis&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=delirium-and-acute-confusional-states-prevention-treatment-and-prognosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Delirium and acute confusional states: Prevention, treatment, and prognosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Although not extensively studied in patients with cancer, anecdotal experience suggests that low doses of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=olanzapine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">olanzapine</a> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=risperidone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">risperidone</a> are effective and well-tolerated for the treatment of delirium and organic mental phenomena in patients with cancer, improving anxiety related to confusional states, delusions, and nausea [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-psychiatric-disorders-in-patients-with-cancer/abstract/41,42\" class=\"abstract_t\">41,42</a>]. In addition, they offer the advantage of not causing extrapyramidal symptoms in the doses generally used, ranging from 2.5 to 10 mg of olanzapine one to two times daily, and for risperidone, 0.5 to 4.0 mg one to two times daily.</p><p>TCAs, SSRIs, and heterocyclic antidepressants are the most effective treatment for anxiety accompanying depression and also are helpful in treating panic disorder [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-psychiatric-disorders-in-patients-with-cancer/abstract/43,44\" class=\"abstract_t\">43,44</a>].

Guidelines for their use are discussed in the section on depression above.</p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=buspirone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Buspirone</a> is a non-benzodiazepine anxiolytic that is useful along with psychotherapy in patients with chronic anxiety or anxiety related to adjustment disorders. The onset of anxiolytic action is delayed in comparison with the benzodiazepines, taking 5 to 10 days for relief of anxiety to begin. Buspirone is not a benzodiazepine; thus, it will not block benzodiazepine withdrawal, and caution must be used when switching from a benzodiazepine to this drug. The effective dose of buspirone is 10 mg PO three times daily [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-psychiatric-disorders-in-patients-with-cancer/abstract/45\" class=\"abstract_t\">45</a>]. Its delayed onset of action and indication for use in chronic anxiety states limit its usefulness in patients with cancer.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1073166589\"><span class=\"h3\">Investigational treatments</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Investigational treatments for managing anxiety in patients with cancer include hallucinogens. As an example, a crossover trial compared a single dose of psilocybin (0.3 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg)</span> with niacin (250 mg) in 29 patients with cancer (mixed type and stage) and acute stress disorder or an anxiety disorder [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-psychiatric-disorders-in-patients-with-cancer/abstract/46\" class=\"abstract_t\">46</a>]. The patients were randomly assigned to the order in which they received the two study drugs, which were administered seven weeks apart. All patients received psychotherapy during the study. Immediately following administration of the first study drug and at week 7, prior to crossover, symptoms of anxiety and depression were lower in the patients who first received psilocybin, compared with patients who first received niacin. Follow-up assessments were performed 26 weeks after receiving the second study drug, and showed that 60 to 80 percent of the patients continued to demonstrate clinically meaningful reductions in anxiety, depression, and hopelessness, as well as improvements in quality of life and attitude towards death.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H19\"><span class=\"h2\">Nonpharmacologic therapy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Nonpharmacologic interventions for anxiety and distress include supportive psychotherapy and behavioral interventions used alone or in combination. Brief supportive psychotherapy is often useful in dealing with both crisis-related issues as well as existential issues [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-psychiatric-disorders-in-patients-with-cancer/abstract/47\" class=\"abstract_t\">47</a>]. Psychotherapeutic interventions can include both the patient and family, particularly as the patient with cancer becomes increasingly debilitated and less able to interact. &#160;</p><p>The goals of psychotherapy for the anxious patient are to establish a bond that decreases the sense of isolation, to help the patient face cancer with a sense of integrity and self-worth, to correct misconceptions about the past and present, to integrate the present illness into a continuum of life experiences, and to explore issues of separation, loss, and the unknown that lies ahead. As in the treatment of depression, the therapist should emphasize past strengths and support previously successful ways of coping. This helps the patient mobilize inner resources, modify plans for the future, and perhaps even accept the inevitability of death.</p><p>Relaxation, guided imagery, and hypnosis may help reduce anxiety and thereby increase the patient's sense of control. Most patients with cancer, even those with advanced disease, are candidates for behavioral techniques despite physical debilitation. In assessing the utility of such interventions for a given patient, the clinician should take into account the patient's mental clarity. Confusional states interfere dramatically with the ability to focus attention and thereby limit the usefulness of these techniques, although occasionally they can be modified to include the mildly cognitively impaired [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-psychiatric-disorders-in-patients-with-cancer/abstract/48\" class=\"abstract_t\">48</a>]. This often involves the therapist taking a more active role by orienting the patient, creating a safe and secure environment, and evoking a conditioned response to the therapist's voice or presence. &#160;</p><p>A typical behavioral intervention for anxiety includes a relaxation exercise combined with some distraction or imagery technique. The patient is first taught to relax with passive breathing accompanied by either passive or active muscle relaxation. Once in a relaxed state, the patient is taught a pleasant, distracting imagery exercise. In a randomized study comparing a relaxation technique with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=alprazolam-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">alprazolam</a> in the treatment of anxiety and distress in cancer patients, both treatments were effective for mild to moderate degrees of anxiety or distress [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-psychiatric-disorders-in-patients-with-cancer/abstract/49\" class=\"abstract_t\">49</a>]. Alprazolam was more effective for greater levels of distress or anxiety and had a more rapid onset of beneficial effect. Relaxation techniques can be used in combination with anxiolytic medications for highly anxious patients.</p><p>Stress management training has been recommended to relieve psychological distress during treatment, but has given conflicting results [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-psychiatric-disorders-in-patients-with-cancer/abstract/50,51\" class=\"abstract_t\">50,51</a>]. In a trial of large patients (n = 382) about to begin chemotherapy, clinician-administered stress management training was not effective compared to usual care, whereas self-administered training was found to be beneficial [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-psychiatric-disorders-in-patients-with-cancer/abstract/50\" class=\"abstract_t\">50</a>]. In contrast, a previous trial of patients (n = 310) receiving radiation therapy found that self-administered training did not relieve psychological distress compared to usual care, except in those cases with the highest levels of initial psychosocial distress [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-psychiatric-disorders-in-patients-with-cancer/abstract/51\" class=\"abstract_t\">51</a>].</p><p>For cancer patients, adjunctive creative arts therapies (eg, art, dance, music, and writing) appear to modestly relieve anxiety symptoms during treatment, but the benefit dissipates during follow-up.

Judicious use of physical restraints, along with one-to-one nursing observation may be necessary. When supportive techniques alone are not effective, symptomatic treatment with neuroleptic or sedative medications are necessary. Sedation may be required to relieve severe agitation or insomnia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-psychiatric-disorders-in-patients-with-cancer/abstract/54\" class=\"abstract_t\">54</a>].</p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=haloperidol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Haloperidol</a> is the drug of choice for treatment of delirium in the medically ill [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-psychiatric-disorders-in-patients-with-cancer/abstract/54-56\" class=\"abstract_t\">54-56</a>]. Low doses (1 to 3 mg) are usually effective for agitation, paranoia, and fear. Typically 0.5 mg to 1.0 mg haloperidol (oral, intravenous, or intramuscular) is administered, with repeat doses every 45 to 60 minutes titrated against symptoms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-psychiatric-disorders-in-patients-with-cancer/abstract/48,57\" class=\"abstract_t\">48,57</a>]. <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lorazepam-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Lorazepam</a> 0.5 mg to 1.0 mg every one to two hours oral or intramuscular, plus haloperidol, may be more effective than the latter alone in rapidly sedating the agitated delirious patient.

Two studies found that delirium in cancer patients was associated with increased mortality [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-psychiatric-disorders-in-patients-with-cancer/abstract/60,61\" class=\"abstract_t\">60,61</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"PATIENT_INFORMATION\"><span class=\"h1\">INFORMATION FOR PATIENTS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>UpToDate offers two types of patient education materials, &ldquo;The Basics&rdquo; and &ldquo;Beyond the Basics.&rdquo; The Basics patient education pieces are written in plain language, at the 5th to 6th grade reading level, and they answer the four or five key questions a patient might have about a given condition. These articles are best for patients who want a general overview and who prefer short, easy-to-read materials. Beyond the Basics patient education pieces are longer, more sophisticated, and more detailed. These articles are written at the 10th to 12th grade reading level and are best for patients who want in-depth information and are comfortable with some medical jargon.</p><p>Here are the patient education articles that are relevant to this topic. We encourage you to print or e-mail these topics to your patients. (You can also locate patient education articles on a variety of subjects by searching on &ldquo;patient info&rdquo; and the keyword(s) of interest.) </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Beyond the Basics topics (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=delirium-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">&quot;Patient education: Delirium (Beyond the Basics)&quot;</a>)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9800440\"><span class=\"h1\">SUMMARY</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Cancer patients with adjustment disorder may respond to brief psychotherapy that addresses cancer-related stressors by teaching coping skills and focusing upon immediate problems. Psychoeducation and social support are also important, and informal support groups and formal group therapy are effective for improving quality of life and decreasing symptoms of depression and anxiety. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Adjustment disorder'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Collaborative care involves treating patients with a team that usually includes a primary care clinician (who prescribes antidepressants), a case manager (eg, nurse) who helps facilitate, implement, and monitor treatment, and a mental health specialist (eg, psychiatrist) who provides consultation and supervision. Where collaborative care is available, multiple studies indicate that collaborative care is beneficial for patients with cancer and unipolar major depression. (See <a href=\"#H8601851\" class=\"local\">'Collaborative care'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Many antidepressants are available to treat patients with cancer (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F53818\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef53818 \">table 2</a>). The choice depends upon a several factors, including specific depressive symptoms, comorbid medical problems, and side effect profiles (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F62488\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef62488 \">table 1</a>). As an example, patients with agitation or insomnia may benefit from more sedating antidepressants (eg, tricyclics, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=trazodone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">trazodone</a>, or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=mirtazapine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">mirtazapine</a>). By contrast, a better choice for patients with fatigue or psychomotor slowing may be a less sedating drug (eg, SSRIs, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=bupropion-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">bupropion</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=duloxetine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">duloxetine</a>, and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=venlafaxine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">venlafaxine</a>). (See <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Antidepressant selection'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The psychostimulants <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methylphenidate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">methylphenidate</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dextroamphetamine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">dextroamphetamine</a>, and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=modafinil-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">modafinil</a> are an option for depressed patients with cancer, either as monotherapy or adjunctive treatment with an antidepressant. (See <a href=\"#H9\" class=\"local\">'Psychostimulants'</a> above and <a href=\"#H10\" class=\"local\">'Combined therapy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Nonpharmacologic interventions for depressed cancer patients include crisis intervention, cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT), and support groups. (See <a href=\"#H11\" class=\"local\">'Psychosocial interventions'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Benzodiazepines are frequently prescribed for anxiety disorders in cancer patients. Shorter acting drugs (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lorazepam-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">lorazepam</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=alprazolam-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">alprazolam</a>, and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=oxazepam-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">oxazepam</a>) are safest, but often lead to breakthrough anxiety or end of dose failure. Thus, some patients may benefit from longer acting benzodiazepines such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clonazepam-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">clonazepam</a> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diazepam-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">diazepam</a>. (See <a href=\"#H17\" class=\"local\">'Benzodiazepines'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For cancer patients with anxiety that does not respond to a benzodiazepine, other options include antipsychotics, antihistamines (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hydroxyzine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">hydroxyzine</a>), and antidepressants. (See <a href=\"#H18\" class=\"local\">'Other anxiolytics'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Nonpharmacologic interventions for cancer patients with anxiety include supportive psychotherapy and behavioral interventions (eg, relaxation and guided imagery). (See <a href=\"#H19\" class=\"local\">'Nonpharmacologic therapy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The standard approach for managing delirious cancer patients includes determining and correcting underlying causes, and management of symptoms. Low dose <a href=\"topic.htm?path=haloperidol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">haloperidol</a> is effective for treatment of delirium that includes agitation, paranoia, and fear. (See <a href=\"#H20\" class=\"local\">'Delirium'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We encourage clinicians to print or e-mail the patient information topic about delirium.
