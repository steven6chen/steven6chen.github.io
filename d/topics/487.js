It affects more than half of all adults by the time they reach the age of 75.</p><p>Presbycusis causes you to slowly lose your hearing in both ears. It mostly affects how well you hear high-pitched sounds. That means that a person with presbycusis might have trouble hearing a bird chirping or a phone ringing but still be able to hear a truck rumbling. Also, people with presbycusis often find that they have a hard time hearing in crowded places.</p><p>Presbycusis is just one form of hearing loss that happens as you age. There are other conditions that affect hearing that also become more common with age. The most common of these is a condition called tinnitus, which means you hear ringing, buzzing, hissing, or roaring in one or both ears. Often presbycusis and tinnitus occur together.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H24673212\"><span class=\"h1\">What causes hearing loss?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>When doctors refer to hearing loss, they often talk about:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Sensorineural hearing loss</strong> &ndash; This type of hearing loss happens when nerves in the ear that register sounds and send signals to the brain are damaged. Presbycusis is a type of sensorineural hearing loss.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Conductive hearing loss</strong> &ndash; This type of hearing loss happens when sounds can't get to the inner ear because of problems in the middle or outer ear (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F55121\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef55121 \">figure 1</a>). For example, conductive hearing loss can happen if you have too much wax in your ear and sounds are being muffled. It can also happen if you have an ear infection and parts of your ear are swollen or filled with fluid.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Mixed hearing loss</strong> &ndash; Mixed hearing loss happens when both types of hearing loss mentioned above occur at the same time.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H24673243\"><span class=\"h1\">Should I see a doctor or nurse?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>See a doctor or nurse if you realize that you are having increasing trouble hearing, or if someone close to you thinks you are having trouble hearing or understanding them.</p><p>Presbycusis occurs slowly over time, so you might not notice the changes yourself. But if you lose hearing suddenly (over a few hours or a day), you should see a doctor or nurse right away. You might have a problem that is more serious than presbycusis. Sudden hearing loss can be caused by an infection or wax buildup in the ear. It can also be caused by a problem in the nerve in the ear. If this is the case, you might need medicines to prevent permanent hearing loss.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H24673258\"><span class=\"h1\">Are there tests I should have?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Your doctor or nurse will probably start by looking inside your ear using a special tool called an &quot;otoscope.&quot; That way, he or she can check if anything looks swollen, blocked, torn, or infected. Then your doctor or nurse will decide which tests you should have based on your age, medical history, other symptoms, and physical exam. If he or she suspects hearing loss, you will probably need a test called an &quot;audiogram.&quot;</p><p>A hearing specialist, called an &quot;audiologist,&quot; will do the audiogram. To do the test, you put on a headset. Then the audiologist plays sounds in one ear at a time and asks you to indicate when you hear the sounds. This test will show what type of hearing loss you have, how severe it is, and whether both ears are affected the same way.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H24673273\"><span class=\"h1\">How is hearing loss treated?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>If you have presbycusis, your ear doctor (called an &quot;otolaryngologist&quot;) will probably recommend hearing aids. But if you have other hearing problems, they might need different treatments. For instance, if you have too much wax in your ears, your doctor or nurse can remove it or teach you how to get the wax out. And if you have ringing or buzzing in your ears because of tinnitus, you might need to learn special skills to manage that problem.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Hearing aids</strong> &ndash; You might not want to wear hearing aids because they make you feel embarrassed or because you think they don't work. If your doctor recommends them, try to keep an open mind, even if you have tried them in the past. Hearing aid technology has gotten much better. There are now lots of different types of hearing aids to try. It might take a few tries to find the right type of aid and the right settings, but hearing aids can really help. The key is to work with your ear doctor until you find the best option for you. Always tell him or her if you have problems with the way your hearing aids sound or fit.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H24673288\"><span class=\"h1\">Can hearing loss be prevented?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Yes. Some forms of hearing loss can be prevented. To protect your hearing, the most important thing you can do is avoid loud noises. If you must be around loud noises, then wear ear plugs or head phones that will protect your ears.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H24673303\"><span class=\"h1\">More on this topic</span></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=tinnitus-ringing-in-the-ears-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Tinnitus (ringing in the ears) (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=outer-ear-infection-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Outer ear infection (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=ear-infections-otitis-media-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Ear infections (otitis media) (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=ear-wax-impaction-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Ear wax impaction (The Basics)</a></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=tinnitus-ringing-in-the-ears-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Tinnitus (ringing in the ears) (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=external-otitis-including-swimmers-ear-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: External otitis (including swimmer's ear) (Beyond the Basics)</a></p></div><div id=\"reviewProcess\"><span>All topics are updated as new evidence becomes available and our <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/home/editorial-policy\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"policy policy_editorialpolicy\">peer review process</a> is complete.</span></div><div id=\"topicRetrievedDate\"><span class=\"emphasis\">This topic retrieved from UpToDate on: </span>Apr 02, 2018.</div><div id=\"disclaimer\">The content on the UpToDate website is not intended nor recommended as a substitute for medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.
