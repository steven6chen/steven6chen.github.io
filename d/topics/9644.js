Kidney infections are less common than bladder infections, and are more common in women than men.</p><p>Kidney infections can usually be treated at home with antibiotics, but are sometimes treated in the hospital if the infection is severe.</p><p>This article will review the causes, symptoms, and treatment of kidney infections. An article about bladder infections is available separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=urinary-tract-infections-in-adolescents-and-adults-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">&quot;Patient education: Urinary tract infections in adolescents and adults (Beyond the Basics)&quot;</a>.)</p><p>More detailed information about kidney infections is available by subscription. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acute-uncomplicated-cystitis-in-women\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Acute uncomplicated cystitis in women&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">KIDNEY INFECTION CAUSES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Most kidney infections occur when bacteria, which normally live in the gut and travel to the genital area and from there into the bladder through the urethra. From the bladder, the bacteria travel up the ureter(s) into the kidney(s) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F79864\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef79864 \">figure 1</a>). You can have a kidney infection in one or both kidneys. </p><p>Factors that increase the risk of developing a kidney infection include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Having sex frequently or having a new sex partner</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Having diabetes</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Having a bladder or kidney infection in the past 12 months</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Using a spermicide for birth control or prevention of infection</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Having a condition that blocks or changes the flow of urine in the kidneys (eg, kidney stones, ureteral reflux)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Having a mother, sister, or daughter with a history of urinary tract infection</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">KIDNEY INFECTION SYMPTOMS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Symptoms of a kidney infection include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Fever (temperature greater than 100.4&ordm; F or 38&ordm; C)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pain in the flank (side of lower back, where the kidney is located)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Nausea <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> vomiting</p><p/><p>Some people also have burning or pain with urination, a need to rush to the bathroom frequently, bloody or cloudy urine, or pain above the pubic bone (near the bladder).</p><p>If you do not have a fever or flank pain, but you do have pain with urination, you may have a bladder infection rather than a kidney infection. Your healthcare provider can help to determine your diagnosis. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=urinary-tract-infections-in-adolescents-and-adults-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">&quot;Patient education: Urinary tract infections in adolescents and adults (Beyond the Basics)&quot;</a>.)</p><p>If you have one or more of these symptoms, you should see a healthcare provider as soon as possible. Although most kidney infections do not cause permanent damage, delaying treatment can lead to serious complications.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h1\">KIDNEY INFECTION DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Kidney infections are usually diagnosed based upon your symptoms, a physical examination, and urine testing. A urine test should be done to determine which bacteria are causing the infection and whether the usual antibiotics are likely to be effective. Imaging tests are not usually needed, but might be done if the diagnosis is not clear or if your healthcare provider suspects a blockage in the urinary tract.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h1\">KIDNEY INFECTION TREATMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The optimal treatment for a kidney infection depends upon the severity of your infection and your general health. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acute-uncomplicated-cystitis-in-women\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Acute uncomplicated cystitis in women&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Home treatment</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>If your fever and pain are mild and you are able to eat and drink, you will probably be given a one to two week course of antibiotics to take by mouth at home. The first dose of antibiotics may be given as an injection in the office, clinic, or emergency department. Let your healthcare provider know if you do not begin to feel better within one to two days after starting treatment. Your provider may need to call you to change the antibiotic if the urine test shows that you have an antibiotic-resistant bacteria causing your infection.</p><p>For fever and pain, you can take a non-prescription medication like acetaminophen (eg, Tylenol and others) or ibuprofen (Motrin, Advil).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Hospital treatment</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>If you have a high fever, severe pain, or cannot keep down <span class=\"nowrap\">food/fluids,</span> you will need to be hospitalized and given intravenous (IV) antibiotics and fluids. As you begin to improve, you will be switched to oral antibiotics and allowed to go home and continue taking antibiotics there.</p><p>Most pregnant women with a kidney infection are hospitalized and treated with intravenous (IV) antibiotics and fluids. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=urinary-tract-infections-and-asymptomatic-bacteriuria-in-pregnancy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Urinary tract infections and asymptomatic bacteriuria in pregnancy&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Recovery</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Most people recover from a kidney infection within a few days. Some people need to take time off from work or school, although this is not always necessary.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h2\">Prevention</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Ways to prevent bladder and kidney infections are discussed separately.
