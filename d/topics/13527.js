Nearly two million deaths each year have been attributed to the disorders. The prevalence of alcohol use disorders in primary care ranges from 20 to 36 percent, although the conditions are frequently untreated [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pharmacotherapy-for-alcohol-use-disorder/abstract/2,3\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,3</a>].</p><p>Psychosocial interventions are effective in the treatment of alcohol abuse and dependence; however, as many as 70 percent of individuals relapse after psychosocial treatment alone [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pharmacotherapy-for-alcohol-use-disorder/abstract/4-7\" class=\"abstract_t\">4-7</a>]. Several medications can be used to treat alcohol use disorder, leading to reduced heavy drinking and increased days of abstinence [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pharmacotherapy-for-alcohol-use-disorder/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. There is little evidence on the effectiveness of medication in the treatment of nondependent alcohol abuse.</p><p>The psychiatric diagnoses, alcohol abuse and alcohol dependence, in DSM-IV-TR were replaced by one diagnosis, alcohol use disorder, in DSM-5 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pharmacotherapy-for-alcohol-use-disorder/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. Although the crosswalk between DSM-IV and DSM-5 disorders is imprecise, alcohol dependence is approximately comparable to alcohol use disorder, moderate to severe subtype, while alcohol abuse is similar to the mild subtype. </p><p>This topic focuses on medication in the treatment of alcohol use disorder. The epidemiology, pathogenesis, clinical manifestations, assessment, and diagnosis of alcohol use disorder, as well as psychosocial treatments for the disorder, are discussed separately.

Medication development has focused on several neurotransmitter systems that interact with the corticomesolimbic dopamine (CMDA) pathway, which can mediate reinforcement. Many available or promising compounds appear to act by modulating the function of opioids, glutamate (with or without gamma aminobutyric acid, GABA), and serotonin (5-HT). </p><p>Some alcohol-dependent individuals possess a biological predisposition to the disease. These biologically vulnerable alcoholics may benefit from specific adjunctive medications addressing the underlying abnormalities.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">TREATMENT PRINCIPLES AND OVERVIEW</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Indications</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Nearly all clinical trials finding medications efficacious for alcohol use disorders studied recently abstinent patients with a DSM-IV-TR diagnosis of alcohol dependence. Applying these findings to patients diagnosed under DSM-V is imprecise, but the most closely comparable group of patients are those with alcohol use disorder, moderate to severe subtype (ie, patients with four or more symptoms within a 12-month period) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pharmacotherapy-for-alcohol-use-disorder/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. DSM-V criteria for the diagnosis of alcohol use disorder are described separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=risky-drinking-and-alcohol-use-disorder-epidemiology-pathogenesis-clinical-manifestations-course-assessment-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Risky drinking and alcohol use disorder: Epidemiology, pathogenesis, clinical manifestations, course, assessment, and diagnosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Pharmacotherapy should be used in patients with alcohol use disorder, moderate to severe subtype, who:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Have current, heavy use and ongoing risk for consequences from use</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Are motivated to reduce alcohol intake</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Prefer medication along with or instead of a psychosocial intervention</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Do not have medical contraindications to the individual drug</p><p/><p>Most data on the efficacy of pharmacotherapy are not generalizable to patients with the mild subtype of alcohol use disorder. Patients with a mild subtype alcohol use disorder who are currently drinking heavily and risk serious consequences can be considered for these treatments on a case-by-case basis. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Goals</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The traditional goal of treatment for alcohol use disorder is abstinence, which remains a primary treatment focus. In addition, reduction of heavy drinking has become accepted as an alternative treatment goal. The frequency of heavy drinking (defined as more than five drinks per day for men and four for women) shows the highest correlation with negative life consequences such as impaired driving, interpersonal problems, and injuries [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pharmacotherapy-for-alcohol-use-disorder/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. Reduction of heavy drinking may be a more acceptable goal for some patients who lack readiness to quit drinking [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pharmacotherapy-for-alcohol-use-disorder/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Initiation and duration</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Pharmacologic treatment for alcohol use disorder is often initiated during hospitalization for alcohol intoxication or withdrawal. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ambulatory-management-of-alcohol-withdrawal\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Ambulatory management of alcohol withdrawal&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-moderate-and-severe-alcohol-withdrawal-syndromes\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of moderate and severe alcohol withdrawal syndromes&quot;</a>.)</p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=naltrexone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Naltrexone</a> can be initiated while the individual is still drinking. This permits treatment for alcohol use disorder to be provided in community-based practice at the point of maximum crisis without the need for enforced abstinence or detoxification [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pharmacotherapy-for-alcohol-use-disorder/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. <a href=\"topic.htm?path=disulfiram-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Disulfiram</a>, which by intent leads to adverse effects when combined with alcohol intake, should only be used by abstinent patients in the context of treatment intended to maintain abstinence. Research indicates that <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acamprosate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">acamprosate</a> should be used once abstinence is achieved.</p><p>After initiating medication treatment, follow-up visits should be sufficiently frequent to provide the patient with encouragement and support, to engage family members if helpful, and to monitor the patients for treatment response, side effects, medication adherence, and early signs of relapse, which can lead to serious complications [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pharmacotherapy-for-alcohol-use-disorder/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. </p><p>The optimal duration of pharmacotherapy is not known. Most trials studied the effect of treatment over two to six months. Experts recommend at least six months of medication with an additional six months of follow-up. The efficacy of medication treatment wanes once medications are discontinued. Of the medications described below, only <a href=\"topic.htm?path=topiramate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">topiramate</a> requires a taper to discontinue, over a two-week period.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h1\">FIRST-LINE MEDICATIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span><a href=\"topic.htm?path=naltrexone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Naltrexone</a> cannot be given to patients taking opioids. If opioids are required to treat pain, naltrexone should be discontinued. Naltrexone is contraindicated in acute hepatitis or liver failure.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Oral naltrexone</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span><a href=\"topic.htm?path=naltrexone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Naltrexone</a> exerts its principal pharmacological effects through blockade of the mu-opioid receptor. Endogenous opioids are involved in modulating the expression of alcohol's reinforcing effects [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pharmacotherapy-for-alcohol-use-disorder/abstract/14,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">14,15</a>]. Mice that lack the mu-opioid receptor do not self-administer alcohol [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pharmacotherapy-for-alcohol-use-disorder/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. Naltrexone also modifies the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis to suppress ethanol consumption [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pharmacotherapy-for-alcohol-use-disorder/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>].</p><p>The usual dose of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=naltrexone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">naltrexone</a> is 50 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day,</span> but some trials have used up to 100 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pharmacotherapy-for-alcohol-use-disorder/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h3\">Efficacy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Multiple metaanalysis of clinical trials for alcohol dependence found <a href=\"topic.htm?path=naltrexone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">naltrexone</a> to reduce alcohol consumption compared with placebo [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pharmacotherapy-for-alcohol-use-disorder/abstract/19,20\" class=\"abstract_t\">19,20</a>]. As an example, a 2010 meta-analysis of 50 randomized trials with 7793 alcohol dependent participants found that naltrexone reduced the risk of heavy drinking to 83 percent of the risk in the placebo group (relative risk [RR] 0.83, 95% CI 0.76-0.90) and decreased drinking days by about 4 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pharmacotherapy-for-alcohol-use-disorder/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>].</p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=naltrexone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Naltrexone</a> may be particularly efficacious in individuals with genetic susceptibility. Preliminary evidence suggests that individuals with the Asp variant of the OPRM1 gene are less likely to experience relapse when receiving naltrexone, but further study is needed to confirm the finding [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pharmacotherapy-for-alcohol-use-disorder/abstract/18,21\" class=\"abstract_t\">18,21</a>].

Fivefold elevation in liver enzymes occurred in 11 of 614 patients who received naltrexone in the COMBINE Study. Enzyme levels returned to baseline after discontinuation of medication in the nine patients who had stopped drinking and returned for follow-up [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pharmacotherapy-for-alcohol-use-disorder/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>].

There are three extended-release, injectable formulations of naltrexone (Vivitrol, Naltrel, and Depotrex). There are no published head-to-head comparisons of their efficacy or bioavailability.</p><p>Only Vivitrol has been approved for use in the US, at a dose of 380 mg every four weeks. The injectable suspension should be administered via intramuscular injection to the gluteal area using the provided 1.5 inch 20-gauge needle. The US Food and Drug Administration has warned against other forms of administration including IV or injection subcutaneously or into fatty tissue on the basis of post-marketing reports of serious injection site reactions (See <a href=\"#H10\" class=\"local\">'Adverse effects'</a> above.).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h3\">Efficacy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A large randomized trial found subjects receiving Vivitrol 380 mg monthly had a 25 percent greater reduction in the rate of heavy drinking after 24 weeks compared with those receiving placebo (HR 0.75, 95% CI 0.60-0.94) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pharmacotherapy-for-alcohol-use-disorder/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. While subgroup analysis suggested that the treatment may be less effective in women, the proportion of women in this study was relatively small, and these findings may be due to patient characteristics that differed between men and women.</p><p>A multi-site randomized trial of the Naltrel formulation did not show a significant difference in the primary outcome, time to first heavy-drinking day, compared with placebo (median of 11 versus 6 days) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pharmacotherapy-for-alcohol-use-disorder/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>].

As an example, a meta-analysis of 24 randomized trials of 6915 participants compared treatment with acamprosate to placebo or active control [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pharmacotherapy-for-alcohol-use-disorder/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. Acamprosate reduced the rate of patients returning to any drinking (relative risk [RR] 0.86, 95% CI 0.81-0.91; NNT = 9) and increased the cumulative abstinence duration by an average of 11 percent. Acamprosate was found not to have a significant effect on heavy drinking. </p><p>The evidence on the efficacy of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acamprosate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">acamprosate</a> has evolved over time and requires further investigation. A 2004 meta-analysis of the 17 European trials found that acamprosate increased six-month abstinence rates compared with placebo (36.1 versus 23.4 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pharmacotherapy-for-alcohol-use-disorder/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. Positive results were primarily seen for maintenance of abstinence rather than reduction of drinking by non-abstinent patients.</p><p>Three subsequent trials conducted in the US and Australia found <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acamprosate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">acamprosate</a> did not improve primary outcomes, including percentage of alcohol-free days and time to first heavy drinking [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pharmacotherapy-for-alcohol-use-disorder/abstract/18,29,30\" class=\"abstract_t\">18,29,30</a>]. One of the trials, the COMBINE Study, found acamprosate (either alone or in conjunction with a psychosocial intervention) to be no more effective than placebo, while <a href=\"topic.htm?path=naltrexone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">naltrexone</a> was significantly more effective than placebo, indicating that the trial was adequately designed and powered to detect significant effects [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pharmacotherapy-for-alcohol-use-disorder/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>].

As many as 70 percent of individuals relapse after psychosocial treatment alone. (See <a href=\"#H1\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pharmacologic treatment of alcohol abuse use disorder has mostly focused on altering the reinforcing effects of alcohol use. Many available or promising medications appear to act by modulating the function of opioids, glutamate (with or without GABA), or serotonin. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Neurobiology'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Goals for treatment include abstinence, the traditional objective of alcohol treatment, or reduction of heavy drinking, a measure of alcohol intake strongly related to negative life consequences. (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Treatment principles and overview'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We suggest that patients with moderate to severe alcohol use disorder initially be offered a choice of medication or an evidence-based psychosocial intervention, or both (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). Patients with the mild subtype, current heavy drinking, and risk of serious consequences can be considered for medication treatment on a case-by-case basis. All patients should receive some psychosocial treatment.

Depot naltrexone should be used when there is a significant risk of nonadherence with daily administration; patients should be monitored for injection site reactions.
