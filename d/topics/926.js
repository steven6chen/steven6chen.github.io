Though most PRAEs are easily managed, more significant events can occur. According to data from the Pediatric Perioperative Cardiac Arrest Registry, after cardiovascular causes, respiratory events were the second-most common cause of perioperative cardiac arrests in children, with laryngospasm being the most likely cause for respiratory-induced cardiac arrests [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anesthesia-for-the-child-with-a-recent-upper-respiratory-infection/abstract/11,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,12</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10952723\"><span class=\"h2\">Time course of PRAE risk</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Airway hyperreactivity, which increases the risk of laryngospasm and bronchospasm, decreases over time with a URI, though the literature on the time course of resolution is inconsistent.

Other risk factors that increased the incidence of PRAEs in children with active URIs include a history of reactive airway disease, surgical procedure on the airway, a history of prematurity, exposure to second-hand cigarette smoke, nasal congestion or copious secretions, and endotracheal intubation.

In general, increasing airway stimulation is associated with higher risk of at least some PRAEs (ie, mask ventilation &lt; supraglottic airway &lt; endotracheal intubation). A metaanalysis of 16 randomized controlled studies including 1240 children &lt;12 years of age that compared laryngeal mask airways (LMAs) with ETT for anesthesia reported increased cough and postoperative sore throat with ETT, but no difference in the incidence of bronchospasm or laryngospasm on emergence [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anesthesia-for-the-child-with-a-recent-upper-respiratory-infection/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. </p><p>The effect of the choice of airway device on the risk of PRAEs in small infants is unclear; many studies comparing LMAs with ETT have either excluded infants or did not specify patient ages. In one single center study, 180 infants &lt;1 year of age were randomly assigned to LMA or ETT for airway management for general anesthesia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anesthesia-for-the-child-with-a-recent-upper-respiratory-infection/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. LMAs were associated with a lower risk of all perioperative PRAEs than ETTs (18 versus 53 percent) and a lower risk of laryngospasm and bronchospasm (4 versus 19 percent). However, it may not be possible to generalize the results of this study, as the incidence of PRAE was unusually high, criteria for extubation were not specified, the anesthetic techniques were not standardized, and all patients were cared for by attending pediatric anesthesia specialists. Therefore, further study is required before basing the choice of airway device for infants on the risk of PRAEs.</p><p>Many pediatric anesthesiologists, including this author, routinely use an ETT rather than a supraglottic airway for small infants. SGAs may not seat well in infants, and tend to become dislodged. Infants desaturate quickly, and there is less time to react to problems with the airway device. In addition, the infant&rsquo;s airway may not be easily accessible, and it can be difficult to rescue a malpositioned SGA or replace it with an endotracheal tube. We extubate most patients with ETT awake, to avoid the chance of laryngospasm on emergence.

The COLDS score does not designate a cutoff that would indicate a safe anesthetic; it can serve as a reminder of all factors one should consider. It helps in identifying where on the spectrum of perioperative risk a particular patient lies. If this risk is acceptable, the decision to proceed or postpone still needs to be made based on local resources and individual experience.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H538466258\"><span class=\"h1\">PREOPERATIVE EVALUATION</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H538466265\"><span class=\"h2\">History</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Most decisions regarding the anesthetic plan for children with an upper respiratory infection (URI) can be made based on history and physical examination, if not by history alone. Signs and symptoms that should be elicited include fever, clear or green nasal secretions, wet or dry cough, wheezing, changes in respiratory pattern, shortness of breath, anorexia, malaise, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> changes in playfulness and physical activity. The disease course of sick contacts in the patient's family can help predict the course of the illness.</p><p>Simply asking the parents whether a child is sick is an important part of preoperative evaluation. A case-control study of 123 children who developed perioperative laryngospasm found that laryngospasm was twice as likely in patients with an active URI, as defined by the parents, compared with those without an active URI [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anesthesia-for-the-child-with-a-recent-upper-respiratory-infection/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>].</p><p>Most often, a patient with a significant URI who is scheduled for an elective procedure can be advised to postpone the procedure during a preoperative screening phone call the day before the anesthetic. Postponement before the patient even reaches the healthcare facility avoids unnecessary fasting, interruption of the operating room schedule, economic hardship, and inconvenience for the patient and family. At our institution, the nurses who make the preoperative phone calls are authorized to cancel elective cases at the time of the phone call if symptoms of URI are present.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10952260\"><span class=\"h2\">Physical examination</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients should be examined for obvious signs of a URI such as nasal discharge, repeated coughing, a sick appearance, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> fever. The chest should be auscultated for wheezing, crackles, or rhonchi as signs of lower respiratory infection. Inspection of the throat can help in making a more specific diagnosis (eg, patients with coxsackie infections who present with herpangina).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H538466285\"><span class=\"h2\">Laboratory and radiologic examination</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Preoperative laboratory and radiologic evaluation are rarely necessary or helpful for otherwise healthy children with a URI. The need for testing should be individualized based on patient comorbidities and the surgical procedure. For example, for ex-premature infants who need elective procedures, it may be helpful to rule out a respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infection, as RSV infection at the time of anesthesia has been associated with increased risk of unplanned postoperative intensive care unit (ICU) admission and increased length of hospital stay [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anesthesia-for-the-child-with-a-recent-upper-respiratory-infection/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>].</p><p>Blood tests for immunologic markers of allergic sensitization and systemic inflammation are not useful predictors of perioperative respiratory adverse events (PRAEs) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anesthesia-for-the-child-with-a-recent-upper-respiratory-infection/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H723210088\"><span class=\"h2\">Timing of elective procedures</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Timing of elective surgery for a child with current or recent URI symptoms remains controversial. Although clinical practice varies widely, a survey of approximately 200 pediatric anesthesiologists reported that those with more clinical experience were more conservative compared with anesthesiologists with less experience [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anesthesia-for-the-child-with-a-recent-upper-respiratory-infection/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. While each situation must be individualized, taking into account both medical and practical concerns, our approach is generally as follows:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>URI found on preoperative screening </strong>&ndash; For children who are found during preoperative screening prior to an elective procedure to have or have had a URI, we postpone the procedure until two to four weeks after symptoms subside.

In general, we proceed with elective procedures for older children who have been asymptomatic for more than one week. We often postpone the procedure for two to four weeks for younger, higher-risk patients who are to undergo higher-risk procedures.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span><strong>URI two to four weeks</strong> <strong>ago</strong> &ndash; We do not usually postpone a procedure when a patient has been asymptomatic for two to four weeks after a URI, recognizing that airway hyperreactivity may persist for up to six weeks.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Urgent procedures </strong>&ndash;<strong> </strong>For patients who present with a URI for urgent or semiurgent procedures, the risks and benefits of postponement should be weighed in a discussion between the anesthesiologist, the surgeon, and the other care providers. When we proceed, we medically optimize as time allows. For urgent procedures, we administer inhaled beta<sub>2</sub> agonists and a nasal decongestant, as needed. Truly emergent procedures that cannot wait until an inhaled beta<sub>2</sub> agonist or a nasal decongestant is administered are rare.

In many cases, the airway device can be removed either &quot;deep,&quot; while the patient is still deeply anesthetized, or awake. Deep extubation can result in smoother emergence without the irritation of the airway device in place. We usually extubate patients with upper respiratory tract infections (URIs) deep unless there is a contraindication, such as blood or secretions in the airway (eg, during ear, nose, and throat procedures) or previous difficulty with mask ventilation or intubation.</p><p>Literature on the risk of PRAEs related to the timing of extubation is inconsistent. One prospective study of approximately 1100 anesthetized children with and without current or recent URIs found that the depth of anesthesia at the time of removal of either an endotracheal tube (ETT) or a laryngeal mask airway (LMA) had no effect on the incidence of PRAEs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anesthesia-for-the-child-with-a-recent-upper-respiratory-infection/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].
