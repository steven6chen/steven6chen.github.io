They are associated with predictable defects in complement-dependent function, as the affected individual loses not only the activity of the deficient protein, but also the functions of the proteins that follow in the cascade.</p><p>Inherited complement deficiencies are classified into two general categories: 1) integral component defects and 2) regulatory component defects [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/inherited-disorders-of-the-complement-system/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Inherited disorders of the complement system will be reviewed here. Acquired disorders and the general evaluation of the complement system are discussed separately.

SLE commonly develops in individuals deficient in an early component of the classical pathway (ie, C1q, C1r, C1s, C4, and C2). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=systemic-lupus-erythematosus-sle-in-children-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) in children: Clinical manifestations and diagnosis&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-the-clinical-manifestations-of-systemic-lupus-erythematosus-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of the clinical manifestations of systemic lupus erythematosus in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2245866\"><span class=\"h2\">Deficiencies in regulatory proteins</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients with deficiencies of certain complement regulatory proteins develop specific disorders resulting from undesirable complement activation. Inherited complete deficiencies of regulators lead to consumption of multiple components in a pathway. In contrast, haploinsufficiency leads to an excessive local inflammatory response at a site of injury or debris accumulation and commonly requires an underlying trigger, such as endothelial cell damage. As examples, heterozygous deficiency of C1 inhibitor causes hereditary angioedema, an autosomal dominant disorder, while haploinsufficiency of factor H predisposes to atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome (aHUS) and age-related macular degeneration (AMD) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/inherited-disorders-of-the-complement-system/abstract/18-22\" class=\"abstract_t\">18-22</a>]. Homozygous factor H deficiency results in alternative pathway activation, cleavage and consumption of C3 and factor B, and increased susceptibility to pyogenic infections. Heterozygous deficiency of factor I is also associated with both aHUS and AMD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/inherited-disorders-of-the-complement-system/abstract/18,23\" class=\"abstract_t\">18,23</a>].

Two abnormal alleles must be present to yield complete deficiency, and, in most cases, only patients with a complete deficiency are symptomatic. Heterozygous deficiencies in which individuals have 50 percent of a component are almost always asymptomatic (eg, parents of children with C3 or C5 deficiency). The association of partial C4 deficiency with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/inherited-disorders-of-the-complement-system/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>] reflects the presence of a C4A null gene on the associated human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-B8, DR3 conserved, extended haplotype [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/inherited-disorders-of-the-complement-system/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. Other extended major histocompatibility complex (MHC) haplotypes with null C4A or null C4B genes are not increased among patients. (See <a href=\"#H8\" class=\"local\">'C4 deficiency'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Indications for screening</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Screening for a classical complement pathway defect as a cause of recurrent infections is indicated in patients with any of the following [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/inherited-disorders-of-the-complement-system/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Recurrent, unexplained pyogenic infections in the setting of normal white blood cell counts and immunoglobulin levels in children (ie, no obvious cause)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Recurrent Neisserial infections at any age</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Multiple family members with Neisserial infections</p><p/><p>In addition, it is reasonable to check, at least once, a total hemolytic complement (THC or CH50) in any patient with SLE. This is particularly relevant in those with familial lupus or subacute cutaneous lupus in whom C2 deficiency should be considered.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Screening CH50 and interpretation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The total hemolytic complement (THC or CH50) assay is a reliable screen for a homozygous deficiency in an integral component of the classical pathway.</p><p>Care must be taken in the handling of serum specimens since complement hemolytic activity is unstable and heat-labile and can be reduced after a few hours at room temperature. Also, another cause for low- or zero-complement activity in patients is cold activation by immune complexes <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> cryoglobulins [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/inherited-disorders-of-the-complement-system/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-and-clinical-assessment-of-the-complement-system\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview and clinical assessment of the complement system&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The CH50 measures the capacity of a patient's serum to lyse sheep erythrocytes coated with rabbit antibody directed against antigens on the red blood cell (RBC) membrane. All nine components of the classical pathway (C1 through C9) are required for a normal CH50, which is 150 to 250 <span class=\"nowrap\">units/mL</span> in a commonly used assay system. For example, a CH50 of 200 <span class=\"nowrap\">units/mL</span> means that a serum sample diluted 1:200 lysed 50 percent of the antibody-coated sheep erythrocytes (measured by hemoglobin release) in the test mixture.</p><p>An elevated CH50 has no specific clinical significance other than to reflect that complement proteins increase as part of the acute-phase response.</p><p>Individuals with heterozygous deficiency will generally have a normal CH50 because the level of a component must be reduced by more than 50 percent before the CH50 is altered. Heterozygous C2 deficiency is one exception. C2 is the limiting component in a CH50 determination, and patients with heterozygous C2 deficiency tend to have mildly-low CH50 values. (See <a href=\"#H9\" class=\"local\">'C2 deficiency'</a> below.)</p><p>A complete deficiency of any one integral component gives an undetectable CH50 value (often reported as less than some specified low value), with the exception of C9 deficiency. Homozygous C9 deficiency, which is most often reported in East Asian patients of Japanese or Korean descent, gives a low, but detectable CH50 titer [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/inherited-disorders-of-the-complement-system/abstract/28,29\" class=\"abstract_t\">28,29</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H11\" class=\"local\">'C5-C9 deficiency'</a> below.)</p><p>If a patient is found to have a very low or undetectable CH50, the first step is to repeat the test. If it is low again, then the next step is the measurement of specific complement proteins. C2 deficiency is most commonly observed on the HLA-B18, DR2 extended haplotype. Heterozygotes thus constitute a little over 1 percent of European Caucasians and homozygotes are seen in approximately 1 in 20,000 individuals of this population [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/inherited-disorders-of-the-complement-system/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. If C2 is normal, then a complete deficiency of C1q, C4, C3, or a membrane attack component (C5, C6, C7, C8, or C9) should be tested next. Complete deficiencies of these components (other than C2) have only been described in approximately 30 to 100 individuals each.</p><p>Another approach is to perform an alternative pathway (AH50) assay. This test, although not as widely available, can be performed in referral laboratories. A Neisserial infection is the most common indication for this diagnostic approach. If AH50 is also very low or undetectable, then the deficiency is most likely of C3, C5, C6, C7, C8, or C9, as these components overlap in CH50 and AH50 assays. If more than one component is low, the problem is almost always an acquired deficiency or lack of a regulator (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F56374\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef56374 \">figure 1</a>).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2768570194\"><span class=\"h2\">Genetic screening</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Whole genome, whole exome, and targeted deep sequencing are increasingly utilized for the specific diagnosis of complete or partial (haploinsufficiency) complement deficiencies. Examples of the latter are those for atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome (aHUS) and age-related macular degeneration (AMD). Likewise, testing for copy number variation (CNV) is becoming more common. It is likely that all patients with SLE will be evaluated for CNV of C4 at the time of diagnosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/inherited-disorders-of-the-complement-system/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. Relative to aHUS, many centers now perform targeted deep sequencing on 6 to 10 genes for patients with aHUS to facilitate diagnosis, decide on treatment, and evaluate for transplantation in patients with a history of thrombotic microangiopathy.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Specific disorders</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h3\">C1 deficiency</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Although any one of the three subcomponents (C1q, C1r, or C1s) of the C1 complex may be deficient, the most common inherited deficiency is of C1q.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>More than 90 percent of C1q-deficient individuals develop SLE and they may also have recurrent bacterial infections. Most of these patients have typical clinical and serologic findings of SLE. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=systemic-lupus-erythematosus-sle-in-children-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) in children: Clinical manifestations and diagnosis&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-the-clinical-manifestations-of-systemic-lupus-erythematosus-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of the clinical manifestations of systemic lupus erythematosus in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A deficiency of the serine protease C1r or C1s also results in the development of SLE, with prominent renal and cutaneous sequelae. C1r or C1s homozygous deficiency is exceptionally rare (ie, fewer than 10 cases reported). Some of these patients have deficiencies of both C1r and C1s, consistent with the close linkage of the genes for these two homologous proteins.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h3\">C4 deficiency</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Total deficiency of C4 is rare. Approximately 80 percent of patients present with SLE that is often severe and begins at an early age. Partial deficiency of C4 is common as part of the HLA-B8, DR3 extended haplotype that also predisposes to the development of SLE [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/inherited-disorders-of-the-complement-system/abstract/24,30\" class=\"abstract_t\">24,30</a>]. It is unclear whether the C4A deficiency alone or some other gene on the 1.4 to 5 Mb haplotype is also responsible. The authors strongly argue that it is C4A deficiency that is the predisposing genetic cause [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/inherited-disorders-of-the-complement-system/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]. A borderline or low C4 (with normal C3) is observed in 1 to 3 percent of the Caucasian population, and most of these individuals are asymptomatic. However, complete C4A deficiency (missing both C4A genes, reflecting homozygosity for HLA-B8, DR3) increases one's risk of SLE. In the Caucasian population, 5 to 10 percent of SLE patients will be C4A-deficient.</p><p>C4 is encoded as two highly polymorphic genes, C4A and C4B, which are located in the MHC on chromosome 6. Fifty to 65 percent of the population carries two C4A and two C4B genes. In the rest of the population, at least one or more C4A <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> C4B gene(s) are deleted or duplicated. An individual may carry one to eight functional C4 genes. These differences in gene number are referred to as copy number variation.</p><p>The more null (nonexpressed) C4 alleles an individual possesses, the greater the predisposition to SLE. Genetic testing is required to determine the number and type of C4 genes. In the future, there will be genetic tests to allow for rapid assessment of gene copy number, although at present this is usually performed for research purposes. Levels of C4 may be 0, 25, 50, or 75 percent of normal depending upon whether the individual inherits four, three, two, or one nonexpressed allele(s), respectively. In these individuals, C4 is borderline low throughout life and, if SLE develops, C4 drops even lower. Such patients will continue to show low or low-normal total C4, even with successful treatment of the disease. This can cause confusion when a patient with SLE is treated and there is resolution of clinical symptoms and C3 levels normalize but C4 levels remain low. There are two explanations for this picture:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The disease is in remission and patient is C4A-deficient (lacks expressed C4A genes, for example) such that the patient will always have a low C4</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">OR</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>There is ongoing but reduced classical pathway activation.</p><p/><p>(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diagnosis-and-differential-diagnosis-of-systemic-lupus-erythematosus-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Diagnosis and differential diagnosis of systemic lupus erythematosus in adults&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-the-clinical-manifestations-of-systemic-lupus-erythematosus-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of the clinical manifestations of systemic lupus erythematosus in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2245115\"><span class=\"h4\">Low C4 in the patient with SLE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The interpretation of a low C4 in a patient with SLE can be complicated. Reduced levels may be due to consumption as well as to deficiency of one or more alleles. Both causes may be present in a given patient. The underlying mechanisms can sometimes be distinguished by the following observations:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Consumption is associated with a reduction in multiple complement components. As an example, low C4, C2, and C3 indicate consumption.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Inherited complement deficiency is characterized by the fixed absence of a single complement component, whereas consumption fluctuates over time.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>If there is still uncertainty, a blood sample can be sent to a commercial laboratory specializing in complement tests. To determine the number of C4 alleles at the DNA level, the sample would need to be sent to a research laboratory. Human leukocyte antigen (HLA) typing can determine if the patient carries the HLA-B8, DR3 haplotype. Definitive reviews have been published on determining copy number of C4 genes in a large number of normal controls and SLE patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/inherited-disorders-of-the-complement-system/abstract/24,31-33\" class=\"abstract_t\">24,31-33</a>].</p><p/><p>Although not recommended for routine assessment of complement consumption, another option is to measure complement activation products. Elevated levels suggest that SLE (or other diseases in question) is active, while low levels imply that consumption is greater than synthesis. However, measurement of complement activation products is not routinely available and is also plagued by activation during procurement and freeze-thawing.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2245128\"><span class=\"h4\">Other associated disorders</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Deficiency of C4A or C4B as parts of various extended MHC haplotypes has also been associated with the development of other disorders. These include scleroderma, immunoglobulin A (IgA) nephropathy, immunoglobulin A vasculitis (IgAV; Henoch-Sch&ouml;nlein purpura [HSP]), childhood diabetes mellitus, chronic forms of noninfectious hepatitis, membranous nephropathy, and subacute sclerosing panencephalitis.</p><p>One report identified a strikingly high frequency of capillary leak syndrome (CLS) in children undergoing cardiac surgery with cardiopulmonary bypass who were C4A null (ie, no C4A protein in their blood) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/inherited-disorders-of-the-complement-system/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>]. If these patients were given C4A-rich blood, only 3 of 58 developed CLS. If they were given blood lacking C4A, 56 (97 percent) developed CLS. The authors are unaware of a confirmatory report.

The main clinical manifestations are recurrent infections with encapsulated bacteria, systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), or both. Deficiencies in complement regulatory proteins can lead to specific disorders resulting from unregulated complement activity. (See <a href=\"#H35196879\" class=\"local\">'Clinical manifestations'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Deficiencies in the early components of the classical complement pathway (ie, C1q, C1r, C1s, C4, and C2) predispose patients to autoimmune disorders, particularly SLE. Recurrent infections may also be seen. (See <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'C1 deficiency'</a> above and <a href=\"#H8\" class=\"local\">'C4 deficiency'</a> above and <a href=\"#H9\" class=\"local\">'C2 deficiency'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Deficiencies in late components (C3-C9) of the classical complement pathway predispose patients to recurrent infections, especially pneumococcal and H. influenzae (with C3 deficiency) and Neisserial infections (with C5, C6, C7, C8, or C9 deficiency). (See <a href=\"#H10\" class=\"local\">'C3 deficiency'</a> above and <a href=\"#H11\" class=\"local\">'C5-C9 deficiency'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The total hemolytic complement (THC or CH50) assay is an effective screening test for a complete deficiency of a component of the classical pathway. Complete deficiency generally yields a very low or undetectable CH50 value (with the exception of complete C9 deficiency). Individuals with a heterozygous-component deficiency are usually healthy and have normal CH50 values. (See <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Screening CH50 and interpretation'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The alternative pathway (AH50) assay is a screen for deficiencies in properdin, factor B, and factor D. Properdin is the most common component of the alternative pathway to be deficient. Properdin deficiency is X-linked and presents in males as a familial predisposition to Neisserial infections, especially meningitis. Inherited defects in factors D and B have only been described in a few case reports. (See <a href=\"#H12\" class=\"local\">'Alternative pathway deficiencies'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Partial deficiencies (haploinsufficiencies) in complement regulators factor H, factor I, or membrane cofactor protein (MCP) predispose to atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome (aHUS). A common polymorphism in factor H is associated with increased risk for age-related macular degeneration (AMD). The largest number of rare variants in AMD has been identified in factor I. The patients tend to have severe, bilateral disease at a relatively young age (&lt;70 years). Also, rare variants in factor H, factor I, factor B, and C3 predispose to AMD. Likewise, a gain-of-function (GOF) in C3 or factor B predispose to aHUS and C3 glomerulopathy. Overall, such genetic variants cause an increase in the activity of the alternative pathway. (See <a href=\"#H17\" class=\"local\">'Abnormalities in regulatory proteins'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The management of complement-deficient patients involves education of the patient in vigilance for early signs of infection and vaccination against the organisms to which the patient is susceptible. (See <a href=\"#H23\" class=\"local\">'Care of the complement-deficient patient'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H145331402\"><span class=\"h1\">ACKNOWLEDGMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The editorial staff at UpToDate would like to acknowledge E Richard Stiehm, MD, who contributed as a Section Editor to an earlier version of this topic review.</p></div><div id=\"topicAgreement\">Use of UpToDate is subject to the <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/legal/license\" class=\"licenseLink\" id=\"sla_in_page\">Subscription and License Agreement</a>.</div><div id=\"references\" class=\"headingAnchor\"><h1>REFERENCES</h1><ol id=\"reference\"><li><a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/inherited-disorders-of-the-complement-system/abstract/1\" class=\"nounderline abstract_t\">Picard C, Al-Herz W, Bousfiha A, et al.
