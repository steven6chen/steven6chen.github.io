Unlike in adults where low-grade, clinically indolent NHL subtypes predominate, most pediatric NHL cases are of high grade and have an aggressive clinical behavior [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-non-hodgkin-lymphoma-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Whenever possible, children with NHL should be treated in a comprehensive pediatric oncology center by a multidisciplinary team experienced in the diagnosis and care of children with cancer.</p><p>This topic will provide an overview of NHL in children and adolescents, focusing on issues that are of interest to primary care providers. The pathobiology of NHL and its diagnosis and management in adults are presented separately, as is an overview of Hodgkin lymphoma in children and adolescents.

In the United States, approximately 800 new cases of pediatric NHL are diagnosed annually with an incidence of 10 to 20 cases per million people per year [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-non-hodgkin-lymphoma-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/3-6\" class=\"abstract_t\">3-6</a>]. This incidence appears to be increasing overall, largely thought to reflect a rise in NHL among adolescents. The median age at diagnosis is approximately 10 years, and the incidence increases with age [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-non-hodgkin-lymphoma-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Lymphomas are rare in infants (&le;1 percent) and account for approximately 4, 14, 22, and 25 percent of neoplasms in children age 1 to 4, 5 to 9, 10 to 14, and 15 to 19 years, respectively. There is a male predominance, and whites are more commonly affected than African Americans.</p><p>The incidence and distribution of specific NHL subtypes differs by population (eg, age, race) and geographical region. In general, the most common subtypes of pediatric NHL are derived from B cell progenitors. In the United States and other developed countries, the most common subtypes are Burkitt lymphoma, diffuse large B cell lymphoma, lymphoblastic T cell or B cell lymphoma, and anaplastic large cell lymphoma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-non-hodgkin-lymphoma-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. Other subtypes (eg, follicular lymphoma, marginal zone lymphoma) are less common, accounting for approximately 7 percent of pediatric NHL.</p><p>Both congenital and acquired immunodeficiency syndromes are associated with an increased risk of NHL. Congenital immunodeficiencies associated with NHL include common variable immunodeficiency, Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome, ataxia telangiectasia, and X-linked lymphoproliferative syndrome. Congenital immunodeficiencies may impact treatment decisions. As an example, the use of diagnostic tests and therapy involving x-rays and ionizing radiation should be limited in children with ataxia telangiectasia to minimize the risk of somatic mutations and subsequent malignancy. Acquired immunodeficiencies include HIV and the use of immunosuppressive medications. Post-transplant lymphoproliferative disorders can follow solid organ and hematopoietic cell transplantation.

Symptoms develop quickly, usually over one to three weeks. NHL commonly presents as enlarging, non-tender lymphadenopathy or as symptoms due to the compression of surrounding structures, such as new onset wheezing, facial swelling, respiratory distress, asymmetrical tonsils, or acute abdominal pain. Hepatic <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> splenic enlargement may be present in patients with advanced stage NHL.</p><p>Central nervous system (CNS) involvement occurs in 6 percent of pediatric NHL with rates ranging from 8.8 percent in Burkitt lymphoma to &lt;3 percent in diffuse large B cell lymphoma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-non-hodgkin-lymphoma-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. A significant minority of patients will have systemic complaints of fever, weight loss, or night sweats (ie, B symptoms). While certain clinical presentations are suggestive of specific NHL histologies, a definitive diagnosis requires a biopsy of involved tissue, as described below.

These may demonstrate masses <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> lymphadenopathy in the neck, chest, or abdomen. Pediatric NHL, unlike Hodgkin lymphoma, may involve non-contiguous areas. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-staging-and-response-assessment-of-non-hodgkin-lymphoma#H13\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation, staging, and response assessment of non-Hodgkin lymphoma&quot;, section on 'Routine imaging studies'</a>.)</p><p>In addition, routine staging of pediatric NHL should include contrast enhanced computerized tomographic (CT) imaging of the neck, chest, abdomen, and pelvis. This CT both serves to help determine disease stage at diagnosis and to provide a baseline study for comparison to determine response to treatment. Integrated positron emissions tomography <span class=\"nowrap\">(PET)/CT</span> scanning is more sensitive and specific than CT in certain histologic subtypes of NHL, including the most common subtypes seen in children [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-non-hodgkin-lymphoma-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].

Bone lesions in NHL are mostly osteolytic on plain films, in contrast to those in patients with Hodgkin lymphoma, which are predominantly osteoblastic. If there is suspicion of spinal cord compression, urgent MRI of the entire spinal column is indicated, since multiple sites may be involved. MRI (with and without gadolinium) of the head is also indicated for patients with neurologic symptoms or signs.

Subtypes of NHL are identified using histology, immunophenotype, and genetic studies. Pediatricians should promptly refer children and teenagers with a suspected NHL to a pediatric oncologist for evaluation and diagnosis.

Rapidly growing lymphadenopathy in the head and neck region is also common. Less common sites of involvement are the testes, bone, skin, bone marrow, and central nervous system. Spontaneous tumor lysis syndrome is common. There is a male predominance and the peak age at presentation is four to six years old.

Optimal therapy involves a multidisciplinary approach from the time of diagnosis, incorporating the skills of pediatric surgical subspecialists, radiation oncologists, pediatric medical <span class=\"nowrap\">oncologists/hematologists,</span> rehabilitation specialists, pediatric nurse specialists, and social workers experienced in the diagnosis and care of children with cancer. Assignment of stage and treatment are best determined after the multidisciplinary team has examined the patient and reviewed the diagnostic images and staging study results. Often there is no better therapy to offer a patient than enrollment onto a well-designed, scientifically valid, peer-reviewed clinical trial. Many of such trials are only offered at comprehensive pediatric oncology centers. (See <a href=\"#H1469844\" class=\"local\">'Clinical trials'</a> below.)</p><p>Combination chemotherapy is the primary modality used for the treatment of pediatric NHL. Unlike in adults, radiation therapy is not commonly used. As described in more detail below, studies in children have demonstrated that radiation therapy does not appear to improve outcomes in early stage NHL or as prophylaxis of the CNS [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-non-hodgkin-lymphoma-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/18-21\" class=\"abstract_t\">18-21</a>].</p><p>Most children and adolescents with NHL have a good prognosis with current therapy. Survival rates have improved dramatically over the past 40 years with modern treatment regimens resulting in estimated five-year survival rates of over 85 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-non-hodgkin-lymphoma-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/2,22\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,22</a>]. The preferred treatment regimen and expected outcome varies by histological subtype and stage. Outcomes are excellent (&gt;90 percent survival) for stage I or II pediatric NHL, regardless of histology. Stage III or IV pediatric NHL has long-term survival rates of 80 to 90 percent.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H22354031\"><span class=\"h2\">Acute toxicities</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Acute effects of treatment for pediatric NHL depend upon the specific chemotherapeutic agents used.</p><p>Myelosuppression is the most common dose-limiting acute toxicity of multiagent chemotherapy and can be treated with transfusions (red cells and platelets) or the administration of colony-stimulating factors (eg, granulocyte colony-stimulating factor). Blood products, if given, need to be irradiated to prevent development of fatal transfusion-associated graft-versus-host disease in these immunocompromised subjects. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=red-blood-cell-transfusion-in-infants-and-children-selection-of-blood-products#H8\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Red blood cell transfusion in infants and children: Selection of blood products&quot;, section on 'Irradiated RBCs'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=transfusion-associated-graft-versus-host-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Transfusion-associated graft-versus-host disease&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Chemotherapy-induced neutropenia and immunosuppression increase the risk of life-threatening infections with viruses, bacteria, and fungi, which need to be treated quickly and appropriately.

Post-exposure prophylaxis can be used to prevent development of varicella infection in children who did not receive the <a href=\"topic.htm?path=varicella-virus-vaccine-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">varicella vaccine</a> before undergoing chemotherapy. Antiviral therapy should be promptly initiated in patients who develop varicella infection or varicella zoster.

Almost all patients with lymphoblastic lymphoma are eligible to enroll on trials for patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia. The preferred treatment modality for pediatric lymphoblastic lymphoma is combination chemotherapy based on regimens used for acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). With this approach, children with early stage (I or II) or advanced stage (III or IV) lymphoblastic lymphoma achieve survival rates of &gt;90 and &gt;80 percent, respectively. The role of surgery is limited to surgical biopsy of a peripheral lymph node, a bone marrow aspiration, or aspiration of pleural fluid to establish the diagnosis. There is no role for surgical debulking of disease due to the high sensitivity of the tumor to chemotherapy. Likewise, there is no routine need for radiation therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-non-hodgkin-lymphoma-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. Radiation is generally reserved for patients with pathologically proven involvement of the central nervous system (CNS) at the time of diagnosis. Testicular involvement at diagnosis does not require testicular radiation.</p><p>Initial support for the use of ALL protocols in patients with lymphoblastic lymphoma was based upon the significant biological and clinical overlap between these two entities. Indeed, the WHO classification system considers these entities to be the same disease with different clinical presentations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-non-hodgkin-lymphoma-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. Initial prospective trials demonstrated the efficacy of ALL protocols in patients with lymphoblastic lymphoma. Subsequent trials demonstrated that good outcomes can be maintained while decreasing the intensity of treatment. As examples:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In the NHL-BFM-90 trial, 105 children with T cell lymphoblastic lymphoma received an eight-drug ALL induction regimen followed by consolidation therapy that included high dose <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methotrexate-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">methotrexate</a> and maintenance therapy for a total treatment duration of two years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-non-hodgkin-lymphoma-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>].

At a median follow-up of 5.9 years, the estimated survival at five years was 96 percent. For children and adolescents with stage <span class=\"nowrap\">III/IV</span> disease without CNS involvement, the A5971 protocol produced a five-year event-free survival rate of 81 percent with intensification and backbone therapy not significantly impacting the outcome. Effective CNS prophylaxis occurred with either intensive intrathecal chemotherapy or with high dose <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methotrexate-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">methotrexate</a> during interim maintenance and no intrathecal therapy during the maintenance phase. The study demonstrated a CNS relapse incidence of 1.2 percent at five years. In contrast, this same trial reported that the 12 children with disseminated CNS disease at the time of diagnosis had estimated event-free survival, overall survival, and relapse rates of 63, 81, and 25 percent at five years, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-non-hodgkin-lymphoma-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>].</p><p/><p>Together, these and other trials demonstrate that treatment based upon protocols for ALL produce excellent survival rates among children with lymphoblastic lymphoma. Prophylactic cranial irradiation adds toxicity and can be eliminated for the vast majority of patients. For patients with disseminated T cell disease without CNS involvement at diagnosis, there appears to be no benefit to extra intensification of therapy during the induction or delayed intensification phases, and no benefit to using high dose <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methotrexate-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">methotrexate</a> during interim maintenance [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-non-hodgkin-lymphoma-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>].</p><p>Patients who relapse do poorly due to difficulty obtaining a second remission.

A key component of the treatment of all HIV-infected patients with an AIDS-related NHL is the administration of antiretroviral therapy (ART). The reduction in HIV viral load and improvement in immune function associated with ART is expected to result in better tolerance of chemotherapy, fewer opportunistic infections, and improvement in overall treatment outcome. As such, children with HIV and NHL should be treated with standard chemotherapy regimens for NHL, but careful attention to prophylaxis against and early detection of infection is warranted.

Unlike in adults where low-grade, clinically indolent NHL subtypes predominate, most pediatric NHL cases are of high-grade and have an aggressive clinical behavior. (See <a href=\"#H1876620\" class=\"local\">'Epidemiology'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The clinical presentation of pediatric NHL varies depending upon the type of lymphoma and the areas of involvement. Signs and symptoms develop quickly, usually over a few weeks to months. NHL commonly presents as enlarging, non-tender lymphadenopathy or as symptoms due to the compression of surrounding structures, such as new onset wheezing, facial swelling, respiratory distress, asymmetrical tonsils, or acute abdominal pain. (See <a href=\"#H1876635\" class=\"local\">'Signs and symptoms'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Potentially emergent complications of NHL may be present at the time of diagnosis and need to be considered during the initial workup and evaluation of a patient with suspected pediatric NHL. These may be life-threatening and include but are not limited to superior vena cava obstruction, acute airway obstruction, and tumor lysis syndrome. Prompt recognition and therapy are critical. (See <a href=\"#H1468535\" class=\"local\">'Oncologic emergencies'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pediatricians should promptly refer children and teenagers with a suspected NHL to a pediatric oncologist for evaluation and diagnosis. The diagnosis of NHL is based upon the pathologic evaluation of involved tissue, usually an abdominal mass, extranodal site, or lymph node, interpreted within the clinical context. Subtypes of NHL are identified using histology, immunophenotype, and genetic studies. (See <a href=\"#H1876663\" class=\"local\">'Diagnosis'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Combination chemotherapy is the primary modality used for the treatment of pediatric NHL. The role of surgery is limited to surgical biopsy of a peripheral lymph node, a bone marrow aspiration, or aspiration of pleural fluid to establish the diagnosis. Unlike in adults, radiation therapy is not commonly used. (See <a href=\"#H1469864\" class=\"local\">'Overview'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Most children and adolescents with NHL have a good prognosis with current therapy. Long-term overall survival is achieved in &gt;80 percent of pediatric NHL cases overall, and in &gt;90 percent of stage I or II pediatric NHL.
