The evaluation of potential deceased adult organ donors and the evaluation and management of potential deceased pediatric organ donors are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-the-potential-deceased-donor\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of the potential deceased donor&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=assessment-of-the-pediatric-patient-for-potential-organ-donation\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Assessment of the pediatric patient for potential organ donation&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-the-potential-pediatric-organ-donor\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of the potential pediatric organ donor&quot;</a>.). </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H401805357\"><span class=\"h1\">GENERAL CONSIDERATIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Management of the potential organ donor primarily involves the use of conventional therapeutic and supportive measures to reverse or mitigate the physiologic changes that occur after brain death, including potentially severe autonomic and inflammatory responses. The mechanisms of these changes are not well understood, not easily studied, and potentially harmful to the function of transplantable organs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-the-deceased-organ-donor/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>]. Donor management involves optimizing the cardiopulmonary and endocrine systems to maximize the viability and function of procured organs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-the-deceased-organ-donor/abstract/3,4\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,4</a>].</p><p>This process requires balancing the interventions needed for the successful preservation of multiple organs. Interventions that improve the function of one organ may be detrimental to the function of other organs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-the-deceased-organ-donor/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. As an example, although the renal transplant team prefers an extremely well-hydrated donor with excellent diuresis, aggressive hydration may cause edema that may jeopardize the transplantability of the heart, lungs, liver, and pancreas. However, data suggest that restrictive fluid balance, which is intended to improve lung procurement and viability, has no substantial detrimental effect on rates of kidney procurement or function after transplant [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-the-deceased-organ-donor/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].</p><p>Other important general considerations include the following:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Proper ventilatory support, good pulmonary toilet, and appropriate infection prophylaxis <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> treatment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-the-deceased-organ-donor/abstract/1,4\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,4</a>] </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Maintenance of normothermia, passively with blankets for all brain-dead cadavers, and with active rewarming (eg, forced air blankets) for temperature &lt;35&deg;C </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Administration of N-acetylcysteine prior to angiographic procedures done to confirm brain death does not appear to provide a benefit after kidney transplantation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-the-deceased-organ-donor/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H303443350\"><span class=\"h1\">STEPS TO OPTIMIZE ORGAN FUNCTION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Care of the potential organ donor should continue the support that started before the declaration of brain death and should compensate for the associated physiologic deterioration. Active donor management is believed to (and almost certainly does) improve the retrieval rate [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-the-deceased-organ-donor/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>], and the Society of Critical Care Medicine, the American College of Chest Physicians, and the Association of Organ Procurement Organizations have published guidelines for donor management [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-the-deceased-organ-donor/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. Our approach is consistent with these guidelines (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F54028\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef54028 \">table 1</a>). </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2069602938\"><span class=\"h2\">Monitoring</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The primary goal for monitoring of the potential organ donor is to optimize the number and long-term function of transplanted organs. While practices vary among institutions, monitoring potential organ donors commonly involves the following [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-the-deceased-organ-donor/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The usual hemodynamic and respiratory monitoring for critically-ill patients, such as serial or continuous monitoring of temperature, blood pressure, heart rate and rhythm, pulse oxygen saturation, and urine output. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A central venous catheter is usually placed to enable serial or continuous measurements of parameters such as central venous pressure (CVP) and central venous oxygen saturation (CVO<sub>2</sub>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-the-deceased-organ-donor/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. The CVP catheter also facilitates administration of vasopressor and other medications and enables sampling of central venous blood. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A pulmonary artery catheter (PAC) may be placed in selected patients when measurement of pulmonary artery occlusion pressure (PAOP, also known as the pulmonary capillary wedge pressure [PCWP]), stroke volume, cardiac output (CO), and cardiac index (CI) is needed.

A PPV of greater than 12 percent or SPV greater than 10 to 15 percent suggests that the patient is still volume responsive.

The DMG for blood pressure is a mean arterial pressure (MAP) of 60 to 110 mmHg [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-the-deceased-organ-donor/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. We support this target, as most modern studies utilize a target MAP of 60 mmHg, which, when compared with lower MAP goals, is associated with a lower risk of kidney injury [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-the-deceased-organ-donor/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2784596329\"><span class=\"h3\">Hypertensive autonomic storm</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Brain death often results in an initial hypertensive crisis followed by hypotension [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-the-deceased-organ-donor/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. The hypertensive crisis (also known as an autonomic storm) is attributed to a massive sympathetic discharge following brain death. For patients who manifest the cardiovascular effects of autonomic storm (eg, tachycardia, increased myocardial oxygen consumption, hypertension), any intervention should be easily reversible as this phase tends to be followed by hypotension. Beta-adrenergic antagonists such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=esmolol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">esmolol</a> may ameliorate the cardiovascular effects and preserve myocardial function [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-the-deceased-organ-donor/abstract/4,12-14\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,12-14</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1716158800\"><span class=\"h3\">Initial management of hypotension</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Following the initial hypertensive storm, a hypotensive period often ensues and is attributed to multiple potential factors, including hypovolemia, cardiac dysfunction, and vasodilation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-the-deceased-organ-donor/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. The initial management requires fluid administration to maintain an adequate, typically near-normal circulating volume; the administration of vasoconstrictors to compensate for the loss of vascular tone (vasoplegia) that often accompanies brain death. Inadequate fluid resuscitation may require excessive vasoconstrictor administration, which can be deleterious to the organs to be procured. In contrast, aggressive fluid administration can cause edema in the lungs, liver, and heart, which can be detrimental to their function in recipients. </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For hypotensive patients, intravenous fluids are administered to replete the circulating volume, aiming to bring the MAP to &gt;60 mmHg and urine output to 0.5 to 1 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/kg</span> per hour [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-the-deceased-organ-donor/abstract/4,9,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,9,15</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients with a high urine output may have brain death-associated diabetes insipidus (DI), which will need specific treatment to avoid hyponatremia and ongoing fluid losses.

Traditional measures include achieving the MAP and urine output targets noted above, CVP 4 to 10 mmHg, or PAOP 8 to 12 mmHg. However, these measures can be misleading, so there is a growing use of noninvasive dynamic measures such as PPV or SPV, which are described separately.

The presence of a hyperchloremic acidosis may prompt selection of lactated Ringer solution or other bicarbonate containing solutions, while the presence of hypernatremia may prompt the use of more hypotonic solutions until the underlying cause has responded to treatment. Some experts prefer colloids, such as albumin 5 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-the-deceased-organ-donor/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>], but hydroxyethyl starch has been associated with acute kidney injury and is NOT recommended [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-the-deceased-organ-donor/abstract/4,17\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,17</a>]. </p><p>The optimal hemoglobin level for organ <span class=\"nowrap\">procurement/preservation</span> is not known. Intraoperative red cell transfusion is often necessary in patients with prior abdominal surgery in whom the dissection of the liver and kidneys for organ procurement might be difficult, or in patients whose blood vessels are difficult to cannulate. Based on the success of restrictive transfusion policies, transfusion to a hemoglobin level &lt;7 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/dL</span> is suggested by guidelines, but a trigger of 7 to 10 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/dL</span> may be requested by one of the procuring surgical teams [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-the-deceased-organ-donor/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].

Transthoracic echocardiography is also used to assess left ventricular ejection fraction and determine the need for additional invasive hemodynamic monitoring or support.

The optimal strategy for mechanical ventilation of the donor is not known, but the trend is to use low tidal volume ventilation (LTVV, also known as lung protective ventilation), and this is the strategy used by the authors. This is in contrast with the traditional use of tidal volumes of 8 to 15 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/kg</span> and a positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 5 cm H<sub>2</sub>O [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-the-deceased-organ-donor/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>].

Potential donors were assigned to conventional ventilation (tidal volumes 10 to 12 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/kg</span> of predicted body weight and PEEP of 3 to 5 cm H<sub>2</sub>O) or protective ventilation (tidal volume 6 to 8 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/kg</span> of predicted body weight and PEEP of 8 to 10 cm H<sub>2</sub>O) for a six hour observation period. In both groups, the respiratory rate was adjusted to obtain an arterial partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PaCO<sub>2</sub>) of 40 to 45 mmHg. Thirty-two patients (54 percent) in the conventional ventilation group and 56 (95 percent) in the protective strategy group met lung donor eligibility criteria. Six month survival rates of lung transplant recipients did not differ between the two groups. Thus, if overall hemodynamic and acid-base status will allow, the LTVV strategy for potential lung donors appears to substantially increase the proportion of lungs that are acceptable for transplantation.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Peak and plateau airway pressures</strong> &ndash; Peak airway pressures should be maintained below 30 cm of water pressure.

However there continues to be a debate whether liver transplantation from DCDD donors leads to higher risk of early graft dysfunction, more frequent vascular and ischemia-type biliary lesions, higher rates of retransplantation and lower graft survival [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-the-deceased-organ-donor/abstract/51-53\" class=\"abstract_t\">51-53</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1210384984\"><span class=\"h2\">Role of ECMO in DCDD</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The use of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) to provide regional perfusion to organs that will be transplanted after DCDD has shown promise in preliminary studies but further study of the ethical issues and effects on organ retrieval outcomes is needed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-the-deceased-organ-donor/abstract/4,54,55\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,54,55</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3292767706\"><span class=\"h1\">SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Management of the potential organ donor primarily involves the use of conventional therapeutic and supportive measures to reverse or mitigate the changes in physiology that occur after brain death (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F54028\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef54028 \">table 1</a>). (See <a href=\"#H401805357\" class=\"local\">'General considerations'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Brain death often results in an initial hypertensive crisis, due to a massive sympathetic discharge. For patients who manifest the cardiovascular effects (eg, tachycardia, increased myocardial oxygen consumption, hypertension) of autonomic storm, we suggest using a short-acting beta-adrenergic antagonist (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=esmolol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">esmolol</a>) (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>), rather than a longer acting agent or an alpha-antagonist. (See <a href=\"#H339275259\" class=\"local\">'Volume repletion and hemodynamic support'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>After initial hypertension, patients often become hypotensive.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>We suggest using isotonic intravenous crystalloid fluids (eg, lactated Ringer solution, Plasma-Lyte, Normosol, or 0.9 percent saline) to replete circulating volume (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). Albumin 5 percent is a reasonable alternative to isotonic crystalloid. We suggest avoiding hydroxyethyl starch due to potential adverse effects on the kidneys (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Fluids are administered until the circulating volume is adequate, based on a central venous pressure (CVP) of 4 to 10 mmHg, or pulse pressure variation (PPV) &lt;12 percent <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> systolic pressure variation (SPV) &lt;10 to 15 percent (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ANEST%2F86275\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef86275 \">figure 2</a>). (See <a href=\"#H339275259\" class=\"local\">'Volume repletion and hemodynamic support'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>We aim for a target mean arterial pressure (MAP) of 60 to 110 mmHg and target urine output of 0.5 to 1 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/kg</span> per hour. (See <a href=\"#H350463233\" class=\"local\">'Goal blood pressure'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Vasoplegia should be treated with vasopressin infusion 0.01 to 0.04 <span class=\"nowrap\">units/minute</span> in most instances. Severe vasoplegia may require the addition of norepinephrine, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=phenylephrine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">phenylephrine</a>, or other vasopressor. (See <a href=\"#H1445185819\" class=\"local\">'Vasopressin and desmopressin'</a> above and <a href=\"#H4293147998\" class=\"local\">'Hypotension despite fluid repletion'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Patients who are hypotensive in spite of adequate volume resuscitation and treatment of vasoplegia should be evaluated with echocardiography. Myocardial dysfunction can be treated with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dobutamine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">dobutamine</a>, epinephrine, or dopamine. (See <a href=\"#H4293147998\" class=\"local\">'Hypotension despite fluid repletion'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The goals of mechanical ventilation are to maintain tissue oxygenation and protect the lungs for transplantation. The optimal strategy for mechanical ventilation of the donor has not been determined, but we typically use low tidal volume ventilation (LTVV) based on an apparent protective effect on lung allografts and experience in other settings. The target arterial tension of carbon dioxide (PaCO<sub>2</sub>) is 35 to 45 mmHg, and the target arterial oxygen saturation (SpO<sub>2</sub>) is &gt;95 percent. (See <a href=\"#H331874051\" class=\"local\">'Ventilation'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Brain death is associated with metabolic and endocrine dysfunction. While the exact role of hormone therapy in the management of organ donors is not well-established, hormone therapy is common (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F54028\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef54028 \">table 1</a>). Diabetes insipidus (DI) is treated with vasopressin <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> <a href=\"topic.htm?path=desmopressin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">desmopressin</a>. Hyperglycemia is managed with avoidance of glucose-containing intravenous solutions and an insulin drip, if needed. Glucocorticoids are often administered to prevent inflammation, and thyroid hormone is typically administered to patients with hemodynamic instability <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> decreased ejection fraction. (See <a href=\"#H3310044518\" class=\"local\">'Hormonal therapy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Preanesthesia preparation requires preparation for volume resuscitation, intraoperative hypotension, anticoagulation, and reintubation as necessary. (See <a href=\"#H2121874415\" class=\"local\">'Preanesthesia preparation'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>After brain death, the spinal cord usually continues to function, and thus unregulated spinal reflexes may occur in response to stimulation. Anesthesia is used to manage reflex sympathetic and motor responses. Typically, volatile anesthetics and non-depolarizing neuromuscular blocking agents are employed. (See <a href=\"#H699359839\" class=\"local\">'Anesthetic agents'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For organ donation after circulatory determination of death (DCDD, previously referred to as donation after cardiac or circulatory death [DCD]), the donor is typically transferred to a location in or near the operating room for withdrawal of life support. After meeting criteria for determination of death, two minutes are allowed to pass, followed by reinitiation of ventilation and hemodynamic support and administration of heparin and anesthetic agents needed for procurement. (See <a href=\"#H733277946\" class=\"local\">'Donation after circulatory determination of death'</a> above.)</p><p/></div><div id=\"topicAgreement\">Use of UpToDate is subject to the <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/legal/license\" class=\"licenseLink\" id=\"sla_in_page\">Subscription and License Agreement</a>.</div><div id=\"references\" class=\"headingAnchor\"><h1>REFERENCES</h1><ol id=\"reference\"><li><a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-the-deceased-organ-donor/abstract/1\" class=\"nounderline abstract_t\">Wood KE, Becker BN, McCartney JG, et al.
