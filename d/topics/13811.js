An understanding of this virus and other enteroviruses is important in the evaluation of the patient with acute flaccid paralysis.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">ENTEROVIRUS CLASSIFICATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Human enteroviruses contain a single-stranded RNA genome, and are divided into four species: human enteroviruses A, B, C, and D. Polioviruses are part of the human enterovirus C group [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/polio-and-infectious-diseases-of-the-anterior-horn/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p>There are 64 human serotypes of enteroviruses. The three poliovirus serotypes are conveniently named types 1, 2, and 3. All produce motor neuron disease, although most paralytic disease was caused by poliovirus type 1 in the prevaccination era. The non-polio enteroviruses include coxsackieviruses A and B and various echoviruses and enteroviruses. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=enterovirus-and-parechovirus-infections-epidemiology-and-pathogenesis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Enterovirus and parechovirus infections: Epidemiology and pathogenesis&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">POLIOVIRUS AND POLIOMYELITIS</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Epidemiology</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The polio epidemics that occurred in the first half of the 20th century in the United States were, ironically, a result of improved sanitation. Prior to 1900 in the United States, polio was endemic. Most infants were infected with poliovirus before age six months. While some developed infantile paralysis, many were protected by maternal antibodies and had inapparent infections, resulting in widespread immunity in American children. Improved sanitation led to many less infants being exposed to poliovirus, creating a large pool of susceptible individuals. When exposure occurred later and the individuals were not protected by maternal antibodies, there were polio epidemics.</p><p>Similarly, polio was endemic in less industrialized areas of the world well into the 20th century. As sanitation and hygiene improved in these countries, they too began to experience epidemics of poliomyelitis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/polio-and-infectious-diseases-of-the-anterior-horn/abstract/2,3\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,3</a>].</p><p>The first major United States outbreak of polio was in 1916, during which 6000 people died and 27,000 were paralyzed. Epidemics continued to occur every few years and to grow. In 1952, there were 57,000 reported cases of polio [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/polio-and-infectious-diseases-of-the-anterior-horn/abstract/4,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,5</a>]. This number included paralytic, nonparalytic, and unspecified cases; paralytic cases peaked at over 21,000 that year [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/polio-and-infectious-diseases-of-the-anterior-horn/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. Many of the nonparalytic and unspecified cases were due to other enteroviruses, mainly the echoviruses and coxsackieviruses.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Pathogenesis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Poliovirus is transmitted by fecal-hand-oral contamination. During epidemics, it also may be transmitted by pharyngeal spread [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/polio-and-infectious-diseases-of-the-anterior-horn/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. Entry is via the oral route, during which the virus infects cells of the mouth, nose, and throat. Ninety to 95 percent of poliovirus infections are asymptomatic. There is an incubation period of 7 to 14 days, during which the virus undergoes primary replication in the lymphatic tissues of the GI tract. An asymptomatic primary (minor) transient viremia occurs, with spread of virus to the systemic reticuloendothelial tissue.</p><p>In 4 to 8 percent of individuals, a second major viremia occurs, causing symptoms of the &quot;minor illness&quot; (abortive polio), which resembles the usual viral infection, including headache, sore throat, fever, nausea, vomiting, malaise, and fatigue. In a fraction of those with major viremia and abortive polio, involvement of the central nervous system occurs, usually after a symptom-free interval of a few days. This usually is signaled by signs and symptoms of meningitis, including neck stiffness, headache, fever, and vomiting. In some of these patients, the poliovirus also causes selective destruction of motor neurons, characterized by severe back, neck, and muscle pain, and the development of motor weakness. This paralysis occurs in only about 0.1 percent of all poliovirus infections [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/polio-and-infectious-diseases-of-the-anterior-horn/abstract/4,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,8</a>].</p><p>The mechanism of spread of poliovirus to the central nervous system is not well understood. It may occur by direct passage of the virus from blood by crossing the blood-brain barrier, or may occur by retrograde axonal transport from muscle to spinal cord and brain.</p><p>After invading the central nervous system, the virus uncoats, viral replication occurs, and the motor neuron dies, leading to paralysis of muscle fibers supplied by this motor neuron. Spread of the virus to neighboring motor neurons may occur laterally, independent of axonal transport, or by transneuronal spread, in a retrograde transport dependent fashion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/polio-and-infectious-diseases-of-the-anterior-horn/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. Other neurons can be infected as well, producing brainstem encephalitis and respiratory insufficiency [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/polio-and-infectious-diseases-of-the-anterior-horn/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Clinical presentation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Weakness may vary from one muscle or group of muscles, to quadriplegia, and respiratory failure. Tone is reduced, nearly always in an asymmetric manner. Proximal muscles usually are affected more than distal muscles, and legs more commonly than arms. Reflexes are decreased or absent. The sensory examination is almost always normal.</p><p>Weakness typically worsens over two to three days, although sometimes worsening can progress for up to a week. Bulbar involvement occurs in 5 to 35 percent of patients, producing dysphagia, dysarthria, and difficulty handling secretions. There may be encephalitis, usually in infancy. Respiratory insufficiency may occur [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/polio-and-infectious-diseases-of-the-anterior-horn/abstract/4,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,10</a>].</p><p>The cerebrospinal fluid shows a pleocytosis as in other types of aseptic meningitis, initially characterized by polymorphonuclear leukocytes, followed by a shift to lymphocytes. The cerebrospinal fluid protein is usually elevated.</p><p>Electrodiagnostic investigations reveal normal sensory nerve studies. Motor nerve studies show normal to mildly slowed conduction velocities and low to normal amplitudes. Needle examination acutely demonstrates only decreased or absent recruitment, but eventually demonstrates fibrillation potentials, positive sharp waves, and occasionally fasciculation potentials in affected muscles.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Diagnosis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The diagnosis of poliomyelitis is suspected based on the clinical presentation and cerebrospinal fluid findings. The gold standard for confirming the diagnosis is polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification of poliovirus RNA from the cerebrospinal fluid. Alternatively, the diagnosis can be confirmed by virus isolation, but this method is less sensitive than PCR. Poliovirus can be isolated from throat secretions in the first week of illness, and from feces for several weeks. It rarely can be isolated from cerebrospinal fluid. The diagnosis can also be made serologically, by comparing viral titers in acute and convalescent sera, but this method is slow and often hard to accomplish with the large number of enteroviruses [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/polio-and-infectious-diseases-of-the-anterior-horn/abstract/4,7,9,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,7,9,10</a>].</p><p>A summary of the suggested evaluation of the patient with acute flaccid paralysis is provided in the Table (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F73307\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef73307 \">table 1</a>).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Differential diagnosis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The differential diagnosis of acute flaccid paralysis includes the following causes (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F71165\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef71165 \">table 2</a>):</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Enteroviruses other than wild-type polio must be considered, particularly in the current era in which polio has been eradicated in most countries.

The electrodiagnostic findings are less helpful early in the course of GBS, when demyelinating findings may not yet have developed, or in the case of axonal forms of GBS. Rarely, patients with Lyme disease have been reported as having a presentation resembling GBS [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/polio-and-infectious-diseases-of-the-anterior-horn/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>].

Respiratory failure may develop, requiring mechanical ventilation. Patients with bulbar involvement require close monitoring of cardiovascular status because of the association with blood pressure fluctuations, circulatory collapse, and autonomic dysfunction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/polio-and-infectious-diseases-of-the-anterior-horn/abstract/4,7,10,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,7,10,14</a>].

The more severe the acute weakness, the greater the chance of residual deficits. Bulbar sequelae are rare. The mortality was 5 to 10 percent in the era of epidemics, and approached 50 percent for those with bulbar involvement because of cardiovascular and respiratory complications [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/polio-and-infectious-diseases-of-the-anterior-horn/abstract/4,7,10,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,7,10,14</a>].</p><p>Post-polio syndrome may occur many years after the acute episode, and has been defined as the &quot;onset of functional deterioration after a prolonged period of stability&quot; in patients with a history of polio [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/polio-and-infectious-diseases-of-the-anterior-horn/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]&nbsp;(see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=post-polio-syndrome\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Post-polio syndrome&quot;</a>).</p><p>Polio has long-lasting effects on its victims, whether or not they meet criteria for post-polio syndrome. A study found that secondary conditions common among polio survivors include new muscle weakness, chronic pain, contractures, depression, fatigue, sleep problems, and a host of other symptoms and signs, all of which may have a negative impact on life satisfaction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/polio-and-infectious-diseases-of-the-anterior-horn/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h2\">Polio vaccination</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Because there are no effective treatments to restore motor neuron function after paralytic polio, prevention has been a mainstay of clinical and research efforts. Jonas Salk created the inactivated <a href=\"topic.htm?path=poliovirus-vaccine-inactivated-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">poliovirus vaccine</a> (IPV), using killed virus in 1952. Vaccination of 1.8 million grade school children at 217 test sites in 44 states was carried out in 1954, and the vaccine was found to be 80 to 90 percent effective in preventing polio [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/polio-and-infectious-diseases-of-the-anterior-horn/abstract/5,18\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,18</a>]. Routine use of IPV began in 1956 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/polio-and-infectious-diseases-of-the-anterior-horn/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. The Sabin oral poliovirus vaccine (OPV), using live attenuated virus, proved successful in 1960, and replaced the Salk vaccine in 1962 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/polio-and-infectious-diseases-of-the-anterior-horn/abstract/14,19\" class=\"abstract_t\">14,19</a>].</p><p>In areas of the world where polio is endemic, primary immunization is still performed with Sabin OPV. However, the OPV causes polio in one out of 2.5 million doses. Therefore, it has been replaced by the Salk IPV in countries without polio, including the United States and most of Europe.</p><p>Polio vaccination is discussed in detail separately.

The results have been dramatic. In 1988, polio was endemic in more than 125 countries, and paralyzed at least 350,000 children per year [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/polio-and-infectious-diseases-of-the-anterior-horn/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>].

One in 10,000 to 15,000 of these patients with acute hemorrhagic conjunctivitis developed acute flaccid paralysis, mostly older teens and adults. As with poliomyelitis, most of these patients with acute flaccid paralysis had a cerebrospinal fluid pleocytosis and elevated cerebrospinal fluid protein level. Diagnosis was made by isolation of the virus from the eyes early in the illness, or by a rise in antibody titers between paired sera [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/polio-and-infectious-diseases-of-the-anterior-horn/abstract/9,36-39\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,36-39</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14\"><span class=\"h2\">Epidemiology subsequent to polio eradication efforts</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The epidemiology of acute flaccid paralysis has changed dramatically since the introduction of mass vaccination programs for polio eradication worldwide.

In a summary of 59 cases from California identified through July 2015, the median age at onset was 9 years, though nine patients were older than 21 years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/polio-and-infectious-diseases-of-the-anterior-horn/abstract/54\" class=\"abstract_t\">54</a>]. Common preceding or concurrent symptoms included respiratory or gastrointestinal illness, fever, and limb myalgia. At the onset of neurologic symptoms, fever, limb myalgia, headache, and neck stiffness were often present alone or in combination, and a minority experienced mental status changes. Weakness progressed rapidly, most often reaching maximum severity over the course of a few hours to a few days. At disease nadir, the severity of neurologic impairments ranged from weakness in one limb (n = 5) to quadriparesis (n = 29); upper limb weakness was most common (n = 43). Additional manifestations included respiratory failure requiring mechanical ventilation (n = 20), cranial nerve palsies (n = 16), neurogenic bowel or bladder (n = 30), and focal paresthesia (n = 21). MRI of the spinal cord typically showed increased signal on T2-weighted sequences involving the central gray matter, particularly the anterior horns. In most cases, the spinal cord lesions were longitudinally extensive (ie, &gt;3 vertebral segments). Cerebrospinal fluid analysis revealed pleocytosis in 43 of 58 patients, with a median white count of 41 <span class=\"nowrap\">cells/microL</span>. No viruses were isolated from the cerebrospinal fluid. Nonpolio enteroviruses were detected in other samples (ie, nasopharynx swab, stool, or serum) in 15 of 45 patients, including enterovirus D68 in 9 patients. Most patients were treated with intravenous glucocorticoids, intravenous <a href=\"topic.htm?path=immune-globulin-intravenous-subcutaneous-and-intramsucular-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">immune globulin</a>, or plasma exchange, but acute improvement with such treatment was rare. Two immunocompromised adult patients died within 60 days of symptom onset. Among 45 patients with follow-up data (median nine months), persistent weakness was noted in 38 (84 percent), while complete motor recovery was observed in only 7 patients (16 percent).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Similar cases of children with acute limb weakness and abnormalities of spinal cord gray matter on MRI were reported from other regions of the United States (eg, Colorado, Massachusetts, and Washington) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/polio-and-infectious-diseases-of-the-anterior-horn/abstract/60-63\" class=\"abstract_t\">60-63</a>].

Flaccid limb weakness, mainly proximal, developed in 10 children and was asymmetric in 7. Additional deficits involved bulbar weakness (n = 6), cranial nerve 6 dysfunction (n = 3), and cranial nerve 7 dysfunction (n = 2). MRI revealed longitudinally extensive spinal cord lesions of the central gray matter with predominant anterior horn cell involvement in 10 children. These lesions spanned a median of 17 vertebral segments (range 4 to 20). Brainstem lesions were present in nine children, mainly involving the dorsal pontine tegmentum. Cerebrospinal fluid pleocytosis (median 55 <span class=\"nowrap\">cells/microL)</span> was observed in 10 children. Nasopharyngeal specimens were positive for rhinovirus or enterovirus in 8 of 11 children, and were positive for enterovirus D68 in 5 of 11 children. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing for enterovirus of cerebrospinal fluid, blood, and rectal swabs were negative. Testing for poliovirus, West Nile virus, and other arboviruses was also negative. All children who presented with limb weakness had incomplete recovery with persistent motor deficits.</p><p/><p>Clinical criteria for a confirmed case of AFM require the acute onset of focal limb weakness and a spinal cord lesion on MRI largely restricted to gray matter and spanning one or more spinal segments [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/polio-and-infectious-diseases-of-the-anterior-horn/abstract/64\" class=\"abstract_t\">64</a>]. Criteria for a probable case of AFM (in patients without MRI) require acute onset of focal limb weakness and cerebrospinal fluid pleocytosis (ie, a white count &gt;5 <span class=\"nowrap\">cells/microL</span> after adjustment by subtraction of 1 white cell for every 500 red cells).

The CDC also requests that clinicians collect and submit specimens to the CDC for testing as early as possible in the course of the illness, to include cerebrospinal fluid, blood, and stool. The CDC requests submission of nasopharyngeal or nasal (mid-turbinate) plus oropharyngeal swab specimens only if the patient tests positive for enterovirus or rhinovirus at an external lab.

Importantly, these enteroviral sequences were found to localize to neurons [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/polio-and-infectious-diseases-of-the-anterior-horn/abstract/82\" class=\"abstract_t\">82</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a multicenter French study, enterovirus RNA was found in 14.5 percent of 242 patients with ALS, compared with 7.6 percent of 354 controls, a statistically significant difference [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/polio-and-infectious-diseases-of-the-anterior-horn/abstract/83\" class=\"abstract_t\">83</a>].</p><p/><p>Studies such as these have led to the hypothesis of nonlytic, noncytopathic persistent viral infection, particularly of enteroviruses, as a cause of ALS [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/polio-and-infectious-diseases-of-the-anterior-horn/abstract/84\" class=\"abstract_t\">84</a>]. Presumably, these viruses could infect motor neurons in this manner, evade the host's immune surveillance, spread from one motor neuron to the next, and turn on apoptosis of motor neurons.

However, other studies have not supported the viral hypothesis of ALS etiopathogenesis, and enterovirus sequences or enterovirus RNA have not been found in the spinal cord or motor cortex of patients with ALS [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/polio-and-infectious-diseases-of-the-anterior-horn/abstract/84-88\" class=\"abstract_t\">84-88</a>].

These articles are best for patients who want a general overview and who prefer short, easy-to-read materials. Beyond the Basics patient education pieces are longer, more sophisticated, and more detailed. These articles are written at the 10<sup>th</sup> to 12<sup>th</sup> grade reading level and are best for patients who want in-depth information and are comfortable with some medical jargon.</p><p>Here are the patient education articles that are relevant to this topic.

(You can also locate patient education articles on a variety of subjects by searching on &quot;patient info&quot; and the keyword(s) of interest.) </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Basics topic (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=poliomyelitis-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">&quot;Patient education: Poliomyelitis (The Basics)&quot;</a>)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H21841430\"><span class=\"h1\">SUMMARY</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Poliovirus is transmitted by fecal-hand-oral contamination. During epidemics, it also may be transmitted by pharyngeal spread. Ninety to 95 percent of poliovirus infections are asymptomatic. There is an incubation period of 7 to 14 days. An asymptomatic primary (minor) transient viremia occurs, with spread of virus to the systemic reticuloendothelial tissue. In 4 to 8 percent of individuals, a second major viremia occurs, causing symptoms of the &quot;minor illness&quot; (abortive polio), which resembles the usual viral infection, including headache, sore throat, fever, nausea, vomiting, malaise, and fatigue. In a fraction of those with major viremia and abortive polio, involvement of the central nervous system then occurs. In some of these patients, the poliovirus then causes selective destruction of motor neurons, characterized by severe back, neck, and muscle pain, and the development of motor weakness. This paralysis occurs in only about 0.1 percent of all poliovirus infections. (See <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Pathogenesis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Weakness due to poliomyelitis may range from involvement of one muscle or group of muscles to quadriplegia and respiratory failure. Tone is reduced, nearly always in an asymmetric manner. Proximal muscles usually are affected more than distal ones, and legs are affected more commonly than arms. The cerebrospinal fluid shows a pleocytosis initially characterized by polymorphonuclear leukocytes, followed by a shift to lymphocytes. The cerebrospinal fluid protein is usually elevated. (See <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'Clinical presentation'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The diagnosis of poliomyelitis is suspected based on the clinical presentation and cerebrospinal fluid findings. The gold-standard method for confirmation of the diagnosis is polymerase chain reaction amplification of poliovirus RNA from the cerebrospinal fluid (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F73307\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef73307 \">table 1</a>). The diagnosis also can be confirmed by virus isolation, but this method is less sensitive. (See <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'Diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>From a practical clinical perspective, the illnesses which most resemble poliomyelitis are other enterovirus infections, West Nile Virus, and Guillain-Barr&eacute; syndrome. The differential diagnosis of acute flaccid paralysis includes a multitude of other conditions (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F71165\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef71165 \">table 2</a>). (See <a href=\"#H8\" class=\"local\">'Differential diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Treatment of poliomyelitis is supportive. Respiratory failure may develop, requiring mechanical ventilation. Patients with bulbar involvement require close monitoring of cardiovascular status because of the association with blood pressure fluctuations, circulatory collapse, and autonomic dysfunction. (See <a href=\"#H9\" class=\"local\">'Treatment, course, and prognosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Because there are no effective treatments to restore motor neuron function after paralytic polio, prevention has been a mainstay of clinical and research efforts. In areas of the world where polio is endemic, primary immunization is performed with Sabin oral <a href=\"topic.htm?path=poliovirus-vaccine-inactivated-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">poliovirus vaccine</a> (OPV). However, OPV causes polio in one out of 2.5 million doses. Therefore, it has been replaced by the Salk inactivated poliovirus vaccine (IPV) in countries without polio, including the United States and most of Europe. (See <a href=\"#H10\" class=\"local\">'Polio vaccination'</a> above and <a href=\"#H11\" class=\"local\">'Paralytic disease associated with vaccination'</a> above and <a href=\"#H12\" class=\"local\">'Polio eradication'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Nonpolio enteroviruses usually produce infections that are clinically inapparent. Although aseptic meningitis is the most common central nervous system manifestation of enteroviruses (followed by encephalitis), acute flaccid paralysis may sometimes result. (See <a href=\"#H13\" class=\"local\">'Nonpolio enteroviruses causing acute flaccid paralysis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Both human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) and human T-cell lymphotropic virus type 1 (HTLV-1) have been implicated in a syndrome resembling amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), but the clinical presentations are atypical for ALS. In contrast, studies of postmortem central nervous system tissue and of cerebrospinal fluid from patients with unequivocal clinical evidence of ALS have revealed enterovirus more frequently than in controls, but the contribution of such viruses to ALS pathogenesis remains uncertain. (See <a href=\"#H15\" class=\"local\">'Viruses and ALS-like syndrome'</a> above.)</p><p/></div><div id=\"topicAgreement\">Use of UpToDate is subject to the <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/legal/license\" class=\"licenseLink\" id=\"sla_in_page\">Subscription and License Agreement</a>.</div><div id=\"references\" class=\"headingAnchor\"><h1>REFERENCES</h1><ol id=\"reference\"><li><a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/polio-and-infectious-diseases-of-the-anterior-horn/abstract/1\" class=\"nounderline abstract_t\">Brown B, Oberste MS, Maher K, Pallansch MA.
