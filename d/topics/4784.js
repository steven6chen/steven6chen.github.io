Even in the era of highly active antiretroviral therapy, the most common etiologies of pneumonia in this setting are still <em>Pneumocystis jirovecii</em>; bacteria and a variety of other entities also enter the differential diagnosis, including cytomegalovirus pneumonia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cytomegalovirus-infection-as-a-cause-of-pulmonary-disease-in-hiv-infected-patients/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>].</p><p>Although cytomegalovirus (CMV) may produce serious sequelae and death among organ transplant recipients (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prevention-of-cytomegalovirus-infection-in-lung-transplant-recipients\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Prevention of cytomegalovirus infection in lung transplant recipients&quot;</a>), its significance as a pulmonary pathogen in HIV-infected patients is often unclear [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cytomegalovirus-infection-as-a-cause-of-pulmonary-disease-in-hiv-infected-patients/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. The data regarding CMV as a pulmonary pathogen in patients with HIV infection and the prognosis and efficacy of treatment of CMV-related pulmonary disease in this setting will be reviewed here.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">AUTOPSY STUDIES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Autopsy studies are the most abundant source of evidence for CMV as a cause of pulmonary disease in HIV-infected patients. In a study of 75 autopsies of patients with HIV infection, 38 of whom were thought to have died of respiratory failure, 44 patients (59 percent) had histologic evidence of CMV infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cytomegalovirus-infection-as-a-cause-of-pulmonary-disease-in-hiv-infected-patients/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. In over one-half of these patients, the CMV was thought to cause little or no pulmonary dysfunction. In contrast, CMV was thought to play some role in 21 of the 44 patients (as a sole pathogen in 6 patients and as a contributory pathogen in 15).</p><p>In another study of 54 patients who died with HIV infection, 31 patients (57 percent) had histologic evidence of CMV infection in the lung found at autopsy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cytomegalovirus-infection-as-a-cause-of-pulmonary-disease-in-hiv-infected-patients/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. One half of the patients with evidence for CMV pneumonitis were thought to have died of respiratory failure, although other causative agents were also found in most of these patients.</p><p>Therefore, histologic evidence of CMV pneumonitis is frequently present at autopsy in HIV-infected patients, but CMV is not commonly found as the sole pathogen.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL STUDIES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>An important question is whether CMV causes pneumonia in patients with less advanced HIV infection than is the case with the aforementioned autopsy studies. One study compared the clinical features of subjects with lung biopsy documented HIV-related CMV pneumonia to those of subjects with HIV-related PCP. Subjects with CMV pneumonia were more likely to have low CD4 counts (below 12 <span class=\"nowrap\">cells/microL),</span> again suggesting that CMV pneumonia occurs primarily with advanced HIV infection and severe immunodeficiency [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cytomegalovirus-infection-as-a-cause-of-pulmonary-disease-in-hiv-infected-patients/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].</p><p>In the clinical setting, the possibility of pulmonary infection with CMV arises because of one or more of the following:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Positive CMV polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay or culture of bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BAL)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Evidence of CMV antigens or typical cytopathic changes induced by CMV seen on cytologic examination of BAL fluid cells</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Transbronchial or surgical lung biopsy demonstrating pneumonitis and cytopathic effect consistent with CMV</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Bronchoalveolar lavage fluid culture</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Cultures of BAL fluid are not established as either a sensitive or a specific test for CMV pneumonitis. Reports of the sensitivity of the technique are variable; one study of 54 patients with CMV pneumonitis at autopsy found a sensitivity of BAL culture of only 50 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cytomegalovirus-infection-as-a-cause-of-pulmonary-disease-in-hiv-infected-patients/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>], while a second study involving 40 autopsies found a sensitivity of 61 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cytomegalovirus-infection-as-a-cause-of-pulmonary-disease-in-hiv-infected-patients/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. The specificity of a positive result appears unacceptably low, and the presence of CMV on BAL culture does not correlate with gas exchange or chest radiographic abnormalities, or with acute morbidity due to pulmonary disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cytomegalovirus-infection-as-a-cause-of-pulmonary-disease-in-hiv-infected-patients/abstract/8,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,9</a>]. One study of asymptomatic HIV-infected subjects showed that BAL culture was positive for CMV in 9 out of 19 subjects (47 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cytomegalovirus-infection-as-a-cause-of-pulmonary-disease-in-hiv-infected-patients/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>].</p><p>One study evaluated the diagnostic yield of BAL in 420 HIV-infected patients with respiratory symptoms during two separate time periods before (1992-1996) and after (1997-2003) the introduction of potent ART [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cytomegalovirus-infection-as-a-cause-of-pulmonary-disease-in-hiv-infected-patients/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. Although fewer procedures were done in the latter period (130 versus 290), the frequency of positive CMV cultures in BAL samples was similar (28 versus 30 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cytomegalovirus-infection-as-a-cause-of-pulmonary-disease-in-hiv-infected-patients/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>].</p><p>A particular problem is posed by the coexistence of CMV with other pathogens found in BAL fluid, particularly <em>P. jirovecii</em>. BAL fluid cultures or PCR testing may be positive for CMV in the majority of HIV-infected patients with <em>P. jirovecii</em> pneumonia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cytomegalovirus-infection-as-a-cause-of-pulmonary-disease-in-hiv-infected-patients/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>], but it is not clear that clinical sequelae can be attributed to the presence of CMV [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cytomegalovirus-infection-as-a-cause-of-pulmonary-disease-in-hiv-infected-patients/abstract/9,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,12</a>]. As an example, in 111 patients with AIDS and a first episode of PCP, 48 percent had CMV demonstrated on BAL fluid culture [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cytomegalovirus-infection-as-a-cause-of-pulmonary-disease-in-hiv-infected-patients/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. There was no difference between CMV culture-positive and culture-negative patients in terms of initial presentation, long-term survival, hospital mortality, or length of hospital stay. Another study even suggested a better short-term survival and a lower incidence of early deterioration in oxygenation in those patients with PCP who also had BAL cultures positive for CMV [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cytomegalovirus-infection-as-a-cause-of-pulmonary-disease-in-hiv-infected-patients/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Other specimens</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>BAL cytology that is positive for a cytopathic effect is presumably a more specific test than is BAL fluid culture or PCR for CMV. However, there is no good correlation of cytopathic effect with either pneumonia attributable to HIV or with morbidity, above and beyond that associated with the presence of a positive BAL culture [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cytomegalovirus-infection-as-a-cause-of-pulmonary-disease-in-hiv-infected-patients/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. Transbronchial biopsies are likely to be more specific for CMV pneumonitis, but are almost certainly insensitive due to the patchy nature of the disease (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F50365\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef50365 \">picture 1</a>).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h1\">PROGNOSTIC IMPLICATIONS OF PULMONARY CMV</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The presence of CMV in BAL fluid by culture or cytopathic effect connotes a poor prognosis for long-term survival. This phenomenon may reflect CMV shedding as a marker for deteriorating immune system function, or may be due to an effect of CMV itself. For example, one report examined the three and six month mortality in 74 patients with evidence of CMV in BAL specimens compared with 40 patients without evidence of CMV in BAL [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cytomegalovirus-infection-as-a-cause-of-pulmonary-disease-in-hiv-infected-patients/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. The patients with evidence of CMV had a higher mortality at both three (25 versus 10 percent) and six months (50 versus 15 percent). The difference in mortality between the two groups was not directly attributable to lower CD4 counts or <em>Pneumocystis carinii</em> infection.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h1\">EFFECT OF TREATMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A central question in the care of HIV-infected patients with pneumonia and isolation of CMV is whether anti-CMV therapy improves outcome. The preponderance of data suggest that anti-CMV treatment of HIV-infected patients with pneumonia and BAL cultures positive for CMV is not associated with improved survival in comparison with patients who have positive BAL cultures for CMV but are not treated with anti-CMV therapy. For example, one study identified 98 patients with PCP, 26 of whom also had CMV [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cytomegalovirus-infection-as-a-cause-of-pulmonary-disease-in-hiv-infected-patients/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. Thirteen of the 26 patients with both pathogens received antiviral therapy in addition to anti-PCP therapy; no difference in short-term mortality resulted from anti-CMV therapy.</p><p>On the other hand, although efficacy is not firmly established, there are some data suggesting a benefit of treatment for patients with presumed isolated CMV pneumonitis. One study, for example, described the course in eight patients with CMV pneumonitis in whom no other pathogens were isolated from the respiratory tract despite an intensive search [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cytomegalovirus-infection-as-a-cause-of-pulmonary-disease-in-hiv-infected-patients/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. The three untreated patients died of respiratory failure and had CMV pneumonitis confirmed at autopsy. The five treated patients demonstrated improvement, such that all were asymptomatic at three month follow-up. Two of the five treated patients died of other opportunistic infections within six months of the initiation of therapy. Another study reported a survival to hospital discharge of 10 of 17 patients (59 percent) treated for biopsy documented CMV pneumonia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cytomegalovirus-infection-as-a-cause-of-pulmonary-disease-in-hiv-infected-patients/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Use of steroids in the setting of CMV</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The era of adjuvant corticosteroid therapy for HIV-infected patients with PCP has raised concerns that further suppression of host immunity by steroids may potentiate the growth and further dissemination of CMV. For example, one study of 148 consecutive patients with a first episode of PCP treated with adjuvant corticosteroids found that the presence of CMV in BAL fluid did not affect short-term mortality, but was associated with a twofold increase in mortality at three months compared to those patients with negative cultures for CMV [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cytomegalovirus-infection-as-a-cause-of-pulmonary-disease-in-hiv-infected-patients/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. A separate retrospective study of patients treated for severe PCP with adjuvant corticosteroids suggested that patients with BAL cultures positive for CMV had an increase in hospital mortality [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cytomegalovirus-infection-as-a-cause-of-pulmonary-disease-in-hiv-infected-patients/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h2\">Antiviral regimens</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span><a href=\"topic.htm?path=ganciclovir-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Ganciclovir</a> (5 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> IV every 12 hours) is currently considered the drug of choice, although its efficacy for CMV pneumonitis in HIV-infected patients has not been established by controlled studies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cytomegalovirus-infection-as-a-cause-of-pulmonary-disease-in-hiv-infected-patients/abstract/6,20,21\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,20,21</a>]. </p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=foscarnet-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Foscarnet</a> is considered an alternative therapy, although data for its use in this setting are sparse [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cytomegalovirus-infection-as-a-cause-of-pulmonary-disease-in-hiv-infected-patients/abstract/21,22\" class=\"abstract_t\">21,22</a>].
