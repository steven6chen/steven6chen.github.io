Sometimes people pass out (lose consciousness) when they have a concussion, but not always.</p><p>A concussion can happen after a person has an injury to the head from being hit or falling.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H17925139\"><span class=\"h1\">What are the symptoms of a concussion?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Symptoms that can happen minutes to hours after a concussion include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Memory loss &ndash; People sometimes forget what caused their injury, as well as what happened right before and after the injury.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Confusion</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Headache</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Dizziness or trouble with balance</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Nausea or vomiting</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Feeling sleepy</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Acting cranky, strangely, or out of sorts</p><p/><p>Symptoms that can happen hours to days after a concussion include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Trouble walking or talking</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Memory problems or problems paying attention</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Trouble sleeping</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Mood or behavior changes</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Vision changes</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Being bothered by noise or light</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H17925154\"><span class=\"h1\">Will I need tests?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>It depends on your injury and symptoms. To check if you have a concussion, your doctor will ask about your symptoms and do an exam. He or she will also ask you questions to check that you are thinking clearly.</p><p>If your doctor suspects a serious injury, he or she might order an imaging test of the brain, such as a CT or MRI scan. These tests create pictures of the skull and inside of the brain.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H17925169\"><span class=\"h1\">How is a concussion treated?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A concussion does not usually need treatment. Most concussions get better on their own, but it can take time. Some people's symptoms go away within minutes to hours. Other people have symptoms for weeks to months. When symptoms last a long time, doctors call it &quot;postconcussion syndrome.&quot;</p><p>After your concussion, your doctor might recommend that someone watch you for 12 to 24 hours. This person should watch for symptoms.</p><p>To help your brain heal after a concussion, you can:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Rest your body &ndash; Make sure to get plenty of sleep. Avoid heavy exercise or too much physical activity if it makes you feel worse.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Rest your brain &ndash; Avoid doing activities that need concentration or a lot of attention if they make you feel worse.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Not drink alcohol while you are still having symptoms of concussion</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Take a pain-relieving medicine, if you have a headache &ndash; You can choose one with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acetaminophen-paracetamol-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">acetaminophen</a> (sample brand name: Tylenol) or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ibuprofen-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">ibuprofen</a> (sample brand names: Advil, Motrin).</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H17925184\"><span class=\"h1\">When can I play sports or do my usual activities again?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Ask your doctor when you can play sports or do your usual activities again. It will depend on your injury and symptoms, as well as the type of sport you play. Do not go back to playing on the same day as your injury.</p><p>It's important to let your brain heal completely after a concussion.
