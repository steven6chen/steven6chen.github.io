We often initiate second-line therapy at a slightly lower platelet count than used for initial therapy (ie, <span class=\"nowrap\">&lt;20,000/microL</span> rather than <span class=\"nowrap\">30,000/microL</span> that is used for initial therapy). (See <a href=\"#H7052468\" class=\"local\">'Indications for second-line therapy'</a> below.)</p><p>As with the initial treatment of ITP, it is worthwhile to review the diagnosis and exclude secondary causes of ITP, including human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection, prior to initiating new therapies. Some patients presumed to have ITP may actually have drug-induced immune thrombocytopenia, infection-associated thrombocytopenia, a myelodysplastic syndrome, or a congenital platelet disorder; these individuals will require a different management approach. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=immune-thrombocytopenia-itp-in-adults-initial-treatment-and-prognosis#H18960585\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) in adults: Initial treatment and prognosis&quot;, section on 'Other therapeutic considerations'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=immune-thrombocytopenia-itp-in-adults-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) in adults: Clinical manifestations and diagnosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p>We consider intravenous <a href=\"topic.htm?path=immune-globulin-intravenous-subcutaneous-and-intramsucular-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">immune globulin</a> (IVIG) to be rescue treatment in ITP rather than routine therapy. It is important for patients with clinically important bleeding and for patients in whom a more rapid response is required [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/immune-thrombocytopenia-itp-in-adults-second-line-and-subsequent-therapies/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7052468\"><span class=\"h2\">Indications for second-line therapy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Second-line therapy is generally reserved for patients with thrombocytopenia that is associated with significant bleeding symptoms (eg, mucosal purpura, more serious bleeding) or for severe, persistent or recurrent thrombocytopenia (eg, platelet count <span class=\"nowrap\">&lt;20,000/microL),</span> following glucocorticoid-based treatments. For second-line therapies, we recommend splenectomy or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=rituximab-intravenous-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">rituximab</a> rather than chronic glucocorticoids (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F54047\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef54047 \">algorithm 1</a>). &#160;</p><p>The importance of proceeding to second-line therapy is greater for patients with a higher risk of bleeding due to other comorbidities (eg, hypertension, renal insufficiency), the need for concomitant antiplatelet agents or anticoagulant medications, or athletic activities or careers with high risk for trauma in certain patients. Additional patients may benefit from second-line agents if they are unable to tolerate adverse effects of glucocorticoids. Patients who are less concerned about bleeding and more concerned about side effects of therapy may choose to defer second-line therapy even at lower platelet counts. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=immune-thrombocytopenia-itp-in-adults-initial-treatment-and-prognosis#H4\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) in adults: Initial treatment and prognosis&quot;, section on 'Indications for treatment'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7052482\"><span class=\"h2\">Choice and sequence of therapy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There are two principal choices of second-line, which differ in their efficacy and risks: splenectomy and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=rituximab-intravenous-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">rituximab</a>. These modalities have the potential to establish a long-term remission, although remissions are generally shorter for rituximab. Thrombopoietin (TPO) receptor agonists are considered as maintenance treatments, which need to be continuously administered in most patients to maintain a safe platelet count. They are typically used when splenectomy <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> rituximab fail to produce a safe platelet count. </p><p>Balancing the risks and benefits of these approaches is challenging. Splenectomy is a one-time surgery; medical therapies like <a href=\"topic.htm?path=rituximab-intravenous-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">rituximab</a> may need to be re-administered. The following principles apply to decisions regarding second-line or subsequent therapies:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients who require additional treatment beyond initial therapy with glucocorticoids, we suggest splenectomy, provided the patient can tolerate surgery. This practice is based on greater response rates and longer sustained responses to splenectomy compared with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=rituximab-intravenous-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">rituximab</a>. (See <a href=\"#H16547568\" class=\"local\">'Splenectomy'</a> below.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><a href=\"topic.htm?path=rituximab-intravenous-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Rituximab</a> may be appropriate for patients in whom splenectomy should be avoided (eg, comorbidities that increase operative risk, higher-than-average infection risk) or who prefer not to undergo splenectomy. (See <a href=\"#H16539965\" class=\"local\">'Rituximab'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For those patients for whom splenectomy does not produce a platelet count response, we suggest <a href=\"topic.htm?path=rituximab-intravenous-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">rituximab</a> rather than a TPO receptor agonist. (See <a href=\"#H16539965\" class=\"local\">'Rituximab'</a> below.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>TPO receptor agonists are used by some clinicians for patients whose platelet count does not respond adequately to first-line therapies while definitive second-line therapies are being considered. We generally reserve TPO receptor agonists for patients with persistent severe thrombocytopenia after splenectomy <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> <a href=\"topic.htm?path=rituximab-intravenous-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">rituximab</a>, or for individuals who are unable to tolerate or are unwilling to undergo splenectomy <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> rituximab. TPO receptor agonists may also be useful for those who require a temporary increase in platelet count in preparation for surgery and do not have an adequate platelet count response to glucocorticoids or IVIG. (See <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Thrombopoietin receptor agonists'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients with persistent severe thrombocytopenia despite splenectomy, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=rituximab-intravenous-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">rituximab</a>, and TPO receptor agonists, additional options include <a href=\"topic.htm?path=danazol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">danazol</a>, intermittent glucocorticoids, or other immunosuppressive agents. The administration of multiple treatments simultaneously may also be used. Other causes of thrombocytopenia should be explored in patients who are refractory to treatments. (See <a href=\"#H14\" class=\"local\">'Other therapies'</a> below and <a href=\"#H112549608\" class=\"local\">'Combination therapy'</a> below.) </p><p/><p>This approach is compatible with guidelines for ITP issued by the British Committee for Standards in Haematology General Haematology Task Force in 2003, an international consensus report published in 2010, and an American Society of Hematology evidence-based practice guideline published in 2011 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/immune-thrombocytopenia-itp-in-adults-second-line-and-subsequent-therapies/abstract/4,6,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,6,7</a>].</p><p>The relative efficacy of splenectomy versus <a href=\"topic.htm?path=rituximab-intravenous-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">rituximab</a> has not been evaluated in a randomized trial; however, the reported initial response rates with splenectomy are higher (eg, 60 to 80 percent versus 55 to 65 percent, respectively) and responses are more durable (often lasting for many years or even indefinitely for splenectomy, versus one to two years for rituximab) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/immune-thrombocytopenia-itp-in-adults-second-line-and-subsequent-therapies/abstract/8-13\" class=\"abstract_t\">8-13</a>]. Decisions about when to perform splenectomy can be challenging, however, because of the possibility of a late spontaneous remission. There are also significant differences in short- and long-term risks of splenectomy versus rituximab (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F95678\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef95678 \">table 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/immune-thrombocytopenia-itp-in-adults-second-line-and-subsequent-therapies/abstract/14,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">14,15</a>]. </p><p>Differences in clinician preference for second-line therapy were illustrated in a survey of 83 Oklahoma hematologists who treat adults with ITP [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/immune-thrombocytopenia-itp-in-adults-second-line-and-subsequent-therapies/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. When presented with a hypothetical patient requiring second-line therapy, equal numbers chose splenectomy and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=rituximab-intravenous-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">rituximab</a> (39 versus 37 percent, respectively). The major factor that correlated with choice of therapy was the number of years in practice: clinicians were more likely to choose splenectomy if they had been in practice for &gt;20 years, and more likely to choose rituximab if they had been in practice for &le;20 years. Additionally, 13 hematologists (16 percent) selected TPO receptor agonists prior to splenectomy or rituximab. Differences in patient preferences also factor into decision-making. This was shown in an interview-based study of 25 patients with ITP who did not have a response to first-line therapy: 15 patients (60 percent) refused splenectomy because of perceptions that the impact of their illness did not warrant splenectomy, impressions of splenectomy as a last-resort treatment, and uncertainty about splenectomy success rates [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/immune-thrombocytopenia-itp-in-adults-second-line-and-subsequent-therapies/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7053272\"><span class=\"h2\">Immunizations</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Appropriate immunizations for encapsulated organisms should be administered at least two weeks prior to splenectomy, if possible. However, these should be administered prior to splenectomy even if splenectomy will be performed urgently, and urgent splenectomy should not be delayed to optimize vaccine response. Treatment with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=rituximab-intravenous-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">rituximab</a> can suppress vaccine responses for up to six months after administration, and patients may later undergo splenectomy. Thus, we also provide immunizations prior to starting rituximab therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/immune-thrombocytopenia-itp-in-adults-second-line-and-subsequent-therapies/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>].

Splenectomy is our preferred second-line therapy for ITP because it results in a sustained remission in the majority of adults and has an acceptable toxicity profile. This was illustrated in a systematic review of splenectomy for ITP that included data for 47 case series (2623 adults) and over 50 years of observation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/immune-thrombocytopenia-itp-in-adults-second-line-and-subsequent-therapies/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. This analysis demonstrated normalization of platelet counts in 66 percent of individuals treated with splenectomy and platelet counts increases to <span class=\"nowrap\">&gt;50,000/microL</span> in an additional 22 percent, for a total response rate of 88 percent. Responses persisted throughout the duration of monitoring (up to over 12 years) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F59587\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef59587 \">figure 1</a>). A subsequent study reported that the duration of response following splenectomy and the likelihood of response may be reduced in patients older than 65 years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/immune-thrombocytopenia-itp-in-adults-second-line-and-subsequent-therapies/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. </p><p>Platelet counts typically rise within the first two weeks postoperatively (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F87698\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef87698 \">table 2</a>). Platelet count increases within one to two days can also occur, and delayed responses (up to eight weeks or longer) have been observed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/immune-thrombocytopenia-itp-in-adults-second-line-and-subsequent-therapies/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. The only clinical parameter that predicts a favorable response to splenectomy is patient age; younger patients have a higher response rate, although a specific age cutoff below which splenectomy was most effective could not be determined [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/immune-thrombocytopenia-itp-in-adults-second-line-and-subsequent-therapies/abstract/5,8,21,22\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,8,21,22</a>].</p><p>Of note, we suggest not pursuing diagnosis of an accessory spleen or accessory splenectomy in patients with persistent thrombocytopenia following splenectomy. However, this approach has been used in rare patients who have a late recurrence of ITP after splenectomy. Absence of Howell-Jolly bodies (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F60588\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef60588 \">picture 1</a>) on the peripheral blood smear may be a clue to persistent splenic tissue or splenic tissue regrowth.

However, data to predict which patients will undergo spontaneous remission (and thus might avoid splenectomy) are lacking, and there is not a clear cutoff time after which spontaneous remissions become less likely. We individualize the timing of splenectomy based on the patient's clinical features, response to initial therapy, and other considerations (eg, patient preference).</p><p>In practice, we often wait at least six months from diagnosis of ITP to splenectomy, to allow for late spontaneous remissions; this practice is consistent with a 2010 consensus report [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/immune-thrombocytopenia-itp-in-adults-second-line-and-subsequent-therapies/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].

Patients who are less concerned about bleeding and more concerned about side effects of therapy may choose to defer second-line therapy at lower platelet counts. (See <a href=\"#H7052468\" class=\"local\">'Indications for second-line therapy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Splenectomy and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=rituximab-intravenous-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">rituximab</a> are both associated with durable remissions off treatment. Balancing the risks and benefits of these therapies is challenging because their benefits, side effects, and toxicity profiles differ greatly (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F95678\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef95678 \">table 1</a>). The relative efficacy of splenectomy versus rituximab has not been evaluated in a randomized trial; however, reported response rates with splenectomy are higher and last longer. Thus, for patients who require additional treatment after glucocorticoids or IVIG, we suggest splenectomy, provided the patient can tolerate surgery (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=5\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2B</a>). (See <a href=\"#H7052482\" class=\"local\">'Choice and sequence of therapy'</a> above and <a href=\"#H16547568\" class=\"local\">'Splenectomy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>We often wait at least six months to allow time for late spontaneous remissions to occur, unless severe thrombocytopenia persists with severe bleeding. (See <a href=\"#H663275\" class=\"local\">'Timing of splenectomy'</a> above.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>We provide preoperative immunizations. (See <a href=\"#H663295\" class=\"local\">'Pre-splenectomy considerations'</a> above.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>We suggest a laparoscopic rather than an open procedure (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients who have not had an adequate platelet count response to glucocorticoids and splenectomy, or who are not candidates for or prefer to avoid splenectomy, we suggest <a href=\"topic.htm?path=rituximab-intravenous-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">rituximab</a> (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=5\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2B</a>). Prior to initiating therapy we provide immunizations and test hepatitis B serologies. (See <a href=\"#H16539965\" class=\"local\">'Rituximab'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Thrombopoietin (TPO) receptor agonists typically require continuous maintenance administration, usually do not induce remission, and are expensive. We generally reserve TPO receptor agonists for patients who have persistent severe thrombocytopenia despite splenectomy and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=rituximab-intravenous-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">rituximab</a> or are unable to tolerate these therapies. We also use these agents for patients who require a temporary increase in platelet count (eg, in preparation for surgery or while awaiting more definitive therapy) and do not have an increase in platelet count with glucocorticoids or IVIG. <a href=\"topic.htm?path=romiplostim-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Romiplostim</a> (once-weekly subcutaneous injection) and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=eltrombopag-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">eltrombopag</a> (once-daily oral pill) have similar efficacy and toxicity; the choice between these agents is based on availability, cost, patient comorbidities, and patient preference. (See <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Thrombopoietin receptor agonists'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Several other therapies and combinations of agents have been used to treat ITP that has not responded to glucocorticoids <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> IVIG, with some reports of success. Options include <a href=\"topic.htm?path=danazol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">danazol</a>, intermittent glucocorticoids, other immunosuppressive agents, and combination therapies. Choices vary according to clinician and patient preference; it may take time to find the best approach for each individual patient.
