Human leukocyte antigen (HLA) typing should be performed for patients who are candidates for future hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT). Women of child-bearing age should undergo a pregnancy test.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We routinely test thiopurine methyltransferase (TPMT) enzyme activity (phenotype) before starting 6-MP, and we use reduced doses for patients with low or absent activity. An acceptable alternative is to reserve testing for patients with unexpectedly severe or prolonged myelosuppression following 6-MP. TPMT genotype testing is not specifically recommended by the FDA prior to treatment with 6-MP, and patients with normal TPMT status can still exhibit bone marrow <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> liver toxicity in a dose-related fashion. Some of this toxicity, especially in East Asian and Hispanic patients, may be due to a variant in the <em>NUDT15</em> gene [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/induction-therapy-for-philadelphia-chromosome-negative-acute-lymphoblastic-leukemia-in-adults/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].

This sample should be sent for pathologic review, immunophenotyping, cytochemistry, cytogenetics, and genetic profiling. Marrow aspirate or peripheral blood blasts should be sent for reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) analysis for <em>BCR-ABL1</em> in order to rapidly identify Philadelphia chromosome positive ALL. If the bone marrow is not aspirable, RT-PCR can be performed on peripheral blood blast cells. In some centers, a FISH analysis aimed at excluding <em>BCR-ABL1</em> can be performed rapidly. If a satisfactory aspirate for cytogenetics is not obtained, peripheral blood analysis for 11q23 abnormalities at least should be done using FISH analysis. While FISH studies for <em>MLL</em> rearrangements, <em><span class=\"nowrap\">ETV5/RUNX1</em>,</span> and trisomies 4, 10, and 17 are routinely performed in children, given their infrequent occurrence in older patients, these studies may not be necessary in adults with a good sample for metaphase cytogenetic analysis.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A chest x-ray, an electrocardiogram (EKG), and a study of cardiac function (eg, ejection fraction measured by echocardiogram or radionuclide ventriculography) should be performed at baseline, especially for patients with a cardiac history, prior anthracycline exposure, or cardiovascular symptoms.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Dental evaluation for possible infection foci is warranted [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/induction-therapy-for-philadelphia-chromosome-negative-acute-lymphoblastic-leukemia-in-adults/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients with neurologic signs or symptoms should undergo imaging studies to evaluate for meningeal disease, or central nervous system bleeding. Lumbar puncture is indicated in all patients to examine the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) for leukemic involvement. Care must be taken to avoid contaminating the CSF specimen with peripheral blood if blasts are present. CSF should be sent for both cytology (examination of stained cytospin slides) and flow cytometry.</p><p/><p>Central venous access must be placed. Two or three independent ports aid medical management of transfusions, chemotherapy, antibiotics, and other intravenous support. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-central-venous-access\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of central venous access&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Men and women with child-bearing potential should receive counseling about the potential effect of treatment on their fertility and options for fertility-preserving measures. Given the urgent need for treatment, options for women are limited, but men can often participate in sperm banking. Typically, the drugs used to induce remission in ALL may not cause sterility in younger patients. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fertility-preservation-in-patients-undergoing-gonadotoxic-treatment-or-gonadal-resection\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Fertility preservation in patients undergoing gonadotoxic treatment or gonadal resection&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The speed with which intensive remission induction chemotherapy should begin varies with the individual patient's condition and treatment options. In general, it is far more important to stabilize a patient's condition and correct or control co-morbidities, such as infection, bleeding, hyperuricemia, dehydration, renal dysfunction, anemia, and thrombocytopenia, than it is to immediately start chemotherapy. Oral <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hydroxyurea-hydroxycarbamide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">hydroxyurea</a> can be used for cytoreduction of an elevated peripheral blast cell count while these problems are addressed. This interval of several days also allows for complete genetic screening where the results will have an impact on the choice of treatment.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">CHEMOTHERAPY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Combination chemotherapy is the primary treatment modality for patients with ALL. There is no role for surgery or radiation therapy in the induction phase. Multiple induction regimens have been developed, most often based upon pediatric regimens. None have been directly compared in a prospective randomized trial. As such, there is no single best regimen for induction therapy in ALL and patients should be encouraged to participate in clinical trials whenever possible.</p><p>These chemotherapy regimens have evolved empirically into complex schemes that use numerous agents in various doses, combinations, and schedules. Few of the individual components have been tested rigorously in randomized trials. Thus, it is difficult to critically analyze the absolute contribution of each drug or dose schedule to the ultimate outcome. Numerous nonrandomized trials have attempted to answer these questions, but multiple alterations in study design between sequential trials have made it difficult to assess the exact merit of each modification.</p><p>Most chemotherapy regimens for ALL contain <a href=\"topic.htm?path=vincristine-conventional-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">vincristine</a>, a corticosteroid (ie, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prednisone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">prednisone</a> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dexamethasone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">dexamethasone</a>), and an anthracycline (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F61620\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef61620 \">table 1</a>)&nbsp;[<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/induction-therapy-for-philadelphia-chromosome-negative-acute-lymphoblastic-leukemia-in-adults/abstract/3-9\" class=\"abstract_t\">3-9</a>]. In addition, some form of central nervous system (CNS) prophylaxis is incorporated. With these regimens, more than 80 percent of newly diagnosed adults with ALL enter complete remission (CR). Protocols that have added other agents (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cyclophosphamide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cyclophosphamide</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cytarabine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cytarabine</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methotrexate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">methotrexate</a>, 6-mercaptopurine, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=etoposide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">etoposide</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=teniposide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">teniposide</a>, or asparaginase) have not improved the CR rate; however, some have demonstrated a faster time to achievement of CR, which may be associated with prolonged remissions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/induction-therapy-for-philadelphia-chromosome-negative-acute-lymphoblastic-leukemia-in-adults/abstract/10-12\" class=\"abstract_t\">10-12</a>].</p><p>The following are examples of the most commonly used regimens:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Cancer and Leukemia Group B (CALGB study 8811 or 9111) ALL regimen (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F67471\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef67471 \">table 2</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/induction-therapy-for-philadelphia-chromosome-negative-acute-lymphoblastic-leukemia-in-adults/abstract/13,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,14</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Standard or augmented Berlin-Frankfurt-Munster (BFM) has been used by the Children&rsquo;s Cancer Group for children and adolescents (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F81231\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef81231 \">table 3</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/induction-therapy-for-philadelphia-chromosome-negative-acute-lymphoblastic-leukemia-in-adults/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Hyperfractionated <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cyclophosphamide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cyclophosphamide</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=vincristine-conventional-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">vincristine</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=doxorubicin-conventional-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">doxorubicin</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dexamethasone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">dexamethasone</a> (Hyper-CVAD) alternating with high-dose <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methotrexate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">methotrexate</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cytarabine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cytarabine</a>&nbsp;(<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F50617\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef50617 \">table 4</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/induction-therapy-for-philadelphia-chromosome-negative-acute-lymphoblastic-leukemia-in-adults/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>French GRAALL-2003 regimen for younger adults (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F54375\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef54375 \">table 5</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/induction-therapy-for-philadelphia-chromosome-negative-acute-lymphoblastic-leukemia-in-adults/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>].</p><p/><p>Details on these specific regimens are provided in the sections that follow. All patients with newly diagnosed ALL require induction chemotherapy with the goal of achieving a complete remission. Patients should be encouraged to participate in clinical trials whenever possible. If a clinical trial is not available or if the patient chooses not to participate in a clinical trial, any of the regimens above would be reasonable and a choice should be made based upon the physician's comfort with administration. We typically use CALGB ALL clinical trial regimens at our institution (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F67471\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef67471 \">table 2</a>).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">General considerations</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h3\">Anthracyclines</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The importance of an anthracycline in the treatment of all adults with ALL was perhaps best illustrated by an early randomized trial (CALGB 7612) that incorporated the anthracycline <a href=\"topic.htm?path=daunorubicin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">daunorubicin</a> during the first three days of induction therapy into a chemotherapy program that included <a href=\"topic.htm?path=vincristine-conventional-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">vincristine</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prednisone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">prednisone</a>, and L-asparaginase; patients who received daunorubicin demonstrated superior CR rates (83 versus 47 percent) and median remission duration (18 versus 5 months) when compared with those who did not receive daunorubicin [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/induction-therapy-for-philadelphia-chromosome-negative-acute-lymphoblastic-leukemia-in-adults/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. <a href=\"topic.htm?path=doxorubicin-conventional-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Doxorubicin</a>, daunorubicin, rubidazone, and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=mitoxantrone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">mitoxantrone</a> appear to produce comparable results [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/induction-therapy-for-philadelphia-chromosome-negative-acute-lymphoblastic-leukemia-in-adults/abstract/4,11,13,18-25\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,11,13,18-25</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h3\">Cyclophosphamide</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A prospective trial that randomly assigned treatment of 778 adults with newly diagnosed ALL to receive induction therapy (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=vincristine-conventional-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">vincristine</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prednisone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">prednisone</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=daunorubicin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">daunorubicin</a>, asparaginase) with or without a single dose of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cyclophosphamide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cyclophosphamide</a> reported similar rates of CR (81 and 83 percent) and eight-year disease-free survival (34 and 31 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/induction-therapy-for-philadelphia-chromosome-negative-acute-lymphoblastic-leukemia-in-adults/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. Other trials that have investigated the addition of cyclophosphamide into the treatment regimen of ALL have suggested that cyclophosphamide may increase the rapidity with which CR is achieved and may increase remission duration. Two sequential cooperative group trials involving 379 adults reported a similar CR rate (85 percent) and a median remission duration of 28 months [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/induction-therapy-for-philadelphia-chromosome-negative-acute-lymphoblastic-leukemia-in-adults/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. However, the median remission duration varied according to the rapidity of CR attainment, being 34 months for the 237 patients who achieved CR within 30 days, compared with 20 months for the 88 patients who required more than 30 days to enter into remission.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h3\">Asparaginase</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Asparaginase is a key component of the ALL regimens for children leading to superior CR and disease-free survival rates [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/induction-therapy-for-philadelphia-chromosome-negative-acute-lymphoblastic-leukemia-in-adults/abstract/19,27\" class=\"abstract_t\">19,27</a>]. For adults, it is a component of the CALGB ALL regimen, the BFM regimen, the GRAALL 2003 regimen, and the modified Hyper-CVAD regimen, but not the standard Hyper-CVAD regimen.</p><p>The importance of asparagine depletion in adults was illustrated in a prospective study of pegylated asparaginase that demonstrated a significant improvement in median overall survival (31 versus 13 months) in those patients who achieved plasma asparagine depletion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/induction-therapy-for-philadelphia-chromosome-negative-acute-lymphoblastic-leukemia-in-adults/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. Further support comes from pediatric trials that suggest that clinical outcomes improve as the period of complete asparagine depletion in the plasma increases. Protocols for adults must balance the desire to achieve maximum asparagine depletion with the understanding that prolonged depletion is difficult for most adults to tolerate. Asparaginase can be associated with allergic reactions, coagulopathies, acute pancreatitis, and increased liver transaminases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/induction-therapy-for-philadelphia-chromosome-negative-acute-lymphoblastic-leukemia-in-adults/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. Asparaginase induces a hypercoagulable state that can result in catastrophic thrombosis of the inferior vena cava or the superior sagittal sinus in addition to deep vein thromboses of the legs or arms. In addition, adults receiving asparaginase commonly develop fatigue, anorexia, confusion, and listlessness. Infusion reactions to and thrombosis with asparaginase are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=infusion-reactions-to-systemic-chemotherapy#H45\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Infusion reactions to systemic chemotherapy&quot;, section on 'L-asparaginase'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=drug-induced-thrombosis-in-patients-with-malignancy#H3\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Drug-induced thrombosis in patients with malignancy&quot;, section on 'L-asparaginase'</a>.) </p><p>There are three formulations of asparaginase available, each with different half-lives:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Native <a href=\"topic.htm?path=e-coli-asparaginase-united-states-not-available-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Escherichia coli Asparaginase</a> (not available in the US) &ndash; Half-life approximately one day </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><a href=\"topic.htm?path=erwinia-asparaginase-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Erwinia Asparaginase</a> &ndash; Half-life approximately 14 hours</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pegylated <a href=\"topic.htm?path=e-coli-asparaginase-united-states-not-available-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Escherichia coli Asparaginase</a> (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=pegaspargase-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">pegaspargase</a>, Oncaspar) &ndash; Half-life approximately six days</p><p/><p>The dose and schedule of asparaginase administration varies depending upon the formulation chosen. Investigations are ongoing to determine the ideal dose and schedule. Pegylated asparaginase has become the preferred preparation for most circumstances because it appears to be less immunogenic while providing equal or greater efficacy when compared with the other formulations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/induction-therapy-for-philadelphia-chromosome-negative-acute-lymphoblastic-leukemia-in-adults/abstract/28,30-33\" class=\"abstract_t\">28,30-33</a>]. In addition, patients who receive pegylated asparaginase appear to be less likely to develop antibodies that result in increased clearance of asparaginase from the circulation and possibly to reduced efficacy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/induction-therapy-for-philadelphia-chromosome-negative-acute-lymphoblastic-leukemia-in-adults/abstract/34-41\" class=\"abstract_t\">34-41</a>]. </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Pegylated asparaginase</strong> &ndash; A reasonable schedule for pegylated asparaginase would be either 2000 <span class=\"nowrap\">units/m<sup>2</span> </sup>given every two weeks or 1000 <span class=\"nowrap\">units/m<sup>2</sup></span> given weekly. These doses should result in asparagine depletion in the vast majority of adults for a two-week period. Generally, this has been intercalated between courses of more cytotoxic therapy or the combination of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=vincristine-conventional-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">vincristine</a> plus corticosteroids.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Nonpegylated preparations</strong> &ndash; Nonpegylated asparaginase preparations have a shorter half-life and require daily or every other day administration.

If asparaginase levels are nondetectable with one preparation, an alternative preparation may be more effective. The best time to measure asparaginase activity depends upon the formulation, dosing, and schedule of asparaginase used. As an example, when using pegylated asparaginase, asparaginase activity is measured 7 and 14 days after the first dose during induction and seven days following every reintroduction after a break in asparaginase treatment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/induction-therapy-for-philadelphia-chromosome-negative-acute-lymphoblastic-leukemia-in-adults/abstract/43\" class=\"abstract_t\">43</a>]. A level below 0.1 <span class=\"nowrap\">IU/mL</span> on day 7 <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> undetectable levels on day 14 are consistent with silent inactivation. Routine antibody monitoring is not implemented in current practice, partly because the prognostic impact of finding the antibody is variable and the testing is only available at a few centers. </p><p>Because of the relatively high incidence of infusion reactions, asparaginase should only be administered in a setting where anaphylaxis can be appropriately managed. Patients who develop an anaphylactic reaction to one preparation may be considered for treatment with another preparation. This is discussed in more detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=infusion-reactions-to-systemic-chemotherapy#H48\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Infusion reactions to systemic chemotherapy&quot;, section on 'Options for retreatment'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h3\">Choice of steroid</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Historically, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prednisone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">prednisone</a> has been incorporated as the steroid in the majority of ALL induction regimens.

The management of ALL in older adults can be complicated by an increased number of comorbidities. A comprehensive geriatric assessment may be useful in assessing comorbidity and functional status in an elderly patient, thus permitting the formulation of an appropriate, individualized treatment plan. Special considerations for the use of chemotherapy in the elderly population are discussed separately.

Outcomes are worse than for younger adults. As an example, a post hoc analysis compared the outcomes of 100 older adults (age 55 to 65 years) to that of 1814 younger patients (age 14 to 54 years) treated on a prospective trial of intensive chemotherapy in patients with newly diagnosed ALL [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/induction-therapy-for-philadelphia-chromosome-negative-acute-lymphoblastic-leukemia-in-adults/abstract/82\" class=\"abstract_t\">82</a>].

Approximately half of older patients with ALL have <span class=\"nowrap\">Ph+/BCR-ABL</span> positive disease. For these patients, the prognosis has improved recently with the incorporation of tyrosine kinase inhibitors into frontline therapy. Drugs such as asparaginase, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=vincristine-conventional-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">vincristine</a>, and anthracyclines, which are critical for the treatment of ALL in younger patients, are poorly tolerated by patients older than 60 years. Nevertheless, current treatment strategies for older adults still incorporate these agents, often at reduced doses [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/induction-therapy-for-philadelphia-chromosome-negative-acute-lymphoblastic-leukemia-in-adults/abstract/83\" class=\"abstract_t\">83</a>].
