Outcome is most closely related to the extent of disease at presentation. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-the-management-of-primary-colon-cancer#H35\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of the management of primary colon cancer&quot;, section on 'Prognosis'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-the-management-of-rectal-adenocarcinoma#H1131680442\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of the management of rectal adenocarcinoma&quot;, section on 'Prognosis'</a>.) </p><p>Among patients who have undergone potentially curative resection for colorectal cancer, disease recurrence is thought to arise from clinically occult micrometastases that are present at the time of surgery. The goal of postoperative (adjuvant) therapy is to eradicate these micrometastases, thereby increasing the cure rate. In colon cancer, the benefits of adjuvant chemotherapy have been most clearly demonstrated in stage III (node-positive (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F111438\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef111438 \">table 1</a>)) colon cancer, whereas benefit in stage II disease remains controversial.

Neoadjuvant or induction chemoradiotherapy is an increasingly used option for patients with locally advanced rectal adenocarcinomas, with additional chemotherapy to eradicate micrometastases administered postoperatively; however, in some cases, chemotherapy can also be given preoperatively. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=adjuvant-therapy-for-resected-rectal-adenocarcinoma#H3\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Adjuvant therapy for resected rectal adenocarcinoma&quot;, section on 'Combined modality therapy'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=neoadjuvant-chemoradiotherapy-and-radiotherapy-for-rectal-adenocarcinoma#H27\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy and radiotherapy for rectal adenocarcinoma&quot;, section on 'Benefit of postoperative chemotherapy'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=neoadjuvant-chemoradiotherapy-and-radiotherapy-for-rectal-adenocarcinoma#H1071237872\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy and radiotherapy for rectal adenocarcinoma&quot;, section on 'Intensification of preoperative therapy for T4 and/or bulky tumors'</a>.) </p><p>Beyond the benefits of chemotherapy and radiation therapy, several adjunctive factors have been associated with improved outcomes after treatment of early stage colorectal cancer, including interventions to achieve energy balance (ie, maintaining a healthy body weight, higher levels of physical activity), intake of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aspirin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">aspirin</a> and other nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), vitamin D status, and coffee consumption. The data linking these adjunctive treatments to outcomes will be addressed here. A more in-depth discussion on the roles of diet, physical activity, and body weight in cancer survivors is provided elsewhere.

However, whether weight reduction or changes in diet would improve outcomes after treatment for colon cancer is not known. </p><p>In addition, higher levels of physical activity may reduce the risk of CRC-specific and overall mortality, in addition to having a beneficial impact on fatigue, quality of life, and functional status [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/adjunctive-therapy-for-patients-with-resected-early-stage-colorectal-cancer-diet-exercise-nsaids-vitamin-d-and-coffee-consumption/abstract/1-3\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-3</a>]. Despite the paucity of randomized controlled trials confirming these observations, updated 2013 American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) guidelines for follow-up care, surveillance, and secondary prevention measures for survivors of CRC endorse counseling patients on maintaining a healthy body weight, being physically active, and eating a healthy diet [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/adjunctive-therapy-for-patients-with-resected-early-stage-colorectal-cancer-diet-exercise-nsaids-vitamin-d-and-coffee-consumption/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. The roles of diet, physical activity, and body weight in cancer survivors are discussed separately.

Patients consuming four or more cups per day of caffeinated coffee during and six months after adjuvant chemotherapy experienced a significantly reduced cancer recurrence or mortality risk compared with abstainers (hazard ratio [HR] 0.48, 95% CI 0.25-0.91; p = 0.002). Neither nonherbal tea nor decaffeinated coffee intake was associated with patient outcome. The association persisted even after controlling for known or suspected predictors of patient outcomes, including physical activity, dietary glycemic load, and other dietary patterns. The authors postulated that coffee might reduce the risk of colon cancer recurrence and death through improved insulin sensitization and decreased hyperinsulinemia, on the basis of previous studies supporting the role of high energy balance states in promoting colon cancer recurrence and mortality.

The analysis was stratified by postdiagnosis smoking status and by other potentially confounding variables, such as age, sex, alcohol consumption, body mass index (BMI), physical activity, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aspirin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">aspirin</a> use, glycemic index, glycemic load, and cancer site. Over almost eight years of follow-up, there were 808 deaths, 188 due to CRC. Higher total coffee intake was associated with reduced risk for both CRC-specific and all-cause mortality, and there was a dose-response effect:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a multivariate adjusted analysis, compared with abstainers, patients who consumed at least four cups of coffee per day had a significantly lower risk of CRC-specific death (HR 0.48, 95% CI 0.28-0.83) and all-cause death (HR 0.30, 95% CI 0.54-0.91).

Many oncologists, including some of the authors, recommend low-dose aspirin to patients with resected early stage CRC unless they have a contraindication (preexisting coagulopathy, on anticoagulants, history of gastritis or peptic ulcer disease). Although the evidence is intriguing, it is premature to consider testing individual patients for mutations in the <em>PIK3CA</em> gene in order to make decisions about postcancer aspirin use.</p><p>Numerous observational studies and randomized trials [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/adjunctive-therapy-for-patients-with-resected-early-stage-colorectal-cancer-diet-exercise-nsaids-vitamin-d-and-coffee-consumption/abstract/8,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,9</a>] have demonstrated the efficacy of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aspirin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">aspirin</a> against the development of colorectal adenomas and CRC through its actions as an inhibitor of the cyclooxygenase 2 (COX-2) pathway.

The reduction in mortality was even greater among patients who initiated aspirin use after cancer diagnosis than among patients who used it before, and benefit was limited to those whose tumors overexpressed COX-2. Benefits were similar in patients who received standard adjuvant chemotherapy and those who did not, and in those with stage I, II, and III disease at diagnosis.

(See <a href=\"#H3766171594\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Given the mounting evidence that diet and exercise can modify prognosis, patients with early stage CRC should be encouraged to maintain a healthy weight and exercise regularly. (See <a href=\"#H1273516514\" class=\"local\">'Diet and exercise'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Several observational studies suggest that use of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aspirin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">aspirin</a> and other NSAIDs may improve survival among patients receiving treatment for early CRC, although all of the available data are from observational studies and it is not clear that all patients benefit. Many oncologists, including some of the authors, recommend low-dose aspirin to patients with resected early stage CRC unless they have a contraindication (preexisting coagulopathy, on anticoagulants, history of gastritis or peptic ulcer disease). Although the evidence is intriguing, it is premature to consider testing individual patients for mutations in the <em>PIK3CA</em> gene in order to make decisions about postcancer aspirin use. (See <a href=\"#H754480570\" class=\"local\">'Aspirin and other NSAIDs'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>An association between higher vitamin D levels and prognosis in early stage CRC has been suggested. Whether higher levels of vitamin D supplementation can improve prognosis in conjunction with adjuvant chemotherapy is not yet known. Nevertheless, given the benefits of vitamin D repletion in terms of skeletal health and the possibility of better cancer-related outcomes, it seems reasonable to test serum vitamin D levels in patients with newly diagnosed CRC and to replete those with low levels (serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D] &lt;20 <span class=\"nowrap\">ng/mL</span> [50 <span class=\"nowrap\">nmol/L])</span>. (See <a href=\"#H1599518867\" class=\"local\">'Vitamin D status'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The possibility that higher levels of coffee consumption might be related to outcomes has been suggested in at least two independent studies. However, the evidence for causality is not yet conclusive, and it is possible that the observed association is related to confounding variables. (See <a href=\"#H1981570234\" class=\"local\">'Coffee consumption'</a> above.)</p></div><div id=\"topicAgreement\">Use of UpToDate is subject to the <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/legal/license\" class=\"licenseLink\" id=\"sla_in_page\">Subscription and License Agreement</a>.</div><div id=\"references\" class=\"headingAnchor\"><h1>REFERENCES</h1><ol id=\"reference\"><li><a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/adjunctive-therapy-for-patients-with-resected-early-stage-colorectal-cancer-diet-exercise-nsaids-vitamin-d-and-coffee-consumption/abstract/1\" class=\"nounderline abstract_t\">Ballard-Barbash R, Friedenreich CM, Courneya KS, et al.
