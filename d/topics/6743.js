The differential diagnosis includes gynecologic, urologic, musculoskeletal, gastrointestinal, vascular, and metabolic disorders (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F56612\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef56612 \">table 1</a>). Gynecologists are frequently consulted to help determine whether the woman's pain is from a gynecological or nongynecological etiology. A thorough history and physical examination are usually necessary to narrow the possible diagnoses and focus the work-up. A critical component of this process is to quickly identify the presence of conditions that are life-threatening and thus demand immediate surgical intervention, such as severe hemorrhage from a ruptured ectopic pregnancy or impending appendiceal perforation.</p><p>This topic will discuss gynecologic causes of acute pelvic pain.

In the pelvis, common causes include obstruction of the ureter by a calculus, distention of an ovarian cyst due to hemorrhage, ovulation (ie, Mittelschmerz), ischemia of a uterine leiomyoma, or inflammation of the appendix.</p><p>The localization of visceral pain can be difficult because the viscera are innervated by a low concentration of nociceptive nerve endings. Furthermore, significant overlap of pathways within the same spinal segments of pelvic and abdominal viscera and within visceral and somatic structures causes viscerosomatic convergence resulting in referred pain (ie, pain felt at a distant location from the diseased organ) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-acute-pelvic-pain-in-women/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p>Visceral pain can be divided into three subtypes; understanding the differences among them is clinically useful.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>True visceral pain &mdash; True visceral pain is characterized by a deep, dull, vague, poorly-defined sensation. True visceral pain related to pelvic viscera is usually perceived in the periumbilical area. It is accompanied by a sense of malaise, discomfort, and oppression, with associated autonomic phenomena, such as pallor, sweating, <span class=\"nowrap\">nausea/vomiting,</span> increased blood pressure, diarrhea, and fever. Diseases of viscera tend to manifest true visceral pain in their early stages, when they are especially difficult diagnostic dilemmas.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Referred visceral pain without hyperalgesia &mdash; Referred visceral pain without hyperalgesia is characterized by pain felt in a somatic area neurologically related to the viscera of origin, but with no increase in pain upon stimulation of the somatic area of referred pain.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Referred visceral pain with hyperalgesia &mdash; Referred visceral pain with hyperalgesia is also characterized by pain felt in a somatic area neurologically related to the affected viscera, but in this case, there is allodynia (ie, nonnoxious stimulation of the somatic area of referred pain provokes pain) or secondary hyperalgesia (ie, the pain threshold is decreased in the somatic areas of pain referral). A state of sustained contraction in the muscles of the area is often present.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h2\">Somatic pain</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Somatic sources of pelvic pain include the abdominal and pelvic muscles, fascia, parietal peritoneum, subcutaneous tissue, and the skeletal system. Such pain can be due to myofascial trigger points, hernia, hematoma, muscle strain, muscle injury, myositis, inflammation, or trauma.</p><p>Somatic mechanisms causing acute pelvic pain are often related to inflammation of the parietal peritoneum. Because somatic nerves innervate parietal peritoneum, the pain is located directly over the inflamed area. Pain due to inflammation of the parietal peritoneum is usually steady and aching in character, but actions that place tension on the peritoneum, such as palpation or movement, consistently increase it. Thus, the patient with peritonitis lies quietly in bed, preferring to avoid any movement or motion.</p><p>In addition to being constant with episodes of sharp exacerbations, somatic pain is well-localized with abdominal tenderness, involuntary guarding, and rebound tenderness. The intensity of pain and inflammation varies depending on the inciting material, as well as the duration of peritoneal exposure. As an example, intraperitoneal blood and urine may go undetected if exposure to the peritoneum has not been sudden and massive. With bacterial infection, such as in pelvic inflammatory disease, pain is usually of gradual onset with initially low intensity, until there is sufficient bacterial multiplication to cause the production and release of inflammatory, irritating substances. There are many diseases and disorders that lead to chemical stimulation of pain receptors in the peritoneum, whether by leakage of purulent matter into the peritoneal cavity, intraperitoneal bleeding, necrosis of an intraabdominal structure, or inflammation due to infection.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h2\">Neurogenic pain</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Occasionally, pelvic pain may be neurogenic due to diseases that injure sensory nerves, such as herpes zoster, impingement by arthritis, tumors, herniated nucleus pulposus, diabetes, multiple sclerosis, or syphilis.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h1\">EVALUATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The clinician's first priority is to identify life-threatening conditions requiring emergent management. Women presenting in shock or with peritoneal signs may require immediate surgical intervention.</p><p>Use of analgesia in adults with acute abdominal pain is discussed in detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-of-the-adult-with-abdominal-pain-in-the-emergency-department#H25\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation of the adult with abdominal pain in the emergency department&quot;, section on 'Analgesia'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h2\">History</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A thorough pain history should be obtained. Often the history will not result in an exact diagnosis, but serves to focus the differential diagnoses and guide further evaluation.</p><p>Important points to address initially include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Location &mdash; Where is the pain located and where does it radiate? Has the location of pain changed over time? Location of pain can often narrow the differential diagnosis (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F71415\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef71415 \">table 3</a>).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Onset and duration &mdash; How long has the patient had the pain? In what circumstance did the pain originate? Was its onset sudden or gradual?</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Character &mdash; Obtain a thorough, descriptive assessment of the patient's pain. What words does the patient use to describe the pain (eg, dull, sharp, colicky, waxing and waning)? Is the pain cyclic? What seems to make the pain better or worse? What pain related behavior does the patient display (eg, posturing, grimace, avoidance of certain movements)? Pain intensity can be measured using any one of a number of methods (visual analog scale, verbal rating scale, numerical rating scale, structured behavioral index) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F82442%7EPC%2F67351%7EPULM%2F50711\" class=\"graphic graphic_form graphicRef82442 graphicRef67351 graphicRef50711 \">form 1A-C</a>)&nbsp;[<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-acute-pelvic-pain-in-women/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Prior history of pain &mdash; Has the patient had this or other similar pain in the past?</p><p/><p>A thorough review of systems helps to identify associated symptoms that can help narrow the differential diagnosis. The presence of vaginal discharge or bleeding or a recent history of dyspareunia or dysmenorrhea is suggestive of pelvic pathology. As an example, a purulent vaginal discharge suggests the presence of a sexually transmitted infection; cramping and vaginal bleeding are commonly seen with ectopic pregnancy or threatened abortion; and dyspareunia and dysmenorrhea are features of endometriosis. Anorexia, nausea, and vomiting are often seen in appendicitis, but can be seen with any inflammatory pelvic process (eg, adnexal torsion, degenerating leiomyoma). Acute pelvic pain in an adolescent may be related to a noncommunicating congenital uterine or vaginal anomaly that obstructs normal menstrual flow. Musculoskeletal disorders may cause acute pelvic pain and abnormal movement, and may be associated with trauma.</p><p>The <span class=\"nowrap\">gynecologic/obstetrical</span> history may point to a <span class=\"nowrap\">gynecologic/obstetrical</span> etiology for pain. As an example, a missed menstrual period suggests the patient may be pregnant. The gynecologic history includes the date of the last menstrual period, menstrual pattern (regular, irregular), current mode of contraception, sexual history, history of sexually transmitted diseases, results of cervical cancer screening, as well as the outcome of prior pregnancies. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=the-gynecologic-history-and-pelvic-examination\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;The gynecologic history and pelvic examination&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Past medical and surgical histories are also useful. A history of pelvic organ surgery, pelvic inflammatory disease, or prior ectopic pregnancy are risk factors for ectopic pregnancy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-acute-pelvic-pain-in-women/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. Any history of abdominal surgery increases the risk of bowel obstruction. Adnexal pathology (eg, ovarian or paratubal cyst, hydrosalpinx) is a risk factor for adnexal torsion.</p><p>Social history may be important, especially if there is any substance abuse, history of domestic violence, or high-risk behavior. Family history may be relevant (eg, a history of coagulation disorders or sickle cell disease).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h2\">Physical examination</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14\"><span class=\"h3\">General</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Does the patient appear comfortable, or is she writhing in pain? Is she disoriented or hallucinating?</p><p>Vital signs should be obtained immediately. If the patient has marked hypotension, tachycardia, or fever, a focused history and a directed physical examination are performed concurrently to expedite emergency treatment. Fever suggests an infectious etiology, but low grade fever may be observed with necrosis associated with a degenerating fibroid or adnexal torsion.</p><p>In the stable patient, a thorough examination is performed, but with particular focus on the abdominal and pelvic examinations. Abdominal examination begins with inspection for distention, visible masses, erythema, ecchymosis, scars, and hernias. Palpation of the abdomen is usually performed next to assess for peritoneal signs, areas of tenderness, trigger points, masses, and organomegaly. Carnett's sign (abdominal wall tensing test) may be helpful to distinguish visceral from abdominal wall sources of pain. If pain increases with contraction of the abdominal wall muscles while the tender area is palpated, it generally suggests an abdominal wall, not visceral, source of pain [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-acute-pelvic-pain-in-women/abstract/5,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,6</a>]. The flank, inguinal area, and lower back should be examined for ecchymosis, tenderness, and lymphadenopathy.</p><p>Auscultation is performed next to evaluate the presence and character of bowel sounds. Absence of, or markedly decreased, bowel sounds suggest an ileus due to peritonitis. Increased bowel sounds suggest gastroenteritis or early intestinal obstruction. Especially in the elderly, auscultation for bruits may be important.</p><p>In the very anxious patient, palpation of the abdomen is often difficult due to her anticipation of pain with palpation. The stethoscope can be used gently to repeat the palpation of the abdomen, often with more reproducible and useful findings.</p><p>Percussion is not always necessary, but can be useful to identify distention versus ascites or hemoperitoneum, and to confirm organomegaly or pelvic masses.</p><p>Palpation with sudden release of pressure to demonstrate rebound tenderness should be the last step in the abdominal examination and is often not necessary in patients with obvious peritoneal signs.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15\"><span class=\"h3\">Pelvic</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A complete pelvic examination is warranted in any female patient with pelvic pain. The usual discomfort of the pelvic examination is magnified in the woman with pelvic pain.</p><p>External genitalia are inspected for rashes, swelling, or discoloration. The Bartholin glands, Skene's glands, and urethra are examined for any abnormality or tenderness.</p><p>A speculum is inserted to evaluate the vagina for any abnormal discharge, laceration, or foreign body, and to evaluate the cervix for abnormal discharge, laceration, polyps, ulceration, mass, or evidence of infection. Opening the blades of the speculum may elicit cervical motion tenderness. Cervical specimens are obtained for testing for Chlamydia and gonorrhea, and a sample of the vaginal discharge is obtained for microscopic examination. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=approach-to-women-with-symptoms-of-vaginitis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Approach to women with symptoms of vaginitis&quot;</a>.)</p><p>After the speculum is removed, a bimanual examination is performed. This is done slowly and gently to optimize clinical findings and minimize pain.</p><p>The introital and pelvic floor muscles are palpated for abnormal tenderness or trigger points.</p><p>The size and symmetry of the uterus are determined; symmetrical enlargement suggests intrauterine pregnancy (or adenomyosis), while irregular enlargement is more indicative of leiomyomas, although asymmetric enlargement can also be caused by bowel or adnexal masses adherent to the uterus. The normal uterus is not tender; the presence of uterine pain suggests infection or pathology related to leiomyomas (torsion, degeneration, infarction).</p><p>The cervix and uterus should be assessed for tenderness to palpation and movement. Significant cervical or uterine motion tenderness usually implies there is pelvic inflammation present. Although cervical motion tenderness is a sensitive sign of pelvic inflammatory disease, it is not as specific for pelvic inflammatory disease as is generally thought. Cervical motion tenderness occurs in about one-half of women with ectopic pregnancy and about one-fourth of those with acute appendicitis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-acute-pelvic-pain-in-women/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].</p><p>The adnexae are evaluated for tenderness or masses. Ovarian neoplasms and ectopic pregnancies are generally not painful unless bleeding, ruptured, or torsed, in which case pelvic pain is aggravated by coitus or bimanual examination of the adnexae. A fixed, painful adnexal mass is suggestive of an endometrioma or tuboovarian abscess.</p><p>A rectovaginal examination to assess the posterior cul-de-sac (pouch of Douglas) and the rectovaginal septum for masses and to evaluate rectal tone, as well as stool guaiac testing, should be done, if indicated. One or more of the following is suggestive of endometriosis: localized tenderness in the posterior cul-de-sac or uterosacral ligaments; palpable tender nodules in the posterior cul-de-sac, uterosacral ligaments, or rectovaginal septum; pain with uterine movement; tender, enlarged adnexal masses; or fixation of adnexa or uterus in a retroverted position.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H16\"><span class=\"h2\">Laboratory</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>All women of reproductive age, regardless of reported sexual history or contraception, should undergo a pregnancy test during evaluation of abdominal or pelvic pain. Current urine and serum pregnancy tests typically detect hCG levels of &ge;25 <span class=\"nowrap\">mIU/ml</span> (many serum tests detect levels &ge;5 <span class=\"nowrap\">mIU/ml)</span>. If the patient is pregnant, quantitative beta hCG testing and Rh(D) typing may be indicated and the status of the pregnancy should be determined (ie, ectopic, intrauterine, threatened abortion etc). It is important to keep in mind that a positive pregnancy test does not exclude a non-gynecologic cause of pelvic pain.</p><p>The remainder of the laboratory testing should be dictated by the differential diagnoses generated by the history and physical examination. In an otherwise healthy adult, laboratory tests should generally only be ordered to rule in a clinically suspected diagnosis or to assess a patient with an acute abdomen of unclear etiology. Tests that may be useful when evaluating for gynecologic pathologies include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Complete blood count with differential</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Urinalysis, with culture if urinalysis shows hematuria or pyuria</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Nucleic acid amplification tests for chlamydia and gonococcus</p><p/><p>An elevated white blood cell count may be due to infection or to <span class=\"nowrap\">inflammation/necrosis</span> related to adnexal torsion or a degenerating leiomyoma.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H17\"><span class=\"h2\">Imaging</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Historically, ultrasound examination has been the initial imaging modality in the evaluation of pelvic pain in women because of its low cost, absence of radiation exposure, ready availability, and ease of use. In combination with findings from history and physical examination, findings from an ultrasound examination may allow the patient to avoid surgery in some cases or help the clinician select the appropriate surgical approach in others. Gynecologic pathologies identifiable with the aid of ultrasound include ovarian neoplasms and torsion, uterine leiomyomas, pelvic abscess, and intrauterine and ectopic pregnancy. Ultrasound is also useful for assessment of nongynecological pathology, such as urinary tract obstruction.</p><p><span class=\"nowrap\">Abdominal/pelvic</span> computed tomography (CT) <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> magnetic resonance imaging can be used for further evaluation in cases of diagnostic uncertainty [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-acute-pelvic-pain-in-women/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].</p><p>Radiographic films of the abdomen or pelvis are rarely useful in the diagnosis of gynecologic pathology.</p><p>When indicated, imaging modalities that do not use ionizing radiation, such as ultrasound and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), are preferred in pregnant women. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diagnostic-imaging-procedures-during-pregnancy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Diagnostic imaging procedures during pregnancy&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H18\"><span class=\"h2\">Laparoscopy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Laparoscopy is sometimes indicated in the evaluation of acute pelvic pain, especially when the diagnosis is not clear after less invasive evaluations and the differential diagnoses include potentially life-threatening or organ-threatening disorders. Examples are appendicitis, pelvic inflammatory disease, and ovarian torsion. Laparoscopy also has a role in the treatment of many surgical disorders. On the other hand, most women with acute pelvic pain, normal imaging and laboratory studies, and a normal physical examination (including absence of <span class=\"nowrap\">vaginal/cervical</span> discharge and abnormal uterine bleeding) will improve without need for intervention [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-acute-pelvic-pain-in-women/abstract/9,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,10</a>]. Gynecologic diagnoses that may be missed in these patients include subclinical pelvic inflammatory disease and endometriosis.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H19\"><span class=\"h1\">SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The source of pain in woman with acute pelvic pain can be a gynecologic, urologic, musculoskeletal, gastrointestinal, vascular, or metabolic disorder.
