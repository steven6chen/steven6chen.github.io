Radiculopathy can affect different parts of the body, depending on which nerve or group of nerves is affected. People sometimes refer to radiculopathy as having a &quot;pinched nerve.&quot;</p><p>Here are 2 common examples of radiculopathy:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Cervical radiculopathy</strong> &ndash; People with this type of radiculopathy have pain, numbness, or tingling down one or both arms. The condition happens when one or more of the nerves that go from the spine to the arm get pinched or damaged.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Lumbosacral radiculopathy</strong> &ndash; People with this type of radiculopathy have pain, numbness, or tingling in the buttocks or down the leg. The condition happens when one or more of the nerves that go from the spine to the foot and leg get pinched or damaged. (People sometimes refer to the symptoms of this type of radiculopathy as &quot;sciatica.&quot;)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1685406784\"><span class=\"h1\">What causes radiculopathy?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Radiculopathy is usually caused by a problem with the back. To understand radiculopathy, it's helpful to first learn a little about the back and spine.</p><p>The back is made up of (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F56246\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef56246 \">figure 1</a>): </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Vertebrae &ndash; A stack of bones that sit on top of one another like a stack of coins. Each of these bones has a hole in the center. When stacked, the bones form a hollow tube that protects the spinal cord.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Spinal cord and nerves &ndash; The spinal cord is the highway of nerves that connects the brain to the rest of the body. It runs through the vertebrae. Nerves branch from the spinal cord and pass in between the vertebrae. From there they connect to the arms, the legs, and the organs. (This is why problems in the back can cause leg pain or bladder problems.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Discs &ndash; Rubbery discs sit in between each of the vertebrae to add cushion and allow movement. The discs have a tough outer shell and jelly-like center.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Muscles, tendons, and ligaments &ndash; Together the muscles, tendons, and ligaments are called the &quot;soft tissues&quot; of the back. These soft tissues support the back and help hold it together.</p><p/><p>Radiculopathy can happen when changes in the back cause a nerve to get pinched or damaged. This can happen if:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The vertebrae form bumps called bone spurs, which press on nearby nerves. (People with a condition called &quot;spinal stenosis&quot; often have this problem.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The discs between the vertebrae break open and bulge out, causing them to press on or irritate nearby nerves. (A disc that breaks open and bulges is called a &quot;herniated disc.&quot;) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Other medical conditions, such as diabetes, infection, inflammation, or a tumor injure the nerves near the spinal cord.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1685406799\"><span class=\"h1\">Should I see a doctor or nurse?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>If you have new pain, numbness, or tingling that seems to spread out to your arms or legs from your spine, see a doctor or nurse.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1685406814\"><span class=\"h1\">Will I need tests?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Maybe. Doctors can tell a lot about a person's radiculopathy based on which parts of the body are affected and how. Because of that, you might not need any tests, especially if you have had symptoms only for a short time. Still, if your doctor or nurse is concerned about nerve damage, he or she might order one or more of these tests:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Imaging tests &ndash; Imaging tests, such as X-rays, MRIs, or CT scans, create pictures of the inside of the body. These imaging tests can show problems with the back like those described above.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Electromyography (also called &quot;EMG&quot;) &ndash; During this test, a technician checks how well electrical pulses travel across nerves to the part of your body that has symptoms. The test helps show whether the nerves controlling that body part are working right.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1685406829\"><span class=\"h1\">How is radiculopathy treated?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Many people with radiculopathy do not need formal treatment. In some cases, the radiculopathy goes away as the back and nerves heal. In other cases, people find ways to cope with their symptoms.</p><p>When people do get treatment, the treatments can include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pain medicines that you can get without a prescription (If these do not work, stronger prescription pain medicines are available.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Medicines to relax the muscles (called muscle relaxants)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Avoiding activities that make the pain worse</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Injections of medicines that numb the back or reduce swelling</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Physical therapy to learn special exercises and stretches</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Surgery to repair the problem causing symptoms </p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1685406844\"><span class=\"h1\">More on this topic</span></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=neck-pain-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Neck pain (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=whiplash-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Whiplash (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=low-back-pain-in-adults-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Low back pain in adults (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=herniated-disc-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Herniated disc (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=spinal-stenosis-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Spinal stenosis (The Basics)</a></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=neck-pain-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Neck pain (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=low-back-pain-in-adults-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Low back pain in adults (Beyond the Basics)</a></p></div><div id=\"reviewProcess\"><span>All topics are updated as new evidence becomes available and our <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/home/editorial-policy\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"policy policy_editorialpolicy\">peer review process</a> is complete.</span></div><div id=\"topicRetrievedDate\"><span class=\"emphasis\">This topic retrieved from UpToDate on: </span>Apr 03, 2018.</div><div id=\"disclaimer\">The content on the UpToDate website is not intended nor recommended as a substitute for medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.
