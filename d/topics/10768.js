As such, these are often considered collectively and define epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC) in clinical trials and clinical practice. This topic will consider all three primary sites under the heading EOC. </p><p>Despite initial therapy (usually consisting of surgical cytoreduction and platinum-taxane combination therapy), the majority of women with advanced-stage ovarian cancer will relapse and require additional treatment. The likelihood for recurrence depends on many factors, including distribution of disease at initial presentation, success of initial surgical cytoreduction (ie, the presence of any residual disease), rapidity of cancer antigen 125 (CA 125) resolution, and treatment response after primary therapy. However, a predictive marker for recurrence has not been prospectively verified. </p><p>The management of patients with platinum-sensitive recurrent ovarian cancer (ie, those with a platinum-free interval of six months or longer) is discussed here. (See <a href=\"#H1138765547\" class=\"local\">'Relevance of the platinum-free interval'</a> below.)</p><p>The management of patients with platinum-resistant disease (those with a platinum-free interval of less than six months), as well as the initial diagnosis and management of EOC, and the surgical treatment of recurrent EOC are covered separately.

The management of these patients is discussed separately.
