A meta-analysis including several thousand women reported the symptom of stress incontinence, when compared against a urodynamic diagnosis, was 91 percent sensitive, but only 51 percent specific in diagnosing pure stress incontinence [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/urodynamic-evaluation-of-women-with-incontinence/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].

(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=surgical-management-of-stress-urinary-incontinence-in-women-preoperative-evaluation-for-a-primary-procedure#H13\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Surgical management of stress urinary incontinence in women: Preoperative evaluation for a primary procedure&quot;, section on 'Urodynamic testing'</a>.)is s</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h1\">COMPLICATIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Bacteriuria has been reported in 3 to 8 percent of women after urodynamic testing, but is usually transient [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/urodynamic-evaluation-of-women-with-incontinence/abstract/14,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">14,15</a>]. Prophylactic antibiotics are not necessary [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/urodynamic-evaluation-of-women-with-incontinence/abstract/16,17\" class=\"abstract_t\">16,17</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h1\">CYSTOMETRY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Filling cystometry<strong><em> </em></strong>is the method by which the <span class=\"nowrap\">pressure/volume</span> relationship of the bladder is measured during bladder filling. It is used to assess detrusor activity and bladder sensation, capacity, and compliance. Cystometry can be done with one channel measuring bladder pressure alone or with an additional channel that simultaneously measures abdominal pressure through the rectum or vagina. The advantage of the multichannel test is that it can discriminate between changes in abdominal versus bladder pressure by electronically subtracting the abdominal component from intravesical pressure.</p><p>Only a multichannel test can show that a rise in bladder pressure is due to detrusor contraction rather than tensing of the abdominal wall. This information is important for avoiding a false impression of detrusor overactivity. As an example, detrusor overactivity during single channel cystometry is not reproducible by multichannel testing in 40 percent of women [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/urodynamic-evaluation-of-women-with-incontinence/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. Thus, most, but not all [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/urodynamic-evaluation-of-women-with-incontinence/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>], experts believe that the multichannel test result is the most reliable for evaluating women with incontinence.</p><p>Some urodynamic machines can also record urethral pressure with a second sensor on the bladder catheter (see below). This allows electronic calculation of urethral closure pressure, which is the difference between urethral and bladder pressures. Leakage usually occurs when bladder pressure exceeds urethral pressure. However, the clinical value of this measurement has not been proven.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Indications</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The most common reason to do cystometry is to distinguish detrusor overactivity (involuntary contractions of the bladder) from stress incontinence (leakage due to an increase in abdominal pressure) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F65452\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef65452 \">figure 1</a>). The test can also identify patients with abnormalities of bladder sensation and mixed incontinence.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Data</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The International Continence Society (ICS) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/urodynamic-evaluation-of-women-with-incontinence/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>] defines cystometry data points as the volume at which the patient notes:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>First desire to void &ndash; The patient would like to pass urine at the next convenient moment, but voiding can be delayed if necessary</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Strong desire to void &ndash; A persistent desire to void, but without fear of leakage</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Urgency &ndash; a sudden compelling desire to void</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Maximum cystometric capacity &ndash; The patient feels she can no longer delay micturition</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Increased bladder sensation &ndash; An early first sensation of bladder filling (or an early desire to void) <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> an early strong desire to void, which occurs at low bladder volume and which persists</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Reduced bladder sensation<em> </em>&ndash; Diminished sensation throughout bladder filling</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Absent bladder sensation<em> </em>&ndash; The individual has no bladder sensation</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Non-specific bladder sensations &ndash; May make the individual aware of bladder filling, for example, abdominal fullness or vegetative symptoms</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Bladder pain </p><p/><p>Other information includes:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Compliance (the change in volume divided by change in detrusor pressure)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Overactive bladder (any contractions, spontaneous or provoked, are abnormal during filling)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h3\">Normal voiding function</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Effective voiding requires intact bladder sensation, a contractile detrusor muscle, and a non-obstructed bladder outlet (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F65433\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef65433 \">figure 2</a>). &#160; As the bladder fills, active relaxation results in a low-pressure, high-compliance bladder. The normal bladder should not have involuntary phasic contractions during filling despite provocation. It should initially expand without resistance or increased intraluminal pressure. The urethral sphincter should relax and open when the patient wants to initiate voiding, accompanied by detrusor contractions. During voiding, detrusor contraction should be smooth and lead to a steady urine stream.</p><p>There are no recognized standards for normal values. However, a reasonable range for first desire to void is 100 to 200 cc, normal desire to void 150 to 350 cc, urgency 250 to 500 cc, and maximum cystometric capacity 300 to 600 cc. A small rise in detrusor pressure (ie, less than 10 to 15 cm of water) without undue sensation of urgency up to a capacity of 400 to 500 is also normal. Values outside these ranges do not necessarily indicate pathology, but could confirm a problem in symptomatic patients. Test results must correlate with symptoms to be meaningful.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h2\">Common abnormalities</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Some of the more common bladder abnormalities and their cystometric findings are described below:</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h3\">Detrusor overactivity</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Detrusor overactivity (overactive bladder) can be diagnosed if there is urgency or leakage with a detrusor contraction that the patient cannot suppress. The involuntary detrusor contractions during the filling phase may be spontaneous or provoked by maneuvers such as posture change from prone to standing, toe raises, running water, or hand washing. In women with neurologic disease, uninhibited detrusor contractions are termed neurogenic detrusor overactivity. When there is no defined cause, detrusor overactivity is labeled as &ldquo;idiopathic.&rdquo;</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Phasic detrusor overactivity<em> </em>&ndash; A characteristic wave form which may or may not lead to urinary incontinence</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Terminal detrusor overactivity<em> </em>&ndash; A single, involuntary detrusor contraction, occurring at cystometric capacity, which cannot be suppressed and results in incontinence usually with bladder emptying (voiding)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Detrusor overactivity incontinence &ndash; Incontinence due to an involuntary detrusor contraction</p><p/><p>Abnormalities of bladder sensation include the following:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Increased bladder sensation &ndash; The individual feels an early and persistent desire to void</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Reduced bladder sensation &ndash; The individual is aware of bladder filling, but does not feel a definite desire to void</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Absent bladder sensation &ndash; The individual reports no sensation of bladder filling or desire to void</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h3\">Stress urinary incontinence</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Stress urinary incontinence is characterized by leakage that occurs with an increase in abdominal pressure, such as coughing or Valsalva, without a rise in true detrusor pressure.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h3\">Idiopathic sensory urgency</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Idiopathic sensory urgency should be considered in women with sensory parameters below the normal range. Symptoms include urgency at a low bladder volume, low bladder capacity, and frequency. However, patients with stress and urgency incontinence also often have low sensory volumes because they adapt to the risk of leakage by emptying the bladder frequently. These latter disorders can be excluded by absence of the findings described above.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h3\">Neurologic abnormality</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Neurologic abnormality is suggested by an above normal capacity and high volume at first desire. A hypotonic bladder fails to empty adequately due to inadequate detrusor pressure. Flow rate is usually low.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14\"><span class=\"h3\">Interstitial cystitis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Interstitial cystitis is characterized by low volume at normal desire, low volume urgency, and low capacity in addition to bladder pain. Some patients also have poor compliance. Normal compliance allows bladder filling to occur up to maximum capacity with minimal (5 to 10 cm H2O) change in intravesical pressure.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15\"><span class=\"h3\">Elevated baseline pressure</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A retrospective study of patients who had midurethral slings for stress incontinence reported that 56 percent of women with a detrusor pressure &gt;15 cm during the filling phase of cystometry developed de novo urgency incontinence after surgery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/urodynamic-evaluation-of-women-with-incontinence/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H16\"><span class=\"h2\">Technique</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The optimal technique for performing cystometry has not been determined; thus, methods vary among centers. There is no preprocedure preparation. In general, having the patient in a sitting or standing position is more desirable than lying prone because these positions simulate stresses on the bladder that typically occur in daily life. Standing or sitting positions increased the detection of detrusor overactivity in most studies by 33 to 100 percent, according to a systematic review [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/urodynamic-evaluation-of-women-with-incontinence/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>].</p><p>The patient begins by emptying her bladder as much as possible, then a thin plastic catheter is slowly inserted into the urethra until it reaches the bladder. Measurements are taken of the residual urine volume and bladder pressure.</p><p>Water or normal saline at room temperature is typically used to fill the bladder, although warm or cold fluid may be useful to provoke detrusor overactivity. Use of carbon dioxide has fallen into disfavor because it is less physiologic, compressible, dissolves in urine to form carbonic acid, and does not permit stress testing or a voiding study.</p><p>Most clinicians fill the bladder through the catheter at a rate of 50 to 100 cc per minute. Faster filling rates (greater than 100 <span class=\"nowrap\">cc/min)</span> are more likely to provoke detrusor overactivity. The woman is asked to describe sensations during filling, including when the first feeling of bladder fullness occurs.</p><p>A variety of transducers is available. Water-filled balloon catheters or water perfusion catheters are inexpensive and disposable. Microtransducer catheters are more accurate, but are more expensive, require sterilization, and can produce artifacts depending upon the orientation of the transducer to the bladder or urethral mucosa. A comparison of air-charged and microtransducer catheters in the evaluation of urethral function showed high concordance for maximum urethral closure pressure and valsalva leak point pressure, but not for functional urethral length [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/urodynamic-evaluation-of-women-with-incontinence/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>].</p><p>Provocative maneuvers, such as coughing, Valsalva, heel bouncing, jumping, walking in place, change in posture, hand washing, and listening to running water are helpful for determining if they cause leakage and whether the leakage is related to uninhibited detrusor contractions or stress incontinence [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/urodynamic-evaluation-of-women-with-incontinence/abstract/24,25\" class=\"abstract_t\">24,25</a>].</p><p>Once the bladder is completely full, the woman is asked to begin voiding, and measurements are made of pressure, volume, and flow rate.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H17\"><span class=\"h2\">Postprocedure care</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>After the procedure, the patient may note urinary frequency, urgency, hematuria, or dysuria for a day. Increasing fluid intake helps to flush out the bladder, but caffeinated, carbonated, or alcoholic beverages should be avoided because they may irritate the bladder lining. Signs of infection, such as fever, chills, low back pain, or persistent blood in the urine, should be reported to the clinician.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H18\"><span class=\"h2\">Modifications</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H19\"><span class=\"h3\">Videourodynamics</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>This technique is similar to conventional cystometry, but with the addition of a radio-opaque filling medium, video recorder, and x-ray equipment. Videourodynamics may offer information beyond conventional urodynamics in complicated neurologic conditions, but most authorities believe it is seldom indicated [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/urodynamic-evaluation-of-women-with-incontinence/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. The disadvantages are radiation exposure, cost, and the extra technical support required.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H20\"><span class=\"h3\">Ambulatory urodynamics</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Ambulatory testing can be performed by using commercially available systems in which an ambulatory patient wears an indwelling catheter connected to a microcomputer. The advantage over conventional cystometry is that the home environment reflects the patient's functional status more realistically than the laboratory. Several studies have shown that ambulatory urodynamics are more sensitive than conventional urodynamics in diagnosing detrusor overactivity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/urodynamic-evaluation-of-women-with-incontinence/abstract/27-29\" class=\"abstract_t\">27-29</a>]. One study showed that ambulatory monitoring was an effective second-line investigation for diagnosing incontinence in difficult cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/urodynamic-evaluation-of-women-with-incontinence/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>].</p><p>However, there are several disadvantages to this method. It is costly and artifacts can be produced by catheter movement, leading to difficulty interpreting data and inaccurate diagnoses. As an example, one study found that 69 percent of healthy, asymptomatic women were diagnosed with detrusor overactivity on ambulatory monitoring [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/urodynamic-evaluation-of-women-with-incontinence/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]. At this time, ambulatory urodynamics is useful in research, but not in clinical practice [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/urodynamic-evaluation-of-women-with-incontinence/abstract/32,33\" class=\"abstract_t\">32,33</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H21\"><span class=\"h1\">UROFLOWMETRY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Uroflowmetry measures urine volume voided over time. It can be done with or without a pressure-flow study (see below), which measures detrusor pressure during voiding.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H22\"><span class=\"h2\">Indications</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Abnormal voiding is much more common in men than in women. Nevertheless, uroflowmetry is usually done as part of a complete urodynamic evaluation in women. It can be useful in clinical situations, such as:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Frequency, urgency, and urgency incontinence as some of these patients have outlet obstruction.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Voiding difficulty, hesitancy, or difficulty maintaining the urine stream, which can also be due to outlet obstruction (from previous pelvic surgery or urethral kinking with anterior vaginal wall prolapse) or weak detrusor (as in neurologic diseases).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Planned pelvic surgery because poor uroflow may be a predictor of postoperative voiding difficulty after incontinence surgery or radical pelvic surgery. This information allows for preoperative counseling or training in self-catheterization [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/urodynamic-evaluation-of-women-with-incontinence/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>]; however, the predictive value of uroflowmetry is controversial [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/urodynamic-evaluation-of-women-with-incontinence/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H23\"><span class=\"h2\">Technique</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>After the physician and nurse have left the room, the patient voids into a special commode that measures the amount and rate of urine flow. Although there are no universally accepted standards, a normal uroflow test consists of:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Volume greater than 200 mL over 15 to 30 seconds</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Maximum flow rate greater than 15 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/sec</span> (after correction for artifact)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Continuous single curve (as opposed to short spikes) of flow</p><p/><p>Flow rates less than 15 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/sec</span> may indicate outlet obstruction, detrusor weakness, or significant Valsalva effort during voiding [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/urodynamic-evaluation-of-women-with-incontinence/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>]. An acontractile detrusor is unable to initiate a contraction and will lead to overflow incontinence.</p><p>Some patients are unable to void normally in the artificial conditions of the urodynamics laboratory; thus, it is important to ask the patient if she feels that her void was typical for her, especially if an abnormal pattern is observed. If the patient feels the test was atypical, it should be repeated.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H24\"><span class=\"h1\">PRESSURE-FLOW STUDY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A pressure-flow study measures both bladder pressure and urinary flow. The purpose of a pressure-flow study is to determine the mechanism of abnormal voiding revealed by a low flow rate on uroflowmetry. If the detrusor pressure is high (&gt;50 cm H2O), urethral overactivity (detrusor-sphincter dyssynergia) or urethral obstruction (stricture or tumor) may be present. The most common cause of obstructed voiding in females is prolapse of the anterior vaginal wall, which can cause kinking of the urethra when the bladder descends more than the urethra. In addition, previous pelvic surgery can cause bladder denervation and a weak detrusor muscle. The most common use of the pressure-flow study in women is to determine the cause of voiding dysfunction after surgery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/urodynamic-evaluation-of-women-with-incontinence/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>]. It may be performed in men with clinical manifestations of prostate disease in whom there is reason to suspect some problem other than, or in addition to, benign prostatic hyperplasia.</p><p>One study that compared women with bladder outlet obstruction to normal controls reported a maximum detrusor pressure &gt;25 cm H2O gave the greatest sensitivity and specificity, &gt;60 percent for detection of obstruction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/urodynamic-evaluation-of-women-with-incontinence/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>]. A uroflow &lt;12 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/sec</span> gave equal sensitivity, specificity and accuracy (68 percent) for predicting obstruction.</p><p>A pressure-flow study can be done as an extension of cystometry when catheters are already in place to measure detrusor and abdominal pressure. The patient voids around the urethral catheter into a commode, which simultaneously measures uroflow.</p><p>If the patient has an acontractile or poorly contractile detrusor, she will have a low flow rate (&lt;15 <span class=\"nowrap\">cc/sec</span> maximum flow) and little or no rise in true detrusor pressure. Voiding occurs mainly by abdominal straining. Since many patients use Valsalva to aid voiding, a rise in abdominal pressure alone does not indicate a problem. Detrusor acontractility is often due to a neurologic abnormality, such as spinal cord injury or multiple sclerosis, but it may be idiopathic.</p><p>Test results are difficult to assess because of the difficulty of voiding around the catheter, as well as the artificial surroundings of the urodynamics laboratory. There are no accepted standards for the method and interpretation of pressure-flow studies.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H25\"><span class=\"h1\">URETHRAL PRESSURE PROFILE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The pressure in the urethra should be equal to or greater than the bladder pressure during bladder filling. When the bladder and urethra are in their proper anatomic location, increases in intraabdominal pressure will also increase urethral pressure, thereby preventing leakage. Low urethral pressure can be associated with incontinence and is related to aging, hypoestrogenic state, multiparity, and previous significant urogynecological operations.</p><p>The urethral pressure profile (UPP) measures the intraluminal pressure along the entire length of the urethra with the bladder at rest. A special catheter with an intravesical and an intraurethral pressure transducer and side openings near its tip is perfused and slowly withdrawn from the bladder (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F65452\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef65452 \">figure 1</a>). The transducers are usually brought out to the external urethral meatus at a rate of 1 <span class=\"nowrap\">mm/sec</span> by a mechanical pulling device. The pressure necessary to maintain a constant flow provides an assessment of the activity of the urethral wall.</p><p>The clinical purpose of the urethral pressure profile (UPP) is to help distinguish intrinsic sphincter deficiency from genuine stress incontinence by measuring:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Maximum urethral pressure (the highest pressure measured)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Maximum urethral closure pressure (the difference between maximum urethral pressure and intravesical pressure)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Functional urethral length (the length where the urethral pressure exceeds the intravesical pressure)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pressure-transmission ratio (the increment in urethral pressure on stress as a percentage of the simultaneous increment in vesical pressure) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/urodynamic-evaluation-of-women-with-incontinence/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]</p><p/><p>The UPP has limited clinical value because of a lack of standardized technique and equipment, as well as variable interpretation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/urodynamic-evaluation-of-women-with-incontinence/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>]. Upright posture and increased bladder volume both increase urethral pressure. The size and stiffness of the catheter and the type of pressure transducer also affect the UPP. When microtransducers are used, pressures vary depending upon the orientation of the transducer, with anterior orientation producing higher pressures and posterior orientation, lower. Therefore, the study is usually done with the transducer in the lateral position.</p><p>In addition, detrusor overactivity can affect urethral function resulting in decreases in functional urethral length and pressure transmission ratio with bladder filling [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/urodynamic-evaluation-of-women-with-incontinence/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>]. Thus, detrusor overactivity needs to be treated to obtain a valid UPP.</p><p>Since the UPP is measuring the urethra at rest, it is of limited value in arriving at a diagnosis in the dynamic situation of incontinence. No single parameter of the UPP is useful in diagnosing stress incontinence [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/urodynamic-evaluation-of-women-with-incontinence/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. The pressure-transmission ratio also cannot discriminate between stress incontinence patients and controls [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/urodynamic-evaluation-of-women-with-incontinence/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>].</p><p>A few studies have indicated that a low maximum urethral closure pressure (usually &lt;20 or &lt;30 cm H2O) is a predictor of poor outcome for retropubic suspension surgery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/urodynamic-evaluation-of-women-with-incontinence/abstract/42-44\" class=\"abstract_t\">42-44</a>], and, therefore, some advocate a sling procedure for patients with low urethral closure pressure and urethral hypermobility [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/urodynamic-evaluation-of-women-with-incontinence/abstract/45,46\" class=\"abstract_t\">45,46</a>]. This reasoning would make the UPP clinically significant. However, there is a strong trend toward sling procedures for all cases of stress incontinence, with or without low urethral pressure, which makes the UPP increasingly irrelevant to choice of surgical procedure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/urodynamic-evaluation-of-women-with-incontinence/abstract/47\" class=\"abstract_t\">47</a>]. Some experts recommend placing a sling slightly closer to the urethra in patients with low urethral closure pressure or low abdominal leak point pressure, but there are no data to support this recommendation. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=surgical-management-of-stress-urinary-incontinence-in-women-choosing-a-primary-surgical-procedure\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Surgical management of stress urinary incontinence in women: Choosing a primary surgical procedure&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Intrinsic sphincter deficiency without urethral hypermobility is usually treated with periurethral bulking injections. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=stress-urinary-incontinence-in-women-persistent-recurrent-symptoms-after-surgical-treatment\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Stress urinary incontinence in women: Persistent/recurrent symptoms after surgical treatment&quot;</a>.) A UPP with low maximum pressure could provide supportive evidence to justify this method of treatment.</p><p>Women younger than 25 have a mean maximum urethral closure pressure of 90 cm H2O, while women older than 64 have a mean of 65 cm H2O [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/urodynamic-evaluation-of-women-with-incontinence/abstract/48\" class=\"abstract_t\">48</a>]. The average functional urethral length declines after menopause. Estrogen increases urethral length and maximum urethral pressure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/urodynamic-evaluation-of-women-with-incontinence/abstract/49\" class=\"abstract_t\">49</a>]. However, there is no evidence that estrogen decreases incontinence in women with intrinsic sphincter deficiency.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H26\"><span class=\"h1\">LEAK POINT PRESSURE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Abdominal leak point pressure refers to the intravesical pressure at which urine leakage occurs due to increased abdominal pressure in the absence of a detrusor contraction. The pressure can be produced by Valsalva or cough. Unlike the urethral pressure profile, the leak point pressure reflects urethral function in the dynamic situation that produces incontinence.</p><p>Leak point pressure is used to assess intrinsic sphincter function. It is more reliable than the urethral pressure profile for diagnosis of intrinsic sphincter deficiency [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/urodynamic-evaluation-of-women-with-incontinence/abstract/50-52\" class=\"abstract_t\">50-52</a>]. Confirmation of this diagnosis can be important in selecting the correct surgical approach. Intrinsic sphincter deficiency is treated with a sling procedure or periurethral injections, rather than retropubic suspension. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=surgical-management-of-stress-urinary-incontinence-in-women-choosing-a-primary-surgical-procedure\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Surgical management of stress urinary incontinence in women: Choosing a primary surgical procedure&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The optimal method for performing leak point pressure is controversial. There is no standard. Variables include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Bladder volume (increasing volume decreases leak point) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/urodynamic-evaluation-of-women-with-incontinence/abstract/53,54\" class=\"abstract_t\">53,54</a>]</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patient position (upright leak point is lower than supine)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Catheter size (a 3 French catheter produces a lower leak point than an 8 French) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/urodynamic-evaluation-of-women-with-incontinence/abstract/52\" class=\"abstract_t\">52</a>]</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Location of the catheter (intravesical versus vaginal or abdominal.

Both Valsalva and cough pressure profile (a series of increasingly strong coughs) are used to determine leak point. In the same patient, cough leak point is often different from Valsalva leak point. Furthermore, some patients involuntarily contract the levator muscles during valsalva or cough, which can increase leak point pressure. Despite these difficulties, many clinicians use a leak point pressure below 60 cm H2O to confirm the diagnosis of intrinsic sphincter deficiency [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/urodynamic-evaluation-of-women-with-incontinence/abstract/57\" class=\"abstract_t\">57</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H27\"><span class=\"h1\">POSTVOID RESIDUAL VOLUME</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>This measurement is made either by straight catheterization or by bladder ultrasound. Small portable ultrasounds specifically for postvoid residual measurement are available. A normal patient should have the ability to void at least 80 percent of the total bladder volume and have residual urine less than 50 cc immediately after voiding. A high residual urine on repeated determinations indicates outlet obstruction or poor detrusor contractility. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H28\"><span class=\"h1\">ELECTROPHYSIOLOGIC TESTING</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Various electrophysiologic tests have also been used to evaluate lower urinary tract dysfunction.
