Families may seek to adopt because of infertility, fetal loss, death of a child, or desire for more children. Pediatric health care providers may provide preadoption counseling to prospective adoptive parents, evaluate children after adoption, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> provide ongoing care to adoptees. </p><p>This topic provides a general overview of adoption within the United States and describes the potential role of the primary care provider as an advocate for adopted children and their families. The recommendations below are largely consistent with those of the American Academy of Pediatrics Committee on Early Childhood and Council on Foster Care, Adoption, and Kinship Care [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/adoption/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>]. Specific infectious disease and immunization considerations in children adopted from outside the United States are discussed separately.

An adoption medical specialist can provide preadoption consultation, travel support, postadoption screening, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> ongoing primary care [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/adoption/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H354386891\"><span class=\"h2\">Confidentiality</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Regulation of confidentiality in adoption seeks to balance the privacy and anonymity of biologic parents with the &quot;right-to-know&quot; interest of the adoptee. Statutes regarding confidentiality vary from state to state; information regarding the statutes in particular states is available through the <a href=\"https://www.childwelfare.gov/topics/systemwide/laws-policies/statutes/infoaccessap/&amp;token=jMDGfzmICBapOfDOj34x1n6Z9L90INW/8fVSJEr4nMatu4cSUHj1Fvbt4TzXPgaL1rlYCjl+STM0O4BEtDXg1EnIl34HCzjmMxcYg3klGBw=&amp;TOPIC_ID=2854\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">Child Welfare Information Gateway</a>. There are four general approaches:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Confidential records</strong> &ndash; The original birth certificate and adoption records are kept sealed by the courts and can be inspected only with court approval. This approach is used in a small and declining number of states.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Open records</strong> &ndash; Adult adoptees are given access to their adoption records or original birth certificate upon request and with no restrictions. This is the policy in an increasing number of states.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">The American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) endorses the <a href=\"http://adopt.org/our-policies&amp;token=9cAYLXbZXBnxxY1bwZJxgFpM2+TVCo512LhK4lvg0ZlUK/AuNGLuD6LiOwSQnFL3&amp;TOPIC_ID=2854\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">National Adoption Center's policy</a> supporting provision of both the original and amended birth certificate to the adoptive family at the time of adoption (unless specifically denied by the birth parent[s]) and of granting the adoptee access to the original birth certificate at age 18 years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/adoption/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Search and consent</strong> &ndash; An adoption agency or other intermediary investigates the location of one party at the request of another party who would like identifying information. The adoptee may petition the court to open the records if the biologic parent does not consent to release of the identifying information. This approach is used in approximately one-half of states. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Mutual consent</strong> &ndash; In mutual-consent voluntary adoption registries, information is maintained in a central file where adult adoptees, biologic parents, and, in some cases, adoptive parents register their names to give consent to release identifying information if it is requested by one of the other parties. Identifying information can be released only if all parties agree.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Types of adoption</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Agency adoption</strong> &ndash; Adoption services traditionally are provided by licensed public or private agencies that offer services to birth parents, adoptive parents, and children who need families.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Agencies work with prospective adoptive families to assess whether adoption is appropriate. A home study is conducted to educate families about adoption and to determine their suitability to adopt [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/adoption/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. The home study includes information regarding the parents' motivation for adoption, financial status, religious beliefs, employment, education, relationship stability, childrearing practices, and housing. The parents must provide copies of birth and marriage certificates, financial statements, letters of recommendation, and reports of physical and mental health from a health care provider. They also must undergo a criminal background check. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">In addition to performing the home study, agencies share medical and social information with the adoptive families and provide services to various members of the adoption constellation through the adjustment period and beyond [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/adoption/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. Agencies may have a consulting clinician available to offer advice if children manifest physical, emotional, or developmental problems. In addition, the agency can receive and relay new medical information from the birth parents to the adoptive parents (eg, regarding inherited disease).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Independent adoption</strong> &ndash; Adoptions can be arranged privately through clinicians, attorneys, or other facilitators [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/adoption/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. About 65 percent of states allow facilitators to work with prospective adoptive parents to find an expectant birth mother. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Subsidized adoption</strong> &ndash; In subsidized adoption, also called adoption assistance, adoptive families receive financial support (eg, monthly cash payments and Medicaid coverage) from the federal and state governments to assist in caring for an adopted child with special needs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/adoption/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Support may include access to medical care, <span class=\"nowrap\">counseling/therapy,</span> special equipment, and tutoring services [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/adoption/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Subsidized adoption has facilitated the adoption of children with special needs, whose medical and special educational expenses might otherwise deter an adoptive family. Most families that adopt children from foster care receive adoption subsidies.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Open adoption</strong> &ndash; Openness in adoption refers to an agreement, between the birth and adoptive parents, to maintain some amount of communication. The degree of openness varies and usually is agreed upon by all of the involved parties, including the adoption agency and the adopted child if he or she is of appropriate age. Approximately 68 percent of domestic adoptions are open adoptions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/adoption/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. Openness arrangements vary, and can change over time based upon the wishes of the birth and adoptive families. (See <a href=\"#H354386891\" class=\"local\">'Confidentiality'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Most adoption professionals believe that adoptive families should have information about the health of their adopted child's birth relatives. Some degree of ongoing openness is helpful if birth relatives develop medical conditions after the child's placement [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/adoption/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Legal-risk placement</strong> &ndash; In legal-risk placement, the child is placed in foster care with parents who are interested in adopting the child if reunification with the birth parents is not possible [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/adoption/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. The legal adoption of the child cannot be guaranteed to the foster parents because of the continuing rights of the birth parents. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epidemiology-of-foster-care-placement-and-overview-of-the-foster-care-system-in-the-united-states#H14\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Epidemiology of foster care placement and overview of the foster care system in the United States&quot;, section on 'Birth parents'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14\"><span class=\"h1\">EPIDEMIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Approximately 120,000 children are adopted in the United States each year [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/adoption/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. In the 2007 National Survey of Adoptive Parents, 1.8 million children in the United States joined their families through adoption (2 percent of children &lt;18 years of age) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/adoption/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. Among these, 37 percent were adopted from foster care, 38 percent through private domestic adoption, and 25 percent internationally. Nearly one-fourth were adopted by relatives (17 percent of those adopted from foster care and 37 percent of those adopted privately). Adoptive parents reported that 40 percent of adopted children in the United States were of a different race, culture, or ethnicity than their adoptive parent(s) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/adoption/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. </p><p>Trends in adoption include increasing numbers of transracial, special-needs, same-sex, and single-parent adoptions, as well as increasing openness in adoption [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/adoption/abstract/1,12,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,12,13</a>]. These trends result from the shortage of healthy newborns available for placement, cultural changes, and increasing attempts to find permanent families for special-needs children in foster care.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Trends in domestic adoption</strong> &ndash; Most domestic adoptions occur through the national public welfare system (ie, foster care) or through independent agencies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/adoption/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span><strong>Public welfare adoptions</strong> &ndash; The numbers of children adopted from the foster care system remained stable between 2010 and 2014 (ranging between 50,644 and 53,547) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/adoption/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. In fiscal year 2014, among children adopted from foster care, 51 percent were boys, 48 percent were white, and the mean age was 6.2 years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/adoption/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\">Approximately 25 percent of the children in foster care in the United States are eligible for adoption [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/adoption/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. Among those that are adopted, 23 percent are adopted by relatives and another 22 percent are adopted by nonrelatives who knew the child before adoption [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/adoption/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. However, many of the children in the foster care system who are available for adoption are difficult to place in permanent homes because of certain special needs (eg, older children; children of color; children with physical, mental, or emotional problems; and children who are part of a sibling group) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/adoption/abstract/15,16\" class=\"abstract_t\">15,16</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=comprehensive-health-care-for-children-in-foster-care\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Comprehensive health care for children in foster care&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span><strong>Other types of adoption</strong> &ndash; In 2012, approximately 49 percent of all United States adoptions were from sources other than foster care or intercountry [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/adoption/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. These included private agencies, tribes, step parent or other forms of kinship care. There has been an increase in the number of children adopted by relatives. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Trends in special needs adoption</strong> &ndash; Adoptions of children with special needs has increased since the mid-1990s. Many adopted children have complex medical, developmental, behavioral, educational, and psychological challenges [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/adoption/abstract/10,11,18,19\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,11,18,19</a>]. The special needs often are identified and managed before adoption, but may not be apparent until months or years after adoption. (See <a href=\"#H21\" class=\"local\">'Special-needs children'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Trends in international adoption </strong>&ndash; Trends in international adoption are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=international-adoption-infectious-disease-aspects#H79946490\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;International adoption: Infectious disease aspects&quot;, section on 'Epidemiology'</a>.) </p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2532218996\"><span class=\"h1\">MEDICAL EVALUATION</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H16\"><span class=\"h2\">Preadoption</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Previsit information gathering</strong> &ndash; Before adoption, pediatric health care providers may be asked to review the prospective adoptee's health information. Prospective adoptive families generally seek information about potential long-term care needs, prognosis for specific medical problems, and availability of community resources. Clinicians who lack expertise in preadoption evaluation may refer families to an adoption medical specialist. A list of specialists is available through the <a href=\"http://www2.aap.org/sections/adoption/directory/map-adoption.cfm&amp;token=5tltgKjsh1mDbJyHG0NEoio2c/oj9z1oyj8JcjL2Xw+IWVqAgJt88+Lrvznbltpv3kD53D28AJTFV4e+CygAzg==&amp;TOPIC_ID=2854\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">American Academy of Pediatrics Council on Foster Care, Adoption, &amp; Kinship Care</a>. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Families should obtain as much information as possible about their prospective child before the preadoption evaluation; the clinician (or clinician's office personnel) can advise the family regarding the type of information necessary to assess the child's health. Although most referrals are incomplete, it is useful to obtain the following information about the child and the birth family [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/adoption/abstract/1,2,4\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2,4</a>]:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Health history of parents, siblings, and extended family &ndash; Ages, medical issues, developmental or cognitive delays, mental health problems, history of smoking, alcohol or drug use, genetic conditions, medications. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Social history of parents, siblings, and extended family &ndash; Educational attainment, history of incarcerations, domestic violence, previous foster care placement, etc.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Circumstances of the adoption &ndash; Why was the child placed for adoption?

Options for feeding adopted newborns should be discussed so that adoptive mothers who wish to breastfeed can be referred to a lactation consultant and have adequate time to prepare for induced lactation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/adoption/abstract/20,21\" class=\"abstract_t\">20,21</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">The clinician also may discuss the upcoming transitions for the adoptive family and the child. Parents should be encouraged to educate themselves about ways they can ease the adjustment for everyone, and set realistic expectations for the changes to their family. Information for parents is available from the <a href=\"https://www.childwelfare.gov/topics/adoption/&amp;token=Rti1NBSWdX//H/lCKGrzlHQ93qlODhb77HGkOPCKRTMQNlpVYMrHN/yvOJpZDJi0ExJnxadtU3QjhP2oRbzHzQ==&amp;TOPIC_ID=2854\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">Child Welfare Information Gateway</a> and the <a href=\"https://www.healthychildren.org/English/family-life/family-dynamics/adoption-and-foster-care/Pages/default.aspx&amp;token=jnAjtstUVN49t2Ll7TfoILqjeU2BAzZ0FNAtOqEdp5OcHjeJeIzEkscoa5DyZJ/ErrUNuvYuFNUQsszPkqMLYT3qZ2ohx61csopZ9+kjNnAlBIyN0V6iGlVlZBS9wK0qrwC1JCwUsNIWoeWxLU0oqw==&amp;TOPIC_ID=2854\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">American Academy of Pediatrics</a> (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F65533\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef65533 \">table 1</a>).

Such requests require thoughtful responses and appropriate anticipatory guidance. The role of the pediatric health care provider is not to judge the advisability of a proposed adoption, but to clearly and realistically apprise the prospective parents of any special health needs detected now or anticipated in the future [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/adoption/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Pediatric health care providers should define and explain the risks to the family so that potential problems can be anticipated and addressed appropriately. The pediatric health care provider can also assist with making sure that the proper social support systems are in place to help the family cope with externalizing behaviors or other adjustment issues as they arise.

Children of all ages must feel safe in their new environment. They need time to create a trusting bond with their caregivers. Adoption agencies often encourage a period of &quot;cocooning,&quot; during which the family remains within the home to promote bonding. However, a cocooning period may not be realistic for many families, as parents have to tend to other children, or need to return to work and rely on other adults to help provide childcare. Clinicians can help parents recognize, understand, and respond to their newly adopted child's adjustment issues. </p><p>Some parents describe a &quot;honeymoon&quot; period, during which the child is compliant and seemingly quite happy. Others describe children who are withdrawn, hypervigilant, easily over-stimulated, aggressive, or defiant. Any of these observations can be typical transitional behaviors and often worrisome to parents, who may not have anticipated the behaviors or may have concerns that they will persist.</p><p>Some children struggle with sleep issues or regulation of their eating patterns. These behaviors can be best understood by considering the child's circumstances before adoption: Was the sleep environment safe? Was the child potentially always hungry?</p><p>At some point, most children will enter a period of &quot;testing,&quot; during which their behavior suggests that they are seeking information about the permanency of their new home environment. Parents should be patient and reassuring and, at the same time, provide appropriate structure and consistency in their messaging and discipline.

(See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Terminology'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The preadoption visit allows pediatric health care providers to review available information about the adoptee, apprise the prospective parents of any current or anticipated special health needs, and help prepare the adoptive family for the upcoming transitions. (See <a href=\"#H16\" class=\"local\">'Preadoption'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The initial postadoption visit should include a comprehensive assessment of medical, developmental, and psychosocial issues. The health care provider also should educate the adoptive family about the physical, nutritional, safety, developmental, social, and emotional needs of their child. (See <a href=\"#H3098661938\" class=\"local\">'Postadoption'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Newly adopted children undergo an adjustment period before they can create a trusting bond with their adoptive families.

(See <a href=\"#H20\" class=\"local\">'Other mental health issues'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For families who adopt children with special needs, referrals for counseling, support groups, special education services, and financial aid should be provided as necessary.

(See <a href=\"#H22\" class=\"local\">'Developmental stages of adoption'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Open discussion of adoption is encouraged.
