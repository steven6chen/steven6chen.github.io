Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) is then removed for sample.</p><p>LP should be performed distal to the spinal cord, at the level of the cauda equina. At birth, the inferior tip of the spinal cord is located opposite the body of L3. The vertebral column grows more rapidly than the spinal cord. As a result, by adulthood, the tip of the spinal cord is at the inferior border of the body of L1. In older children, LP can be performed from the L2-L3 interspace to the L5-S1 interspace because these interspaces are below the termination of the spinal cord. LP in children younger than 12 months must be performed below the L2-L3 interspace [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lumbar-puncture-indications-contraindications-technique-and-complications-in-children/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].</p><p>An imaginary line that connects the two posterior-superior iliac crests intersects the spine at approximately the fourth lumbar vertebra (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F60862\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef60862 \">figure 1</a>).

Furthermore, observational evidence suggests that using a local anesthetic increases the likelihood of a successful procedure:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Among 297 infants &le;3 months of age receiving lumbar punctures in an emergency department, LPs performed with a local anesthetic were twice as likely to be successful as those performed without local anesthesia (odds ratio [OR]: 2.2, 95% CI 1.04-4.6) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lumbar-puncture-indications-contraindications-technique-and-complications-in-children/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a prospective series describing 1459 children receiving lumbar punctures in an emergency department, procedures performed without local anesthetic were more likely to be traumatic or unsuccessful than those performed with local anesthesia (OR: 1.6, 95% CI 1.1-2.2) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lumbar-puncture-indications-contraindications-technique-and-complications-in-children/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>].</p><p/><p>These findings suggest that local anesthesia should be provided for all children whenever possible. We suggest topical anesthesia for all neonates and young infants for whom the procedure can safely be delayed until the medication has had an effect. When there is not enough time for topical anesthesia, an infiltrative anesthetic is suggested for most; the available data do not support the notion that infiltrative anesthetics interfere with the procedure, even in this young age group.</p><p>For older infants and children, ideal local anesthesia is provided by the combination of a topical and infiltrative anesthetic. The latter can be used alone when the LP must be performed emergently.</p><p>Some older infants and young children may be apprehensive and unable to tolerate being positioned and restrained for the procedure. They should receive procedural sedation.

Limited evidence suggests that the frequency of postspinal headaches in children is approximately 5 to 15 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lumbar-puncture-indications-contraindications-technique-and-complications-in-children/abstract/30-35\" class=\"abstract_t\">30-35</a>].</p><p>Various techniques such as using the smallest possible needle, use of atraumatic needles, and placing the bevel of the needle parallel to the long axis of the spine have been shown to prevent or lessen postspinal headache in adults. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=post-lumbar-puncture-headache#H5\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Post-lumbar puncture headache&quot;, section on 'Prevention'</a>.)</p><p>However, the efficacy of using smaller LP needles in children is not proven. As an example, in a blinded crossover trial of 341 LPs in 93 children, the frequency of postspinal headache was not significantly different between smaller (25 gauge) or larger (22 gauge) needles (5 versus 7 percent, respectively, p = 0.3) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lumbar-puncture-indications-contraindications-technique-and-complications-in-children/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>]. Thus, use of a 22 gauge needle is reasonable and may be preferred by some clinicians because it shortens the duration of the procedure and is easier to place without bending. In adults, larger needles (eg, 20 gauge) have clearly been associated with a higher frequency of postspinal headaches, data in children is limited but we advise against the use of an LP needle that is larger than 22 gauge.
