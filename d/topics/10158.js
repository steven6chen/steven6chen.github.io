Sometimes, instead of killing only bad cells, something goes wrong and the immune system starts to attack healthy cells. That is called an autoimmune response. It is what happens in lupus. In other words, if you have lupus, your body is attacking itself.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H482505453\"><span class=\"h1\">What are the symptoms of lupus?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>People with lupus can:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Feel tired or weak</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Lose or gain weight</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Get fevers</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Get headaches</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Get a rash on their nose and cheeks shaped like a butterfly, especially if they spend time in the sun (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F79355\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef79355 \">picture 1</a>)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Lose some hair</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Get chest pain</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Have trouble breathing</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Bruise easily</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Have joint pain and stiffness</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Have swelling in the hands, feet, belly, or around the eyes</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Have urine that looks brown (tea-colored) or foamy</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Get sores in the mouth</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Get cold fingers or toes that turn pale or blue</p><p/><p>Lupus can also make it hard to think clearly, and it can make people feel anxious and sad. That is partly because the disease attacks the brain, and partly because the disease is hard to deal with.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H482505460\"><span class=\"h1\">Can I do anything on my own to feel better?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Yes. It can help to eat a healthy diet, full of fruits and vegetables. It's also important to stay active, even if you do not feel well. If you rest too much, your muscles will get weak and you might feel even worse later. Also, any time a doctor or nurse gives you medicine, make sure he or she knows you have lupus. Some medicines make lupus worse. It is important that you not take them.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H482505467\"><span class=\"h1\">What are the treatments for lupus?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There are medicines that can ease lupus symptoms, decrease the autoimmune response, or both. These medicines include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>NSAIDs, such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ibuprofen-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">ibuprofen</a> (sample brand names: Advil, Motrin) or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=naproxen-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">naproxen</a> (sample brand name: Aleve), which can ease joint pain</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Medicines called &quot;<a href=\"topic.htm?path=hydroxychloroquine-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">hydroxychloroquine</a>&quot; or &quot;<a href=\"topic.htm?path=chloroquine-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">chloroquine</a>,&quot; which were originally made to treat malaria but can also help with lupus</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Steroids and related medicines, which partly &quot;turn off&quot; the immune system, and can help with many of the problems caused by lupus (these are <strong>not</strong> the same as the steroids some athletes take illegally)</p><p/><p>Steroids can do a lot of good, because they control the disease. But they can also cause problems of their own. For instance, steroids can cause weight gain, make bones weak, or make diabetes worse (or even cause diabetes).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H482505474\"><span class=\"h1\">What if I want to get pregnant?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Women with lupus are more likely than other women to have problems with pregnancy. But they can have healthy babies.</p><p>If you would like to get pregnant, speak with your doctor or nurse before you start trying to get pregnant. There are ways for you to reduce the chances of having problems. For instance, it is important that you wait until you have not had lupus symptoms for at least 6 months.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H482505481\"><span class=\"h1\">How will lupus affect my life?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>You will have lupus for the rest of your life. It might be severe, or it might be mild. Either way, doctors and nurses today know a lot about how to handle the disease. You are likely to live a long time. And you might even find that your symptoms go away for long periods.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H482505511\"><span class=\"h1\">More on this topic</span></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=lupus-and-pregnancy-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Lupus and pregnancy (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=lupus-and-kidney-disease-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Lupus and kidney disease (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=antinuclear-antibodies-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Antinuclear antibodies (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=disease-modifying-antirheumatic-drugs-dmards-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Disease modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs) (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=discoid-lupus-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Discoid lupus (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=oral-steroid-medicines-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Oral steroid medicines (The Basics)</a></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=systemic-lupus-erythematosus-sle-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=systemic-lupus-erythematosus-and-pregnancy-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Systemic lupus erythematosus and pregnancy (Beyond the Basics)</a></p></div><div id=\"reviewProcess\"><span>All topics are updated as new evidence becomes available and our <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/home/editorial-policy\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"policy policy_editorialpolicy\">peer review process</a> is complete.</span></div><div id=\"topicRetrievedDate\"><span class=\"emphasis\">This topic retrieved from UpToDate on: </span>Apr 02, 2018.</div><div id=\"disclaimer\">The content on the UpToDate website is not intended nor recommended as a substitute for medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.
