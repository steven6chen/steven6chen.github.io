It is lined by synovium and consists of two hinge-type joints between the femoral condyles and the medial and lateral tibial plateaus, and a gliding-type joint between the patella and the trochlear groove of the anterior distal femur (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RHEUM%2F69611\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef69611 \">figure 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/radiologic-evaluation-of-the-chronically-painful-knee-in-adults/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. The major stabilizers of the joint are the extensor tendons (quadriceps and patellar tendons), medial and lateral collateral ligament complex, and cruciate ligaments. The menisci are fibrocartilaginous structures that distribute the stress over the articular cartilage, absorb the shock in axial loading, stabilize the joint in flexion and extension, and have a role in joint lubrication [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/radiologic-evaluation-of-the-chronically-painful-knee-in-adults/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p>For the purposes of this discussion, &quot;chronic knee pain&quot; is defined as pain of at least three months' duration. Imaging modalities used to evaluate adults with chronic knee pain and the appropriateness of particular studies in different clinical scenarios will be reviewed here. The history and physical examination, which are necessary to develop a differential diagnosis prior to the selection of imaging tests; a general review of imaging tests that are used in the evaluation of bone and joint pain; and radiologic evaluation of adults with acute knee pain are presented separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=approach-to-the-adult-with-unspecified-knee-pain\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Approach to the adult with unspecified knee pain&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=imaging-techniques-for-evaluation-of-the-painful-joint\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Imaging techniques for evaluation of the painful joint&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=radiologic-evaluation-of-the-acutely-painful-knee-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Radiologic evaluation of the acutely painful knee in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Chronic knee pain is most commonly caused by arthritis, bursitis and cystic lesions around the joint, tendon pathology, cartilage pathology, chronic infection, osteonecrosis (avascular necrosis), stress fractures, and avulsion injuries.</p><p>Referred pain is an important clinical consideration in the patient with chronic knee pain; however, knee pain that is referred from other anatomic sites is beyond the scope of our discussion and is discussed elsewhere.</p><p>The use of imaging in the assessment of children and adolescents with knee pain is also presented elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=approach-to-acute-knee-pain-and-injury-in-children-and-skeletally-immature-adolescents#H538637006\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Approach to acute knee pain and injury in children and skeletally immature adolescents&quot;, section on 'Imaging'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=approach-to-chronic-knee-pain-or-injury-in-children-or-skeletally-immature-adolescents#H1196273181\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Approach to chronic knee pain or injury in children or skeletally immature adolescents&quot;, section on 'Imaging'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">ARTHRITIDES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The major arthritides involving the knee joint include osteoarthritis (OA), calcium pyrophosphate deposition disease, and inflammatory arthritides such as rheumatoid arthritis (RA), psoriatic arthritis, reactive arthritis (formerly Reiter's syndrome), and peripheral arthritis in patients with ankylosing spondylitis (AS). Less common arthritides that cause chronic knee pain, such as neuropathic arthropathy, gout, and hemophilic arthropathy, are also discussed below.</p><p>As noted above, the knee joint consists of three compartments: the medial tibiofemoral, the lateral tibiofemoral, and the patellofemoral compartment. These compartments are affected differently by various arthropathies.</p><p>Plain film radiography is the initial imaging modality of choice for evaluation of all arthritides and in most cases the only study required for diagnosis. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has some value for evaluation of arthritides, which will be discussed below under individual entities. MRI can differentiate between proliferating synovium and joint effusion, and quantifies synovial volume. The latter is valuable in assessing severity of the disease and response to therapy in clinical trials. MRI and ultrasonography may be useful in directing synovial biopsy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/radiologic-evaluation-of-the-chronically-painful-knee-in-adults/abstract/1,3\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,3</a>]. Computed tomography (CT) and CT arthrography may be alternative imaging studies when MRI is contraindicated.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Osteoarthritis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>OA is the most common arthropathy seen in the knee. OA can be primary or secondary to prior joint injury, infection, osteonecrosis, inflammatory and crystal-induced arthropathies, metabolic disorders, or hemophilia.</p><p>Plain film radiography is the initial, and is often the only, imaging modality needed to diagnose OA and exclude other causes of knee pain. The presence of articular calcification may be a clue to the presence of OA due to underlying endocrine, metabolic, or inherited disorder. (See <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Calcium pyrophosphate deposition disease'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Plain film radiography &ndash; Plain film radiographs are not sensitive for detection of early cartilage loss associated with arthritis. Hallmarks of OA of the knee seen in plain film include osteophyte formation, joint space narrowing, subchondral sclerosis, and subchondral cyst formation (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RHEUM%2F74675\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef74675 \">image 1</a>). Osteophyte formation is the most specific sign for detection of OA [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/radiologic-evaluation-of-the-chronically-painful-knee-in-adults/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. Joint effusion can also be present. Advanced manifestations of OA include complete loss of joint space, osteochondral loose bodies, and Baker's cyst formation. Other degenerative changes in the knee can occur at the insertion of the quadriceps or patellar tendon on the patella, leading to enthesopathy (tendinopathy, followed by ossification of the tendon attachment).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>CT &ndash; CT is more sensitive for showing early bony changes of OA; however, it is not routinely indicated. CT can help in detection of radiographically occult loose bodies.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>MRI &ndash; MRI is not recommended in the presence of advanced OA seen on plain radiographs. In early OA, MRI may provide additional information about the extent of bone and soft tissue involvement, such as subchondral bone marrow edema, extent of cartilage damage, meniscal and ligament tears, synovitis, osteochondral loose bodies, and Baker's cyst [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/radiologic-evaluation-of-the-chronically-painful-knee-in-adults/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">However, MRI often reveals abnormal findings even in asymptomatic patients without radiographic OA. In a study of 710 patients over age 50 without radiographic evidence of OA, the most common changes on MRI examination of the tibiofemoral joint were osteophytes, cartilage damage, and bone marrow abnormalities (in 74, 69, and 52 percent, respectively) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/radiologic-evaluation-of-the-chronically-painful-knee-in-adults/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. Moreover, at least one finding was present in similar numbers of patients with or without pain (90 to 97 percent and 86 to 88 percent, depending upon the pain definition used). Changes were more common with advancing age. Thus, MRI is generally not useful in routine clinical practice for the evaluation of advanced OA.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Ultrasound &ndash; Ultrasound (US) can also detect findings consistent with more advanced OA, including osteophytes and signs of cartilage deterioration. It is also useful for detecting effusions and synovial hypertrophy secondary to OA (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=musculoskeletal-ultrasonography-clinical-applications#H20\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Musculoskeletal ultrasonography: Clinical applications&quot;, section on 'Joints'</a>). US is also being used to guide joint aspiration and intraarticular injection in OA [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/radiologic-evaluation-of-the-chronically-painful-knee-in-adults/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=musculoskeletal-ultrasonography-guided-injection-and-aspiration-of-joints-and-related-structures\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Musculoskeletal ultrasonography: Guided injection and aspiration of joints and related structures&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p>Several of the above imaging abnormalities correlate with severity of knee pain in patients with OA. These include synovitis, joint effusion, ligament tears such as anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) tear, and subchondral bone marrow edema [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/radiologic-evaluation-of-the-chronically-painful-knee-in-adults/abstract/6,8-10\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,8-10</a>]. Subchondral bone marrow edema also correlates with progression of OA [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/radiologic-evaluation-of-the-chronically-painful-knee-in-adults/abstract/9,11,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,11,12</a>].</p><p>Degenerative meniscal tears appear to be an early event in development of OA as shown by several studies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/radiologic-evaluation-of-the-chronically-painful-knee-in-adults/abstract/13,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,14</a>]. However, degenerative meniscal tears are highly prevalent in both symptomatic and asymptomatic osteoarthritic knees and MRI is not indicated in the evaluation and management of these tears in patients with OA [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/radiologic-evaluation-of-the-chronically-painful-knee-in-adults/abstract/15,16\" class=\"abstract_t\">15,16</a>].</p><p>Changes in cartilage volume also appear to be associated with clinical symptoms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/radiologic-evaluation-of-the-chronically-painful-knee-in-adults/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. Studies using quantitative techniques emphasize the ability of MRI to accurately measure the progression of knee OA by assessing changes in cartilage volume. This in turn could be helpful in following the effect of treatment with structure-modifying agents in clinical trials, or in selecting patients at high risk for requiring joint replacement [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/radiologic-evaluation-of-the-chronically-painful-knee-in-adults/abstract/17-20\" class=\"abstract_t\">17-20</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Calcium pyrophosphate deposition disease</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Calcium pyrophosphate deposition disease (CPPD) is caused by deposition of calcium pyrophosphate dihydrate crystal in and around the joints. CPPD is the second most common arthropathy of the knee, seen predominantly in the middle and older age group. CPPD is often asymptomatic and diagnosed on plain film by articular cartilage or meniscal calcification (chondrocalcinosis). When symptomatic, CPPD is also called pseudogout. Joint aspiration may be necessary to obtain synovial fluid to confirm the presence of CPPD crystals and to exclude infection. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-calcium-pyrophosphate-crystal-deposition-cppd-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of calcium pyrophosphate crystal deposition (CPPD) disease&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Plain film radiography &ndash; Thin calcification (chondrocalcinosis) is present in the articular cartilage or menisci (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RHEUM%2F66550\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef66550 \">image 2</a>), with preferential involvement of the patellofemoral joint. Calcifications of the synovium, tendon, and ligaments can also be seen. CPPD may lead to the early development of secondary OA. Isolated patellofemoral involvement in the knee should suggest the possibility of CPPD arthropathy. Definitive diagnosis of CPPD arthropathy also requires the demonstration of positively (but weakly) birefringent CPPD crystals in tissue or synovial fluid.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Rheumatoid arthritis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The most common inflammatory arthritis of the knee is RA. Women are more commonly affected than men. RA frequently involves the knees, with up to 13 percent of patients presenting with the knee as initial site of involvement [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/radiologic-evaluation-of-the-chronically-painful-knee-in-adults/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. The presence of a popliteal (Baker's) cyst (see <a href=\"#H13\" class=\"local\">'Popliteal bursitis'</a> below) is a common occurrence in RA.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Plain film radiography &ndash; Characteristic findings of RA on plain film are bilaterally symmetric and uniform joint space narrowing involving all three compartments (medial and lateral tibiofemoral and patellofemoral), periarticular osteoporosis, soft tissue swelling and joint effusion. Large synovial cysts may be present. Erosion is not a predominant characteristic in the knee and there is relative lack of sclerosis and osteophyte formation.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>CT &ndash; CT demonstrates erosions earlier than plain film; however, CT is not routinely used for evaluation of RA. CT better demonstrates the degree of joint destruction as compared with plain films. CT differentiates synovial proliferation from joint effusion.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>MRI &ndash; MRI demonstrates early changes of RA manifested by synovitis before plain film evidence of disease. The extent of synovitis in early RA is the best predictor of development of erosions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/radiologic-evaluation-of-the-chronically-painful-knee-in-adults/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. MRI shows the degree of synovial hypertrophy (pannus formation), which correlates with disease activity. MRI identifies involvement of the cartilage, tendon, and ligaments. MRI is useful in demonstrating the presence of loose bodies and Baker's cyst, which may complicate RA. Despite these advantages, the role of MRI in the diagnosis and monitoring of RA is still uncertain. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diagnosis-and-differential-diagnosis-of-rheumatoid-arthritis#H8594869\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Diagnosis and differential diagnosis of rheumatoid arthritis&quot;, section on 'Evaluation for suspected RA'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=general-principles-of-management-of-rheumatoid-arthritis-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;General principles of management of rheumatoid arthritis in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>US &ndash; US is more sensitive than clinical examination in detecting inflammation in the synovial tissues, and can be useful in the evaluation of early RA [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/radiologic-evaluation-of-the-chronically-painful-knee-in-adults/abstract/23,24\" class=\"abstract_t\">23,24</a>]. It also has utility for the evaluation of the response to therapy in patients with inflammatory arthritis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/radiologic-evaluation-of-the-chronically-painful-knee-in-adults/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. Semi-quantitative measurements of joint effusion, synovial hypertrophy, and inflammation have been developed, which correlate with disease activity. US can also be used to identify tendinopathy and bony erosions when present. These methods, however, need further standardization. US can also be used to guide joint aspiration and intraarticular therapeutic injection. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=musculoskeletal-ultrasonography-clinical-applications#H20\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Musculoskeletal ultrasonography: Clinical applications&quot;, section on 'Joints'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Psoriatic arthritis and reactive arthritis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Psoriatic and reactive arthritis (formerly the arthritis of Reiter's syndrome) have similar radiographic findings in the knee. Asymmetric involvement is a common feature.

Typical findings include osteophyte and enthesophyte formation (bone proliferation at the ligamentous and tendinous attachments) and periostitis.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>US &ndash; As with RA, US has utility for detecting inflammation in the synovial tissues, and can be used to monitor disease activity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/radiologic-evaluation-of-the-chronically-painful-knee-in-adults/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Rheumatoid arthritis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Ankylosing spondylitis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>AS is a chronic inflammatory disease primarily affecting the axial skeleton (spine and sacroiliac joints). It is more commonly seen in young men. Knee involvement is uncommon.

Uniform joint space narrowing, small erosions, and bone sclerosis are seen early in the disease, which may lead to ankylosis of the entire joint.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Neuropathic arthropathy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Neuropathic arthropathy, also known as Charcot joint, is caused by chronic conditions causing neurosensory deficit, such as diabetes, syphilis, and syringomyelia. In the past, neuropathic arthropathy of the knee was most commonly caused by tabes dorsalis (a &quot;tertiary&quot; form of neurosyphilis); however, this has since been replaced by diabetes mellitus [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/radiologic-evaluation-of-the-chronically-painful-knee-in-adults/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. Charcot joint is characterized by fragmentation of bone and cartilage with increased density and disorganization of the joint.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Plain film radiography &ndash; Plain film radiographic findings of neuropathic arthropathy include large recurrent joint effusions, joint subluxations, pathological fractures, and bone debris in the joint, leading to complete derangement of the joint.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h2\">Gouty arthritis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Gout affects men significantly more than women. The knee is the third most commonly affected joint, after the foot and ankle. There is usually a latent period of 5 to 10 years between the initial presentation and the appearance of radiographic findings [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/radiologic-evaluation-of-the-chronically-painful-knee-in-adults/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>].</p><p>Urate crystal deposition in the articular cartilage leads to secondary OA. Urate crystals can also deposit in the soft tissues in the form of tophi, which in turn cause erosion of the adjacent bone with typical sclerotic border and overhanging edges. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-gout\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of gout&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Plain film radiography &ndash; Plain film radiography of gouty arthritis or tophaceous gout can show periarticular soft tissue masses with occasional internal calcifications and possible adjacent erosions. When the knee is affected, osteoarthritic changes predominate [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/radiologic-evaluation-of-the-chronically-painful-knee-in-adults/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>MRI &ndash; MRI shows gouty erosions earlier than plain film radiography, demonstrates presence of tophi, and differentiates suprapatellar soft tissue masses from joint effusion. Tophi characteristically have relatively homogeneous intermediate or low-signal intensity on T1-weighted images and variable signal intensity on T2-weighted images [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/radiologic-evaluation-of-the-chronically-painful-knee-in-adults/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h2\">Hemophilic arthropathy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Joint changes in hemophilia are secondary to repeated hemarthrosis (joint hemorrhage) and intraosseous bleeding, which occur in 75 to 90 percent of patients. Articular changes occur most often in the first and second decade of life. The knee is the most commonly affected joint in patients not treated with prophylaxis (45 percent); however, in patients on prophylactic treatment, the ankle joint accounts for the most common site of bleeding [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/radiologic-evaluation-of-the-chronically-painful-knee-in-adults/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. The radiographic findings can mimic juvenile idiopathic arthritis. MRI findings can mimic those of pigmented villonodular synovitis (PVNS) due to intraarticular hemosiderin deposition in both entities.

Chronic hyperemia in the joint leads to overgrowth of the tibial and femoral epiphyses, causing widening of the intercondylar notch. Overgrowth and squaring of the patella is present. Subchondral cyst formation is seen secondary to intraosseous bleeding. In the chronic phase, there is secondary OA with uniform joint space narrowing.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>MRI &ndash; MRI is indicated for determining the extent of cartilage destruction and synovial thickening, which affect management. Hemosiderin deposition due to chronic joint hemorrhage in hemophilia may result in clumps of low T1-weighted and low T2-weighted signal lining the synovium. The presence of hemosiderin is associated with advanced joint destruction. MRI is important in assessment of response to therapy and disease progression [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/radiologic-evaluation-of-the-chronically-painful-knee-in-adults/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h1\">BURSITIS AND CYSTS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The bursae around the knee joint most commonly involved by pathology include the popliteal bursa, prepatellar bursa, and pes anserinus bursa. Less commonly involved bursae are the supra- and infrapatellar bursae, semimembranosus tibial collateral ligament bursa, tibial collateral ligament bursa, iliotibial band bursa, and fibular collateral ligament-biceps femoris bursae.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h2\">Bursitis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Bursae around the knee can become inflamed and mimic intraarticular pathology. The bursae around the joint are not seen arthroscopically, and ultrasound (US) is useful in evaluation of pes anserinus bursitis and Baker's cyst. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is the modality of choice for imaging evaluation of suspected bursal pathology in other knee bursae. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=knee-bursitis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Knee bursitis&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h3\">Popliteal bursitis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The most commonly inflamed bursa of the knee is the popliteal bursa, also known as Baker's cyst. Baker's cyst is commonly associated with meniscal tears and other causes of internal derangement of the joint. Baker's cyst is also associated with arthropathies, including osteoarthritis (OA) and rheumatoid arthritis (RA). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=popliteal-bakers-cyst\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Popliteal (Baker's) cyst&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Baker's cyst may extend superiorly or inferiorly and can cause compartment syndrome. It can cause pressure on the venous system and lead to edema or thrombophlebitis.

Rupture of the cyst with extravasation in the surrounding muscle may mimic thrombophlebitis.

However, meniscal tears may also be noted in otherwise healthy persons with no knee pain.</p><p>Chronic knee pain with mechanical symptoms such as locking or an inability to fully extend the knee, popping, giving way, or &quot;not moving properly&quot; may indicate a clinically significant meniscal tear. Patients for whom surgical intervention would be indicated if a meniscal tear is present are best evaluated with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).

CT is considered superior to magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in the setting of chronic active osteomyelitis for the demonstration of cortical destruction and gas. The most specific sign of active chronic osteomyelitis is the presence of a sequestrum, which is best demonstrated on CT, although the viability of sequestered bone is more reliably determined with MRI [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/radiologic-evaluation-of-the-chronically-painful-knee-in-adults/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>MRI &ndash; MRI is more sensitive than CT in demonstrating activity of the disease in chronic osteomyelitis.
