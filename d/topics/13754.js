Viral inactivation of blood products is discussed separately.

The use of such plasma required mixing, under battlefield conditions, with sterile water, a time-consuming process. In addition, pooled, freeze-dried plasma frequently transmitted serum hepatitis.</p><p>The development of plasma fractionation took place under the pressure of devising products for the treatment of war casualties in the early 1940s. Harvard biochemist Edwin J. Cohn and a team of scientists developed what became known as the Cohn plasma fractionation process, also known as cold ethanol fractionation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/plasma-derivatives-and-recombinant-dna-produced-coagulation-factors/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>].</p><p>Additional methods for purifying certain of these proteins involve ion exchange, immune affinity chromatography, and other separation techniques, but modifications of the original cold ethanol process remain the mainstay for the production of plasma derivatives. Currently, derivatives manufacturers perform various additional steps to inactivate viruses and other infectious agents [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/plasma-derivatives-and-recombinant-dna-produced-coagulation-factors/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">ALBUMIN</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Human serum albumin became the mainstay of the treatment of shock on the battlefield and in the emergency department for decades and is still in widespread use, although colloid therapy for routine resuscitation offers no therapeutic advantage over crystalloid fluid resuscitation. For reasons of efficacy and expense, non-plasma-derived crystalloids (eg, saline) and colloids (eg, hydroxyethyl starch, dextran) have generally supplanted albumin for the primary treatment of hypovolemic shock when blood components (plasma, platelets, red blood cells) are not available or indicated. (See <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'Indications'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Available preparations</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Human serum albumin is available in both 5 and 25 percent solutions, the former being isosmotic with plasma. Both have been pasteurized and do not transmit any known infectious diseases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/plasma-derivatives-and-recombinant-dna-produced-coagulation-factors/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. The 25 percent <a href=\"topic.htm?path=albumin-solution-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">albumin solution</a> should never be used for shock alone without other fluid volume replacement, since the hyperosmotic 25 percent solution will draw fluids from the extravascular space into the vascular space.</p><p>The 25 percent solution is sometimes diluted by pharmacies or nursing staff to a volume of 250 mL of 5 percent solution from its original 50 mL volume. This must be done <strong>only with normal saline</strong>. A number of cases of hemolysis in patients undergoing therapeutic plasmapheresis due to dilution of 25 percent albumin with sterile water have been reported.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h3\">Plasma protein fraction</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>This less frequently used product &quot;<a href=\"topic.htm?path=plasma-protein-fraction-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">plasma protein fraction</a>&quot; contains primarily albumin (about 90 percent) and historically is less expensive than albumin. It is available in 5 percent solutions and contains some globulins as well as albumin.

This subject is discussed in detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=factor-viii-and-factor-ix-inhibitors-in-patients-with-hemophilia#H2\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Factor VIII and factor IX inhibitors in patients with hemophilia&quot;, section on 'Inhibitors in hemophilia A'</a>.)</p><p>An important development in the prophylaxis and treatment of bleeding episodes in patients with hemophilia A and B are the long-acting factor VIII and factor IX concentrates, many of which became available in 2014 to 2016. These proteins are made by recombinant technologies involving fusion of the gene for the active portion of the relevant coagulation factor with a gene encoding the Fc portion of immunoglobulin G, subclass 1 (IgG1), which extends the half-life of the resulting protein, or by a PEGylation process, which involves attaching long strands of polyethylene glycol (PEG) to the factor molecule and also accomplishes the goal of half-life extension. These products have demonstrably longer half-lives (roughly 19 hours for factor VIII and up to 111 hours for factor IX) and have not stimulated the production of inhibitory antibodies, and they provide possibility of less onerous prophylactic regimens [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/plasma-derivatives-and-recombinant-dna-produced-coagulation-factors/abstract/12-14\" class=\"abstract_t\">12-14</a>].

The preparation preserves the ultra-high molecular weight multimers. It has a mean half-life of approximately 22 hours.

The vast majority of individuals with factor XIII deficiency (approximately 95 percent) have deficiency of the A-subunit.

An activated, recombinant form of protein C had been commercially available (Xigris, drotrecogin alfa) for reduction of mortality from severe sepsis associated with organ dysfunction in adults at high risk of death (eg, APACHE II score &ge;25). This product was voluntarily removed from the market in September 2011 when it failed to show a survival benefit for such patients.</p><p>Activated protein C differs from <a href=\"topic.htm?path=protein-c-concentrate-from-human-plasma-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">protein C concentrate</a>, which is used to treat severe congenital protein C deficiency and purpura fulminans.

Three protease inhibitors isolated from human plasma are commercially available and have important clinical applications. These include antithrombin (AT), C1-esterase inhibitor, and alpha-1 antitrypsin.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H25\"><span class=\"h2\">Antithrombin</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Antithrombin (AT, Thrombate III, formerly called antithrombin III) is a major inhibitor of thrombin and of activated factor X (Xa), and also has an effect on activated factors IX and XI. It has a strong affinity for heparin, which enhances its anticoagulant effects.</p><p>Antithrombin concentrate derived from human plasma is indicated for treatment of patients with hereditary AT deficiency in connection with surgery or obstetrical procedures or when they suffer from thromboembolism. This product is no longer recommended for patients with DIC who are not receiving heparin [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/plasma-derivatives-and-recombinant-dna-produced-coagulation-factors/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>].
