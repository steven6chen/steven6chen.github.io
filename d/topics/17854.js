In addition, 1 to 5 percent of women with breast cancer have metastatic disease at presentation. Although patients with metastatic breast cancer are unlikely to be cured of their disease, survival has improved over time due to improved options for treatment. As an example, compared with women treated from 1991 to 1992, those treated from 1999 to 2001 had a statistically longer survival (median, 22 versus 15 months) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-metastatic-breast-cancer-in-older-women/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p>This topic will address issues pertinent to systemic antitumor treatment in older women (typically defined as age &gt;65 years) with metastatic breast cancer.

However, treatment should take into consideration the medical status and treatment preferences of the older patient. Older adult patients may be more susceptible to toxicities of certain agents. For example, due to lesser bone marrow reserve, older adult patients may be more likely to suffer neutropenia when treated with inhibitors of cyclin dependent kinase (CDK) <span class=\"nowrap\">4/6</span>. They may also be more susceptible to dehydration due to <a href=\"topic.htm?path=everolimus-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">everolimus</a>, requiring parenteral hydration earlier than a younger patient might.

However, one must consider comorbid illnesses that might increase the odds of toxicity. A model can be useful in predicting which patients should not receive chemotherapy because they are at increased risk of developing severe or fatal toxicity from chemotherapy (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F78775\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef78775 \">table 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F60649\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef60649 \">table 2</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-metastatic-breast-cancer-in-older-women/abstract/12,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,13</a>].

However, there is no optimal or preferred sequence of agents. A choice between them should be based on the patient&rsquo;s clinical status and careful consideration of the agents, their schedule of administration, and specific toxicities. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=frailty\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Frailty&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Prior treatment history and toxicities must also be considered. In general, treatment with chemotherapy drugs of different classes (non-cross resistant agents) may result in a higher probability of response, especially if disease progression occurred within six months following the previously administered regimen.

In this cohort, 103 patients received monotherapy and 14 patients received polychemotherapy. Although 25 percent of patients were living at two years, 25 percent died within three months of beginning chemotherapy. Factors associated with improved prognosis included good performance status, absence of visceral disease, and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=capecitabine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">capecitabine</a> treatment.
