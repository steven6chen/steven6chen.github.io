Such children usually require the expertise of a multidisciplinary team. For children with mild or moderate malnutrition, nasogastric tube feedings may be initiated in the outpatient setting if adequate parental instructions for refeeding and periodic monitoring can be provided by home care personnel. For children with severe malnutrition, nasogastric tube feedings should be instituted in the hospital setting, where monitoring for the refeeding syndrome can be performed. Nasogastric feedings can be discontinued after consistent weight gain has been demonstrated for four to six months. If weight gain remains inadequate after three to four months of nasogastric tube feeding, gastrostomy tube placement may be appropriate.

Successful management requires a plan to address contributing nutritional, medical, <span class=\"nowrap\">developmental/behavioral,</span> and psychosocial factors. Support of the caregivers is critical. The involvement of a dietitian, occupational or speech therapist, social worker, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> developmental and behavioral pediatrician can be helpful in formulating a management plan. (See <a href=\"#H444762709\" class=\"local\">'Initial management'</a> above and <a href=\"#H444764414\" class=\"local\">'Interdisciplinary team'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Nutritional therapy is the mainstay of management. Catch-up growth requires energy intake greater than the Estimated Energy Requirement for age. We estimate the daily energy requirement for catch-up growth by multiplying the average energy requirement for age by the median weight for the child's current length (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F59304\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef59304 \">figure 3</a>) and dividing by the child's actual weight. (See <a href=\"#H444759485\" class=\"local\">'Energy requirements for catch-up growth'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We provide a multivitamin that includes iron and zinc during the catch-up phase of growth. (See <a href=\"#H508100979\" class=\"local\">'Vitamin and mineral supplementation'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Strategies to achieve adequate intake of dietary energy and protein vary depending upon the age and dietary preferences of the child (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F55039\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef55039 \">table 6</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F52825\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef52825 \">table 7</a>). Changes to the feeding environment also may be necessary (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F80726\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef80726 \">table 4</a>). (See <a href=\"#H1355299\" class=\"local\">'Strategies to increase intake'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Adjunctive management includes intervention as indicated for medical and <span class=\"nowrap\">developmental/behavioral</span> conditions contributing to undernutrition and anticipation and prevention of medical, developmental, and behavioral consequences. Psychosocial support of the caregivers is critical. (See <a href=\"#H508104469\" class=\"local\">'Adjunctive interventions'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The frequency of follow-up depends upon the child's age and the severity of undernutrition, but usually ranges from weekly to monthly. Frequent follow-up should continue until catch-up growth is demonstrated and a positive trend is maintained. (See <a href=\"#H508098755\" class=\"local\">'Follow-up'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Response to therapy is defined by achievement of catch-up growth (ie, a rate of weight gain that is two to three times the normal rate for age) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F73565\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef73565 \">table 5</a>). With adequate nutritional intake, catch-up growth is generally initiated within two days to two weeks, depending upon the severity of the initial deficit. (See <a href=\"#H27\" class=\"local\">'Response to initial management'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Between 25 and 60 percent of infants with FTT remain small for age (weight or height &lt;20<sup>th</sup> percentile for age and sex). Cognitive function is below normal in one-half of the children with FTT, and behavior and learning problems are common. Whether these findings are a direct result of FTT or are the result of continued adverse social circumstances is not known.
