Ear cartilage is classically affected, but RPC may involve cartilage and biochemically and immunologically related connective tissue structures throughout the body (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RHEUM%2F76071\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef76071 \">table 1</a>). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-of-relapsing-polychondritis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations of relapsing polychondritis&quot;</a>.)</p><p>This topic will review the pathologic changes associated with RPC. The pathogenesis of this disorder is discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=etiology-and-pathogenesis-of-relapsing-polychondritis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Etiology and pathogenesis of relapsing polychondritis&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">HISTOLOGY OF A TYPICAL ACTIVE EAR LESION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Biopsy of an active ear lesion is representative of pathologic changes occurring at connective tissue sites elsewhere. There is a characteristic spectrum of changes that depends upon the time the biopsy is performed.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A pleomorphic perichondral infiltrate of lymphocytes with a variable proportion of polymorphonuclear cells, <span class=\"nowrap\">monocyte/macrophages,</span> and plasma cells is initially observed at the chondro-dermal junction (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RHEUM%2F68917\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef68917 \">picture 1</a>). Lymphocytes dominate with CD4 helper T cells exceeding CD8 cytotoxic T cells [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathology-of-relapsing-polychondritis/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Contiguous regions of cartilage show evidence of proteoglycan depletion. Coarse granular deposits consisting primarily of immunoglobulin G (IgG) and C3 can be localized by direct immunofluorescence at the junctional site.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>As the disease progresses, the integrity of cartilage is disrupted by invading granulation tissue, which tends to sequester islands of degenerating chondrocytes and depleted matrix (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RHEUM%2F55022\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef55022 \">picture 2</a>). IgG and C3 may be seen throughout the matrix. Matrix metalloproteinases (MMP) are expressed in both the perichondral granulation tissue and chondrocytes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathology-of-relapsing-polychondritis/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Chondrocyte apoptosis is increased in chondritis lesions and correlates with the expression of MMP-3 and cathepsin-K. Nitric oxide expression is increased, reflecting the chondrocyte production of pro-apoptotic MMPs.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The late stage of the disease is characterized by complete disruption of tissue architecture and fibrosis (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RHEUM%2F80944\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef80944 \">picture 3</a>). Gelatinous cysts may be observed with focal regions of calcification and bone formation.</p><p/><p>Electron microscopy shows prominent chondrocyte cytoplasmic processes extending into regions of damage [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathology-of-relapsing-polychondritis/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. These contain as-yet-to-be-identified small, electron-dense granules and vesicles of varying size, shape, and density.</p><p>The chondrocytes appear to be actively phagocytosing degraded material and are rich in lysosomes, lipid, and glycogen. Collagen and elastic fibers are eventually destroyed. Finely granular electron-dense material may be seen coating such fibers and may be on the surface of cartilage.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">PATHOLOGY AT OTHER SITES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Other anatomic areas and organs that may be involved include the eyes, nose, airways, vascular system, skin, joints, kidney, and nervous system (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RHEUM%2F76071\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef76071 \">table 1</a>). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-of-relapsing-polychondritis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations of relapsing polychondritis&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Aorta</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>At sites of aortic involvement, the media appears vascularized, and there is lymphocyte cuffing of the vasa vasorum. Mononuclear cell infiltration occurs with depletion of glycosaminoglycan content and with subsequent fragmentation and destruction of collagen and elastic fibers. Inflammation may extend throughout the aortic wall [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathology-of-relapsing-polychondritis/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. Smooth muscle destruction may lead to aneurysm formation. The aortic ring may be dilated, and valve leaflets may be thickened or ruptured.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Tracheobronchial tree</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The tracheal and bronchial mucosa may be edematous, and their cartilaginous rings exhibit changes varying from mild inflammation to total resorption by granulation tissue. The large- and medium-sized bronchi may show patchy widening or extensive narrowing and may collapse. Lesions may be localized or may involve the entire upper airway.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Synovia</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Synovial tissue biopsies have shown a chronic synovitis with edema and mononuclear cell infiltration.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Kidney</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Renal pathology is variable in relapsing polychondritis (RPC) because of its association with diverse autoimmune and connective tissue diseases and with immunoglobulin A (IgA) nephropathy (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RHEUM%2F81401\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef81401 \">table 2</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathology-of-relapsing-polychondritis/abstract/5,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,6</a>]. As a result, renal involvement may reflect both RPC and the related diseases. Three major changes have been attributed to RPC [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathology-of-relapsing-polychondritis/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Mild mesangial matrix expansion and cell proliferation</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Segmental crescentic necrotizing glomerulonephritis</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Tubulointerstitial disease</p><p/><p>Mesangial deposition of IgG, IgM, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> C3 may be seen by immunofluorescent microscopy, correlating with electron microscopic evidence of electron-dense mesangial deposits. Variable degrees of vascular and glomerular sclerosis and of tubular loss have been observed at necropsy.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Eye</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In the eye, episcleral vessels may be surrounded by plasma cells, lymphocytes, and mast cells; there may also be a vasculitis with immunoglobulin deposition in scleral and conjunctival vessels [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathology-of-relapsing-polychondritis/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. These changes may be associated with loss of basophilia and fragmentation of elastic tissue at the scleroconjunctival angle. A case of RPC-manifesting chronic bilateral follicular conjunctivitis has been described, with conjunctival biopsy demonstrating a granulomatous obliterative microangiopathy with numerous eosinophils, plasma cells, lymphocytes, and epithelioid cells in the substantia propria [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathology-of-relapsing-polychondritis/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. The chronic conjunctivitis resolved following use of systemic <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methotrexate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">methotrexate</a>, indicating that such a presentation may be indicative of smoldering RPC and may be a harbinger of potential visceral disease.</p><p>Inflammatory cells may infiltrate the peripheral region of the cornea, which can show edema and necrotic changes. The iris may also be infiltrated with chronic inflammatory cells and may contain granulation tissue.</p><p>Optic neuropathy, an uncommon feature of RPC, has been attributed to ischemia, intrinsic inflammation of the optic nerve, or spread of inflammation to the nerve from adjacent intraconal orbital tissues. There is a description of optic neuropathy associated with periosteal thickening and enhancement in the apical orbit and in the adjacent intracranial space consistent with periostitis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathology-of-relapsing-polychondritis/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h1\">SUMMARY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Relapsing polychondritis (RPC) is characterized by widespread, potentially destructive, inflammatory and degenerative lesions.
