Among the most important are:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Increased work of breathing from severe airflow resistance due to bronchial mucosal inflammation and edema, constriction of bronchial smooth muscle, and mucus in the bronchial lumen</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Increased intrathoracic pressure from air trapping, which further increases the work of breathing, decreases preload, and increases afterload</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Depletion of catecholamines during prolonged exacerbations</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Dehydration through insensible losses (more important in children)</p><p/><p>The pathophysiology of asthma is discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pathogenesis-of-asthma\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pathogenesis of asthma&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">THE DECISION TO INTUBATE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The decision to intubate is a clinical one. Asthmatics in obvious respiratory distress that the clinician judges to be unsustainable require prompt intubation. Beyond that, there are no studies or consensus guidelines that predict precisely when intubation is necessary in the asthmatic.</p><p>The clinical assessment that a patient in respiratory distress requires intubation involves the patient's appearance, vital signs including oxygen saturation, and the response to therapy. As an example, the patient who is clearly tiring, speaking only in one or two word phrases, and demonstrating either increased distress or declining mental status should be intubated prior to the inevitable respiratory arrest of which these findings warn. It is a combination of the severity of bronchoconstriction and the exhaustion of the patient trying to overcome it that sets the stage for respiratory arrest. When the clinician decides that respiratory failure is advanced, progressing, and unlikely to be reversed by further pharmacologic therapy, intubation should be performed expeditiously, before crisis ensues.</p><p>It is important to note that unlike other conditions in which intubation essentially &quot;solves the problem,&quot; the dynamic hyperinflation potentially caused or exacerbated by mechanical ventilation of a severe asthmatic can have devastating consequences, including cardiovascular collapse and barotrauma. Therefore, intubation of a patient with acute status asthmaticus should be undertaken only when judged clinically necessary. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acute-severe-asthma-exacerbations-in-children-endotracheal-intubation-and-mechanical-ventilation#H344206148\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Acute severe asthma exacerbations in children: Endotracheal intubation and mechanical ventilation&quot;, section on 'Complications'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=invasive-mechanical-ventilation-in-adults-with-acute-exacerbations-of-asthma#H870670\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Invasive mechanical ventilation in adults with acute exacerbations of asthma&quot;, section on 'Adverse effects of dynamic hyperinflation'</a>.)</p><p>In most patients (including those with asthma), a simple assessment consisting of three clinical evaluations distinguishes those who require intubation:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Is there failure of airway maintenance or protection?</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Is there failure of oxygenation or ventilation?</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Is deterioration, particularly of the airway, anticipated? (ie, What is the expected clinical course?)</p><p/><p>This general approach to emergency intubation is discussed in detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=the-decision-to-intubate\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;The decision to intubate&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=emergency-endotracheal-intubation-in-children#H2\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Emergency endotracheal intubation in children&quot;, section on 'Indications'</a>.)</p><p>In the patient with severe acute asthma, the most important indication for intubation is anticipation of the patient's continued deterioration. Without prompt intervention this can lead to severe hypoxemia or respiratory arrest. Irreversible failure of oxygenation or clinical suspicion of ventilatory failure may also develop, prompting emergent intubation.</p><p>Clinical findings that portend imminent respiratory arrest in the asthmatic may include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Inability to maintain respiratory effort (ie, extreme fatigue)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Depressed mental status</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Cyanosis</p><p/><p>Note that these findings are not sensitive indicators of severe attacks; many patients with severe airway obstruction will not manifest these signs.

Arterial blood gases are also rarely helpful in determining the need for intubation in the emergency setting. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h1\">NONINVASIVE POSITIVE PRESSURE VENTILATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Endotracheal intubation and mechanical ventilation can lead to severe complications in asthmatics. One possible alternative in patients who are not on the brink of respiratory failure and do not have other contraindications is noninvasive positive pressure ventilation (NPPV) using bilevel positive airway pressure (BLPAP). BLPAP offers positive airway pressure on inspiration and a lower level of continuous positive airway pressure on expiration.</p><p>In some patients with severe respiratory distress, NPPV reduces the work of breathing, decreases airway resistance and the feeling of dyspnea, re-expands collapsed alveoli, and provides rest for the thoracic muscles of respiration. The role of NPPV in patients with acute severe asthma remains unclear, but a trial of BLPAP prior to invasive mechanical ventilation is reasonable in patients experiencing a severe, persistent exacerbation despite maximal bronchodilator therapy, if they do not already require immediate intubation. NPPV is discussed in detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=noninvasive-ventilation-in-acute-respiratory-failure-in-adults#H18\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Noninvasive ventilation in acute respiratory failure in adults&quot;, section on 'Asthma'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=noninvasive-ventilation-in-acute-respiratory-failure-in-adults#H5\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Noninvasive ventilation in acute respiratory failure in adults&quot;, section on 'Initiation'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acute-severe-asthma-exacerbations-in-children-intensive-care-unit-management#H8\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Acute severe asthma exacerbations in children: Intensive care unit management&quot;, section on 'Noninvasive positive pressure ventilation'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h1\">RAPID SEQUENCE INTUBATION</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Approach</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The asthmatic in need of endotracheal intubation is often exhausted with little physiologic reserve and at high risk of sustaining a rapid decline in oxygen saturation and blood pressure after receiving sedating medications and neuromuscular blocking agents. For these reasons, it is important to plan for and achieve intubation as early as possible once the determination has been made that intubation is necessary. Rapid sequence intubation (RSI) is the preferred approach in such cases because it is the most rapid method for securing the airway with the highest likelihood of success.</p><p>Aspects of RSI of special relevance to the severe asthmatic are discussed below. The general performance of RSI is reviewed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=rapid-sequence-intubation-for-adults-outside-the-operating-room\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Rapid sequence intubation for adults outside the operating room&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=rapid-sequence-intubation-rsi-outside-the-operating-room-in-children-approach\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Rapid sequence intubation (RSI) outside the operating room in children: Approach&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Preoxygenation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Achieving adequate preoxygenation in an asthmatic experiencing a severe exacerbation is extremely difficult, if not impossible, due to their high residual volume and functional residual capacity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/emergency-airway-management-in-acute-severe-asthma/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. The clinician must anticipate rapid oxygen desaturation when performing RSI in such patients, despite maximal efforts at preoxygenation. Patients who do not achieve a SpO<sub>2</sub> above 93 percent have a much faster rate of SpO<sub>2</sub> decline during intubation attempts [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/emergency-airway-management-in-acute-severe-asthma/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p>If the patient will tolerate it, preoxygenation via active breathing through a bag valve mask provides significantly higher inspiratory oxygen concentrations than a typical nonrebreather mask. The use of noninvasive positive pressure ventilation may also improve preoxygenation, even if it does not successfully reverse the patient's respiratory failure. (See <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Noninvasive positive pressure ventilation'</a> above.)</p><p>Many patients with status asthmaticus require positive pressure ventilation either before or between attempts at intubation. Such ventilation should be delivered by bag and mask using a small tidal volume and high inspiratory flow rate with a prolonged expiratory phase, mimicking the approach used during mechanical ventilation. If a normal tidal volume is delivered at a normal rate, breath stacking and increasing auto PEEP may lead to further declines in oxygenation and impair the ability to ventilate the patient.

Once the patient loses consciousness, place the patient in a supine position and perform laryngoscopy and intubation.</p><p>Placement of a large endotracheal tube (8 to 9 mm) is desirable in order to minimize airway resistance and facilitate aggressive pulmonary toilet during mechanical ventilation in adults, but tube size should be selected to achieve the most rapid possible intubation. If necessary, the tube can be changed later to one of a larger diameter.</p><p>In children between one and eight years of age, the tube size can be calculated based upon age (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F72932\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef72932 \">table 2</a>). A cuffed endotracheal tube is preferable for all age groups and a cuff pressure should be measured, especially in pediatric patients. Older children and adolescents should have the largest possible tube placed (up to 9 mm internal diameter). </p><p>Although cricoid pressure is now considered optional during rapid sequence intubation, it may reduce the flow of air into the stomach should bag-mask ventilation be necessary, particularly given the increased airway resistance in the asthmatic.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h2\">Pretreatment</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Pretreatment should be viewed as a supplementary but nonessential step in RSI.

Ketamine is preferable because it aids bronchodilation through both direct and indirect mechanisms and helps to maintain blood pressure. Barbiturates, such as thiopental, should be avoided because they can exacerbate bronchospasm through histamine release.</p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=ketamine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Ketamine</a> is a dissociative anesthetic that provides several benefits in the severe asthmatic. It acts directly as a smooth muscle dilator, increases circulating catecholamines (thus indirectly dilating smooth muscle), inhibits vagal outflow, decreases production of vasodilatory nitric oxide, and does not cause histamine release. Ketamine is discussed in greater detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=induction-agents-for-rapid-sequence-intubation-in-adults-outside-the-operating-room#H10\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Induction agents for rapid sequence intubation in adults outside the operating room&quot;, section on 'Ketamine'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=rapid-sequence-intubation-rsi-outside-of-the-operating-room-in-children-medications-for-sedation-and-paralysis#H3917883154\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Rapid sequence intubation (RSI) outside of the operating room in children: Medications for sedation and paralysis&quot;, section on 'Ketamine'</a>.)</p><p>Large randomized trials to assess the effectiveness of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ketamine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ketamine</a> in the intubation of asthmatics are lacking. However, a number of studies and case reports suggest that ketamine improves pulmonary function and is of benefit in severe asthmatics [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/emergency-airway-management-in-acute-severe-asthma/abstract/3-6\" class=\"abstract_t\">3-6</a>]. In addition, multiple case series suggest that infusions of ketamine improve pulmonary function in patients with severe asthma. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-acute-exacerbations-of-asthma-in-adults#H272232657\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of acute exacerbations of asthma in adults&quot;, section on 'Anesthetic agents'</a>.)</p><p>Not all studies of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ketamine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ketamine</a> have been favorable.

However, the rate of dysphoric reactions, a well-known side effect of ketamine, led the investigators to reduce the initial bolus to 0.1 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> after the first nine patients. Larger prospective trials of ketamine in severe acute asthma are needed.</p><p>Case reports suggest that <a href=\"topic.htm?path=propofol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">propofol</a> has bronchodilatory effects and is therefore a suitable induction agent in the severe asthmatic [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/emergency-airway-management-in-acute-severe-asthma/abstract/8,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,9</a>]. However, propofol can cause hypotension, so it is less ideal than <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ketamine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ketamine</a> in these patients, who are predisposed to drop their blood pressure after intubation.</p><p>No large study has been performed to assess <a href=\"topic.htm?path=propofol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">propofol</a>'s role in the intubation of patients with severe asthma.

(See <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'Preoxygenation'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We suggest that <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ketamine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ketamine</a> (1 to 2 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> IV) be used as the induction agent for RSI in patients with severe asthma (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). Ketamine aids bronchodilation and helps to maintain blood pressure. <a href=\"topic.htm?path=propofol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Propofol</a> may have bronchodilatory effects but can cause hypotension. Barbiturates, such as thiopental, should be avoided because they can exacerbate bronchospasm. (See <a href=\"#H10\" class=\"local\">'Choice of induction agent'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Mechanical ventilation in the asthmatic is fraught with potential complications, including cardiovascular collapse and barotrauma. Minimizing airway pressures while maintaining adequate oxygenation is the primary goal of management. Mechanical ventilation of the asthmatic is discussed in detail separately.
