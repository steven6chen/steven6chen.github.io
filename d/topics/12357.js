The term &quot;damage control&quot; was borrowed from the United States Navy to refer to special teams that are responsible for keeping a severely damaged ship afloat until it can be returned to port for definitive repair. In a similar manner, damage control surgery serves to attend to immediately life-threatening conditions (keeping the patient afloat), while definitive management of these and other non-life-threatening injuries are delayed until after appropriate resuscitation. Although damage control surgery and resuscitation was initially described following abdominal injury, the basic principle has been extended to all aspects of trauma care. </p><p>The principles of damage control and resuscitation, as well as the damage control sequence, are reviewed here.

What would be regarded today as damage control surgery was first reported in 1983 as a laparotomy that was stopped due to excessive bleeding following bowel resection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-damage-control-surgery-and-resuscitation-in-patients-sustaining-severe-injury/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. The intestines were left in discontinuity; the abdomen was packed open, and, after resuscitation in the intensive care unit, the patient was later returned to the operating room for definitive intestinal repair and abdominal closure. The term &quot;damage control surgery&quot; was later used to describe abbreviated laparotomy in the context of trauma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-damage-control-surgery-and-resuscitation-in-patients-sustaining-severe-injury/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. The principles of damage control have since extended to all aspects of trauma care.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H102173510\"><span class=\"h2\">Phases of care</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The damage control approach can be broken down into distinct phases summarized below and discussed in the next sections more fully (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F105402\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef105402 \">figure 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-damage-control-surgery-and-resuscitation-in-patients-sustaining-severe-injury/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Damage control resuscitation principles should be applied throughout all phases of damage control. </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Phase 0 &ndash; Presurgery damage control involves rapid transport and rapid triage for treatment (eg, operating room, interventional suite). (See <a href=\"#H1488730\" class=\"local\">'Indications and presurgery damage control'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Phase 1 &ndash; Damage control surgery is aimed at arresting hemorrhage, limiting contamination, and maintaining optimal blood flow to vital organs and the extremities. Operative time is limited to minimize further hypothermia, coagulopathy, and acidemia. (See <a href=\"#H102173857\" class=\"local\">'Damage control surgery'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Phase 2 &ndash; Resuscitation in the intensive care unit involves intravenous fluid therapy to establish euvolemia using a balanced approach and warming the patient. These measures, along with appropriate airway and ventilatory management, will help to normalize tissue oxygen delivery and resolve acidosis and coagulopathy. (See <a href=\"#H1488754\" class=\"local\">'Resuscitation'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Phase 3 &ndash; Definitive repair of injuries temporized during damage control surgery may require a staged approach to address all injuries. The timing of definitive repair is determined by the patient's physiologic status. (See <a href=\"#H1488760\" class=\"local\">'Definitive repair'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Phase 4 &ndash; Closure of abdominal or other soft tissue wounds often requires complex reconstructive surgery, which is delayed until after complete recovery from the associated injuries. (See <a href=\"#H1488766\" class=\"local\">'Delayed abdominal/soft tissue closure'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H102175407\"><span class=\"h2\">Efficacy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Damage control surgery has not been validated prospectively. However, outcomes using a damage control approach compared with historical controls have shown significant reductions in morbidity and mortality [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-damage-control-surgery-and-resuscitation-in-patients-sustaining-severe-injury/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. As such, any study withholding such an approach would be deemed unethical [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-damage-control-surgery-and-resuscitation-in-patients-sustaining-severe-injury/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. </p><p>In the earliest report involving 22 patients with major vascular injury or two or more visceral injuries, mortality was reduced 66 percent using damage control techniques compared with standard techniques for the era (77 versus 11 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-damage-control-surgery-and-resuscitation-in-patients-sustaining-severe-injury/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1488730\"><span class=\"h1\">INDICATIONS AND PRESURGERY DAMAGE CONTROL</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Damage control begins in the field and continues during transport and initial evaluation of the patient in the emergency department. </p><p>Early recognition of the need for a damage control approach minimizes wasted time in the emergency department and limits physiologic strain. Initiating a damage control approach is based not only upon the type of traumatic injury but also includes the physiologic response to the injury [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-damage-control-surgery-and-resuscitation-in-patients-sustaining-severe-injury/abstract/6-8\" class=\"abstract_t\">6-8</a>]. Prior to arrival at the hospital, the trauma patient's physiologic response can be determined by vital signs and mental status. Recognition of severe physiologic abnormalities, especially in the face of penetrating trauma, should prompt prehospital personnel to abort all but lifesaving maneuvers to expedite patient delivery to the hospital environment for definitive care [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-damage-control-surgery-and-resuscitation-in-patients-sustaining-severe-injury/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. </p><p>During transport to the trauma center, the best strategy for minimizing mortality appears to be to perform only those interventions that are absolutely necessary to control hemorrhage and promote gas exchange [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-damage-control-surgery-and-resuscitation-in-patients-sustaining-severe-injury/abstract/9-11\" class=\"abstract_t\">9-11</a>]. Even taking the time to start intravenous therapy may result in an unnecessary delay to definitive care [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-damage-control-surgery-and-resuscitation-in-patients-sustaining-severe-injury/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. An exception may be in the rural setting where transport times to definitive care may be prolonged. Intubation, in particular, protects the airway and ensures adequate oxygenation and ventilation; however, rates of successful endotracheal intubation by prehospital personnel in the rural setting are lower compared with the urban setting [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-damage-control-surgery-and-resuscitation-in-patients-sustaining-severe-injury/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. As such, the safest approach may be to expeditiously transfer a patient to a trauma center following injury, regardless of the rural versus urban setting in which the event occurs. Other rescue airway options exist and can be carried out expeditiously if prehospital providers are familiar with their use. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prehospital-care-of-the-adult-trauma-patient#H9\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Prehospital care of the adult trauma patient&quot;, section on 'Controversies and guidelines'</a>.)</p><p>In the emergency department, the nature and extent of injuries can be rapidly determined, and physical examination (vital signs, temperature) and laboratory studies (eg, base deficit, lactate, coagulation parameters) help assess the magnitude of physiologic derangement. Any patient having undergone a resuscitative thoracotomy should be immediately placed into a damage control algorithm secondary to the severe physiologic insult. Damage control resuscitation, which includes a balanced blood product resuscitation, should begin as early as possible. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=initial-management-of-trauma-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Initial management of trauma in adults&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=initial-evaluation-of-shock-in-the-adult-trauma-patient-and-management-of-non-hemorrhagic-shock\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Initial evaluation of shock in the adult trauma patient and management of NON-hemorrhagic shock&quot;</a>.) </p><p>Damage control should be initiated in severely injured patients with multisystem trauma, but there are no absolute, evidence-based prediction models of who would benefit. A systematic review identified various indications used for damage control, and the validity of these indications was assessed by a panel of surgeons [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-damage-control-surgery-and-resuscitation-in-patients-sustaining-severe-injury/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>].

Implicit in this philosophy is the need to maintain blood flow to the vital organs and extremities, using temporary shunts if necessary. This holds true regardless of location, as damage control methodologies can be instituted in the head, chest, abdomen, and extremities. Life-threatening injuries to the head, neck, chest, or abdomen take precedence over extremity injuries, which, in spite of best efforts, may not be salvaged.</p><p>Damage control surgery should be performed in a diligent and expeditious fashion to minimize additional physiologic insult. Operative times should be approximately 90 minutes or less, as prolonged operation will cause or exacerbate existing hypothermia, coagulopathy, and acidemia, which increase morbidity and mortality [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-damage-control-surgery-and-resuscitation-in-patients-sustaining-severe-injury/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. Identified injuries are temporized, and definitive repair is deferred until the patient has stabilized. (See <a href=\"#H1488754\" class=\"local\">'Resuscitation'</a> below and <a href=\"#H1488760\" class=\"local\">'Definitive repair'</a> below.)</p><p>Although damage control was initially described for laparotomy in patients with abdominal injury, its principles have extended to all surgical disciplines. </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Damage control laparotomy focuses on controlling hemorrhage and contamination as well as leaving the abdomen open to prevent abdominal compartment syndrome. In a similar manner, although less common, damage control <span class=\"nowrap\">thoracotomy/sternotomy</span> would refer to leaving the sternum or hemithorax open to prevent cardiac tamponade in cases where the heart is significantly distended or edematous, and to control hemorrhage from the pleura, respectively. (See <a href=\"#H1488736\" class=\"local\">'Damage control laparotomy'</a> below and <a href=\"#H102177532\" class=\"local\">'Others'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Damage control of extremity injuries often requires cooperation of orthopedic and vascular surgery specialists. Damage control orthopedic surgery quickly places external fixation devices in patients who are too unstable to undergo definitive internal stabilization or who have contaminated wounds [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-damage-control-surgery-and-resuscitation-in-patients-sustaining-severe-injury/abstract/16,17\" class=\"abstract_t\">16,17</a>]. Damage control vascular surgery places temporary shunts into injured vessels to maintain blood flow, rather than ligation or definitive revascularization, and liberally uses fasciotomy to prevent extremity compartment syndromes. (See <a href=\"#H1488748\" class=\"local\">'Extremity stabilization'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Principles of damage control surgery can be applied to other surgical disciplines as well, including neurosurgery and urology. As an example, decompressive craniectomy may be used to manage refractory intracranial hypertension. In this context, damage control refers more to limiting operative time, potential blood loss, and propensity for hypothermia to develop in order to allow for resuscitation and reconstitution of normal physiology in the intensive care unit setting [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-damage-control-surgery-and-resuscitation-in-patients-sustaining-severe-injury/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H102177532\" class=\"local\">'Others'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1488736\"><span class=\"h2\">Damage control laparotomy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The fundamental strategy of damage control laparotomy, with the following priority, is to control hemorrhage, control contamination, and provide temporary abdominal closure to prevent abdominal compartment syndrome and facilitate subsequent procedures once the patient has been resuscitated [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-damage-control-surgery-and-resuscitation-in-patients-sustaining-severe-injury/abstract/19-21\" class=\"abstract_t\">19-21</a>]. </p><p>Fundamentally then, exploratory laparotomy should be performed via a midline incision because it is rapid and allows for complete observation and mobilization of intraperitoneal <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> retroperitoneal structures. The skin, subcutaneous tissue, and midline fascia (linea alba) are incised, leaving the peritoneum intact. Then, anesthesia personnel are informed and should be prepared for blood loss, which may occur once the tamponade of the closed abdomen is released during the opening of the peritoneum.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Packing and exploration &ndash; Immediately after opening the peritoneum, the abdomen is packed in all four quadrants. Laparotomy pads are first packed in quadrants where bleeding appears most significant. To explore the abdomen, the abdominal packs are then deliberately removed in reverse order, and active bleeding is controlled as it is encountered before addressing any gastrointestinal contamination. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Control hemorrhage &ndash; In general, hemorrhage is controlled by resecting severely damaged nonessential organs (eg, spleen) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F105403\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef105403 \">picture 1</a>), leaving severely damaged essential organs packed (most commonly the liver), and ligating or shunting transected intra-abdominal vessels [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-damage-control-surgery-and-resuscitation-in-patients-sustaining-severe-injury/abstract/22,23\" class=\"abstract_t\">22,23</a>]. Although any intra-abdominal blood vessel that is not an end-vessel can be ligated, consideration can also be given to shunting an injured vessel rather than ligating it (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F106052\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef106052 \">picture 2</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F105404\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef105404 \">picture 3</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-damage-control-surgery-and-resuscitation-in-patients-sustaining-severe-injury/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. This approach maintains perfusion while also controlling hemorrhage (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F105871\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef105871 \">table 1</a>). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=surgical-management-of-splenic-injury-in-the-adult-trauma-patient\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Surgical management of splenic injury in the adult trauma patient&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=surgical-techniques-for-managing-hepatic-injury\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Surgical techniques for managing hepatic injury&quot;</a>.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Control contamination &ndash; Control of contamination is obtained by sealing or resecting perforated hollow viscera. Gastric injuries can be oversewn quickly or stapled; low-grade partial- or full-thickness small and large bowel injuries can be repaired primarily, if this can be performed expeditiously; and high-grade small or large bowel injuries are most commonly resected (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F76656\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef76656 \">table 2</a>). If resection has been performed, the bowel is left in discontinuity, rather than being reanastomosed, which hastens the surgery and also avoids the potential postoperative complication of anastomotic dehiscence. Performing an anastomosis in the face of diminished perfusion or multiple transfusions increases the risk of gastrointestinal anastomotic dehiscence [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-damage-control-surgery-and-resuscitation-in-patients-sustaining-severe-injury/abstract/24,25\" class=\"abstract_t\">24,25</a>]. However, where physiology is normalized, the risk of anastomotic dehiscence during the index operation is not significantly higher compared with repair at a later stage in the damage control sequence (ie, phase 3) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-damage-control-surgery-and-resuscitation-in-patients-sustaining-severe-injury/abstract/26-29\" class=\"abstract_t\">26-29</a>].

Negative pressure dressings (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F105405\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef105405 \">picture 4</a>) are a commonly used method to provide temporary abdominal closure following damage control laparotomy because the dressing allows peritoneal fluid efflux, which can be accounted for in fluid resuscitation, improves the ability to bring the fascial edges back together, and facilitates second-look laparotomy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-damage-control-surgery-and-resuscitation-in-patients-sustaining-severe-injury/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. A second-look laparotomy may be needed if the patient remains severely hemodynamically unstable or hypothermic, where the possibility of a missed injury causing ongoing hemorrhage or contamination needs to be considered. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-the-open-abdomen-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of the open abdomen in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2531210837\"><span class=\"h2\">Damage control thoracotomy/sternotomy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Similar to abdominal damage control, when physiology warrants damage control methodology, chest injuries can be managed and the <span class=\"nowrap\">chest/sternum</span> temporarily closed using similar techniques as described below for the abdomen.

By allowing the edematous brain to expand beyond the usual confines of the cranium, decompressive craniectomy dissipates intracranial pressure and reduces the risk of stroke and uncal herniation. The skull flap is left off to allow the brain to swell, and downstream reconstructive efforts, such as definitive cranioplasty, occur two to three months following operation. A single trial of decompressive craniectomy following traumatic brain injury failed to show a mortality benefit [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-damage-control-surgery-and-resuscitation-in-patients-sustaining-severe-injury/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>].

In the rare event that both kidneys are injured, salvage should be attempted within reason. In cases of ureteral injury noted in hemodynamically-unstable patients, the ureter can be externalized through a separate incision and sutured to the skin, akin to a &quot;stoma,&quot; or a stent can be placed into the ureter and the stent can be externalized as a conduit. When pelvic fractures can cause distraction defects in the posterior urethra and a urethral catheter cannot be placed across the defect, damage control involves placement of a suprapubic drainage catheter. Definitive urethroplasty is delayed three to six months later.

The term &quot;damage control resuscitation&quot; refers to the balanced resuscitation used during this period. Although the damage control approach began with the management of abdominal injuries, these principles are standard of care for intrathoracic, vascular, orthopedic, and intracranial injuries as well. Morbidity and mortality rates using a damage control approach have been reduced significantly compared with historical controls. (See <a href=\"#H102173538\" class=\"local\">'Principles of damage control'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The damage control approach can be broken down into distinct phases of care (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F105402\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef105402 \">figure 1</a>). These include presurgery rapid transport and triage, damage control surgery, perioperative resuscitation, definitive repair of injuries temporized during damage control surgery, and delayed <span class=\"nowrap\">abdominal/chest</span> closure <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> coverage of soft tissue wounds. (See <a href=\"#H102173510\" class=\"local\">'Phases of care'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Initiating a damage control approach is based not only upon the type of traumatic injury but also includes the physiologic response to the injury. Although there are no absolute, evidence-based models that predict who would benefit most from damage control, in general damage control should be initiated in patients with multisystem trauma, or any injured patient at risk for or who manifests hypothermia, coagulopathy, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> metabolic acidosis. (See <a href=\"#H1488730\" class=\"local\">'Indications and presurgery damage control'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The goals of damage control surgery are to first arrest hemorrhage and then to limit contamination. This holds true regardless of the site of injury (ie, intra-abdominal, intrathoracic, intracranial, extremity). To control hemorrhage, nonessential bleeding vessels should be ligated, while essential bleeding vessels should be shunted or rapidly repaired. Leakage from injuries to the gastrointestinal tract, tracheobronchial tree, or urogenital tract are controlled (eg, closure, exteriorization), and the surrounding region should be irrigated. Temporary closure of the abdomen or chest promotes drainage of fluid and allows rapid return to access if needed. Preemptive extremity fasciotomy prevents the negative sequelae of extremity compartment syndrome. (See <a href=\"#H102173857\" class=\"local\">'Damage control surgery'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Perioperative resuscitation aims to achieve euvolemia, normalize tissue oxygen delivery, and resolve acidosis and coagulopathy by appropriate fluid therapy and transfusion (using near-equal amounts of packed red blood cells, plasma, and platelets), warming the patient and providing appropriate airway and ventilatory management. Damage control resuscitation principles should be applied throughout all phases of damage control. Any further testing or imaging that is needed to better define the full extent of injuries is also obtained. (See <a href=\"#H1488754\" class=\"local\">'Resuscitation'</a> above and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=coagulopathy-associated-with-trauma\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Coagulopathy associated with trauma&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=initial-management-of-trauma-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Initial management of trauma in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The timing of definitive repair of injuries temporized during damage control surgery is determined by the patient's physiologic status but typically starts 24 to 48 hours after the initial injury.
