Autologous HCT (auto-HCT) uses hematopoietic progenitor cells derived from the individual with the disorder and is used increasingly to treat a variety of hematologic neoplasms.</p><p>Eligibility for auto-HCT varies across countries and institutions. Ultimately, decisions regarding transplant eligibility should be made on a case by case basis based on a risk-benefit assessment, and the needs and wishes of the patient. This topic will discuss eligibility for auto-HCT. Eligibility for allogeneic HCT, the use of HCT in specific disease settings, and the short and long term complications of HCT are discussed separately.

While the initial studies that demonstrated a benefit from auto-HCT were performed in younger adults (&lt;65 years), subsequent studies suggest that the benefit from auto-HCT is also seen in older adults. In many European countries, auto-HCT is offered primarily to patients less than 65 years of age. In the United States, a strict age limit is not used. Instead, decisions are made on a case by case basis based upon &quot;physiologic age&quot; and vary across institutions.</p><p>The majority of data regarding the impact of age on outcomes following auto-HCT come from studies in patients with multiple myeloma. The following is a description of studies that have investigated the impact of age on outcomes after HCT for myeloma:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A large population-based study from Sweden demonstrated a benefit from using high dose <a href=\"topic.htm?path=melphalan-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">melphalan</a> plus auto-HCT in myeloma for patients as old as 80 years (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F70205\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef70205 \">figure 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/determining-eligibility-for-autologous-hematopoietic-cell-transplantation/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Improved rates of overall survival at one year were seen in patients of all age groups; however, a survival benefit at five years was only seen in patients younger than 70 years.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A retrospective study evaluated survival after auto-HCT in patients with myeloma over the age of 70 (mean age: 72, range: 70 to 83) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/determining-eligibility-for-autologous-hematopoietic-cell-transplantation/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. Complete remission (CR) was achieved in 20 and 27 percent after a single or tandem (double) auto-HCT, respectively, with median overall survivals of 13 and 33 months. Treatment-related mortality (TRM) was 16 percent in patients receiving 200 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/m<sup>2</sup></span> of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=melphalan-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">melphalan</a>, 2 percent in subsequent patients receiving 140 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/m<sup>2</sup>,</span> and 10 percent for those undergoing a tandem transplant.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A retrospective study of patients with myeloma undergoing tandem (double) auto-HCT compared 49 patients age 65 years or older with 49 younger patients matched for other known prognostic factors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/determining-eligibility-for-autologous-hematopoietic-cell-transplantation/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. Although the incidence of CR was lower in the older patients (20 versus 43 percent), age was not a predictor of worse outcomes; CR duration, event-free survival, and overall survival (OS) were comparable in the two groups. The prognosis was primarily determined by the presence of unfavorable cytogenetics (17p deletion, t(4;14), t(14;16), classical monosomy 13 or deletion 13q) and serum beta-2 microglobulin &gt;2.5 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/L</span>.

Although many patients in the older group received dose-reduced <a href=\"topic.htm?path=melphalan-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">melphalan</a> as the conditioning regimen, the toxicity of and outcomes with HCT appear similar to those for the younger group.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A report from the Center for International Blood and Marrow Transplant Research (CIBMTR) suggested that older patients who are selected to receive an auto-HCT have similar anti-myeloma benefits as younger patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/determining-eligibility-for-autologous-hematopoietic-cell-transplantation/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. At a median follow-up of three years, the median survival had not been reached in any cohort. Increasing age was associated with higher treatment-related mortality, while myeloma-specific deaths were similar in all age cohorts. These findings are consistent with an increase in non-myeloma deaths with increasing age. While not statistically significant, there was a trend towards decreased progression-free survival (PFS) at three years with increasing age: </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Ages 18 to 59 (n = 5818): PFS 42 percent</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Ages 60 to 69 (n = 4666): PFS 38 percent</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Ages &gt;70 (n = 946): PFS 22 percent</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Post-relapse survival also appeared worse for the older cohort.</p><p/><p>There are fewer studies reporting the outcomes of older adults undergoing auto-HCT for hematologic malignancies other than myeloma. </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A retrospective registry data study described the use of auto-HCT for the treatment of lymphoma in 21 patients with a median age of 71 years (range 69 to 86) and limited comorbidity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/determining-eligibility-for-autologous-hematopoietic-cell-transplantation/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. Overall, 76 percent achieved a complete response following auto-HCT. With median follow-up of 20 months, the median PFS and OS were 10 and 18 months, respectively. TRM in the first 100 days post-auto-HCT was 9 percent. This compares with an approximately 3 percent TRM rate reported from registry data in younger populations.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A retrospective analysis reported the outcomes of 75 older adults (&ge;65 years) that underwent auto-HCT with a BEAM conditioning regimen as treatment for aggressive or relapsed lymphoma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/determining-eligibility-for-autologous-hematopoietic-cell-transplantation/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. The median age was 67 years (range 65 to 74). The TRM at &lt;100 days was 2.7 percent. The two-year PFS and OS rates were 67 and 79 percent, respectively. &#160;</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A nationwide Japanese retrospective analysis identified 484 older adults (&ge;60 years) who underwent auto-HCT for <span class=\"nowrap\">relapsed/refractory</span> diffuse large B cell lymphoma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/determining-eligibility-for-autologous-hematopoietic-cell-transplantation/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. The median age was 64 years (range 60 to 78). Non-relapse mortality did not appear to differ between age groups (60 to 64, 65 to 69, and &ge;70 years). Among those &ge;70 years, estimated two-year survival was 46 percent.</p><p/><p>Thus, biologic age alone should not be the sole criteria used to determine eligibility for auto-HCT, but may indicate a need for dose adjustment of the conditioning regimen. It is important to consider how well the patient is expected to tolerate and benefit from the auto-HCT based on his or her overall clinical status and other comorbidities. (See <a href=\"#H24428775\" class=\"local\">'Determining eligibility for auto-HCT'</a> below.)</p><p>In the United States, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services reimburses for high-dose therapy with auto-HCT in patients who are less than 78 years old.

Although renal failure increases the morbidity and mortality of multiple myeloma, it appears to have no adverse effect on either the quality of stem cell collection or engraftment following auto-HCT [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/determining-eligibility-for-autologous-hematopoietic-cell-transplantation/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. As such, renal dysfunction is not a contraindication to auto-HCT in myeloma. In contrast, there are no published data of auto-HCT in patients with lymphoma who have moderate or significant renal dysfunction. This is largely because the preparative regimens historically used for auto-HCT in lymphoma cannot be administered to patients with a serum creatinine &gt;2 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> (177 <span class=\"nowrap\">micromol/L)</span>.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a study of patients with multiple myeloma and a serum creatinine &gt;2.0 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> undergoing auto-HCT, median overall survival for the entire group of 81 patients was &gt;53 months; there was a median survival of &gt;51 months for the 38 patients who were dialysis-dependent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/determining-eligibility-for-autologous-hematopoietic-cell-transplantation/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>].

Twenty-four percent of the patients became dialysis independent at a median of four months after auto-HCT (range 1 to 16 months). When compared with patients without these factors, the recovery of renal function was more likely in patients requiring dialysis prior to HCT for &lt;6 months (33 versus 6 percent) and a pre-HCT creatinine clearance &gt;10 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/min</span> (38 versus 11 percent). &#160;</p><p/><p>Of importance, the randomized trials that have shown benefit with auto-HCT in multiple myeloma compared with chemotherapy have mainly studied patients with serum creatinine &lt;2.0 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> (177 <span class=\"nowrap\">micromol/L)</span> or Cr CL &gt;50 to 60. Patients with renal failure must therefore be approached with caution.

Infectious and noninfectious pulmonary complications are common after auto-HCT, and approximately 3 percent of patients will have severe pulmonary complications requiring mechanical ventilation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/determining-eligibility-for-autologous-hematopoietic-cell-transplantation/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. Numerous studies have demonstrated that abnormal pre-transplant pulmonary function tests predict severe pulmonary complications and mortality after allogeneic HCT. While there are fewer data in the auto-HCT setting, it is assumed that pulmonary complications are more likely to be severe in patients with less pulmonary reserve. The degree of pulmonary dysfunction allowed depends largely upon the underlying disease and conditioning regimen. In general, patients with diffusion capacity of the lungs for carbon monoxide corrected for hemoglobin (corrected DLCO) &lt;50 percent are not routinely considered candidates for auto-HCT. Smokers should be advised to quit smoking during the pretransplant counseling sessions.</p><p>Typically, a corrected DLCO of 50 percent or greater is required for auto-HCT eligibility. This cutoff is largely based upon eligibility criteria for trials that have investigated the use of auto-HCT and cohort studies that have demonstrated a higher risk of developing respiratory failure and inferior survival among patients with abnormal pulmonary function tests prior to HCT [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/determining-eligibility-for-autologous-hematopoietic-cell-transplantation/abstract/15,16\" class=\"abstract_t\">15,16</a>].</p><p>It is unknown what the ideal DLCO cutoff value is and whether this criterion should be used by itself to exclude patients from auto-HCT [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/determining-eligibility-for-autologous-hematopoietic-cell-transplantation/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. Using DLCO alone as a criterion for HCT eligibility may exclude patients that might still benefit from the procedure. The cutoff values used depend at least partially upon the conditioning regimen. In lymphoma, a DLCO &ge;50 percent is required if using BEAM or a TBI-based regimen because of concerns about pulmonary toxicity from the conditioning regimen. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=preparative-regimens-for-hematopoietic-cell-transplantation\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Preparative regimens for hematopoietic cell transplantation&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3288623\"><span class=\"h2\">Cardiac disease</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>While life-threatening cardiac complications are uncommon following auto-HCT, the transplant procedure is associated with sub-acute cardiac injury even in patients with normal cardiac function pretransplant. This cardiac injury is assumed to be of greater impact in patients with less cardiac reserve. The degree of cardiac dysfunction allowed depends largely upon the underlying disease and conditioning regimen. In general, patients with a left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) &lt;40 percent or uncontrolled coronary artery disease or uncontrolled arrhythmias are not considered candidates for auto-HCT. Cardiac risk factors should be minimized in all patients prior to transplant (eg, smoking, obesity, hyperlipidemia, hypertension, hyperglycemia) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/determining-eligibility-for-autologous-hematopoietic-cell-transplantation/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>].</p><p>It is well established that patients with clinically apparent cardiac primary systemic amyloidosis have increased morbidity and mortality from auto-HCT resulting in reduced post-HCT survival when compared with those without cardiac involvement [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/determining-eligibility-for-autologous-hematopoietic-cell-transplantation/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. Based in part upon these observations, we recommend that patients with amyloid who have uncompensated heart failure or an LVEF &lt;40 percent should be excluded from auto-HCT.

Thirty-one percent of patients showed an absolute decrease in LVEF to &lt;50 or a &gt;10 percent decline.</p><p/><p>The cutoff values for cardiac dysfunction depend at least partially upon the conditioning regimen used. In lymphoma, most institutions require a LVEF &ge;40 percent if using the BEAM conditioning regimen and a LVEF &ge;50 percent using chemotherapy regimens with known cardiac toxicity (eg, cyclophosphamide-based regimens) or total body irradiation (TBI)-based conditioning regimens.

Causes include those seen in patients without malignancy (eg, hepatitis, alcohol abuse, hepatic steatosis) and iron overload due to a large number of previous transfusions. Patients with abnormal liver function tests should undergo a detailed workup for etiology, ideally in consultation with a hepatologist. Patients with frank cirrhosis of the liver are excluded from auto-HCT because of excessive mortality and morbidity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/determining-eligibility-for-autologous-hematopoietic-cell-transplantation/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H87611335\"><span class=\"h2\">Infectious disease status</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Screening for infectious diseases before auto-HCT is designed to prevent post-transplant infections by defining specific infection control policies and antimicrobial prophylaxis and therapy, which will be necessary after transplantation.

Patients with these infections need further evaluation regarding the status of the infection, ideally in consultation with an infectious disease expert. Patients with hepatitis B or hepatitis C are at increased risk of viral reactivation after transplant, even if the infection appears to be resolved. However, if patients have cirrhosis of the liver secondary to the hepatitis viral infection they are not eligible for transplant.

A plan must be in place to care for the patient's usual responsibilities and dependents during the prolonged hospital stay.</p><p>The patient's living situation must be taken into consideration. Patients are immunocompromised following auto-HCT and are therefore at increased risk for infectious complications, especially if exposed to large crowds. As such, patients who are homeless are unlikely to be able to get the needed care post-transplant. Similarly, transportation costs may become significant for patients who do not live near the transplant center. Some centers require that the patient provide or hire a full-time caregiver during the peri-transplant period and this may be cost prohibitive. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-infections-following-hematopoietic-cell-transplantation\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of infections following hematopoietic cell transplantation&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Although more pronounced in the allogeneic HCT setting, there are disparities in the use of auto-HCT among patients of different races with HCT rates being lower among Blacks when compared with Caucasians [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/determining-eligibility-for-autologous-hematopoietic-cell-transplantation/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. Factors that may contribute to this include health insurance coverage, educational status, and health literacy. Numerous studies have demonstrated no association between race and outcomes following auto-HCT [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/determining-eligibility-for-autologous-hematopoietic-cell-transplantation/abstract/25-29\" class=\"abstract_t\">25-29</a>]. As an example, registry data from patients with multiple myeloma demonstrated that, when compared with Caucasians, Blacks had similar rates of overall survival (52 versus 47 percent) and progression-free survival (19 versus 21 percent), cumulative incidence of disease progression (72 percent each), and non-relapse mortality (9 versus 8 percent) at five years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/determining-eligibility-for-autologous-hematopoietic-cell-transplantation/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>].</p><p>Virtually all patients undergoing auto-HCT require blood product support in the form of red blood cell and platelet transfusions until the transplanted cells engraft sufficiently to support hematopoiesis (usually 10 to 14 days).

Patients with obesity, anorexia, cachexia, or malnutrition should be evaluated by a dietician to maximize their nutritional status before and during the transplant procedure. Obesity should not exclude patients from undergoing auto-HCT. It is rare that malnourished patients are referred for transplant in the United States. </p><p>There have been a limited number of studies that have evaluated the impact of weight on patient outcomes in this setting. As examples:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A study of registry data from the American Society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation (ASBMT) evaluated the impact of weight on the outcomes of 1087 patients who were treated with high-dose <a href=\"topic.htm?path=melphalan-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">melphalan</a> followed by auto-HCT for multiple myeloma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/determining-eligibility-for-autologous-hematopoietic-cell-transplantation/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>].

The most commonly used scoring systems are the Hematopoietic Cell Transplantation Comorbidity Index (HCT-CI) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F59272\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef59272 \">table 3</a>), the Charlson Comorbidity Index (CCI), and the Pretransplant Assessment of Mortality (PAM) score. Such scoring systems may provide insight into the relative feasibility of autologous HCT (auto-HCT); however, it remains to be determined which comorbidity score is preferred, how much additional information they add over the more simple Karnofsky Performance Score (KPS) or Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) scores alone (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F57945\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef57945 \">table 1</a>), and how they may be best incorporated into the assessment of a patient considering auto-HCT. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=determining-eligibility-for-allogeneic-hematopoietic-cell-transplantation#H24292831\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Determining eligibility for allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation&quot;, section on 'Risk assessment scoring systems'</a>.) Also of note, all retrospective analysis is biased already by self-selection of transplant physicians who exclude patients from transplant based on poor performance status or significant co-morbidities.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A retrospective study of 126 patients undergoing auto-HCT for myeloma assigned scores based upon the CCI, HCT-CI, and a modified PAM score [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/determining-eligibility-for-autologous-hematopoietic-cell-transplantation/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>]. Pretransplant comorbidities according to CCI were present in none, one, or &ge;2 organ systems in 52, 17, and 31 percent of patients, respectively. The most common comorbidities were lung disease, liver abnormalities, and diabetes. An increased comorbidity score was associated with increased toxicity and a longer hospital stay, but no difference in mortality. The lack of an association with mortality may reflect selection bias (eg, physicians selecting fit patients for HCT) or the low overall mortality rate of auto-HCT for myeloma. Of the comorbidity indices, the CCI and HCT-CI appeared to be better predictors of toxicity than the modified PAM scoring system. &#160;</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A retrospective study from the Center for International Blood and Marrow Transplant Research (CIBMTR) of 1156 patients undergoing auto-HCT for multiple myeloma showed that higher HCT-CI scores were associated with dose reduction of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=melphalan-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">melphalan</a> conditioning and did not predict non-relapse mortality (NRM, 2 percent at one year; 95% CI 1-4 percent), but were associated with inferior overall survival [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/determining-eligibility-for-autologous-hematopoietic-cell-transplantation/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>]. However, KPS remained important for risk stratification, with KPS &lt;90 percent being associated with an increased risk of death (relative risk of death 1.6). The most common comorbidities included pulmonary disease, diabetes, psychiatric illness, cardiac disease, renal insufficiency, and prior solid tumors. Since auto-HCT is associated with a low NRM (eg, 5 percent at two years), it is not surprising that, even in a large cohort of patients, HCT-CI score did not show an impact on the risk of NRM.</p><p/><p>The comorbidity scores available currently are not practical enough to be applied routinely as predictors of outcomes following auto-HCT. In addition, they do not address the issue of long term toxicity on overall function and performance status, and there is very little known on the impact of degree of recovery after transplant-related toxicity on patients. Future studies should focus on the development of better defined, simpler toxicity criteria that allow more detailed assessment of relevant organ toxicity. An ideal comorbidity score would be simple to implement and reproducible both between physicians and between transplant centers. &#160;</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6573010\"><span class=\"h1\">RISK OF SECONDARY CANCERS POST-TRANSPLANT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Secondary malignancies (eg, solid tumors, acute leukemia, and myelodysplastic syndromes) are a potential long term complication following auto-HCT. The risk of developing a second malignancy should be considered when determining the feasibility of transplant, especially in the setting of early stage disease and when auto-HCT is not expected to cure the underlying disease. In particular, patients with myelodysplasia do not appear to benefit from auto-HCT because risk for developing secondary acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is too high. This is discussed in more detail separately.
