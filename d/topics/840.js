Anaphylaxis presents with the sudden onset of signs and symptoms, usually in more than one body system, within minutes to a few hours of exposure to a trigger [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anaphylaxis-confirming-the-diagnosis-and-determining-the-causes/abstract/1-5\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-5</a>]. It potentially involves more than 40 signs and symptoms (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F72225\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef72225 \">table 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anaphylaxis-confirming-the-diagnosis-and-determining-the-causes/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].

Each of these steps is discussed in detail in the sections that follow.</p><p>The diagnosis of anaphylaxis is confirmed if the nature and timing of the event are consistent with the known signs and symptoms and chronology of anaphylaxis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anaphylaxis-confirming-the-diagnosis-and-determining-the-causes/abstract/1-5\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-5</a>]. However, the diagnosis of anaphylaxis is not always easy to make, particularly if it is the initial episode. Because anaphylaxis is a potentially fatal medical emergency [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anaphylaxis-confirming-the-diagnosis-and-determining-the-causes/abstract/9,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,10</a>], even if the diagnosis is uncertain, the patient should be equipped to self-treat a potential recurrence, and if another episode occurs, the clinician should plan to re-evaluate the patient and ascertain if exposures common to both the episodes can be detected. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=long-term-management-of-patients-with-anaphylaxis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Long-term management of patients with anaphylaxis&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4433830\"><span class=\"h2\">History of exposures and activities</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The clinical history is supremely important in making the diagnosis of anaphylaxis, determining the cause(s), and assessing the patient for contributing factors that might increase the risk of severe or fatal anaphylaxis.</p><p>Each past episode of anaphylaxis should be carefully reviewed, starting with the 24-hour period before the onset of symptoms and paying particular attention to the one to two hours immediately preceding symptom onset.

Exercise can be the only trigger for an anaphylactic episode (exercise-induced anaphylaxis) or it may only induce symptoms when preceded by ingestion of food or medications, such as nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). Sometimes specific foods, such as shellfish, wheat, or celery, combined with exercise, will trigger symptoms (food-dependent, exercise-induced anaphylaxis), while in other cases, any food ingestion followed shortly by exercise can trigger an episode.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Uncommonly, allergen exposure can occur through kissing or intercourse [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anaphylaxis-confirming-the-diagnosis-and-determining-the-causes/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].

Sometimes patients draw their own conclusions about what the likely cause was and report this as an established allergy to future clinicians. It is important for health care professionals to ask patients with past anaphylaxis if the cause was verified by an allergist or proven in some other way, since the patient may be avoiding the wrong allergens and may be at risk for future recurrences.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4433865\"><span class=\"h2\">Sensitization to allergens</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In patients with anaphylaxis attributed to an IgE-mediated allergy, positive allergen skin tests <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> elevated allergen-specific IgE levels in serum confirm sensitization to the allergen(s) tested.

For reasons that are poorly understood, it is possible to have clinically irrelevant positive tests. For example, more than 25 percent of all adults in the general population have one or more positive skin test responses to stinging insect venoms, yet most of these individuals do not experience anaphylaxis after a sting. However, given a clinical history of a sting shortly before the onset of symptoms of anaphylaxis, any venom sensitization is considered relevant (ie, establishes IgE-mediated venom allergy as the cause of the event).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>False-negative tests are also possible.
