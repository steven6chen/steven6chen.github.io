Advances in the therapeutic management of PID, most notably immunoglobulin replacement therapy, have resulted in a longer life expectancy and duration of disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/malignancy-in-primary-immunodeficiency/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. As patients with PID live longer, malignancies are diagnosed more commonly. However, the cancer risk associated with PID is not well characterized in most studies due to various limitations, including small sample size (because of the rarity of PID), limited follow-up, lack of matched comparison groups, and the scarcity of population-based studies.</p><p>The Australasian Society of Clinical Immunology and Allergy (ASCIA) study was the first large study to calculate the standardized incidence ratio (SIR) of malignancy in PID patients, and it remains one of the largest studies performed to date [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/malignancy-in-primary-immunodeficiency/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. SIRs were significantly elevated for all cancers (combined SIR 1.60), cancer of the thymus gland (SIR 67.3), non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) (SIR 8.82), stomach cancer (SIR 6.10), and leukemia (SIR 5.36). &quot;All cancer&quot; and site-specific SIRs were not different for men and women, with the exception of thymoma, which was only identified in men [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/malignancy-in-primary-immunodeficiency/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. In a study of 745 patients with PID reported in the Netherlands between 2009 and 2012, almost 10 percent of the patients suffered from a malignancy.

These include impaired genetic stability, genetic predisposition, immune dysregulation, impaired clearance of oncogenic viruses, and iatrogenic causes.

AT is clinically characterized by recurrent infections due to defective cellular and humoral immune response, neurologic complications in the form of ataxia, and high susceptibility to malignancy, as well as increased radiosensitivity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/malignancy-in-primary-immunodeficiency/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. In a study of the French national registry of PID, among 279 patients with AT, 69 (24.5 percent) were diagnosed with cancer, with non-Hodgkin lymphoma, Hodgkin lymphoma, and T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia being the most common [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/malignancy-in-primary-immunodeficiency/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>].

The <em>NBS</em> gene directs the production of nibrin protein [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/malignancy-in-primary-immunodeficiency/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. Nibrin phosphorylation is promoted by ATM [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/malignancy-in-primary-immunodeficiency/abstract/28,29\" class=\"abstract_t\">28,29</a>]. Phosphorylated nibrin is considered a catalyst for phosphorylation of other molecules involved in the cell cycle, including checkpoint kinase 2 (CHK2), checkpoint kinase 1 (CHK1), and structural maintenance of chromosomes 1 (SMC1) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/malignancy-in-primary-immunodeficiency/abstract/30,31\" class=\"abstract_t\">30,31</a>]. Moreover, nibrin itself forms a complex with products of <em>MRE11</em> and <em>RAD50</em> genes, known as MRN complex (Mre11-Rad50-Nbs1 complex), which is an essential component of ATM-mediated response to DNA damage [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/malignancy-in-primary-immunodeficiency/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>]. Hence, the <em>NBS</em> gene has roles in both upstream and downstream of DNA damage response regulated by the <em>ATM</em> gene [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/malignancy-in-primary-immunodeficiency/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1067686893\"><span class=\"h3\">Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>WAS is a combined immunodeficiency with an X-linked pattern of inheritance caused by mutations in gene-encoding WAS protein (WASP), which acts as a key regulator of cell signaling and reorganization of cytoskeleton in hematopoietic cells [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/malignancy-in-primary-immunodeficiency/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>].

Although some authors have suggested that WASP may play a direct role in genomic stability, genetic instability is not considered to be the main reason for the development of malignancies in WAS patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/malignancy-in-primary-immunodeficiency/abstract/35,36\" class=\"abstract_t\">35,36</a>].

Another group also reported good tolerance and response to treatment among AT patients with NHL, Hodgkin lymphoma, and acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) who received standard chemotherapy regimen as the sole treatment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/malignancy-in-primary-immunodeficiency/abstract/102,104,105\" class=\"abstract_t\">102,104,105</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1067687335\"><span class=\"h2\">Radiotherapy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In patients with AT and NBS, radiotherapy should be limited to situations in which there is an absolute need for this treatment, and it should be administered at the lowest possible doses.</p><p>Radiotherapy and radiation-based diagnostic tests should be used very cautiously in patients with common variable immunodeficiency (CVID) due to reports of dose-dependent radiosensitivity of lymphocytes in vitro [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/malignancy-in-primary-immunodeficiency/abstract/58,106,107\" class=\"abstract_t\">58,106,107</a>].

However, evidence regarding the role of the permissive phase of infection as a predisposing factor to malignancy is needed. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-treatment-of-epstein-barr-virus-infection\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and treatment of Epstein-Barr virus infection&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1067687366\"><span class=\"h2\">Rituximab</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span><a href=\"topic.htm?path=rituximab-intravenous-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Rituximab</a> is an anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody which eliminates B cells and is used in the treatment of B cell lymphoma. EBV-induced malignant transformation among PID patients is considered to be the result of uncontrolled expansion of EBV-infected B cells and a probable subsequent proliferation and activation of T cells. Thus, it is possible that rituximab may reduce the risk of EBV-induced lymphoma by eliminating EBV-infected B cells.</p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=rituximab-intravenous-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Rituximab</a> has been used with apparent success in controlling acute EBV infection in a small number of patients with X-linked lymphoproliferative (XLP) disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/malignancy-in-primary-immunodeficiency/abstract/108\" class=\"abstract_t\">108</a>]. In these patients, the number of B cells dropped to about 1 percent or less of the total number of circulating lymphocytes and leukocyte-associated EBV DNA in patients' peripheral blood declined to the limits below the detection limit. The use of rituximab in XLP is described elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=x-linked-lymphoproliferative-disease#H18\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;X-linked lymphoproliferative disease&quot;, section on 'Treatment of disease manifestations'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1067687372\"><span class=\"h2\">Stem cell transplantation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>HCT is the only curative therapy available for a number of PID disorders associated with higher malignancy rates, including severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID), X-linked lymphoproliferative syndrome (XLP), Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome (WAS), X-linked hyperimmunoglobulin M syndrome, and dedicator of cytokinesis 8 (DOCK8) deficiency [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/malignancy-in-primary-immunodeficiency/abstract/109\" class=\"abstract_t\">109</a>]. However, even after HCT, some patients may remain at increased risk for malignancies. As an example, patients with DOCK8 deficiency remain predisposed to cancers because DOCK8 may play a tumor suppression role in nonhematopoietic tissues [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/malignancy-in-primary-immunodeficiency/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hematopoietic-cell-transplantation-for-primary-immunodeficiency\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Hematopoietic cell transplantation for primary immunodeficiency&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H956854488\"><span class=\"h1\">SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The overall risk for developing cancer in patients with primary immunodeficiency (PID) is estimated to range from 4 to 25 percent. Advances in the treatment of PID have resulted in longer life expectancies for these patients and corresponding increases in diagnosed malignancies. The most common types of cancer in patients with PID are non-Hodgkin and Hodgkin lymphoma, which together account for approximately 60 percent of malignancy cases. Patients with PID develop lymphomas at somewhat younger ages compared with immunocompetent populations. The PIDs with the highest incidences of cancers are ataxia-telangiectasia (AT) and common variable immunodeficiency (CVID). (See <a href=\"#H1067686851\" class=\"local\">'Epidemiology and prevalence of cancer in PID'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Several mechanisms have been suggested to contribute to the high susceptibility of distinct groups of PID patients to specific types of malignancies. These include impaired genetic stability, genetic predisposition, immune dysregulation, impaired clearance of oncogenic viruses, and iatrogenic interventions (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F96198\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef96198 \">table 1</a>). (See <a href=\"#H1067686863\" class=\"local\">'Mechanisms of increased susceptibility to malignancy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Cancers of all types in patients with PID are more likely to disseminate or be widespread at the time of diagnosis. Non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) in patients with PID tend to be of B cell origin, high histologic grades, be associated with Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) infection, and involve extranodal tissues, especially the gastrointestinal tract and central nervous system. (See <a href=\"#H956855603\" class=\"local\">'Features of malignancies in PID'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients with PID should undergo all age-appropriate cancer screening procedures periodically, as indicated for immunocompetent individuals. In addition to general measures to avoid developing cancer (eg, avoidance of sexually-transmitted diseases, excessive alcohol, obesity, etc), patients should be educated about the signs and symptoms of the specific types of cancer associated with their PID, especially lymphoma. In cultures in which consanguinity is widespread, families with a member with PID should be counseled to avoid marriages between relatives. (See <a href=\"#H1067687273\" class=\"local\">'Monitoring for malignancy'</a> above and <a href=\"#H693552214\" class=\"local\">'Patient education'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Malignant cells in PID patients do not show an increased resistance to the standard therapeutic protocols. However, patients with PID are more likely to develop widespread cancer requiring more aggressive therapy, and the adverse effects of these treatments, such as infections and end-organ damage, are often poorly tolerated. Therefore, treatments should be chosen with the patient's underlying susceptibilities in mind, and less toxic therapies preferred whenever possible. (See <a href=\"#H1067687323\" class=\"local\">'Treatment considerations'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H191867741\"><span class=\"h1\">ACKNOWLEDGMENTS</span></p><p>The editorial staff at UpToDate would like to acknowledge Babak Mirminachi, MD, MPH, who contributed as an author to an earlier version of this topic review.</p><p>The editorial staff at UpToDate would like to acknowledge E Richard Stiehm, MD, who contributed as a Section Editor to an earlier version of this topic review.</p></div><div id=\"topicAgreement\">Use of UpToDate is subject to the <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/legal/license\" class=\"licenseLink\" id=\"sla_in_page\">Subscription and License Agreement</a>.</div><div id=\"references\" class=\"headingAnchor\"><h1>REFERENCES</h1><ol id=\"reference\"><li><a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/malignancy-in-primary-immunodeficiency/abstract/1\" class=\"nounderline abstract_t\">Mueller BU, Pizzo PA.
