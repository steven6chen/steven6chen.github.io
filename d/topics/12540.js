As survival rates of patients with cancer have improved over the past few decades, an increasing number of cancer survivors have or will develop kidney disease associated with malignancy or its treatment. A variety of renal complications can occur among cancer patients, including acute kidney injury (AKI), chronic kidney disease (CKD), proteinuria and nephrotic syndrome, and electrolyte disorders.</p><p>This topic will provide an overview of the major kidney complications that affect patients with cancer. Kidney disease in patients with multiple myeloma or other monoclonal gammopathies, kidney disease among cancer patients who have undergone hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT), and the nephrotoxicity of specific chemotherapeutic agents are discussed elsewhere.

In a Danish population-based study that followed 37,267 incident cancer patients from 1999 to 2006, the one- and five-year risks of AKI, as defined by a &gt;50 percent increase in serum creatinine compared with a baseline serum creatinine measured within one year of cancer diagnosis, were 17.5 and 27 percent, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-kidney-disease-in-the-cancer-patient/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].

In one study of 288 cancer patients admitted to a cancer intensive care unit in Brazil, mortality among patients with RIFLE Risk, Injury, and Failure stages of AKI was 49, 62, and 87 percent, respectively, compared with 14 percent among those without AKI [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-kidney-disease-in-the-cancer-patient/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].</p><p>Overall severity of illness, age, and functional status are likely to contribute to the prognosis in these patients, and the presence of cancer should not be considered an absolute exclusion criterion for RRT.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H265816610\"><span class=\"h2\">CKD in cancer patients</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is also a common complication of cancer and its therapy. This may be related in part to the high prevalence of preexisting CKD in patients with various types of malignancy. Two large observational studies, each involving nearly 5000 cancer patients, found that approximately 50 percent of patients with an active malignancy had an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) of &lt;90 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/min/1</span>.73 m<sup>2</sup> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-kidney-disease-in-the-cancer-patient/abstract/12,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,13</a>]. The prevalence of stage 3 and 4 CKD among these patients was 12 and less than 1 percent, respectively. In a prospective study of 4077 patients with various cancers, 30 percent had an eGFR of &lt;60 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/min/1</span>.73 m<sup>2</sup>, and 8.3 percent had an eGFR of 45 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/min/1</span>.73 m<sup>2</sup> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-kidney-disease-in-the-cancer-patient/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>].

However, the risk may vary by cancer type, and some studies have found no differences in mortality between cancer patients with and without CKD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-kidney-disease-in-the-cancer-patient/abstract/14-17\" class=\"abstract_t\">14-17</a>].</p><p>The relationship between CKD and cancer appears to be reciprocal since both CKD and end-stage renal disease (ESRD) appear to be risk factors for the development of a number of malignancies. A retrospective study of more than 1 million adults assessed the association between severity of kidney disease and the risk of incident cancer [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-kidney-disease-in-the-cancer-patient/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. Lower eGFR was associated with an increased risk of renal cancer (adjusted hazard ratio [HR] 2.3, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.8-2.9 for an eGFR of &lt;30 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/min/1</span>.73 m<sup>2</sup>) and urothelial cancer but not other cancers.

AKI due to TLS results from the formation of crystals composed of uric acid, calcium phosphate, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> xanthine, which can cause intratubular obstruction, inflammation, and a reduction in glomerular filtration rate (GFR).

The assessment of kidney function among cancer patients is similar to that in patients without cancer.

In general, the same etiologies of AKI that occur in the general population can affect cancer patients; however, certain causes of AKI are specific to the cancer patient population. AKI in cancer patients can be divided into prerenal, intrinsic renal, or postrenal causes.

Kidney insults directly related to cancer or its therapy include prior episodes of AKI, nephrotoxic anticancer agents, a reduction in renal mass following nephrectomy for renal cell (RCC) or urothelial cancers, chronic obstructive nephropathy, and kidney irradiation.

Proteinuria and nephrotic syndrome may be the presenting features of disorders associated with monoclonal gammopathies, including amyloidosis and monoclonal immunoglobulin deposition disease (MIDD). Chemotherapy-associated glomerular diseases may present at various times during treatment, and therefore, patients receiving these drugs should be monitored for the development of proteinuria <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> renal impairment.
