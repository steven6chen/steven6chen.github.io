The more common and least severe forms consist of isolated vertebral bony defects. However, the vertebral defects may occur in association with other more severe anomalies of the spinal cord and sacral structures, such as split spinal cord malformation or various cavitary defects of the spinal cord.</p><p/><p>The clinical manifestations of closed (occult) spinal dysraphism (CSD) vary widely and range from benign or asymptomatic to severe neurologic, genitourinary, gastrointestinal, or musculoskeletal anomalies. The clinical presentation, evaluation, and management of these disorders are discussed in a separate topic review.

The incidence varies substantially across populations, in patterns that follow nutritional, geographic, and ethnic factors.

Risk factors have been identified for specific types of dysraphic lesions:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><a href=\"topic.htm?path=folic-acid-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Folic acid</a> deficiency (whether caused by dietary deficiency, folic acid antagonists, or genetic abnormalities of folate metabolism), has been clearly associated with open spinal dysraphism (myelomeningocele), and the benefit of folic acid supplementation has been established [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/closed-spinal-dysraphism-pathogenesis-and-types/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. However, no studies have specifically addressed whether there is a relationship between folic acid deficiency and closed spinal dysraphism [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/closed-spinal-dysraphism-pathogenesis-and-types/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=folic-acid-supplementation-in-pregnancy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Folic acid supplementation in pregnancy&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Maternal diabetes has been associated with increased incidence of the syndrome of caudal regression, but the exact mechanism remains unclear [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/closed-spinal-dysraphism-pathogenesis-and-types/abstract/5,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,6</a>]. The incidence of caudal regression syndrome in the infants of diabetic mothers is 1 to 2 per thousand, whereas its incidence in the general population is 0.05 to 0.1 per thousand [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/closed-spinal-dysraphism-pathogenesis-and-types/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].

As an example, maternal exposure to <a href=\"topic.htm?path=valproate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">valproate</a> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=carbamazepine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">carbamazepine</a> has been associated with spinal dysraphism in their offspring, both in humans and rodent models [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/closed-spinal-dysraphism-pathogenesis-and-types/abstract/8-10\" class=\"abstract_t\">8-10</a>]. The human studies generally focused on open rather than closed spinal dysraphism. The effects of these anticonvulsant drugs may be mediated through alterations in <a href=\"topic.htm?path=folic-acid-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">folic acid</a> metabolism.

The embryology of neural tube development helps to explain many of the clinical findings, although the exact mechanisms underlying the development of many of these defects are not fully understood.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H19221931\"><span class=\"h2\">Notochord development</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The initial phase of development of the human nervous system starts with the formation of the notochord on day 17 of gestation. The notochord then secretes signaling molecules, such as the Sonic Hedgehog (Shh) protein, which induce the overlying ectoderm to differentiate into neuroectoderm (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F72061\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef72061 \">figure 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/closed-spinal-dysraphism-pathogenesis-and-types/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. The neuroectoderm produces precursor cells of all neural structures in the developing embryo, while the notochord itself becomes the axis of the developing vertebral column and also contributes to the formation of the nucleus pulposus of the intervertebral disc [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/closed-spinal-dysraphism-pathogenesis-and-types/abstract/7,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,12</a>]. </p><p>The endodermally-derived yolk sac is initially connected with the ectodermally-derived amnion through a primitive neurenteric canal (PNC). The PNC exists only temporarily and normally disappears to allow continued normal embryonic development. However, some inciting event may lead to persistence of adhesions between the endoderm and ectoderm, known as the accessory neurenteric canal (ANC) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/closed-spinal-dysraphism-pathogenesis-and-types/abstract/13,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,14</a>]. Depending on which part of the ANC fails to regress, several different clinical anomalies may result, including anomalous development of the vertebrae and spinal cord, anomalies of the gastrointestinal tract such as malrotation and neuroenteric fistula, and genitourinary malformations. The spinal dysraphic lesions include: split notochord syndrome, neurenteric cysts, dorsal dermal sinus tracts and cysts, sacral meningeal cysts, and certain types of split spinal cord syndrome. (See <a href=\"#H19221435\" class=\"local\">'Anomalies of notochord development'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H19221938\"><span class=\"h2\">Primary neurulation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Primary neurulation is the process of forming a tube from the neuroectodermal tissue (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F72061\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef72061 \">figure 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/closed-spinal-dysraphism-pathogenesis-and-types/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. The neuroectoderm begins as a flat neural plate, which invaginates as its lateral ends elevate and come together to fuse to form the primary neural tube (PNT). </p><p>Fusion starts on day 21 of gestation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/closed-spinal-dysraphism-pathogenesis-and-types/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. The fusion begins in the middle of the neural plate and then proceeds both rostrally and caudally to form the PNT. The PNT initially has openings at both ends, known as the anterior (cranial) and posterior (caudal) neuropores. The anterior neuropore closes first at around 25 days GA, followed by the posterior neuropore at around 27 days GA (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F81711\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef81711 \">figure 2</a>). </p><p>As the neural tube is closing, mesenchymal cells migrate between and separate the developing neural tube from the overlying ectoderm. These mesenchymal cells will form the meninges, neural arches of the vertebrae, paraspinal muscles, and dermis. In addition some cells detach themselves from the closing edges of the neural plate and form the neural crest cells, which have pluripotent potential [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/closed-spinal-dysraphism-pathogenesis-and-types/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. As the posterior neuropore closes, the process of primary neurulation is completed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/closed-spinal-dysraphism-pathogenesis-and-types/abstract/2,16\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,16</a>].</p><p>Failure of the caudal neuropore to close causes spina bifida (myelomeningocele) and spina bifida occulta, the most common neural tube defects. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pathophysiology-and-clinical-manifestations-of-myelomeningocele-spina-bifida\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pathophysiology and clinical manifestations of myelomeningocele (spina bifida)&quot;</a> and <a href=\"#H19221504\" class=\"local\">'Abnormalities of primary neurulation'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H19221945\"><span class=\"h2\">Secondary neurulation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The process of secondary neurulation begins by addition of a terminal segment to the caudal end of the PNT. The two segments join at approximately the level of future sacral segment 2 (S2) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/closed-spinal-dysraphism-pathogenesis-and-types/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. The terminal segment derives from the caudal cell mass (or tail bud), which is a collection of undifferentiated mesodermal cells from which arise the caudal ends of the spinal cord, notochord and GI tract, the caudal somites, the caudal neural crest cells derivatives, and the blood vessels supplying all these structures [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/closed-spinal-dysraphism-pathogenesis-and-types/abstract/2,16\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,16</a>].</p><p>The cavity of the SNT forms through two different processes. At the junction of the PNT and SNT, the cavity of the PNT grows into the SNT. However, more distally, multiple small cavities form within the SNT independently and coalesce together and with the growing PNT cavity, to form a continuous cavity that spans both the PNT and the SNT [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/closed-spinal-dysraphism-pathogenesis-and-types/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p>While the structures of the caudal SNT are undergoing apoptosis to form the cavity within the SNT, a thin fibrous layer remains connected to the PNT. This is a continuation of the pia mater and dura mater, known as the filum terminale [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/closed-spinal-dysraphism-pathogenesis-and-types/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. The most caudal end of the spinal cord, to which the filum terminale is attached, becomes known as the conus medullaris, and its cavity becomes known as the ventriculus terminale [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/closed-spinal-dysraphism-pathogenesis-and-types/abstract/2,16\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,16</a>]. The ventriculus terminale usually regress by term, but may occasionally persist, asymptomatically into adulthood [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/closed-spinal-dysraphism-pathogenesis-and-types/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>].</p><p>Disruption of secondary neurulation leads to spinal cord anomalies that are covered by skin; they include tethered cord syndrome, terminal diplomyelia, sacrococcygeal teratomas, and sacral agenesis. (See <a href=\"#H19221527\" class=\"local\">'Anomalies of the caudal cell mass and secondary neurulation'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3635113957\"><span class=\"h2\">Junctional neurulation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Junctional neurulation refers to the sequence of events surrounding the time of caudal neuropore closure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/closed-spinal-dysraphism-pathogenesis-and-types/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. The process involves two cell populations: Sox-2 positive cells distributed as lateral stripes in continuity with the PNT and Sox-2 negative cells along the midline in continuity with the primitive streak. As neurulation proceeds, the former cell population undergoes dorsal folding and midline fusion identical to the PNT. It fuses with the caudal end of the PNT and becomes an indistinguishable part of the PNT. The latter cell population undergoes epithelial-mesenchyme transition and moves caudally, fusing with the SNT and becoming an indistinguishable part of the SNT. In normal development, these two cell populations remain continuous with each other throughout this process, leading to intact continuity of the spinal cord.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H19222092\"><span class=\"h2\">Molecular mechanisms</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>While the basic structure of the spinal cord is developing through primary neurulation, the developing cord is actively undergoing ventrodorsal and rostrocaudal differentiation, guided by chemical gradients of different signaling molecules secreted by the surrounding structures. These signaling molecules control the expression of transcription factors by the developing neural cells:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Fibroblast Growth Factor (FGF) is secreted by the paraxial mesoderm in a decreasing caudorostral gradient. FGF maintains immaturity of the neural progenitor cells in the caudal area, allowing continued growth of the caudal spinal cord, while the decreasing FGF gradient in the rostral direction allows maturation of the spinal cord in a rostrocaudal sequence. This is done through differential promotion and inhibition of the expression of genes of the homeobox family (eg, Sax1), paired box family (eg, Pax6), Iroquois family (eg, Irx3) and other proneural genes (eg, Cash4).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Sonic hedgehog (Shh) and retinoic acid (RA) oppose the action of FGF and promote the rostrocaudal maturation of the spinal cord. In addition, they promote the dorsoventral differentiation of the developing spinal cord, through opposite decreasing (RA) and increasing (Shh) dorsoventral gradients. The dorsal spinal cord differentiates into the alar plate under the influence of RA, while the ventral spinal cord differentiates into the basal or motor plate under the influence of SHH. This is done through the regulation of expression of yet another set of transcription factor genes belonging to the homeodomain family (such as Nkx2 and Nkx6), which are upregulated by SHH [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/closed-spinal-dysraphism-pathogenesis-and-types/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Spatial and temporal differences in the expression of the homeobox genes are central to the process of secondary neurulation. These genes regulate the growth of the SNT, the apoptotic activity that leads to cavitation and elongation of the neural tube cavity across the PNT and SNT, and the development and then regression of the fetal tail.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><em>Prickle-1 </em>protein, a core protein of planar cell polarity pathway, has been demonstrated to play a critical role in junctional neurulation during transition from primary to secondary neurulation. Interference with its expression leads to incomplete closure of the PNT and disorganized formation of the caudal cell mass [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/closed-spinal-dysraphism-pathogenesis-and-types/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>].</p><p/><p>Given the delicate interplay of molecular gradients that control the growth and differentiation of the spinal cord, it is easy to understand how minor disturbances in the microenvironment of the developing nervous system can result in congenital anomalies of varying severity.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H19221442\"><span class=\"h1\">PATHOGENESIS OF CLOSED SPINAL DYSRAPHIC ANOMALIES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The spinal dysraphic anomalies can be classified into three groups, based on the developmental stage at which they are thought to arise. Although these anomalies are discussed separately, more than one dysraphic state commonly coexists in the same patient [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/closed-spinal-dysraphism-pathogenesis-and-types/abstract/14,19\" class=\"abstract_t\">14,19</a>].</p><p>The pathophysiologic explanations for these anomalies are not well established. Theories that attribute an anomaly to disruption in a specific stage of nervous system development are challenged by observations of some patients with two or more dysraphic anomalies that are thought to originate at different stages of nervous system development [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/closed-spinal-dysraphism-pathogenesis-and-types/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. It is possible that such anomalies coexist because a disruption at one stage of neural development also disrupts later stages of development. Alternatively, the anomalies may have a common genetic or environmental trigger. However, it is possible that the proposed pathophysiology does not apply to humans because they are largely based on studies of mammal and non-mammal vertebrates, especially mice and chick embryos. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H19221435\"><span class=\"h1\">ANOMALIES OF NOTOCHORD DEVELOPMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Each of the anomalies in this category are thought to be caused by persistence of the accessory neurenteric canal (ANC) connecting the endoderm and ectoderm during development of the notochord. Depending on whether and which part of the ANC is resorbed, several different clinical anomalies may result, including anomalous development of the vertebrae and spinal cord, anomalies of the gastrointestinal tract such as malrotation and neuroenteric fistula, and genitourinary malformations:</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12518966\"><span class=\"h2\">Persistence of the anterior part of the ANC</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10600692\"><span class=\"h3\">Neurenteric cysts</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Neurenteric cysts result from persistence of the anterior part of the ANC, with resorption of its dorsal part [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/closed-spinal-dysraphism-pathogenesis-and-types/abstract/14,21\" class=\"abstract_t\">14,21</a>]. As expected, these malformations are usually associated with a split notochord [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/closed-spinal-dysraphism-pathogenesis-and-types/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. The persistence of such a cyst with its connection to the intestines may lead to intestinal anomalies such as malrotation or even duplication [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/closed-spinal-dysraphism-pathogenesis-and-types/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12518982\"><span class=\"h2\">Persistence of the intermediate part of the ANC</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12518957\"><span class=\"h3\">Split notochord syndrome</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The split notochord syndrome results from persistence of the intermediate part of the ANC, which forces the notochord to follow an abnormal development pattern around the adhesion, resulting in a split notochord [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/closed-spinal-dysraphism-pathogenesis-and-types/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. This may lead to anomalous development of the spinal cord and surrounding mesoderm, with extensive defects and an open dysraphic state [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/closed-spinal-dysraphism-pathogenesis-and-types/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>], and abnormal vertebral bodies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/closed-spinal-dysraphism-pathogenesis-and-types/abstract/14,23\" class=\"abstract_t\">14,23</a>]. </p><p>The vertebral defects associated with split notochord syndrome range in severity from a mere vertebral cleft or bifid vertebrae (which when it affects the posterior vertebral element is referred to as spina bifida occulta), to hemivertebrae, block or fused vertebrae (such as in the Klippel-Feil anomaly), hypertrophic or hyperplastic vertebrae and butterfly vertebrae, to absent vertebrae, and in the most severe form may also lead to partial or total sacral agenesis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/closed-spinal-dysraphism-pathogenesis-and-types/abstract/4,7,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,7,14</a>].</p><p>Total sacral agenesis is usually associated with extensive defects in all structures that arise from the caudal cell mass, and is known as the caudal regression syndrome.

Terms used in the past literature include diastematomyelia, diplomyelia, pseudodiplomyelia and dimyelia; these terms were used inconsistently and at times interchangeably. SSCM is thought to arise when the persistent intermediate part of the ANC causes the neural placode to split and not just the notochord. SSCM may present at any age, and is 1.3 to 6 times more frequent in women as compared to men.</p><p>SSCM is divided into two types. The percentage of type I SSCM reported in the literature is highly variable, ranging from 30 to 80 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/closed-spinal-dysraphism-pathogenesis-and-types/abstract/14,24\" class=\"abstract_t\">14,24</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In type I, previously called diastematomyelia, each hemicord has a full thecal sac and meningeal covering, and they are separated by a bony spur, forming a double spinal canal. This is thought to occur when there are precursor meningeal cells in the ANC around which the spinal cord splits. These meningeal cells contribute to the formation of the medial aspect of the thecal sac around the two developing hemicords, while the lateral aspect of the sac develops normally around the two hemicords. The ANC persists and forms the bony ridge between the two thecal sacs. The bony spur between the hemicords may be perfectly median, dividing the cord into two symmetric hemicords, or it may be asymmetric, dividing it into a larger functional cord, and a smaller non-functional one. An asymmetric spur has been reported in 10 to 50 percent of SSCM I cases in the literature. The hemicords usually join below the level of the spur, but this is not always the case.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In type II SSCM, often called diplomyelia in older terminology, the two hemicords are surrounded by one thecal sac and there is a single spinal canal. The hemicords are generally symmetrical and may be separated by a fibrous band which is the length of one or two vertebral segments. This pattern is thought to occur when no meningeal precursor cells are incorporated in the ANC. In this case, the ANC tends to disappear completely, or persists only as the fibrous tract between the hemicords. </p><p/><p>A different embryological theory has been proposed to explain a terminal SSCM type II anomaly (or terminal diplomyelia); this anomaly is thought to be caused by abnormal secondary neurulation, and is discussed separately. (See <a href=\"#H19221543\" class=\"local\">'Terminal diplomyelia'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12519286\"><span class=\"h3\">Sacral meningeal cysts, meningoceles, and myelocystoceles</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Sacral cysts are thought to arise when the ANC partially resorbs both ventrally and dorsally, leaving only a cyst-like structure, with no connection to the intestines or skin. This cyst-like structure is incorporated in the mesenchyma destined to form the sacrum, forming a sacral cyst [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/closed-spinal-dysraphism-pathogenesis-and-types/abstract/14,21\" class=\"abstract_t\">14,21</a>]. The spinal meninges with or without the terminal spinal cord can then herniate into this defect, forming a sacral meningocele [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/closed-spinal-dysraphism-pathogenesis-and-types/abstract/21,25\" class=\"abstract_t\">21,25</a>].</p><p>Sacral meningeal cysts usually communicate freely with the subarachnoid space and are known as perineural or Tarlov cysts [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/closed-spinal-dysraphism-pathogenesis-and-types/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].

Spinal cord compression also may be caused by inclusion masses, which are associated with dorsal dermal sinuses in 35 to 55 percent of cases. These masses usually are dermoid, epidermoid, or teratoid tumors. The neurological deficit can also be due to infection, such as an epidural abscess compressing the cord. Of note, the tract of the dorsal dermal sinus may terminate anywhere from outside the vertebral column, to the extradural, subdural, and subarachnoid spaces, or even on the nerve roots, filum or cord itself. Therefore, probing of the sinus or a fistulogram should never be performed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/closed-spinal-dysraphism-pathogenesis-and-types/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H19221504\"><span class=\"h1\">ABNORMALITIES OF PRIMARY NEURULATION</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H19221496\"><span class=\"h2\">Syringohydromyelia</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Two forms of syringohydromyelia are defined.

However, because these terms are also used to refer to the many different types of spinal dysraphic anomalies described in this topic review, we prefer to describe these more specifically as &quot;vertebral defects&quot; or &quot;defects in the posterior vertebral arches.&quot;</p><p>Radiographic findings in addition to the defect in the posterior vertebral arches may include widening of the spinal canal, fusion of the vertebral bodies, and fused or malformed laminae. Minor abnormalities of the overlying skin are common, including nevi, dermal sinus or dimple, hemangioma, underlying lipoma, or a hirsute area (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F76756\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef76756 \">table 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/closed-spinal-dysraphism-pathogenesis-and-types/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>] (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=assessment-of-the-newborn-infant#H180221208\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Assessment of the newborn infant&quot;, section on 'Sacral dimple'</a>). When this finding occurs in isolation, it is usually incidental and clinically asymptomatic. If the vertebral defect is associated with pain or neurologic deficits, this usually indicates that there is an associated spinal cord anomaly, such as a cyst or tethered cord. The diagnosis and management of these issues are discussed elsewhere.

Therefore, an incompletely ossified neural arch in a child younger than three years of age should not be mistaken for spina bifida occulta [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/closed-spinal-dysraphism-pathogenesis-and-types/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]. In addition, an incompletely ossified dorsal neural arch is a normal variant seen in 20 to 30 percent of healthy individuals [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/closed-spinal-dysraphism-pathogenesis-and-types/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].

When TCS occurs independently, it is usually due to anomalous regression of the human tail, part of the normal involution of the caudal cell mass [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/closed-spinal-dysraphism-pathogenesis-and-types/abstract/4,39\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,39</a>].</p><p>The filum terminale is normally viscoelastic in nature, and serves to dampen movements of the spine during flexion and extension, without applying undue traction to the moving spinal cord [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/closed-spinal-dysraphism-pathogenesis-and-types/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>]. In TCS, the spinal cord is attached to abnormally inelastic structures caudally, such as a fibrous or fat-infiltrated filum, tumor, meningoceles or myelomeningoceles, scars, or septa (as seen in SSCM). This causes the caudal portion of the spinal cord to stretch between the point of tethering and the dentate ligaments that fix the cord proximally [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/closed-spinal-dysraphism-pathogenesis-and-types/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>]. Progressive dysfunction occurs because of repeated extension or flexion of the spine.

The severity of the biochemical and electrophysiological abnormalities is found to be proportionate to the degree of stretching in animal models, and proportionate to the severity of the clinical symptoms in humans. In the long term, the stretching of the spinal cord leads to neuronal degeneration and regeneration, and the neurological deficits may become irreversible [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/closed-spinal-dysraphism-pathogenesis-and-types/abstract/40,42\" class=\"abstract_t\">40,42</a>].</p><p>In toddlers and children, tethered cord syndrome typically presents with progressive motor and sensory dysfunction, which may include gait abnormalities and loss of bladder control [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/closed-spinal-dysraphism-pathogenesis-and-types/abstract/43\" class=\"abstract_t\">43</a>].

However, the vertebral defects may occur in association with other more severe anomalies of the spinal cord and sacral structures, such as split spinal cord malformation or various cavitary defects of the spinal cord.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients with closed spinal dysraphism often have minor abnormalities of the overlying skin, including nevus, dermal sinus or dimple, an underlying lipoma, or a hirsute area. This finding may be incidental and clinically asymptomatic or may be associated with pain or neurologic deficits, in which case it is likely to be associated with an additional spinal cord anomaly, such as cysts or a tethered cord. (See <a href=\"#H19221511\" class=\"local\">'Isolated vertebral defects'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Tethered cord syndrome (TCS) is stretch-induced dysfunction of the caudal spinal cord and conus, caused by attachment of the filum terminale to inelastic structures caudally. TCS may occur in isolation, or in association with other dysraphic lesions. Symptoms of tethered cord syndrome may include progressive motor and sensory dysfunction, sphincteric dysfunction, pain in the lumbosacral region, perineum and legs, or progressive scoliosis. (See <a href=\"#H19221535\" class=\"local\">'Tethered cord syndrome'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Split spinal cord malformation (SSCM) describes anomalies where there is splitting or duplication of the spinal cord. In type I SSCM, each hemicord has a full thecal sac and meningeal covering, and they are separated by a bony spur, forming a double spinal canal. In type II SSCM, the two hemicords are surrounded by one thecal sac and there is a single spinal canal. (See <a href=\"#H10600759\" class=\"local\">'Split spinal cord malformation'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Terminal diplomyelia refers to duplication or splitting of the terminal spinal cord. This anomaly is not always symptomatic, and may be incidentally seen in otherwise healthy children. (See <a href=\"#H19221543\" class=\"local\">'Terminal diplomyelia'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Caudal regression syndrome consists of a spectrum of structural defects of the caudal region, including incomplete development of the sacrum and sometimes of the lumbar vertebrae. An increased frequency of caudal regression has been noted in infants of diabetic mothers. Genetic contributors also seem likely, as suggested by the association of caudal regression with several genetic syndromes. (See <a href=\"#H19221559\" class=\"local\">'Caudal regression or sacral agenesis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The evaluation and management of a patient with suspected closed spinal dysraphism is discussed in a separate topic review. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=closed-spinal-dysraphism-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-management\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Closed spinal dysraphism: Clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and management&quot;</a>.) </p><p/></div><div id=\"topicAgreement\">Use of UpToDate is subject to the <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/legal/license\" class=\"licenseLink\" id=\"sla_in_page\">Subscription and License Agreement</a>.</div><div id=\"references\" class=\"headingAnchor\"><h1>REFERENCES</h1><ol id=\"reference\"><li><a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/closed-spinal-dysraphism-pathogenesis-and-types/abstract/1\" class=\"nounderline abstract_t\">Dias M, Partington M, SECTION ON NEUROLOGIC SURGERY.
