Important determinants of progression include the severity of histologic disease and the absolute amount of proteinuria [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dialysis-in-diabetic-nephropathy/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].</p><p>Although the overall number of incident ESRD patients is still increasing slowly, now almost up to 120,000 new patients in 2013, the distribution of causes is shifting slightly. Based on data in the United States Renal Data System (USRDS) Annual Report for 2015, with data through 2013, the rate of new ESRD cases with diabetes listed as the primary cause plateaued in 2001 and has declined in most subsequent years, with the lowest rate in 2012 and 2013 approximately <span class=\"nowrap\">152/million/year</span> population [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dialysis-in-diabetic-nephropathy/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].</p><p>Diabetes is the most common cause of new patients requiring renal replacement therapy, accounting for approximately 45 percent of cases in the United States (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEPH%2F107053\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef107053 \">figure 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dialysis-in-diabetic-nephropathy/abstract/6,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,7</a>]. Although the rate of 157 patients per million population for diabetes remains the highest of the renal diagnoses, it has decreased by 4.2 percent in 2011 incident patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dialysis-in-diabetic-nephropathy/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. Although less frequent in other countries, 34 and 30 percent of incident dialysis patients have diabetes in Germany and Australia, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dialysis-in-diabetic-nephropathy/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. An increasing incidence has also been noted in non-German European countries, as reported from data from 10 registries in Europe [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dialysis-in-diabetic-nephropathy/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. However, the incidence appears to have stabilized in Denmark, which may be due to the widespread implementation of intensive renoprotective measures [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dialysis-in-diabetic-nephropathy/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>].</p><p>In the United States and Puerto Rico, although the total number of patients who develop ESRD due to diabetes continues to increase, the risk of developing ESRD appears to be decreasing among patients who have diabetes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dialysis-in-diabetic-nephropathy/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. Although the reasons for the decline in risk are not known, improved glycemic and blood pressure control and the use of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers may play a role [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dialysis-in-diabetic-nephropathy/abstract/2,7,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,7,12</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">PATIENT SURVIVAL</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patient survival in diabetics on maintenance dialysis is lower than that seen in nondiabetics with end-stage renal failure due to chronic glomerular disease or hypertension [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dialysis-in-diabetic-nephropathy/abstract/6,13,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,13,14</a>]. According to the 2015 United States Renal Data System (USRDS), the adjusted survival based on primary diagnosis was 92.9 and 78.3 percent at 3 and 12 months, respectively, for diabetic patients on dialysis (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEPH%2F107055\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef107055 \">table 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dialysis-in-diabetic-nephropathy/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. This is slightly improved over prior survival data [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dialysis-in-diabetic-nephropathy/abstract/8,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,15</a>]. Survival also varies inversely with age, being best in young patients with good blood pressure control and no clinically evident cardiac disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dialysis-in-diabetic-nephropathy/abstract/6,16\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,16</a>].</p><p>However, older survival data may have been overly optimistic as it was based upon information from the USRDS, a database that excludes patients who have died within the first 90 days of the initiation of dialysis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dialysis-in-diabetic-nephropathy/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. The 2013 data are based on survival from the first day of dialysis initiation. When such individuals are included in mortality studies, the survival rate of diabetics requiring dialysis remains poor, even in dialysis centers located in countries with relatively high survival rates. As an example, among 84 consecutive patients with type 2 diabetes requiring dialysis in a center in France, 27 (32 percent) died at a mean follow-up of 211 days [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dialysis-in-diabetic-nephropathy/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>].</p><p>Cardiovascular disease is the <strong>most</strong> common cause of death, accounting for more than one-half of cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dialysis-in-diabetic-nephropathy/abstract/18-20\" class=\"abstract_t\">18-20</a>]. In addition to the presence of significant cardiovascular disease prior to the initiation of dialysis, the tissue deposition of advanced glycosylation end products (AGEs) may also enhance cardiovascular mortality once dialysis is begun. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=patient-survival-and-maintenance-dialysis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Patient survival and maintenance dialysis&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-diabetic-nephropathy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of diabetic nephropathy&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The adequacy of dialysis and a decrease in nutritional status may also be contributors to the worse outcome in diabetics. The morbidity associated with insufficient dialysis in diabetics may be mediated through anorexia, leading to decreased caloric and protein intake. The potential importance of malnutrition is suggested by the observation that the increase in mortality (when compared with nondiabetics) largely disappears if reductions in the plasma albumin and creatinine concentrations (that primarily reflect inadequate intake) are taken into account [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dialysis-in-diabetic-nephropathy/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prescribing-and-assessing-adequate-hemodialysis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Prescribing and assessing adequate hemodialysis&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=assessment-of-nutritional-status-in-hemodialysis-patients\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Assessment of nutritional status in hemodialysis patients&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Death by withdrawal from dialysis is also more likely to occur in patients with diabetes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dialysis-in-diabetic-nephropathy/abstract/22,23\" class=\"abstract_t\">22,23</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=patient-survival-and-maintenance-dialysis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Patient survival and maintenance dialysis&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=withdrawal-from-and-withholding-of-dialysis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Withdrawal from and withholding of dialysis&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">DIALYSIS VERSUS RENAL TRANSPLANTATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In the 2013 United States Renal Data System (USRDS) report, overall survival of patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) receiving a transplant was estimated to be 85 percent at five years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dialysis-in-diabetic-nephropathy/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. These less than optimal results, due largely to extrarenal vascular disease, are still markedly better than those seen with either hemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis, which ranges from 36 to 42 percent at five years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dialysis-in-diabetic-nephropathy/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. Transplantation is also associated with a better quality of life and a higher degree of rehabilitation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dialysis-in-diabetic-nephropathy/abstract/24,25\" class=\"abstract_t\">24,25</a>]. Because of these substantial benefits, renal transplantation should be offered to any suitable diabetic patient with ESRD. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=renal-transplantation-in-diabetic-nephropathy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Renal transplantation in diabetic nephropathy&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Some of the benefit associated with renal transplantation is clearly related to patient selection. Those patients who receive a transplant are usually younger and less likely to have type 2 diabetes or extrarenal vascular disease. However, the improved outcome with transplantation is seen even if the evaluation of dialyzed patients is limited to relatively healthy subjects who are candidates for transplantation (but not transplanted for some reason). Thus, factors in addition to selection bias must also be important. It is possible, for example, that the restoration of near-normal renal function following transplantation retards the progression of microvascular disease by reducing the circulating levels of advanced glycosylation end products (AGEs, as noted previously) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dialysis-in-diabetic-nephropathy/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. This mechanism of possible benefit has been difficult to prove. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=patient-survival-after-renal-transplantation\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Patient survival after renal transplantation&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h1\">HEMODIALYSIS VERSUS PERITONEAL DIALYSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Choice of a dialysis modality in diabetics is dependent in part upon the following factors, which apply to nondiabetics as well:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Comorbid conditions.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Home situation.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Independence and motivation of the patient.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Ability to tolerate volume shifts &ndash; Diabetic patients with autonomic neuropathy are often more likely to have hypotensive episodes during hemodialysis (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=intradialytic-hypotension-in-an-otherwise-stable-patient\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Intradialytic hypotension in an otherwise stable patient&quot;</a>).

Diabetic patients with unstable cardiac hemodynamics, severe vascular disease, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> advanced neuropathy are most often treated with in-center hemodialysis. Few studies have specifically analyzed the efficacy of peritoneal dialysis in these patients. Very few diabetic patients choose home hemodialysis, which is generally associated with the highest survival rates. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=home-hemodialysis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Home hemodialysis&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=outcomes-associated-with-nocturnal-hemodialysis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Outcomes associated with nocturnal hemodialysis&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Survival</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>If dialysis is required, most studies, after adjustment for comorbid factors, have <strong>not</strong> found a survival difference between hemodialysis and peritoneal dialysis in diabetic patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dialysis-in-diabetic-nephropathy/abstract/27,28\" class=\"abstract_t\">27,28</a>].</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Initial reports suggested that peritoneal dialysis was associated with a better outcome [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dialysis-in-diabetic-nephropathy/abstract/18,29-33\" class=\"abstract_t\">18,29-33</a>]. In the Michigan experience, the risk ratio for mortality for diabetics treated with peritoneal dialysis was 0.4 to 0.7 when compared with diabetics treated with hemodialysis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dialysis-in-diabetic-nephropathy/abstract/29,33\" class=\"abstract_t\">29,33</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In contrast, data from the United States Renal Data System (USRDS) case-mix study suggest that mortality may actually be increased in diabetic patients treated with peritoneal dialysis rather than hemodialysis. One report found that the increase in risk was limited to older diabetic patients, who may have had more underlying peripheral vascular disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dialysis-in-diabetic-nephropathy/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>]. A subsequent study of prevalent patients for three successive years found that patients treated with peritoneal dialysis had a 19 percent higher mortality rate than any form of hemodialysis: This increase in risk was greatest in diabetics of any age and in nondiabetics above age 55 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dialysis-in-diabetic-nephropathy/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>].<br/><br/>There are, however, potential problems with these data. They were obtained at a time when the delivery of dialysis was inadequate, the importance of residual renal function was poorly understood, and the importance of comorbid conditions was not taken into account.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A subsequent, very large study attempted to assess the impact of multiple risk factors, including diabetes, on survival after initiation of either hemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis. Utilizing data from 398,940 patients who initiated dialysis between the years 1995 to 2000, some patient characteristics included the following: 12 percent used peritoneal dialysis for initial therapy, 45 percent were diabetic, 51 percent were &gt;65 years of age, and 55 percent had at least one comorbidity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dialysis-in-diabetic-nephropathy/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>]. Mortality risk was significantly higher on hemodialysis than peritoneal dialysis among younger diabetics with no comorbidity (1.22, age between 18 and 44 years). By comparison, hemodialysis was associated with a lower mortality risk in older diabetics with either no comorbidity (relative risk [RR] 0.92 and 0.86 for ages 45 to 64 and &gt;65 years, respectively) or a baseline comorbidity (0.82 and 0.8 for ages 45 to 64 and &gt;65 years, respectively). No difference in survival with either modality was observed among younger diabetic patients with baseline comorbidity.</p><p/><p>Few diabetic patients perform home hemodialysis, the single modality with the highest patient survival rate [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dialysis-in-diabetic-nephropathy/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>].

More insulin may be required because of insulin resistance and the glucose load absorbed from the hypertonic dialysate. A 1.5 percent dialysate solution, for example, has a glucose concentration of 1500 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> (83 <span class=\"nowrap\">mmol/L),</span> well above that in the plasma. On the other hand, less insulin is often required because of decreased carbohydrate intake (if the patient is inadequately dialyzed) and prolongation of the duration of action of insulin resulting from reduced renal and hepatic clearance.
