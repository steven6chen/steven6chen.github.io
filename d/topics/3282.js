Other aspects of CMT are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=charcot-marie-tooth-disease-genetics-clinical-features-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease: Genetics, clinical features, and diagnosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2140447790\"><span class=\"h1\">BACKGROUND</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The genetics, clinical features, and diagnosis of CMT, summarized here briefly, are described in detail elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=charcot-marie-tooth-disease-genetics-clinical-features-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease: Genetics, clinical features, and diagnosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p>CMT is genetically heterogeneous. The major categories of CMT are CMT types 1 through 7 as well as an X-linked category, CMTX. Within each category, a specific disease associated with a particular gene is assigned a letter (eg, CMT1A, CMT1B, etc). CMT1 (demyelinating) and CMT2 (axonal) represent by far the largest proportion of patients (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F72688\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef72688 \">table 1</a>).</p><p>The most common initial presentation of CMT is distal weakness and atrophy manifesting with foot drop and pes cavus. Sensory symptoms are often present but tend to be less prominent. Later in the course, foot deformities such as hammertoes ensue, along with hand weakness and atrophy.</p><p>A comprehensive history and physical examination remain the core of ascertainment of and evaluation for cases of CMT (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=charcot-marie-tooth-disease-genetics-clinical-features-and-diagnosis#H1550567833\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease: Genetics, clinical features, and diagnosis&quot;, section on 'When to suspect CMT'</a>). Genetic testing is key to confirming the diagnosis after electrodiagnostic testing. &#160; </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3146074024\"><span class=\"h1\">MANAGEMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Management of CMT is currently supportive; however, such supportive therapy can dramatically improve a patient&rsquo;s quality of life. Specific disease-modifying therapy is not available. Optimal management is multidisciplinary, with care provided by neurologists, genetic counselors, nurses, physical and occupational therapists, physiatrists, and orthopedic surgeons [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/charcot-marie-tooth-disease-management-and-prognosis/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2469396874\"><span class=\"h2\">Rehabilitation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A comprehensive rehabilitation program plays a crucial role in the management of individuals affected by CMT [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/charcot-marie-tooth-disease-management-and-prognosis/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. All patients should be evaluated for weakness (both distal and proximal), physical conditioning, ambulation, balance, coordination, and manual dexterity. A major goal is the prevention of complications such as joint deformity and falls. Daily stretching exercises early in the course of the disease may help delay ankle contractures. Occupational therapy can help to improve function with activities of daily living.</p><p>Orthotics are often used to help stabilize the ankles, and may mask the gait impairment to the point where it becomes difficult for casual observers to detect any gait abnormalities. Orthopedic foot surgery may be beneficial for severe manifestations of pes cavus deformity and hammer toes, typically during adolescence or early adulthood.</p><p>However, there are only limited data from high-quality studies to support the utility of rehabilitation interventions for patients with CMT [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/charcot-marie-tooth-disease-management-and-prognosis/abstract/2-4\" class=\"abstract_t\">2-4</a>]. A systematic review published in 2016 identified only seven small randomized controlled trials and four small cohort studies examining physiotherapy or orthotics for patients with CMT [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/charcot-marie-tooth-disease-management-and-prognosis/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. There was evidence that mild to moderate endurance, stretching, and strength training exercises are safe for patients with CMT and can increase arm, pelvic girdle, and knee strength, and improve performance with activities of daily living. Outcomes for orthotic interventions were mixed, but the one small trial that measured walking ability found that wearing plastic ankle-foot orthoses improved walking control compared with wearing ordinary shoes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/charcot-marie-tooth-disease-management-and-prognosis/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1921899466\"><span class=\"h2\">Conditions that may exacerbate CMT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients with CMT may experience further impairments with disorders that cause or exacerbate neuropathy, a list that includes diabetes mellitus, vitamin deficiencies, and immune-mediated neuropathies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/charcot-marie-tooth-disease-management-and-prognosis/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Therefore, patients should be screened periodically for these conditions and treated promptly if any are detected. In particular, patients with CMT who experience unusually rapid progression of symptoms should be evaluated for a superimposed immune-mediated or inflammatory neuropathy.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H503716708\"><span class=\"h2\">Drugs that may exacerbate CMT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Because patients with CMT have an existing peripheral neuropathy, they are considered to be more susceptible to injury when treated with standard &quot;non-toxic&quot; dosages of neurotoxic agents [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/charcot-marie-tooth-disease-management-and-prognosis/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. A systematic review published in 2006 identified 26 publications, mainly case reports or small case series, describing CMT exacerbation associated with toxic medications, of which 22 involved <a href=\"topic.htm?path=vincristine-conventional-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">vincristine</a> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/charcot-marie-tooth-disease-management-and-prognosis/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. Acute worsening or onset of weakness in patients with CMT was observed after vincristine administration of 2 to 4 mg for adults or 1.5 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/m<sup>2</sup></span> per dose in children. Most of the patients had undiagnosed demyelinating forms of CMT (eg, CMT1A).</p><p>Thus, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=vincristine-conventional-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">vincristine</a> is considered to be a definite high risk medication for patients with CMT, including those who are asymptomatic <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> undiagnosed. Vincristine has long been labeled as contraindicated for patients with demyelinating forms of CMT.</p><p>Data for other drugs are quite limited, but a list of medications considered to have moderate to significant risk for patients with CMT is as follows [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/charcot-marie-tooth-disease-management-and-prognosis/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><a href=\"topic.htm?path=amiodarone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Amiodarone</a></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><a href=\"topic.htm?path=bortezomib-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Bortezomib</a></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><a href=\"topic.htm?path=cisplatin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Cisplatin</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=carboplatin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">carboplatin</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=oxaliplatin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">oxaliplatin</a></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><a href=\"topic.htm?path=colchicine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Colchicine</a> (extended use)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><a href=\"topic.htm?path=dapsone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Dapsone</a></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><a href=\"topic.htm?path=didanosine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Didanosine</a></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Dichloroacetate</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Disulfiram</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Gold salts</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><a href=\"topic.htm?path=leflunomide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Leflunomide</a></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><a href=\"topic.htm?path=metronidazole-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Metronidazole</a><span class=\"nowrap\">/misonidazole</span> (extended use)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><a href=\"topic.htm?path=nitrofurantoin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Nitrofurantoin</a></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><a href=\"topic.htm?path=nitrous-oxide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Nitrous oxide</a> (inhalation abuse or vitamin B12 deficiency)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Perhexiline (not used in the United States)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pyridoxine (high dose)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><a href=\"topic.htm?path=stavudine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Stavudine</a></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><a href=\"topic.htm?path=suramin-united-states-available-via-cdc-drug-service-investigational-drug-ind-protocol-only-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Suramin</a></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><a href=\"topic.htm?path=tacrolimus-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Tacrolimus</a></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Taxol (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=paclitaxel-conventional-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">paclitaxel</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=docetaxel-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">docetaxel</a>)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><a href=\"topic.htm?path=thalidomide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Thalidomide</a></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Zalcitabine</p><p/><p>A longer list of drugs of concern for patients with CMT, including drugs of uncertain or minor risk, and negligible or doubtful risk, can be found online at the <a href=\"http://www.cmtausa.org/&amp;token=Hj0v5/Mll/opXnQbf+Qe7UIpw0CW12/sRsz1rNwqQ94=&amp;TOPIC_ID=113945\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">Charcot-Marie-Tooth Association</a> website.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2491206480\"><span class=\"h2\">Anesthesia</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Regional anesthesia has been controversial due to theoretical concerns that patients with CMT may have an increased susceptibility to further nerve damage with the use of local anesthetic agents [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/charcot-marie-tooth-disease-management-and-prognosis/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].

Ascorbic acid therapy reduced the expression of PMP22 to a level below that required to induce the disease.
