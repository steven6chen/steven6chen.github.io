Disruption of pancreatic ducts can occur following acute or chronic pancreatitis, pancreatic resection, or trauma. Leakage of pancreatic secretions can cause significant morbidity due to malnutrition, skin excoriation, and infection.</p><p>The epidemiology, pathogenesis, clinical features, and diagnosis of pancreatic fistulas will be reviewed here. The prevention and management of pancreatic fistulas are discussed in detail, separately.

PFs can also be classified based upon the underlying disease process and the immediate predisposing cause (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F66011\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef66011 \">table 1</a>).</p><p>According to the International Study Group for Pancreatic Fistulas (ISGPF), a postoperative PF is defined as an external fistula with a drain output of any measurable volume after postoperative day 3 with an amylase level greater than three times the upper limit of the normal serum value [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pancreatic-fistulas-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Based on the clinical impact of the fistula on the patient's hospital course and outcome, postoperative PFs are graded as follows (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F96468\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef96468 \">table 2</a>) (see <a href=\"#H1059794123\" class=\"local\">'Clinical manifestations'</a> below):</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Grade A</strong> &ndash; Patients have no clinical symptoms or signs of local infection or sepsis. A computerized tomography (CT) scan shows no peripancreatic collections. The patient is fed orally and remains clinically well without the use of antibiotics, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=total-parenteral-nutrition-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">total parenteral nutrition</a>, or somatostatin analogues.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Grade B</strong> &ndash; Patients have mild to moderate symptoms that may require pharmacologic treatment (eg, antibiotics, somatostatin analogues), parenteral nutrition, or nonoperative drainage procedures.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Grade C </strong>&ndash; Patients have severe clinical symptoms and signs of sepsis or organ failure, or require reoperation for control of the fistula and its sequelae.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h1\">EPIDEMIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The incidence of pancreatic fistulas (PFs) after pancreatic resection ranges from 10 to 29 percent, depending upon the definition used, type of surgery, and the underlying pancreatic pathology [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pancreatic-fistulas-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/2-8\" class=\"abstract_t\">2-8</a>].</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In one retrospective review, PFs occurred in 422 of 3268 (13 percent) patients after pancreaticoduodenectomy, in 80 of 617 (13 percent) patients after distal pancreatectomy, and in 29 of 243 (12 percent) patients after pancreatic trauma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pancreatic-fistulas-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Surgery for chronic pancreatitis had a lower incidence of PF as compared with surgery for acute necrotizing pancreatitis (3 to 8 versus 15 to 76 percent).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Partial resection of a fibrotic pancreas is associated with lower fistula rates as compared with resection of a normal or soft pancreas (0 to 5 versus 20 to 25 percent). The incidence of fistula after resection of a pancreas with intermediate consistency is 3 to 5 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pancreatic-fistulas-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H19004936\"><span class=\"h1\">ETIOLOGY AND RISK FACTORS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Pancreatic fistulas (PFs) may be due to iatrogenic or non-iatrogenic causes. Non-iatrogenic causes include acute and chronic pancreatitis. Iatrogenic causes of PFs include pancreatic resection or percutaneous drainage of pancreatic pseudocyst, pancreatic abscess, or organized necrosis. Internal PFs most commonly occur due to chronic alcohol-induced pancreatitis, whereas external fistulas are usually iatrogenic [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pancreatic-fistulas-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].</p><p>The risk of postoperative PFs varies based on the underlying pancreatic pathology and texture. A fibrotic pancreatic remnant in patients with chronic pancreatitis facilitates pancreaticoenteric anastomosis, whereas a soft and friable pancreatic parenchyma makes the anastomosis difficult to perform and is associated with a higher risk of PFs. Small nondilated pancreatic ducts (&le;3&thinsp;mm in diameter) are associated with a higher risk of PFs as compared with those with dilated ducts. Other risk factors for clinically significant PFs include the presence of diabetes mellitus, previous laparotomy, longer operating time, and nonstapler stump closure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pancreatic-fistulas-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=surgical-resection-of-lesions-of-the-body-and-tail-of-the-pancreas#H32\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Surgical resection of lesions of the body and tail of the pancreas&quot;, section on 'Postoperative pancreatic fistula'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H19004889\"><span class=\"h1\">PATHOGENESIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Both internal and external pancreatic fistulas (PFs) result from a partial disruption of the pancreatic duct. Disruption of the pancreatic duct leads to leakage of pancreatic juice, which forms an acute fluid collection. If the fluid collections and the leak persist, a fibroinflammatory rind is formed around the collection, also called a pseudocyst. Pancreatic fluid is high in bicarbonate and protein, and in the case of high output fistulas, fluid loss may lead to metabolic acidosis, malnutrition, and dehydration.</p><p>Persistent leakage of pancreatic juice can lead to the development of an internal fistula due to spontaneous erosion into a neighboring hollow viscus (colon, duodenum, stomach, or esophagus), communication with peritoneal or pleural cavities, or development of fluid collections in the mediastinum, lesser sac, retroperitoneum, or perihepatic space, thromboses of the splenic or portal vein or bleeding from arterial pseudoaneurysms. If the communication occurs anteriorly into the peritoneal cavity, it results in pancreatic ascites. A posterior communication may track into the pleural cavity or mediastinum. Thoracopancreatic fistulas develop from leakage of pancreatic exocrine secretions cephalad through openings in the diaphragm [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pancreatic-fistulas-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. Pancreaticopleural, pancreaticobronchial, pancreaticomediastinal, or pancreaticopericardial fistulas have also been reported [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pancreatic-fistulas-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. Percutaneously placed catheters to drain peripancreatic collections can create pancreaticoenteric fistulas due to erosion of the catheter tip into the bowel and external PFs from the pancreas or peripancreatic fluid collection to the skin surface.</p><p>In some cases, the pancreatic duct disruption may be complete, causing disconnected pancreatic duct syndrome (DPDS). DPDS is characterized by a cutoff of the main pancreatic duct during endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) despite computerized tomography (CT) evidence of viable pancreatic tissue distal to the cutoff [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pancreatic-fistulas-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/12,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,13</a>]. DPDS most commonly occurs in the pancreatic neck or body after an episode of acute pancreatitis when there is necrosis of a portion of the pancreas or after pancreatic debridement. In addition to fistula formation, DPDS can be associated with pancreatic fluid collections and can lead to the development of chronic pancreatitis and diabetes mellitus.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL FEATURES</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1059794123\"><span class=\"h2\">Clinical manifestations</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The clinical manifestations of pancreatic fistulas (PFs) vary based on their size, location, and the site of communication of the PF (eg, peritoneal or pleural cavity, another hollow viscus or the skin).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h3\">Internal fistulas</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients with internal PFs can be asymptomatic. Symptoms of an internal PF include vague abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, altered bowel habits, and abdominal distension. Patients may have fevers, features of sepsis, and gastrointestinal bleeding with hematemesis, melena, or hematochezia. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pathophysiology-of-sepsis#H14\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pathophysiology of sepsis&quot;, section on 'Organ-specific effects of sepsis'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-and-management-of-suspected-sepsis-and-septic-shock-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation and management of suspected sepsis and septic shock in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Pancreatic ascites usually develops slowly and is associated with a variable intensity of abdominal pain and distension. Ascites may be associated with weight loss, anorexia, weakness, and severe malnutrition. Some patients have shortness of breath. Physical examination findings include abdominal distension and flank dullness. A large pseudocyst may be palpable in the epigastric region.

On physical examination, pancreatic fluid effluent may be visible from an external PF with skin excoriation around the fistula site.

In patients with a PF, an abdominal CT scan may demonstrate free and walled-off fluid collections in the abdominal and thoracic cavities and changes of acute or chronic pancreatitis. However, a CT scan is diagnostic of a PF only if performed immediately after an ERCP when it may demonstrate a fistulous tract [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pancreatic-fistulas-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-chronic-pancreatitis-in-adults#H13\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of chronic pancreatitis in adults&quot;, section on 'CT, MRI, and US'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-acute-pancreatitis#H31174031\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of acute pancreatitis&quot;, section on 'Abdominal computed tomography'</a> and <a href=\"#H344979864\" class=\"local\">'Assessment of the pancreatic duct'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1059794357\"><span class=\"h3\">Laboratory tests</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In patients with an external fistula, the effluent should be collected for fluid analysis. Although there is no established cutoff, pancreatic fluid amylase level greater than three times the serum amylase is supportive of a diagnosis of a PF.</p><p>In patients with ascites, diagnostic paracentesis should be performed. We assess ascitic fluid cell count and differential, Gram stain, culture, amylase, albumin, total protein and cytology. The combination of a serum-albumin ascites gradient below 1.1 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/dL,</span> a total protein level &gt;3 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/L,</span> and ascitic amylase greater than serum amylase is suggestive of pancreatic ascites. Often fluid amylase levels are 4000 <span class=\"nowrap\">units/L</span> or higher. In some cases, the white cell count may be elevated due to concomitant infection of the ascitic fluid [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pancreatic-fistulas-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>].</p><p>Thoracentesis should be performed in patients with a pleural effusion. Effusions associated with pancreaticopleural fistulas are exudative and amylase-rich with pleural fluid amylase greater than the upper limits of normal for serum amylase or a pleural fluid to serum amylase ratio greater than 1.0. Pleural effusions due to a pancreaticopleural fistula can be distinguished from a sympathetic pleural effusion that occurs following acute pancreatitis by a therapeutic thoracentesis. Pancreaticopleural effluents have high amylase content and tend to reaccumulate after therapeutic thoracentesis, whereas sympathetic pleural effusions do not have an elevated amylase and do not reaccumulate following thoracentesis. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diagnostic-evaluation-of-a-pleural-effusion-in-adults-initial-testing\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Diagnostic evaluation of a pleural effusion in adults: Initial testing&quot;</a>.)</p><p>In addition, a complete blood count, electrolytes, alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), bilirubin, calcium, amylase, lipase, and albumin should be obtained to rule out other causes of abdominal pain. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-acute-pancreatitis#H28235514\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of acute pancreatitis&quot;, section on 'Differential diagnosis'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H344979864\"><span class=\"h3\">Assessment of the pancreatic duct</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography</strong> &ndash; Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) provides direct evidence of a PF and is the test of choice if therapeutic pancreatic stenting is planned (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F78573\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef78573 \">image 1</a>). Findings on ERCP suggestive of a duct disruption include extravasation of contrast during injection of the pancreatic duct, the presence of fluid collections that communicate directly with the main pancreatic duct, pancreatic ascites, or the presence of a PF [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pancreatic-fistulas-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>].

ERCP also has a higher sensitivity and specificity for pancreatic duct leak as compared with CT scan [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pancreatic-fistulas-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/14,17\" class=\"abstract_t\">14,17</a>]. However, ERCP has the disadvantage of requiring sedation and is associated with risks of pancreatitis.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography</strong> &ndash; Secretin-enhanced MRCP should be performed if there is concern for adjacent complications (eg, pseudoaneurysm on CT) and if an ERCP is not performed. MRCP has the advantage that it is noninvasive and it can guide clinical management by delineating pancreatic duct injuries including those upstream of a complete duct disruption that would not be visualized on ERCP [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pancreatic-fistulas-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/18-20\" class=\"abstract_t\">18-20</a>]. As MRCP only allows for visualization of endogenous ductal liquid content, leaks without large fluid pools may not be identified. We therefore perform secretin-enhanced MRCP to stimulate pancreatic secretion and thereby visualize side branches [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pancreatic-fistulas-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. Contrast injection during MRCP also helps rule out arterial pseudo-aneurysms and venous thromboses. However, MRCP is not therapeutic and unlike ERCP does not demonstrate extravasation of contrast in real time.

However, for PF occurring after pancreatic resection, fistulography is preferred over ERCP and MRCP in patients with operative or percutaneously placed pancreatic drainage catheters. In such cases, a fistulogram can also delineate associated fluid collections and guide the repositioning of catheters to optimize drainage. However, fistulography is associated with the risk of infection of undrained collections.

Chronic alcohol-induced pancreatitis is the most common pancreatic disease associated with internal PFs. By contrast, external PFs are usually iatrogenic, occurring after pancreatic resection or percutaneous drainage of pancreatic pseudocyst, pancreatic abscess, or organized necrosis.
