However, such an assessment may fail to uncover important underlying causes that stem from abnormal gait mechanics. A focused dynamic assessment of gait can be performed in a clinic hallway or using a treadmill. In addition, high-quality video capability is available on many smart phones or handheld devices, enabling more careful review of a patient's gait. Such gait analysis can provide important insights into the cause of a patient's symptoms.</p><p>The term &quot;gait analysis&quot; encompasses a broad spectrum of potential assessment strategies used to evaluate normal and abnormal gait, both walking and running. Such assessments range from simple observation to sophisticated computer analysis of biomechanics. This topic is intended to help general clinicians and primary care sports medicine physicians understand how to perform a basic analysis of a patient's normal walking and running gait and to recognize some common gait abnormalities. Such techniques as computer-assisted gait analysis, force platforms, pressure sensors, and other sophisticated modes of analysis are beyond the scope of this topic, as is the assessment of complex pathologic conditions, including cerebral palsy, other pediatric neuropathic gait patterns, and gait involving use of a prosthetic limb [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-assessment-of-walking-and-running-gait/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Specific injuries that may stem from abnormal gait patterns are reviewed in greater detail separately.

Each complete gait cycle, or stride, begins when one foot makes initial contact with the ground, progressing through each phase of gait (see below), and ending when the same foot again makes contact. For walking, each stride is subdivided into a stance phase and swing phase for each foot. For running, a float phase is added.

A tee shirt and running shorts work well. We begin the examination by assessing the patient's posture, joint motion, and strength. Once this is completed, we systematically observe the patient's gait as described below.

Specifically, look for atrophy of the gluteals, quadriceps, and gastrocnemius muscles. Achilles tendon thickening or nodules may be noted. Consider internal and external rotation of the knee, sometimes referred to as &quot;patella squinting&quot; (patella tilts inward &ndash; internal rotation (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SM%2F114762\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef114762 \">picture 7</a>)) or &quot;frog eyed&quot; patella (patella tilts outward &ndash; external rotation). Look for tibial varus, in which the angle of the tibia is curved outward relative to a perpendicular line from the torso to the ground (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SM%2F114903\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef114903 \">picture 8</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-assessment-of-walking-and-running-gait/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. </p><p>Inspect the arch of the foot for pes cavus (high arch) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SM%2F82600\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef82600 \">picture 12</a>) or pes planus (flatfoot) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F98818\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef98818 \">picture 16</a>), metatarsal break (abnormally short or long great toe), and metatarsophalangeal (MTP) deformities such as hallux valgus (bunion) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F96788\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef96788 \">picture 15</a>). Note any external or internal rotation of the foot: toe-out or toe-in. Are the feet asymmetric in any way? Assess the Fick angle: extent to which there is &quot;toe-out&quot; deviation from the sagittal plane (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SM%2F114040\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef114040 \">figure 4</a>). This angle can be affected by hip position, tibial torsion, or excessive pronation in the foot. </p><p>The most common static abnormality associated with gait-related injury is limb length discrepancy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-assessment-of-walking-and-running-gait/abstract/4-6\" class=\"abstract_t\">4-6</a>]. Visual estimation of limb length difference is best done at this stage of the examination (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SM%2F113571\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef113571 \">picture 3</a>). If a leg length discrepancy exists, one hip usually appears lower than the other. If any asymmetry appears to be present, careful leg length measurements should be taken. One simple technique for doing so entails ensuring the pelvis is level and then measuring the distance from the ASIS to the medial malleolus while the patient lies supine (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SM%2F114761\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef114761 \">picture 17</a>). If the pelvis is not level, pelvic rotation can cause a pseudo leg length inequality when measurements are taken. &#160; </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H588277781\"><span class=\"h2\">Joint motion</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Normal joint range of motion (ROM) is needed for smooth, symmetric gait, and to help dissipate ground reaction forces. Running requires greater joint motion than walking [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-assessment-of-walking-and-running-gait/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. Inadequate motion at any joint within a closed kinetic chain unavoidably leads to the transfer of ground reaction forces to other sites within that chain, a process that may contribute to injury. </p><p>ROM is typically assessed using open chain movements while the patient is seated or lying on an examination table [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-assessment-of-walking-and-running-gait/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. Motion of the hips, knees, ankles, and first metatarsophalangeal joints should be assessed (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SM%2F113555\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef113555 \">table 2</a>). Assessment of joint motion necessarily entails some assessment of the flexibility of the muscles that move the joint in question. However, more focused assessment of a muscle or muscle group may be needed. Detailed assessment of individual joints is reviewed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=musculoskeletal-examination-of-the-hip-and-groin\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Musculoskeletal examination of the hip and groin&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=physical-examination-of-the-knee\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Physical examination of the knee&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-ankle-fractures-in-adults#H3\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of ankle fractures in adults&quot;, section on 'Clinical anatomy'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-and-diagnosis-of-common-causes-of-foot-pain-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation and diagnosis of common causes of foot pain in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Although performed while the patient is stationary and non-weightbearing, open chain joint assessments accurately reflect joint mobility during movement in most cases. In addition, it is useful to have the patient perform closed chain movements to assess mobility when the feet are planted and bearing weight, as this more closely approximates joint mobility during gait. As an example, the clinician can ask the patient to perform a full, body weight squat (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SM%2F112458\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef112458 \">picture 18</a>). Additional movements to assess joint mobility, symmetry in movement, and strength, include stepping down from a step or bench (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F68323\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef68323 \">picture 19</a>), a single leg squat (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SM%2F102338\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef102338 \">picture 20</a>), and bend and reach.</p><p>When assessing joint motion, keep in mind the effect of major muscles that cross two joints. As an example, knee flexion is restricted by the rectus femoris if the hip is simultaneously extended, as the rectus femoris crosses both the knee and the hip. Likewise, ankle motion is affected by knee extension or flexion, as the gastrocnemius crosses both the ankle and knee. The clinician needs to distinguish between joint motion limitations due to soft tissue constraints versus mechanical restrictions (eg, joint effusion, meniscal tear, bone spurs).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3397681289\"><span class=\"h2\">Muscle strength</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A cursory evaluation of strength may alert the clinician to injury, myopathy, or a neurologic contribution to gait abnormality. As a practical matter, the strength examination is usually performed with manual muscle testing (MMT). Testing should include assessment of hip abduction (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F98477\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef98477 \">picture 21</a>), adduction (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F100319\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef100319 \">picture 22</a>) and flexion (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F100327\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef100327 \">picture 23</a>), and knee flexion (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F74953\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef74953 \">picture 24</a>) and extension (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F81977\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef81977 \">picture 25</a>). MMT is reviewed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=muscle-examination-in-the-evaluation-of-weakness#H5\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Muscle examination in the evaluation of weakness&quot;, section on 'Manual muscle strength testing'</a>.) </p><p>Of note, the MMT scale has several limitations, particularly when assessing strength for gait. One is that strength is assessed in one position and a muscle's strength varies along its range of motion. A second is that the assessment is performed using open kinetic chain movements, whereas most lower extremity muscles perform tasks (eg, gait) in a closed kinetic chain [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-assessment-of-walking-and-running-gait/abstract/9,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,10</a>]. The load applied to the muscle may be markedly greater in a closed kinetic chain movement.</p><p>When an examination using open-chain movements suggests weakness, an examination using closed-chain repetitive movement may confirm the finding (eg, repetitive heel raises for gastrocnemius weakness).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2136519222\"><span class=\"h1\">GENERAL APPROACH TO GAIT ASSESSMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The dynamic gait examination can be as simple as observing the patient walk or run in a hallway. If a treadmill is available, the clinician can observe walking or running across a range of speeds that may elicit abnormalities not seen at a slower pace. Although there are subtle differences in gait when using a treadmill compared with overland running, they are minimal and generally not clinically significant [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-assessment-of-walking-and-running-gait/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>].</p><p>A skilled clinician may be able to identify asymmetries and other abnormalities with the naked eye. Nevertheless, by using simple motion capture video with an iPad, smartphone, or comparable device, and performing a careful review of slow motion video, clinicians are better able to identify a host of potential mechanical problems that may be missed by the naked eye. Applications for obtaining angular measurements and other mechanical analyses are available [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-assessment-of-walking-and-running-gait/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. These strategies allow real-time review with the patient. A table summarizing conditions associated with particular gait findings is provided (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SM%2F114760\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef114760 \">table 1</a>).</p><p>Dynamic gait is assessed from the side (sagittal plane), front, and rear (coronal plane) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SM%2F114052\" class=\"graphic graphic_movie graphicRef114052 \">movie 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SM%2F114963\" class=\"graphic graphic_movie graphicRef114963 \">movie 2</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SM%2F114042\" class=\"graphic graphic_movie graphicRef114042 \">movie 3</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SM%2F114043\" class=\"graphic graphic_movie graphicRef114043 \">movie 4</a>).</p><p>It is best that the clinician establish a systematic method for observing a patient's gait that is used for every examination. This approach helps to ensure that all the important elements of a patient's gait are observed and possible abnormalities identified. We observe the elements of gait in the following sequence:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Arm swing</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Head and trunk position and movement</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pelvic position and rotation</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Hip position and motion</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Knee position and motion</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Ankle and foot position (pronation, neutral, supination) and motion</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Overall gait dynamics</p><p/><p>We find it helpful to focus on one element of gait through several full cycles, and then move on to the next element. As an example, we may concentrate on the right leg during its swing phase for three to four cycles, and then observe the left leg during swing phase for several cycles, and then compare the two, before moving on to the next element. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3224246767\"><span class=\"h2\">Gait observation checklist</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A checklist suitable for use during patient evaluation that summarizes the elements to observe during gait assessment is provided.

Look at the motion of the head, trunk, and arms. The head moves vertically, although only slightly, in a sinusoidal pattern, with minimal if any side-to-side sway or rotation. Shoulder height and arm swing should be symmetric [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-assessment-of-walking-and-running-gait/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. Movement of the torso in the coronal plane should be minimal and symmetric [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-assessment-of-walking-and-running-gait/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. Normal walking gait is seen in the following videos (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SM%2F114963\" class=\"graphic graphic_movie graphicRef114963 \">movie 2</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SM%2F114052\" class=\"graphic graphic_movie graphicRef114052 \">movie 1</a>). </p><p>Each arm provides counterbalance to the contralateral lower extremity as they swing, and the movements of these limbs should be synchronized. This synchrony minimizes any twisting of the trunk or pelvis in the transverse plane, enabling maximal stride length [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-assessment-of-walking-and-running-gait/abstract/14-16\" class=\"abstract_t\">14-16</a>]. Exaggerated sway to the stance side after touchdown is associated with ipsilateral knee pain, hip abductor weakness, spinal deformity, low back pain, and other problems [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-assessment-of-walking-and-running-gait/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4259375078\"><span class=\"h3\">Running</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A person's center of mass becomes lower during running, and the body leans forward.

Arm swing is more exaggerated but remains symmetric (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SM%2F114042\" class=\"graphic graphic_movie graphicRef114042 \">movie 3</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SM%2F114044\" class=\"graphic graphic_movie graphicRef114044 \">movie 5</a>). From the front, observe the symmetry and extent of hand and arm elevation, and from behind, the elbow position. The hands and fingers should maintain a relaxed, slightly cupped position without excessive gripping or rigidly straight fingers. &#160; &#160;</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3231723704\"><span class=\"h2\">Pelvis</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H585043585\"><span class=\"h3\">Walking</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Pelvic movement during gait should be smooth, symmetric, and unexaggerated. From the rear, look closely for pelvic tilt. Observe one side of the pelvis before directing attention to the other. Excessive lateral pelvic tilt may be caused by weakness of the contralateral hip abductors (eg, gluteus medius) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SM%2F114964\" class=\"graphic graphic_movie graphicRef114964 \">movie 6</a>). </p><p>Next, examine the pelvis from the side. The pelvis is rotated posteriorly at foot-strike, then begins to rotate anteriorly during the stance phase, reaching its maximum after toe-off [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-assessment-of-walking-and-running-gait/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. The pelvis provides stability for the lower extremities during gait. Although normally there is some movement of the pelvis in all three planes, excessive pelvic motion in any plane or asymmetric movement can contribute to injury, such as hamstring strains (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SM%2F114074\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef114074 \">picture 26</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-assessment-of-walking-and-running-gait/abstract/18,19\" class=\"abstract_t\">18,19</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2863466832\"><span class=\"h3\">Running</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Seen from the rear, the pelvis drops and rotates during running, but the increase in motion is small compared with walking. Pelvic movement should remain smooth, symmetric, and unexaggerated (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SM%2F114048\" class=\"graphic graphic_movie graphicRef114048 \">movie 7</a>). Most importantly, observe the symmetry and degree of pelvic drop (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SM%2F114074\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef114074 \">picture 26</a>). Excessive drop suggests weakness of the hip abductors (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SM%2F114764\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef114764 \">picture 27</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-assessment-of-walking-and-running-gait/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H327022212\"><span class=\"h2\">Hip</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3254372165\"><span class=\"h3\">Walking</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>From the side, observe hip flexion and extension (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SM%2F114965\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef114965 \">picture 28</a>). Note any differences in range of motion and timing. A limp alters timing (patient spends more time on the injured extremity) and suggests a painful limb. </p><p>The weightbearing hip passively adducts at initial ground contact. Then at late stance, the gluteus medius actively abducts the femur (acting on the pelvis) in preparation for accepting the load of bodyweight at contralateral touch down [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-assessment-of-walking-and-running-gait/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. Seen in the coronal plane, the supporting hip passively adducts maximally at mid-stance. This adduction of the hip relative to the pelvis is passive because gravity causes the swing (unsupported) side of the pelvis to drop. This drop is best appreciated by observing the lateral pelvic tilt towards the swing side (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SM%2F114680\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef114680 \">picture 29</a>). With normal hip adduction, the lower extremity, most notably the knee, should not reach midline. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H109173057\"><span class=\"h3\">Running</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Hip motion during running is best appreciated from the side. Observe the degree of hip flexion (look for knee lift), and the symmetry of movement. During running, the hip begins to extend before foot contact (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SM%2F114967\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef114967 \">picture 30</a>). Maximum hip extension occurs just before toe-off. Hip extension and anterior pelvic tilt combine to provide maximal time for foot contact with the ground (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SM%2F114681\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef114681 \">picture 31</a>). Runners may compensate for limited hip extension by increasing their anterior pelvic tilt, thereby causing increased lumbar lordosis. Over time, this adaptation may produce low back pain or hamstring tendinopathy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-assessment-of-walking-and-running-gait/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. In addition, excessive hip adduction is associated with tibial stress fractures [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-assessment-of-walking-and-running-gait/abstract/22-25\" class=\"abstract_t\">22-25</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H398323280\"><span class=\"h2\">Knee and leg</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1465156328\"><span class=\"h3\">Walking</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>From the side, observe, knee elevation, knee flexion at foot contact, and knee extension at toe-off. In the sagittal plane, the knee is slightly flexed (approximately 20 to 25 degrees) at initial contact. As the contact phase continues and impact increases, the knee flexes further to absorb more of the ground reaction force. On the stance leg, maximal flexion (approximately 45 degrees) occurs as the opposite knee passes it during its mid-swing. Knee flexion should also be observed during the swing phase. Knee extension occurs during the late stance phase, and then again during late swing phase. Normal motion of the knee during walking is seen in the following video (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SM%2F114968\" class=\"graphic graphic_movie graphicRef114968 \">movie 8</a>).</p><p>It is important to observe knee alignment and motion in the coronal plane. Knee valgus, seen as an inward deviation of the knee, is associated with patellofemoral pain and other conditions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-assessment-of-walking-and-running-gait/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. Knee valgus is usually accompanied by knee internal rotation. Excessive valgus can be observed by focusing on the distance between the knees at mid-stance as the knees cross, and noting knee position relative to a line drawn from the hip to the ankle (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SM%2F114969\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef114969 \">picture 32</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-assessment-of-walking-and-running-gait/abstract/2,17\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,17</a>]. </p><p>Look for outward tibial tilt (tibial varus) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SM%2F114075\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef114075 \">picture 33</a>). This occurs when the proximal tibia is positioned away from the midline and the distal tibia toward the midline. Excessive outward tibial tilt correlates with increased torsional loads placed on the tibia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-assessment-of-walking-and-running-gait/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1717320333\"><span class=\"h3\">Running</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Observing the knee from the side enables the clinician to assess the knee flexion angle at foot contact. This angle is typically 20 degrees when walking and 30 degrees when running. The angle at contact varies little with increased running speed. A straighter knee at contact is associated with over-striding and more forceful heel contact [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-assessment-of-walking-and-running-gait/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. </p><p>During the stance phase, maximal knee flexion (typically 45 degrees) occurs at mid-stance when the knees cross one another. Knee flexion is much greater during the swing phase of running, reaching 130 degrees in some. While the knee may reach near full extension at toe-off when walking, it remains slightly flexed at terminal stance when running. &#160;</p><p>Knee motion in the coronal plane can be evaluated from the front or rear. Observe the knee relative to a line from the hip to the ankle. Knee excursion medial of this line (valgus knee) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SM%2F114049\" class=\"graphic graphic_movie graphicRef114049 \">movie 9</a>) is associated with patellofemoral pain and other conditions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-assessment-of-walking-and-running-gait/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2123956838\"><span class=\"h2\">Foot and ankle</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2702125086\"><span class=\"h3\">Walking</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Some authors suggest a &quot;bottom up&quot; scheme for gait assessment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-assessment-of-walking-and-running-gait/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. This is not required, and is not our approach, but the suggestion reflects the important effect that foot contact has on the kinetic chain proximally during gait. </p><p>Observe rearfoot and ankle motion from the front, rear, and both sides. A view from the front is most helpful for determining whether the patient is toeing in or out (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SM%2F114678\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef114678 \">picture 14</a>). Look for symmetry and the degree of rotation, if present. The Fick angle reflects foot external rotation relative to the line of direct forward progress, and is normally 5 to 18 degrees (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SM%2F114040\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef114040 \">figure 4</a>). If this angle is asymmetric or excessive, the examiner should attempt to determine the source of rotation: foot, tibia, femur, or hip. &#160;</p><p>The side view is used to assess ankle dorsiflexion and plantarflexion, stride length, and toe-off symmetry. Restricted ankle motion, perhaps a result of previous ankle sprain or arthritis, usually causes a shorter stride on the affected side. This manifests as a quickened or premature lift off of the foot when compared with the unaffected side. </p><p>From the rear, observe heel contact position, heel valgus or varus, and the timing of heel lift. At contact, the heel is typically varus (or supinated), and seen as landing on the posterior-lateral corner of the foot or shoe. This causes the most common shoe wear pattern (on <span class=\"nowrap\">rear/lateral</span> part of sole). The heel may be valgus (or rearfoot pronated) due to a variety of structural problems, such as posterior tibial tendon dysfunction, rigid flatfoot (pes planus), or tarsal coalition. Heel lift occurs midway through the stance phase of gait. An early lift may occur in the presence of a tight gastrocnemius muscle or Achilles tendon, ankle joint restriction, or neurologic conditions such as mild cerebral palsy. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1634604523\"><span class=\"h3\">Running</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>When assessing the foot and ankle during running, begin by identifying the foot strike pattern. From the side, observe which part of the foot makes initial contact with the ground. Each foot will move through a stance phase and a swing phase; the float phase is when both feet are off the ground (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SM%2F114050\" class=\"graphic graphic_movie graphicRef114050 \">movie 10</a>).</p><p>The magnitude and pattern of ground reaction forces is largely determined by the foot-strike pattern, of which there are three basic types [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-assessment-of-walking-and-running-gait/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]: </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Rearfoot strike pattern</strong> &#8210; In the rearfoot pattern, the posterior-lateral heel makes first contact with the ground while the foot is dorsiflexed. The rearfoot is typically inverted prior to contact and then promptly everts or pronates after contact. This pronation helps attenuate impact forces. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Midfoot strike pattern</strong> &#8210; In the midfoot pattern, initial ground contact is made with the portion of the midfoot overlying the metatarsal heads, followed immediately by the heel (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SM%2F114685\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef114685 \">picture 34</a>). The foot is subtly plantar-flexed, instead of dorsiflexed, at contact.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Forefoot strike pattern</strong> &ndash; In the forefoot pattern, the foot is positioned in plantar flexion, and often supination, at contact. The forefoot makes initial contact with the ground, but this is <strong>not</strong> followed by heel contact (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SM%2F114685\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef114685 \">picture 34</a>). A pronounced forefoot varus strike is associated with an increased risk for running-related injury.</p><p/><p>A rearfoot strike pattern produces rapid and relatively high peak vertical ground reaction forces, whereas a forefoot pattern produces a slower rate of rise in ground reaction forces and eliminates the initial spike in such forces seen with a rearfoot strike [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-assessment-of-walking-and-running-gait/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. Of note, a forefoot strike made with a rigid cavus foot also generates high peak forces [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-assessment-of-walking-and-running-gait/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. High vertical loading rates and high peak ground reaction forces are associated with stress fractures and possibly other injuries [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-assessment-of-walking-and-running-gait/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. </p><p>Once the foot strike pattern is determined, the key aspect of foot and ankle movement to observe is the degree of pronation, in particular whether pronation is associated with too much or too rapid an inward motion of the foot and ankle (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SM%2F114686\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef114686 \">picture 35</a>). This is best observed from the rear during mid-stance. The foot pronates maximally halfway through the stance phase (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SM%2F114051\" class=\"graphic graphic_movie graphicRef114051 \">movie 11</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-assessment-of-walking-and-running-gait/abstract/31,32\" class=\"abstract_t\">31,32</a>]. To gauge pronation, watch the heel movement, and look for navicular drop (arch collapse) and forefoot abduction (or &quot;toe-out&quot;) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SM%2F114686\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef114686 \">picture 35</a>). &#160;</p><p>Heel position and movement is determined by comparing it to the lower leg. To do so, extend two imaginary vertical lines, one that bisects the lower leg and another that bisects the heel at mid-stance. If the angle formed by these lines is oriented laterally, the heel is in valgus; if medially, the heel is in varus (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SM%2F114679\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef114679 \">picture 11</a>). Determining whether pronation is excessive without computer or video assistance is somewhat subjective. The clinician can compare sides for symmetry and estimate the amount of heel eversion and arch flattening as mild, moderate, or severe.</p><p>Excessive valgus angulation can place stress on the posterior tibial tendon, plantar fascia, and lower leg muscles. As noted above, the heel is usually slightly inverted at contact, then it rapidly everts. Foot structure, intrinsic and extrinsic foot muscles, and conditions affecting more proximal structures, such as genu valgus, can all play a role in excessive pronation. When genu valgus contributes to pronation, the alignment of the ankle and foot may appear normal or minimally angulated. However, in some instances both genu valgus and excessive foot pronation coexist.</p><p>Arch descent is a readily visible component of normal pronation. This can be seen from a posterior or medial perspective. A small degree of navicular drop seen in the idealized neutral foot is normal. The pes planus foot (&quot;flatfoot&quot; (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F98818\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef98818 \">picture 16</a>)) demonstrates a marked navicular drop, consistent with its flat appearance (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SM%2F114686\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef114686 \">picture 35</a>). A dynamic navicular drop is greatly exaggerated in the &quot;hyperpronated&quot; (or rigidly flatfooted) individual. &#160;</p><p>Excessive heel varus is present with a supinated (ie, pes cavus or high arch) foot structure. If the heel remains in varus and does not transition to slight valgus after heel contact, the examiner should consider conditions such as a tarsal coalition. Many tarsal coalitions involve bridging between the calcaneus or talus and one of the tarsal bones (eg, navicular). Such a bridge blocks the normal rotation that takes place between the midfoot and rearfoot at Chopart's joint. The pes cavus foot is sometimes associated with a rigidly plantar-flexed first ray (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SM%2F82600\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef82600 \">picture 12</a>). Such a rigid, high arch lacks appropriate pronation through mid-stance [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-assessment-of-walking-and-running-gait/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>].</p><p>Watching the patient from the front and rear, observe the transfer of weight from the lateral forefoot to the first ray and then through the great toe at toe-off. This sequence requires normal metatarsal anatomy, first ray mobility, and motion at the first metatarsophalangeal (MTP) joint, and should appear smooth. Excessive first ray motion may manifest as persistent pronation late into the toe-off phase. This can increase the impact at the first MTP joint and cause inappropriate weight transfer to the lesser metatarsals late in push-off, which may contribute to pathology at the first MTP joint, such as hallux rigidus and hallux valgus [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-assessment-of-walking-and-running-gait/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H920144012\"><span class=\"h1\">SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The gait cycle is the repetitive pattern of walking or running movement.
