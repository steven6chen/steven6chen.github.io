JDM is characterized primarily as a capillary vasculopathy, whereas JPM involves direct T cell invasion of muscle fibers similar to that seen in adult polymyositis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/juvenile-dermatomyositis-and-polymyositis-diagnosis/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-of-dermatomyositis-and-polymyositis-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations of dermatomyositis and polymyositis in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The diagnosis of JDM and JPM is reviewed here. The pathogenesis, clinical manifestations, and treatment of these disorders are discussed elsewhere.

These criteria replace the longstanding Bohan and Peter classification schema and diagnostic criteria for the various forms of myositis, including JDM, that were proposed in 1975 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/juvenile-dermatomyositis-and-polymyositis-diagnosis/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].</p><p>The <span class=\"nowrap\">EULAR/ACR</span> criteria include four variables related to muscle weakness and three related to skin manifestations, as well as variables related to laboratory measurements and other clinical manifestations. Muscle biopsies are infrequently performed in children. Thus, the <span class=\"nowrap\">EULAR/ACR</span> criteria have one scoring system if no muscle biopsy is available and a separate scoring system if the patient has had a muscle biopsy.</p><p>The <span class=\"nowrap\">EULAR/ACR</span> score in the absence of a muscle biopsy is interpreted as follows (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F115665\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef115665 \">table 1</a>):</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Definite IIM</strong> &ndash; Score of &ge;7.5; level of probability &ge;90 percent</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Probable IIM</strong> &ndash; Score of &ge;5.5 to &lt;7.5; level of probability &ge;55 to &lt;90 percent</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Possible IIM</strong> &ndash; Score of 5.3 or 5.4; level of probability &ge;50 to &lt;55 percent</p><p/><p>Pediatric patients who meet the criteria for IIM are classified as having JDM if they have a heliotrope rash (reddish-purple rash on the upper eyelids with periorbital edema), Gottron papules (erythematous, papulosquamous eruption over the dorsal surfaces of the knuckles) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F52062\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef52062 \">picture 1</a>), or Gottron sign (flat, erythematous rash over the dorsal surfaces of the knuckles). If they do not have any of these skin findings, they are classified as juvenile myositis other than JDM.</p><p>The original Bohan and Peter criteria were replaced in part because electromyography (EMG) and muscle biopsy are no longer used as frequently because of their invasive nature, especially in patients with the classical clinical features of JDM (ie, characteristic rash and proximal muscle weakness). In an international survey of pediatric rheumatologists published in 2006, all respondents routinely used the clinical features of JDM to make the diagnosis of JDM [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/juvenile-dermatomyositis-and-polymyositis-diagnosis/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. Elevated serum muscle enzymes, muscle biopsy, and EMG were used as diagnostic aids in 87, 61, and 55 percent of cases, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/juvenile-dermatomyositis-and-polymyositis-diagnosis/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. In addition, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was rated as a very useful tool in the diagnosis of JDM, but, for some, access to this modality was limited.</p><p>The Bohan and Peter classification and diagnostic criteria for JDM included the following findings (diagnosis probable with three criteria, definite with four or five criteria present) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/juvenile-dermatomyositis-and-polymyositis-diagnosis/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Symmetric weakness of the proximal muscles</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Characteristic cutaneous changes, consisting of heliotrope dermatitis (reddish-purple rash on the upper eyelids with periorbital edema) and Gottron papules (erythematous, papulosquamous eruption over the dorsal surfaces of the knuckles)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Elevation of the serum level of one of the muscle enzymes</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>EMG demonstrating denervation and myopathy</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Muscle biopsy displaying necrosis and inflammation (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F63190\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef63190 \">picture 2</a>)</p><p/><p>Some also consider nailfold capillary changes to be one of the typical cutaneous changes, although they were not included in either set of criteria.</p><p>The classification and diagnostic criteria for JPM were similar to those described for JDM, except that the cutaneous findings are absent in patients with JPM [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/juvenile-dermatomyositis-and-polymyositis-diagnosis/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. However, as the diagnostic tools become more sophisticated (eg, biopsies that demonstrate inclusion body myositis or inflammatory dystrophies, or autoantibodies that are markers of particular types of myositis such as anti-signal recognition particle [SRP] and necrotizing myopathy), fewer patients are diagnosed with JPM, calling into question whether JPM is a specific entity.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The diagnosis of JDM is primarily a clinical one (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F115665\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef115665 \">table 1</a>) (see <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Classification and diagnostic criteria'</a> above). JDM is suspected if there is both symmetric proximal muscle weakness and characteristic cutaneous findings, including heliotrope rash, Gottron papules, and nailfold capillary abnormalities (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F52062\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef52062 \">picture 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F63190\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef63190 \">picture 2</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/juvenile-dermatomyositis-and-polymyositis-diagnosis/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. The diagnosis of JPM and <span class=\"nowrap\">amyopathic/hypomyopathic</span> JDM are more challenging because of the lack of cutaneous manifestations in the former and lack of clinically evident weakness in the latter. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=juvenile-dermatomyositis-and-polymyositis-epidemiology-pathogenesis-and-clinical-manifestations#H8\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Juvenile dermatomyositis and polymyositis: Epidemiology, pathogenesis, and clinical manifestations&quot;, section on 'Clinical manifestations'</a>.)</p><p>Elevation of muscle enzymes and an electromyogram (EMG) demonstrating denervation and myopathy are supportive of the diagnosis of these disorders. Increasingly, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is used as a diagnostic tool in childhood inflammatory myopathy. T2 fat-suppressed MRI shows muscle inflammation as edema (bright signal) and appears to be highly sensitive. A muscle biopsy may be used to confirm the diagnosis whenever the clinical evaluation and initial laboratory testing are inconclusive. (See <a href=\"#H515393324\" class=\"local\">'Our approach'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H515393324\"><span class=\"h2\">Our approach</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The authors use the following approach in making the diagnosis of <span class=\"nowrap\">JDM/JPM</span> in their practice:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Evaluation in all patients </strong>&ndash; Patients are examined for the characteristic cutaneous findings of JDM, including the rashes and nailfold capillary changes, and muscle strength testing is performed to evaluate for symmetric proximal muscle weakness.

In these patients, we also perform myositis-specific (MSA) and myositis-associated (MAA) antibody testing done by immunoprecipitation (positive tests are reasonably specific for JPM). (See <a href=\"#H11\" class=\"local\">'Muscle biopsy'</a> below and <a href=\"#H12\" class=\"local\">'Other tests'</a> below and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=juvenile-dermatomyositis-and-polymyositis-epidemiology-pathogenesis-and-clinical-manifestations#H5\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Juvenile dermatomyositis and polymyositis: Epidemiology, pathogenesis, and clinical manifestations&quot;, section on 'Immunologic mechanisms'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span><strong>Evaluation in patients with suspected JDM, JPM, or <span class=\"nowrap\">amyopathic/hypomyopathic</span> JDM</strong> &ndash; In these patients, we measure serum muscle enzyme levels. These studies often provide evidence of the presence of myositis, but not always. Thus, further testing should still be performed even if levels are not elevated. (See <a href=\"#H8\" class=\"local\">'Measurement of muscle enzymes'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\">We next perform short tau inversion recovery (STIR) sequence MRI of the thigh and shoulder girdle muscles (or whole-body STIR MRI) to document evidence of muscle inflammation and confirm a diagnosis of JDM in a patient with typical clinical findings. If the MRI findings are consistent with JDM, we usually do not perform any further testing. If MRI is not available or is negative or inconclusive, we perform EMG. Treatment should not be delayed if these additional testing modalities are not available, the presentation is not atypical, and disease is moderate to severe.

Any decrement in proximal muscle strength is considered a positive finding. Distal muscles are often weak in JDM and JPM, but distal muscle weakness in the absence of proximal muscle weakness should prompt suspicion for other diagnoses.</p><p>A standardized confrontational (manual) muscle strength testing score of eight muscle groups, the MMT8, has been validated for use in assessing strength in JDM [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/juvenile-dermatomyositis-and-polymyositis-diagnosis/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>] and is also used in assessing patients with suspected JPM. Tested muscles comprise the deltoid, biceps, wrist extensors, quadriceps, ankle dorsiflexors, neck flexors, gluteus medius, and gluteus maximus [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/juvenile-dermatomyositis-and-polymyositis-diagnosis/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. Muscle strength is scored on a 0 to 10 point scale [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/juvenile-dermatomyositis-and-polymyositis-diagnosis/abstract/11,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,12</a>].</p><p>The Childhood Myositis Assessment Scale (CMAS) is a clinical assessment tool that provides an objective measure of muscle strength (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F104902\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef104902 \">table 2</a>). The CMAS tests function and endurance by having a child complete a number of different physical maneuvers that assess primarily axial and proximal muscle groups [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/juvenile-dermatomyositis-and-polymyositis-diagnosis/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. A score is assigned from 0 to 51, with a higher score indicating greater strength. In a validation study of 10 children with JDM or JPM and 12 clinicians, the CMAS was found to correlate with the clinician global assessment of disease activity, manual muscle testing, and serum creatine kinase (CK) level, with excellent intra- and inter-rater reliability [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/juvenile-dermatomyositis-and-polymyositis-diagnosis/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Nailfold capillaroscopy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Abnormalities in nailfold capillaroscopy suggest an underlying connective tissue disease, including JDM. Nailfold capillaroscopy is easily performed at the bedside or in clinic. A drop of oil or water-soluble gel is placed on the patient's fingernail bed, and a light microscope or ophthalmoscope (set on the highest level of magnification) is used to assess nailfold capillary dilatation, tortuosity, dropout (loss of capillary loops), and the total number of capillaries per millimeter (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F63190\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef63190 \">picture 2</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/juvenile-dermatomyositis-and-polymyositis-diagnosis/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>].</p><p>In one study, nailfold capillary microscopy demonstrated a lower density of capillaries (4.9 versus 6.9 capillaries per millimeter) and increased capillary width in 18 children with connective tissue disease, including 8 with JDM, compared with 17 healthy control children [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/juvenile-dermatomyositis-and-polymyositis-diagnosis/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>].</p><p>In another study of 84 children with a variety of rheumatologic disorders and 34 healthy controls, nailfold capillaroscopy demonstrated significant dropout and dilatation of nailfold capillaries in patients with childhood dermatomyositis or scleroderma compared with children with other rheumatologic diseases and controls [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/juvenile-dermatomyositis-and-polymyositis-diagnosis/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. Of the 25 patients with JDM for whom muscle biopsies were available, there was good correlation between the severity and number of vascular abnormalities on biopsy (eg, nonnecrotizing vasculitis or significant loss of capillary bed) and an increased likelihood of having nailfold capillaroscopic abnormalities.</p><p>In patients with JDM, abnormal nailfold capillaroscopy correlated with increased skin involvement, but not muscle weakness, in several studies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/juvenile-dermatomyositis-and-polymyositis-diagnosis/abstract/14,17\" class=\"abstract_t\">14,17</a>]. However, in one study, loss of nailfold capillary density correlated with both muscle weakness and skin disease activity over time [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/juvenile-dermatomyositis-and-polymyositis-diagnosis/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. The likelihood of nailfold changes increases with the duration of untreated disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/juvenile-dermatomyositis-and-polymyositis-diagnosis/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Measurement of muscle enzymes</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Elevated serum muscle enzyme levels are markers for muscle damage and, when present, support the diagnosis of JDM or JPM. However, these enzymes may arise from sources other than muscle, even in patients with muscle weakness. In addition, normal levels do not exclude these diagnoses.</p><p>The muscle enzymes routinely tested in the evaluation of myopathy include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Creatine kinase (CK)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Lactate dehydrogenase (LDH)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Aldolase</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Alanine aminotransferase (ALT)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Aspartate aminotransferase (AST)</p><p/><p>Although the majority of children with JDM and JPM will have serum elevation of one or more of these enzymes, some patients may have normal values despite clinically evident weakness. This was illustrated in a retrospective study of 166 patients with JDM that reported normal serum levels of CK, LDH, and aldolase in 26, 13, and 17 percent of patients, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/juvenile-dermatomyositis-and-polymyositis-diagnosis/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>].

Thus, MRI, either full body or of the thigh and shoulder muscles, is increasingly used in the diagnosis of childhood inflammatory myopathy to avoid the morbidity of muscle biopsy and EMG (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F63190\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef63190 \">picture 2</a>). Whole-body MRI is emerging as an important method of determining the extent of muscle disease and following patients with JDM and JPM [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/juvenile-dermatomyositis-and-polymyositis-diagnosis/abstract/19-21\" class=\"abstract_t\">19-21</a>].</p><p>Of 122 children with various stages of JDM evaluated in one study from the United Kingdom and Ireland, 78 of 102 patients (76 percent) who underwent MRI had abnormalities consistent with myositis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/juvenile-dermatomyositis-and-polymyositis-diagnosis/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. In this cohort, EMG was performed in only 8 percent of patients and muscle biopsy in 36 percent.</p><p>Another study of 19 patients with JDM (15 with active and 4 with inactive disease) and 5 healthy controls evaluated the role of MRI in the diagnosis of JDM [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/juvenile-dermatomyositis-and-polymyositis-diagnosis/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. All patients with clinically active disease had abnormal findings on MRI compared with none of the patients with inactive disease or controls. The abnormalities included increased signal intensity (on T2 or short tau inversion recovery [STIR] images) of the affected muscle, perimuscular edema, enhanced chemical shift artifact, and increased signal intensity in subcutaneous fat. Higher muscle signal intensity on MRI correlated with decreased muscle strength. After therapy, signal intensity in the muscle returned to normal.</p><p>MRI has also been used to detect flares in muscle disease when other studies were less helpful [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/juvenile-dermatomyositis-and-polymyositis-diagnosis/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>].</p><p>Magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) is a research tool that is not yet routinely available. It can detect irregularities in muscle function and metabolism in inflammatory myopathy. In a study of 13 children with JDM, MRS identified metabolic abnormalities in the quadriceps muscle of 10 patients with severe clinical weakness [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/juvenile-dermatomyositis-and-polymyositis-diagnosis/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>].

It is helpful in distinguishing muscle weakness caused by muscle denervation, which may be due to motor neuron disease and myasthenia gravis, from that caused by inflammatory myopathy (eg, JDM).
