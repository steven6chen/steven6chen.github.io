It may arise via contiguous spread from adjacent structures or by the hematogenous route from a distant site. The incidence is rare, but the frequency of this diagnosis has increased with the use of computed tomography, prior to which most cases were diagnosed at postmortem [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/psoas-abscess/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].

From this origin, it courses downward across the pelvic brim, passes deep to the inguinal ligament and anterior to the hip joint capsule to form a tendon that inserts into the lesser trochanter of the femur. The iliacus muscle joins the psoas to insert via the same tendon. The iliacus and psoas muscles are the main hip flexors.</p><p>The psoas and iliacus are sometimes considered together as the iliopsoas muscle, located in an extraperitoneal space called the iliopsoas compartment. The tendon is separated from the hip capsule by the iliopsoas bursa. This bursa is in communication with the hip joint space in up to 15 percent of persons, which may facilitate spread of infection between these sites.</p><p>The psoas muscle is situated near a number of important anatomical structures including the vertebral bodies, the abdominal aorta, the sigmoid colon, the appendix, the hip joint, and iliac lymph nodes. Infection may spread directly between these structures and the psoas muscle.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">PATHOGENESIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Psoas abscesses may be divided into primary and secondary abscesses according to the pathogenesis.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Primary abscess</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Primary psoas abscess occurs as a result of hematogenous or lymphatic seeding from a distant site (which may be occult) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/psoas-abscess/abstract/2-4\" class=\"abstract_t\">2-4</a>]. Risk factors include diabetes, intravenous drug use, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection, renal failure, and other forms of immunosuppression [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/psoas-abscess/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>]. Trauma and hematoma formation can predispose to development of psoas abscess [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/psoas-abscess/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].</p><p>Primary psoas abscesses tend to occur in children and young adults [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/psoas-abscess/abstract/2,3,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,3,5</a>]. They are more common in tropical and developing countries. In Asia and Africa, 99 percent of iliopsoas abscesses are primary; in Europe and North America, 17 to 61 percent are primary [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/psoas-abscess/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].

Vertebral osteomyelitis or discitis can give rise to psoas abscess when infection spreads from bone and perforates the psoas sheath. Psoas abscess may be accompanied by involvement of the epidural space with epidural abscess formation due to spread of infection from the vertebral body [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/psoas-abscess/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. Vertebral osteomyelitis with a psoas abscess has been reported as a complication of epidural catheter use [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/psoas-abscess/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>].

In one series of 106 patients admitted with hip arthroplasty infection, psoas abscess was observed in 12 percent of cases. Hematogenous infection and history of neoplasm were predictors of psoas abscess [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/psoas-abscess/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>].

Therefore, if there is any supportive evidence for this diagnosis, then echocardiography should be considered.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H16\"><span class=\"h2\">Histopathology</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Biopsy material should be sent for histopathology evaluation as this may be useful for identification of mycobacterial infection as well as an alternative diagnosis such as tumor [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/psoas-abscess/abstract/50\" class=\"abstract_t\">50</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10839964\"><span class=\"h1\">DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The differential diagnosis of psoas abscess includes:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Psoas muscle hematoma &ndash; This occurs most often in the setting of anticoagulation or a bleeding disorder. Psoas abscess and psoas hematoma present with similar clinical manifestations, including back or flank pain and fever; they may be distinguished radiographically.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Retrocecal appendicitis &ndash; Patients with retrocecal appendicitis may not exhibit marked localized tenderness in the right lower quadrant since the appendix does not come into contact with the anterior parietal peritoneum. Rather, retrocecal appendicitis may be associated with a &quot;psoas sign&quot; (right lower quadrant pain with passive hip extension). The inflamed appendix may lie against the right psoas muscle, causing the patient to shorten the muscle by drawing up the right knee. Patients with retrocecal appendicitis typically have pain in the retrovesical pouch during a rectal exam, whereas those with a psoas abscess do not. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acute-appendicitis-in-adults-clinical-manifestations-and-differential-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Acute appendicitis in adults: Clinical manifestations and differential diagnosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Iliopsoas bursitis &ndash; Iliopsoas bursitis can occur in the setting of rheumatoid arthritis, trauma, or overuse injuries. Infection generally occurs as a result of hematogenous or contiguous spread of infection or, in rare cases, direct inoculation in the setting of corticosteroid injection. In a minority of patients, the iliopsoas bursa is in direct communication with the hip joint. Therefore, in this setting, infection at one of these sites can easily extend to the other. The diagnosis is suggested in the setting of normal psoas muscle imaging and presence of localized hip pain. Deep septic bursitis is confirmed by bursa aspiration. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=septic-bursitis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Septic bursitis&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Septic hip arthritis &ndash; Patients with septic hip arthritis present with joint pain, swelling, and restricted movement. The diagnosis is established by joint aspiration with findings of leukocytosis and positive bacterial culture results. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=septic-arthritis-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Septic arthritis in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H17\"><span class=\"h1\">TREATMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Management of psoas abscess consists of drainage and prompt initiation of appropriate antibiotic therapy. Secondary abscess also requires management of the adjacent infected focus (such as ruptured viscus, fistula, or infected aortic aneurysm).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H18\"><span class=\"h2\">Drainage</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Abscess drainage may be achieved with percutaneous or surgical intervention. Percutaneous drainage (by ultrasound or computed tomographic guidance) is an appropriate initial approach; in one study, this technique was successful in 90 percent of cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/psoas-abscess/abstract/1,2,17,50,51\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2,17,50,51</a>]. Following needle aspiration, a pigtail catheter may be placed in situ to allow further drainage. The percutaneous catheter may be removed when drainage has ceased, the patient's condition has improved, and repeat imaging demonstrates that the drainage has been satisfactory.</p><p>Surgical drainage may be warranted in the setting of percutaneous drainage failure; there are no studies directly comparing open and percutaneous approaches. Indications for surgical drainage include multiloculated abscesses and significant involvement of an adjacent structure requiring surgical management [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/psoas-abscess/abstract/2,38\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,38</a>]. Options for surgical drainage include laparoscopic and open surgical drainage. Advantages of laparoscopy include the extraperitoneal nature of the procedure, the capability to break down loculations, and rapid postoperative recovery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/psoas-abscess/abstract/52\" class=\"abstract_t\">52</a>].</p><p>Open drainage via an extraperitoneal approach was previously the surgical intervention of choice; in one series, successful outcomes were described in 97 percent of patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/psoas-abscess/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Open surgical drainage may be warranted in the setting of a multiloculated psoas abscess, an abscess secondary to bowel disease (eg, Crohn's disease) in which bowel resection may be necessary [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/psoas-abscess/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>], or a psoas abscess with a gas-forming organism [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/psoas-abscess/abstract/53\" class=\"abstract_t\">53</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H19\"><span class=\"h2\">Antibiotics</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In general, directed antimicrobial therapy (based on the results of cultures and smears) is preferable to empiric therapy. It is preferable to attempt to make definitive diagnosis before initiating antibiotic therapy. For circumstances in which prompt microbial diagnosis is not feasible, empiric antibiotic therapy should include activity against <em>S. aureus</em> (including activity against methicillin-resistant <em>S. aureus</em> in regions where prevalence is substantial) and enteric organisms (both aerobic and anaerobic enteric flora) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F64723\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef64723 \">table 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/psoas-abscess/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>].</p><p>Antimicrobial therapy should be tailored to culture and susceptibility results. Evidence of mycobacterial infection should prompt management as described in detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-pulmonary-tuberculosis-in-hiv-infected-adults-initiation-of-therapy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of pulmonary tuberculosis in HIV-infected adults: Initiation of therapy&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-drug-susceptible-pulmonary-tuberculosis-in-hiv-uninfected-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of drug-susceptible pulmonary tuberculosis in HIV-uninfected adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Parenteral antibiotics should be administered in conjunction with psoas abscess drainage. Antibiotics alone are unlikely to be curative, although some success with antibiotic therapy alone has been reported in a small number of patients with abscesses &lt;3 cm [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/psoas-abscess/abstract/17,38\" class=\"abstract_t\">17,38</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H18\" class=\"local\">'Drainage'</a> above.)</p><p>The optimal duration of antibiotics is uncertain; three to six weeks of therapy following adequate drainage is likely appropriate; the decision on duration of therapy may be impacted by the presence of osteomyelitis, for example [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/psoas-abscess/abstract/22,38\" class=\"abstract_t\">22,38</a>]. Follow-up imaging should be performed near the end of the planned course of antimicrobial therapy to ensure satisfactory response to therapy. Most, if not all, cases of tuberculous psoas abscesses have associated vertebral osteomyelitis. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=skeletal-tuberculosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Skeletal tuberculosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H20\"><span class=\"h1\">OUTCOME</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Psoas abscess can portend significant morbidity and mortality. In one series, mortality due to primary and secondary abscess was 2.4 and 19 percent, respectively; in untreated cases, mortality may approach 100 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/psoas-abscess/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Risk factors for mortality include delayed or inadequate treatment, advanced age, the presence of bacteremia, and infection due to <em>E. coli</em> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/psoas-abscess/abstract/5,38\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,38</a>].</p><p>Relapse can occur up to one year after initial presentation; this outcome has been reported in 15 to 36 percent of cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/psoas-abscess/abstract/5,27,54\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,27,54</a>]. Recurrence may be associated with inadequate drainage or inadequate antimicrobial therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/psoas-abscess/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. In addition, presence of hip flexion deformity at clinical presentation may not completely resolve as a result to fibrosis within the iliopsoas sheath [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/psoas-abscess/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H21\"><span class=\"h1\">SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A psoas (or iliopsoas) abscess is a collection of pus in the iliopsoas muscle compartment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/psoas-abscess/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. It may arise via contiguous spread from adjacent structures (secondary abscess) or by the hematogenous route from a distant site (primary abscess). (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Pathogenesis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Primary psoas abscesses are most frequently due to infection with a single organism. In regions where <em>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</em> is endemic, this is a frequent cause of psoas abscess. The most common bacterial cause is <em>Staphylococcus aureus</em>, including methicillin-resistant <em>S. aureus</em> (MRSA). Secondary psoas abscess may be monomicrobial or polymicrobial and frequently consist of enteric organisms (both aerobic and anaerobic bacteria). (See <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'Microbiology'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Symptoms and signs of psoas abscess include back or flank pain, fever, inguinal mass, limp, anorexia, and weight loss. Pain may localize to the back, flank, or lower abdomen, with or without radiation to the hip <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> the posterior aspect of the thigh. Limitation of hip movement is common, and patients frequently prefer to be in a position of less discomfort that includes hip flexion and lumbar lordosis. Pain is exacerbated when performing movements in which the psoas muscle is stretched or extended; the &quot;psoas sign&quot; is pain brought on by extension of the hip. (See <a href=\"#H8\" class=\"local\">'Clinical manifestations'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The diagnosis of a psoas abscess may be suspected on clinical grounds and confirmed on imaging studies. Computed tomography (CT) is the optimal radiographic modality to evaluate for psoas abscess. Blood samples and abscess material should be sent to the microbiology lab for Gram stain and bacterial culture. Acid-fast bacilli smear and mycobacterial culture should also be performed in the setting of risk for tuberculosis. (See <a href=\"#H13\" class=\"local\">'Diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Management of psoas abscess consists of drainage and prompt initiation of appropriate antibiotic therapy.
