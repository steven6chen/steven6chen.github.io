Among those who are admitted to an ICU, the most common indications are postpartum hemorrhage and hypertensive disorders. Acute respiratory failure requiring mechanical ventilation is a rare complication of pregnancy affecting 0.1 to 0.2 percent of pregnancies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-respiratory-failure-during-pregnancy-and-the-peripartum-period/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].</p><p>The clinical presentation, differential diagnosis, most common causes, and management of acute respiratory failure during pregnancy and the peripartum period are reviewed here. Other critical illnesses associated with pregnancy are described separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=critical-illness-during-pregnancy-and-the-peripartum-period\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Critical illness during pregnancy and the peripartum period&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL PRESENTATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients with acute respiratory failure during pregnancy or the peripartum period generally present with respiratory distress [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-respiratory-failure-during-pregnancy-and-the-peripartum-period/abstract/5-7\" class=\"abstract_t\">5-7</a>]. They are typically dyspneic and unable to speak in complete sentences. Confusion, somnolence, agitation, diaphoresis, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> cyanosis are common.</p><p>Most patients are breathing rapidly (tachypnea) and shallowly (small tidal volumes), while using their accessory muscles of respiration. Ausculatory findings vary according to the cause of the acute respiratory failure, but may include crackles, rhonchi, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> wheezes. Consolidation may be evident, as indicated by bronchophony, egophony, or whisper pectoriloquy.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">INITIAL MANAGEMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Initial management is the same regardless of the cause of the acute respiratory failure. Supplemental oxygen should be administered. The preferred method of administering the oxygen depends upon the severity of the hypoxemia. For patients with mild hypoxemia, administration via nasal cannula may be sufficient. More severe hypoxemia generally requires administration via a facemask, high flow nasal cannula, or a nonrebreather mask. Oxygenation should be monitored continuously by pulse oximetry. A reasonable goal for pregnant patients is to maintain the oxyhemoglobin saturation &ge;95 percent to optimize the fetal oxygen content. Adequate fetal oxygenation requires a maternal arterial oxygen tension (PaO<sub>2</sub>) &gt;70 mmHg, which corresponds to an oxyhemoglobin saturation of 95 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-respiratory-failure-during-pregnancy-and-the-peripartum-period/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].</p><p>Mechanical ventilation may be required. The decision about whether to intubate a patient should be considered in the context of pregnancy. Pregnant women have hypocapnia due to hyperventilation at baseline. Thus, the arterial carbon dioxide tension (PaCO<sub>2</sub>) tends to be lower in pregnant woman than in nonpregnant individuals with a similar degree of respiratory failure. The decision to intubate is discussed elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=the-decision-to-intubate\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;The decision to intubate&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Intubation may be difficult during pregnancy and the peripartum period due to upper airway edema and diminished airway caliber, especially late in pregnancy. The process of intubation and the initiation of mechanical ventilation are also reviewed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=approach-to-the-difficult-airway-in-adults-outside-the-operating-room\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Approach to the difficult airway in adults outside the operating room&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=induction-agents-for-rapid-sequence-intubation-in-adults-outside-the-operating-room\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Induction agents for rapid sequence intubation in adults outside the operating room&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=advanced-emergency-airway-management-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Advanced emergency airway management in adults&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=rapid-sequence-intubation-for-adults-outside-the-operating-room\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Rapid sequence intubation for adults outside the operating room&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-mechanical-ventilation\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of mechanical ventilation&quot;</a>.)</p><p>An arterial blood analysis (ABG) and chest radiograph should be obtained after initial stabilization:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The ABG identifies and quantitates the severity of any ventilatory abnormalities. It also guides ventilator adjustments in mechanically ventilated patients. Ventilatory goals are different in pregnant patients. The target PaCO<sub>2</sub> is 30 to 32 mmHg, since this is the normal level during pregnancy. Marked respiratory alkalosis should be avoided because it may decrease uterine blood flow. Maternal permissive hypercapnia may also be deleterious to the fetus because of resultant fetal respiratory acidosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-respiratory-failure-during-pregnancy-and-the-peripartum-period/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. Arterial catheterization may be helpful if frequent arterial blood gases are likely to be needed.

Approximately 50 percent of the cases of pulmonary edema were attributed to tocolytic therapy or cardiac disease. The remaining cases were ascribed to either preeclampsia or iatrogenic volume overload. Preterm labor increases the risk of pulmonary edema, likely due to the increased exposure of these patients to tocolytic therapy as outlined below. As an example, a case control study demonstrated pulmonary edema occurred in 6.7 percent of patients with preterm labor between 24 and 33 weeks gestation; among this population, exposure to antenatal corticosteroid therapy and tocolytic medications were major risk factors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-respiratory-failure-during-pregnancy-and-the-peripartum-period/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h3\">Tocolytics</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The use of tocolytic beta-2 agonists (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=terbutaline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">terbutaline</a>) to inhibit preterm labor is associated with pulmonary edema. This is more common among pregnancies complicated by multiple gestations or maternal infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-respiratory-failure-during-pregnancy-and-the-peripartum-period/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>], and among women who receive multiple tocolytic agents simultaneously [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-respiratory-failure-during-pregnancy-and-the-peripartum-period/abstract/12,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,15</a>].

Pregnant women are predisposed to fluid overload because they tend to receive a large amount of intravenous fluid in response to hypotension caused by peripheral vasodilation.</p><p>The clinical presentation of tocolytic-related pulmonary edema is nearly identical to that of other types of pulmonary edema: dyspnea, tachypnea, tachycardia, hypoxemia, and diffuse crackles. Chest pain and a cough may also be present. The chest radiograph reveals bilateral air space disease. A review of 58 case reports and case series found that the following findings were most frequent in tocolytic-related pulmonary edema [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-respiratory-failure-during-pregnancy-and-the-peripartum-period/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Basilar crackles (100 percent)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Bilateral air space disease on chest radiograph (81 percent)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Shortness of breath (76 percent)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Chest pain (24 percent)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Cough (17 percent)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Fever (14 percent)</p><p/><p>The diagnosis of tocolytic-related pulmonary edema is made when these findings develop in a woman who is receiving tocolytic therapy with a beta-2 agonist in the absence of an alternative explanation for acute respiratory failure. There are no definitive diagnostic tests.</p><p>Most patients with tocolytic-related pulmonary edema respond well to discontinuation of the tocolytic beta-2 agonist, supplemental oxygen, fluid restriction, and diuresis. Mechanical ventilation may be necessary. Most cases resolve within 12 to 24 hours. Persistence of symptoms beyond this time period should prompt reconsideration of the diagnosis. Mortality is uncommon.</p><p>Alternative tocolytics that can be used after discontinuation of the beta-2 agonist are reviewed separately.

Cardiogenic pulmonary edema can be a consequence of preexisting or new cardiac disease.

In a case series that included 1276 patients with severe preeclampsia or eclampsia, 3 percent developed pulmonary edema [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-respiratory-failure-during-pregnancy-and-the-peripartum-period/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. Among those with pulmonary edema, 70 percent developed this complication during the postpartum period (mean of 71 hours after delivery) and 11 percent died. Patients who were older or multigravid were at the greatest risk for pulmonary edema. Pulmonary edema was often accompanied by dysfunction of another organ system, such as disseminated intravascular coagulation, acute renal failure, hypertensive crisis, cardiopulmonary arrest, or cerebral edema.</p><p>Pulmonary edema associated with preeclampsia and eclampsia is multifactorial. Fluid overload, decreased plasma oncotic pressure, increased capillary permeability, and increased pulmonary capillary hydrostatic pressures all appear to play a role [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-respiratory-failure-during-pregnancy-and-the-peripartum-period/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. The increased hydrostatic pressure is probably due to arterial vasospasm causing elevated cardiac afterload [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-respiratory-failure-during-pregnancy-and-the-peripartum-period/abstract/26,27\" class=\"abstract_t\">26,27</a>].</p><p>The clinical presentation of severe preeclampsia- or eclampsia-related pulmonary edema is nearly identical to that of other types of pulmonary edema: dyspnea, tachypnea, tachycardia, hypoxemia, and diffuse crackles.

The chest radiograph reveals bilateral air space disease.</p><p>The diagnosis is made when these findings develop in a woman who has severe preeclampsia or eclampsia in the absence of an alternative explanation for acute respiratory failure. There is no definitive diagnostic test. Recognition of both preeclampsia and eclampsia is reviewed elsewhere.

Diuresis is indicated if there is fluid overload. However, clinicians must be careful to avoid compromising cardiac output and placental perfusion because many patients already have reduced cardiac preload due to intravascular depletion. Mechanical ventilation may be necessary. The treatment of preeclampsia and eclampsia is discussed separately.

However, the reduction in cell-mediated immunity that is associated with pregnancy (especially during the third trimester) also places women at increased risk for severe pneumonia and disseminated disease from atypical pathogens, such as herpesvirus, varicella, and coccidioidomycosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-respiratory-failure-during-pregnancy-and-the-peripartum-period/abstract/32,33\" class=\"abstract_t\">32,33</a>].

Auscultation may reveal focal crackles, rhonchi, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> evidence of consolidation (eg, bronchophony, egophony, whisper pectoriloquy). Chest radiographs generally demonstrate focal air space disease. Gram stain of the sputum may reveal abundant polymorphonuclear leukocytes, while a culture of the sputum may grow the pathogen.

This is probably because the effects of sedation, analgesia, increased intraabdominal pressure, and recumbency are added to pre-existing factors that predispose pregnant women to aspirate. These factors include increased intra-abdominal pressure, relaxation of the lower esophageal sphincter, and delayed gastric emptying. Aspiration may also be a complication of general anesthesia and intubation during an emergent cesarean delivery.</p><p>Aspiration may induce chemical pneumonitis, airway obstruction, or acute bronchospasm:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Chemical pneumonitis can be difficult to distinguish from pneumonia because the clinical manifestations are similar (see <a href=\"#H10\" class=\"local\">'Pneumonia'</a> above). Features that favor aspiration over pneumonia include an abrupt onset of symptoms and signs, a cough productive of material that resembles gastric contents, diffuse crackles, and chest radiograph infiltrates that are multifocal and predominate in the dependent portions of the lung. In addition, fevers tend to be low-grade. The diagnosis of pneumonitis is made when compatible symptoms and signs occur within the correct clinical context and there is no better explanation for the clinical findings. Treatment is supportive. This may include supplemental oxygen, suctioning, and, if necessary, ventilatory assistance. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aspiration-pneumonia-in-adults#H6\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Aspiration pneumonia in adults&quot;, section on 'Chemical pneumonitis'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Airway obstruction typically presents with dyspnea and impaired ventilation and oxygenation. Physical findings vary depending upon the site of obstruction. Laryngeal, subglottic, or tracheal obstruction may cause stridor, while obstruction distal to the carina may induce asymmetric wheezing. These clinical findings are generally unresponsive to bronchodilators. The diagnosis is made by direct bronchoscopic visualization of the obstruction. Treatment is bronchoscopic removal of the obstructing foreign body. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-presentation-diagnostic-evaluation-and-management-of-central-airway-obstruction-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical presentation, diagnostic evaluation, and management of central airway obstruction in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Acute bronchospasm due to aspiration is difficult to distinguish from an asthma exacerbation because the symptoms and signs may be identical. Features that favor acute bronchospasm due to aspiration over an asthma exacerbation include an acute onset (ie, no prodrome) and coexisting evidence of aspiration (eg, witnessed aspiration, multifocal infiltrates in the dependent areas of the lung). The diagnosis is made when compatible symptoms and signs occur within the correct clinical context and there is no better explanation for the clinical findings. The treatment is the same as that for an asthma exacerbation. (See <a href=\"#H11\" class=\"local\">'Asthma exacerbation'</a> above.)</p><p/><p>Some patients who have aspirated progress to aspiration pneumonia or acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-respiratory-failure-during-pregnancy-and-the-peripartum-period/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>].

This appears to be a consequence of several factors, including changes in the clotting factors and an increased likelihood of venous stasis.
