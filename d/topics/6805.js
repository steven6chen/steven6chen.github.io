Coma is therefore the most profound degree to which the two components of consciousness, arousal and awareness, can be diminished. Less profound states of impaired consciousness (stupor, lethargy, obtundation) preserve one or more of these components to some degree.</p><p>Coma represents an acute, life-threatening emergency, requiring prompt intervention for preservation of life and brain function. Although discussed separately, the assessment and management are performed jointly in practice (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F62416\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef62416 \">table 1</a>).</p><p>This topic will discuss the evaluation of children presenting in stupor or coma.

The ARAS is a loosely organized network of neurons within the brainstem whose major function is to modulate arousal in response to signals from the environment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-stupor-and-coma-in-children/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Awareness is based on an even more widely distributed network of connections between cortical and subcortical structures [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-stupor-and-coma-in-children/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].</p><p>Consciousness can be diminished or abolished by dysfunction within the brainstem, impairment of both cerebral hemispheres, or insults that globally depress neuronal activity. The latter include metabolic disturbances and disorders that deplete substrates for cerebral metabolism, alter neuronal cell homeostasis, or interfere with neuronal excitability. Unilateral cerebral lesions may cause coma if they compress or injure contralateral or brainstem structures.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">DEFINITIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There is a spectrum of impaired consciousness between full arousal and complete unresponsiveness.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Coma</strong> &ndash; Coma, a state of &quot;unarousable unresponsiveness,&quot; is the most profound degree to which arousal and consciousness are impaired [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-stupor-and-coma-in-children/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Lethargy</strong> &ndash; Lethargy, obtundation, and stupor refer to states in which arousal is somewhat less impaired. These patients have some difficulty maintaining attention during an examination, tend to fall asleep when not stimulated, and respond poorly (if at all) to questions and commands. These terms are imprecise. In clinical situations, it is more useful to describe the patient's responses to specific stimuli.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Delirium</strong> &ndash; Delirium is a disturbance of consciousness with reduced ability to focus, sustain, or shift attention. Patients with hyperactive delirium show both hyperactivity and diminished sleep. Confusion, excitement, hallucinations, and irritability are common. Patients with hypoactive delirium have little interaction with their environment and often appear somnolent. Delirium is caused by a subset of conditions that can lead to coma, including medical conditions, substance intoxications, and medication side effects (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F59893\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef59893 \">table 2</a>).

Such patients often have reflexive vocalizations (sounds but not words), facial expressions, and movements that can be misinterpreted by hopeful observers as reflecting awareness of their internal or external environment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-stupor-and-coma-in-children/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].

They can at least occasionally demonstrate purposeful movements or responses. These can include following simple commands, making gestural or verbal responses to questions, making intelligible verbalizations, smiling or crying in response to evocative sounds or images, reaching accurately toward the location of an object, or fixating on and pursuing visual stimuli [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-stupor-and-coma-in-children/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. Functional neuroimaging studies suggest that these patients have a different, less severe neuroanatomic substrate than do patients in PVS [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-stupor-and-coma-in-children/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Brain death</strong> &ndash; Brain death criteria include coma, apnea, and absent brainstem reflexes.

With the exception of abusive head trauma, nontraumatic causes are more frequent in infancy and early childhood. The relative frequency of causes of nontraumatic coma varies according to the geographic location and demographic makeup of the population. In most series, infection is the leading cause, composing 30 to 60 percent of cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-stupor-and-coma-in-children/abstract/14-17\" class=\"abstract_t\">14-17</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h1\">EVALUATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Coma is a medical emergency whose evaluation requires a rapid, comprehensive, and systematic approach.

Examples include a child who presents after a drowning injury or a child with diabetes presenting with hypoglycemic coma or with cerebral edema from diabetic ketoacidosis.</p><p>The history of symptoms leading up to coma may also provide clues. Coma of abrupt and unexplained onset suggests intracranial hemorrhage, seizure, trauma, or intoxication. A gradual deterioration of mental status suggests an infectious process, metabolic abnormality, or slowly expanding intracranial mass lesion. A history of preceding headache, double vision, or nausea suggests increased intracranial pressure (ICP). Inborn errors of metabolism may also present with slowly evolving coma or recurrent episodic coma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-stupor-and-coma-in-children/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>].

Sympathomimetic and anticholinergic drugs also cause dilated pupils (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F71268\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef71268 \">table 4</a>).</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h3\">Eye movements</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Persistent conjugate eye deviation to one side may suggest injury to the ipsilateral cerebral hemisphere or ongoing seizure activity arising from the contralateral hemisphere. Accompanying nystagmus also suggests seizure.</p><p>The presence of bilateral conjugate roving eye movements that appear full indicate an intact brainstem, and further reflex testing is not required. Otherwise, eye movements can be tested in comatose patients using reflex maneuvers:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In the oculocephalic (doll's eye) reflex, the head is rotated to one side. With an intact brainstem, the eyes do not turn with the head but move in the opposite direction, thus appearing to maintain visual fixation (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F61416\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef61416 \">figure 1</a>). When comatose patients have possible cervical spine injury, this reflex should not be tested. An abnormal response suggests a lesion within the brainstem or cranial nerves; profound metabolic coma or drug intoxication can also impair this reflex.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The oculovestibular (caloric) reflex test assesses the same pathways. Otoscopy should first confirm that the external ear canals are patent and the tympanic membranes are intact. With the head at 30 degrees elevation from horizontal, irrigation of the external ear canal with ice-cold water (10 to 30 mL) induces slow deviation of the eyes toward the irrigated side (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F61416\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef61416 \">figure 1</a>). Five minutes should intervene before the other side is tested. Failure of the eyes to move conjugately as expected suggests a lesion of one or more cranial nerves or their nuclei within the brainstem. Conscious patients also have saccadic eye movements back toward midline that attempt to maintain visual fixation. When this occurs in an unresponsive patient, a psychogenic origin is suspected.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h3\">Other brainstem reflexes</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The corneal reflex tests the sensory function of the trigeminal nerve and the motor function of the facial nerve. The patient's cornea is lightly touched with a fine wisp of cotton or a drop of sterile water; an intact reflex produces a bilateral (direct and consensual) eye blink. Bilaterally absent corneal reflexes can be seen with extensive structural lesions within the pons, but also occur with metabolic disorders, intoxication, sedation, and paralysis.</p><p>The gag reflex requires intact function of the glossopharyngeal and vagal nerves (cranial nerves IX and X), and produces palate elevation with stimulation of each side of the posterior wall of the oropharynx. When a patient is intubated, endotracheal tube manipulation or suctioning to elicit a cough is often used as an alternative. However, cervical spinal cord reflexes can also mediate this response.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14\"><span class=\"h3\">Motor responses</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The motor examination in the comatose child should assess muscle tone, observe spontaneous and stimulus-elicited movements, and test deep tendon reflexes. Painful stimuli (eg, pressure applied to nail bed or supraorbital ridge) are often used to elicit motor responses in an unconscious child. Asymmetries may suggest involvement of the corticospinal tracts in the cerebral hemisphere or brainstem. The presence of spontaneous or purposeful limb movements (eg, withdrawing from or pushing away a painful stimulus) suggests a lighter depth of coma.</p><p>Abnormal flexion or extension of the arms and legs may occur spontaneously or in response to stimulation. Decerebrate posturing includes extension and internal rotation of the arms and legs; decorticate posturing produces adduction and flexion at the elbows, wrists, and fingers, with leg extension and rotation (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F61697\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef61697 \">figure 2</a>). Classically, decerebrate posturing implies brainstem involvement from a compressive or destructive process, while decorticate posturing implies a more rostral and potentially less dire insult.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H16\"><span class=\"h1\">COMA SYNDROMES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Certain coma syndromes are important to recognize, as they may guide diagnostic evaluation and initial management.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H17\"><span class=\"h2\">Transtentorial herniation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Large and rapid expansions induce dramatic increases in intracranial pressure (ICP) and may lead to transtentorial herniation, which can be fatal. Early recognition of the clinical signs of transtentorial herniation (decerebrate or decorticate posturing, periodic respirations, uni- or bilateral pupillary abnormalities, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> hypertension with bradycardia) in a comatose patient is important, as these indicate emergency measures to treat increased ICP. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=elevated-intracranial-pressure-icp-in-children-management\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Elevated intracranial pressure (ICP) in children: Management&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Transtentorial herniation is manifest by progressive appearance of respiratory, motor, and pupillary signs in a comatose patient (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F76974\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef76974 \">figure 3</a>). Relatively early signs of Cheyne-Stokes respiration, decorticate posturing, and small reactive pupils progress to ataxic, irregular respiration, decerebrate posturing, and pupils that are midposition and fixed. Generally, survival does not occur once herniation progresses beyond this point (ie, the lower pontine level) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-stupor-and-coma-in-children/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>].</p><p>In uncal herniation, laterally directed compression leads to asymmetric signs, including the early appearance of third cranial nerve palsy with a unilateral fixed dilated pupil, often deviated downward and laterally. Hemiplegia due to compression of the corticospinal tract in the midbrain often follows immediately. The syndrome then follows the sequence of central herniation (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F76974\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef76974 \">figure 3</a>). </p><p>Other signs of increased ICP, papilledema, and Cushing triad (hypertension, bradycardia, and irregular respirations) may be observed in this setting.</p><p>Some metabolic derangements, intoxications, and seizure states may mimic the early signs of central herniation. Treating all children with these signs as if further herniation is imminent avoids missing an opportunity for preventing irreversible brainstem injury and death [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-stupor-and-coma-in-children/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H18\"><span class=\"h2\">Metabolic encephalopathy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Metabolic coma usually occurs as a progression from delirium to stupor to coma, but more fulminant cases may present in coma. </p><p>A fluctuating examination is common; deficits can include abnormal brainstem reflexes, hypotonia, and even posturing in severe cases. Asymmetries in the examination and pupillary involvement are uncommon in metabolic coma. Multifocal myoclonus is very suggestive of a metabolic etiology. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acute-toxic-metabolic-encephalopathy-in-children\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Acute toxic-metabolic encephalopathy in children&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H19\"><span class=\"h2\">Toxidromes</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Some toxic ingestions are recognized by specific clinical syndromes or toxidromes (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F71268\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef71268 \">table 4</a>). However, children often present with atypical clinical features [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-stupor-and-coma-in-children/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>].

These include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Complete paralysis. Patients with acute lesions of the brainstem, particularly the pons, may be unable to move or speak while retaining awareness. Voluntary vertical eye movements and blinking may be retained. This condition is often called the &quot;locked-in&quot; state. Other causes of severe motor paralysis (eg, Guillain-Barr&eacute; syndrome, botulism) may also cause a similar condition.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Akinetic-mutism or abulia may be produced by lesions in the portions of the frontal lobes responsible for initiating movement. The patient retains awareness and often tracks movements with the eyes but rarely initiates other movements or obeys commands. Tone, reflexes, and postural reflexes usually remain intact.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Psychiatric unresponsiveness and catatonia are unusual in very young patients but may occur in adolescents. These patients often resist passive eye opening, move to avoid noxious stimuli, turn the eyes towards the floor regardless of which side they are lying on, or have nonepileptic seizures. Catatonia is distinguished from coma by the preserved ability to maintain trunk and limb postures, even the ability to sit or stand.</p><p/><p>A careful neurologic examination can usually distinguish these entities from coma, but occasionally a diagnostic test such as electroencephalography (EEG), brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), or <span class=\"nowrap\">electromyography/nerve</span> conduction velocity <span class=\"nowrap\">(EMG/NCV)</span> study is helpful in making the correct diagnosis.

CT quickly detects pathology in need of immediate surgical intervention, including hydrocephalus, herniation, and mass lesions due to infection, neoplasia, hemorrhage, and edema. </p><p>CT should be performed immediately when the examination suggests increased intracranial pressure (ICP; papilledema, bulging fontanelle in infants, or bradycardia with hypertension) or a transtentorial herniation syndrome (see <a href=\"#H17\" class=\"local\">'Transtentorial herniation'</a> above). When lumbar puncture (LP) is indicated, a CT is required in the comatose patient to rule out a mass lesion that might precipitate transtentorial herniation as a result of the procedure.</p><p>Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) provides greater structural detail and is more sensitive for early evidence of encephalitis, infarction, diffuse axonal injury from head injury, petechial hemorrhages, cerebral venous thrombosis, and demyelination [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-stupor-and-coma-in-children/abstract/28-31\" class=\"abstract_t\">28-31</a>]. When initial testing (CT, laboratory studies) does not provide a definitive diagnosis, MRI can be helpful. Additional neuroimaging studies may be suggested by the history or initial CT or MRI, such as magnetic resonance, CT, or conventional angiography for cases of suspected vascular malformation, vasculitis, or venous thrombosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-stupor-and-coma-in-children/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>].

A serum glucose should be drawn as near in time as possible to the CSF, to ensure that the CSF:serum glucose ratio can be calculated accurately. Additional microbiologic tests may be warranted in immunocompromised patients.
