Some patients with FTD also develop a concomitant motor syndrome such as parkinsonism or motor neuron disease (MND). FTD is one of the more common causes of early-onset dementia, with an average age of symptom onset in the sixth decade.</p><p>This topic will review the clinical features and diagnosis of the main clinical syndromes of FTD. The treatment of FTD and the genetics, pathology, and pathogenesis of FTD are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=frontotemporal-dementia-treatment\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Frontotemporal dementia: Treatment&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=frontotemporal-dementia-epidemiology-pathology-and-pathogenesis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Frontotemporal dementia: Epidemiology, pathology, and pathogenesis&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H533509392\"><span class=\"h1\">TERMINOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Terminology for FTD has evolved over time. In 1892, Arnold Pick first described a patient with progressive aphasia and focal frontotemporal atrophy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/frontotemporal-dementia-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Alois Alzheimer later characterized the disorder as &quot;Pick disease,&quot; defined by distinctive round, silver-staining inclusions called Pick bodies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/frontotemporal-dementia-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Subsequent clinicopathologic studies determined that many patients diagnosed clinically with Pick disease did not have Pick neuropathology at autopsy, and thus Pick disease now designates a pathologic diagnosis, rather than a clinical syndrome.</p><p>The term &quot;FTD&quot; has gained favor as an umbrella term for three clinical presentations: behavioral variant FTD (bvFTD) and two forms of primary progressive aphasia (PPA), the nonfluent and semantic variants. Historically, bvFTD has also been called &quot;FTD&quot; or &quot;frontal variant FTD,&quot; while semantic variant PPA has been called &quot;temporal variant FTD&quot; and &quot;semantic dementia.&quot; Nonfluent variant PPA is also referred to as &quot;agrammatic PPA.&quot; The third variant of PPA, the logopenic variant, is typically associated with Alzheimer pathology and is not included as one of the three clinical FTD syndromes.</p><p>The pathology underlying clinically defined FTD is heterogeneous. The term &quot;frontotemporal lobar degeneration&quot; (FTLD) refers to this group of neuropathologic diagnoses, further categorized by abnormal protein inclusions due to tau, TDP-43 (transactive response [Tar, abbreviated &quot;T&quot;] DNA binding protein 43 kDa), and other proteins. A clear distinction between clinical and neuropathologic terminology is important in these disorders, since clinicopathologic series have determined that clinical syndromes often fail to predict underlying pathology.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H533509426\"><span class=\"h1\">BEHAVIORAL VARIANT FTD</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Behavioral variant frontotemporal dementia (bvFTD) is the most common clinical subtype, comprising approximately half of all cases of FTD. The hallmark of bvFTD is progressive change in personality and behavior [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/frontotemporal-dementia-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Behavioral symptoms represent a significant and persistent shift from the premorbid personality.</p><p>Disease onset usually occurs in the sixth decade but has been reported as early as the second decade and as late as the ninth. Symptoms often precede the correct diagnosis by several years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/frontotemporal-dementia-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=frontotemporal-dementia-epidemiology-pathology-and-pathogenesis#H10331468\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Frontotemporal dementia: Epidemiology, pathology, and pathogenesis&quot;, section on 'Epidemiology'</a>.) </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H533509472\"><span class=\"h2\">Clinical presentation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Early behavioral changes of bvFTD include the following:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Disinhibition &ndash; Examples of disinhibition or socially inappropriate behavior include touching or kissing strangers, public urination, and flatulence without concern. Patients may make offensive remarks or invade others' personal space. Patients with FTD may exhibit utilization behaviors, such as playing with objects in their surroundings or taking others' personal items.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Apathy and loss of empathy &ndash; Apathy manifests as losing interest <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> motivation for activities and social relationships. Patients may participate less in conversations and grow passive. Apathy is mistaken frequently for depression, and patients are often referred for psychiatric treatment early in the disease course.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">As patients lose empathy, caregivers may describe patients as cold or unfeeling towards others' emotions. Degeneration of right orbitofrontal and anterior temporal regions may drive the loss of sympathy and empathy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/frontotemporal-dementia-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/5,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,6</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Hyperorality &ndash; Hyperorality and dietary changes manifest as altered food preferences, such as carbohydrate cravings, particularly for sweet foods, and binge eating. Increased consumption of alcohol or tobacco may occur. Patients may eat beyond satiety or put excessive amounts of food in their mouths that cannot be chewed properly. They may attempt to consume inedible objects. This behavior correlates with right orbitofrontal, insular, striatal and hypothalamic degeneration [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/frontotemporal-dementia-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/7-9\" class=\"abstract_t\">7-9</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Compulsive behaviors &ndash; Perseverative, stereotyped, or compulsive ritualistic behaviors include stereotyped speech, simple repetitive movements, and complex ritualistic behaviors such as hoarding, checking, or cleaning. Other behaviors traditionally associated with obsessive compulsive disorder, such as hand washing and germ phobias, are generally absent. Patients with FTD can develop a rigid personality, rigid food preferences, and inflexibility to changes in routine. </p><p/><p>Most patients lack insight into their behavioral changes and the distress experienced by family members [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/frontotemporal-dementia-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. To probe for a history of subtle behavioral changes, it may be useful to ask caregivers about the following [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/frontotemporal-dementia-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Has the patient said or done anything in public that has embarrassed others?</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Does the patient appear to have a lack of disgust?</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Does the patient seem indifferent or oblivious to others' feelings and less warm or affectionate, especially toward grandchildren or pets?</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Have food preferences changed or table manners declined?</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Does the patient seem more concerned with timekeeping or tend to watch the clock?</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Has there been a change in the patient's sense of humor?</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Has the patient developed new hobbies or interests pursued obsessively, especially with a religious or spiritual bent?</p><p/><p>Patients with bvFTD generally lack cranial nerve, sensory, cerebellar, pyramidal, and extrapyramidal motor findings, at least initially. Frontal release signs may be seen, but the diagnostic utility of these signs is low, as they are not specific to FTD. In later stages of FTD, disinhibition and compulsive behaviors often wane as patients grow more apathetic, reflecting further degeneration in the medial frontal cortex [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/frontotemporal-dementia-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. Parkinsonism may also emerge in advanced stages of the disease.</p><p>Approximately 15 to 20 percent of patients with bvFTD develop concomitant motor neuron disease (MND); less frequently they may exhibit clinical features of either corticobasal syndrome (CBS) or progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP). (See <a href=\"#H533511510\" class=\"local\">'Motor syndromes associated with FTD'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H533509621\"><span class=\"h2\">Neuropsychologic testing</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients with bvFTD typically score well on neuropsychologic testing early in the course of the disease. Neuropsychologic measures of executive function test frontal lobe functions referable to the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, a region that is spared in early stages of bvFTD.</p><p>In early bvFTD, damage to medial frontal and orbitofrontal regions results in apathy and disinhibition. Measures of social cognition include impairments in recognition of affect, emotions, and sarcasm [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/frontotemporal-dementia-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>] and difficulty understanding another person's perspective [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/frontotemporal-dementia-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>].</p><p>As disease severity progresses to involve dorsolateral prefrontal regions, executive functions such as set-shifting and verbal fluency decline. Memory and visuospatial functions are usually spared in FTD, although frontal lobe dysfunction can make it appear to families that patients have memory problems. Memory impairment, when present, has been associated with an increased rate of progression in several studies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/frontotemporal-dementia-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/14,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">14,15</a>]. Apathy and poor attention and planning make it challenging to interpret neuropsychologic test results in many patients with bvFTD.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H533509669\"><span class=\"h2\">Neuroimaging</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Structural and functional imaging provides supportive but not diagnostic evidence for bvFTD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/frontotemporal-dementia-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/16,17\" class=\"abstract_t\">16,17</a>], as neuroimaging may appear normal early in the disease course [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/frontotemporal-dementia-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/18,19\" class=\"abstract_t\">18,19</a>]. As the disease progresses, focal frontal or temporal atrophy manifests in 50 to 65 percent of patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/frontotemporal-dementia-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/20-22\" class=\"abstract_t\">20-22</a>] and targets the anterior insula, anterior cingulate cortex, and amygdala [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/frontotemporal-dementia-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/23-26\" class=\"abstract_t\">23-26</a>]. Atrophy may affect one brain hemisphere more than the other; over time, homologous regions in the other hemisphere degenerate.</p><p>The earliest regions of damage in bvFTD include the anterior insula in the right hemisphere, pregenual anterior cingulate, and orbitofrontal cortex. Neuroanatomic-behavior correlation studies reveal that medial frontal and anterior cingulate damage correlates with apathy, while right anterior temporal and right medial frontal atrophy correlates with loss of empathy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/frontotemporal-dementia-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/6,27\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,27</a>]. Damage to orbitofrontal, right insula and striatum correlates with changes in eating behavior [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/frontotemporal-dementia-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/7-9\" class=\"abstract_t\">7-9</a>]. Simple motor stereotypies correlate with striatal atrophy, while complex ritualistic compulsions are related to atrophy in orbitofrontal, caudate, and temporal lobe atrophy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/frontotemporal-dementia-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/28,29\" class=\"abstract_t\">28,29</a>]. In patients with bvFTD and MND, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) may demonstrate atrophy in premotor regions and precentral gyri [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/frontotemporal-dementia-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. </p><p>The sensitivity of structural imaging may vary not only by disease duration but also by the age of disease onset. In an autopsy series of over 100 cases of pathology-confirmed frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD), the majority of cases with an age of onset &lt;65 years had evidence of moderate to severe frontotemporal atrophy and ventricular dilation at autopsy, while only 40 percent of the late-onset cases had severe frontotemporal atrophy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/frontotemporal-dementia-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>].</p><p>Functional neuroimaging studies (single-photon emission computed tomography [SPECT], perfusion MRI, or positron emission tomography [PET]) demonstrating frontal or frontotemporal hypoperfusion or hypometabolism may be more sensitive than MRI in the early stages of disease, but are not in themselves diagnostic [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/frontotemporal-dementia-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/16,17,32\" class=\"abstract_t\">16,17,32</a>]. Diffusion tensor imaging shows abnormal diffusivity in gray matter in these regions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/frontotemporal-dementia-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H533510009\"><span class=\"h2\">Diagnosis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The diagnosis of bvFTD is made primarily by clinical assessment. Brain MRI is required to exclude structural pathology and may provide supporting findings. Neuropsychologic testing can be helpful in patient management but is not diagnostic. Other laboratory tests are typically performed to exclude potentially reversible contributors or causes of cognitive impairment. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-of-cognitive-impairment-and-dementia\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation of cognitive impairment and dementia&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Clinicopathologic studies suggest that bvFTD can be diagnosed fairly reliably as one of the FTLD-spectrum pathologies in life, although occasionally Alzheimer pathology manifests as bvFTD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/frontotemporal-dementia-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>]. Patients are not reliable informants of behavioral problems (because of their lack of insight), and interviewing family members is crucial [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/frontotemporal-dementia-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>]. The presence of abnormal social conduct, eating disorders, stereotyped behaviors, and <span class=\"nowrap\">akinesia/apathy</span> along with the absence of significant memory or visual spatial deficits are very specific (close to 99 percent) and moderately sensitive (80 to 85 percent) for the diagnosis of bvFTD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/frontotemporal-dementia-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/20,23,36-42\" class=\"abstract_t\">20,23,36-42</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H533510277\"><span class=\"h3\">Diagnostic criteria for bvFTD</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In 2011, the International Behavioral Variant FTD Criteria Consortium (FTDC) published new criteria for bvFTD, building upon the 1998 Neary criteria [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/frontotemporal-dementia-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]; the FTDC criteria synthesize clinical features, neuroimaging, neuropathology, and genetic testing [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/frontotemporal-dementia-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/16,17\" class=\"abstract_t\">16,17</a>].</p><p>The FTDC criteria are structured as a diagnostic hierarchy. A diagnosis of possible bvFTD is based solely on the clinical syndrome and aims to identify patients at the mildest stages of disease. Possible bvFTD requires a combination of three of six clinical features:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Disinhibition</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><span class=\"nowrap\">Apathy/inertia</span></p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Loss of <span class=\"nowrap\">sympathy/empathy</span></p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><span class=\"nowrap\">Perseverative/compulsive</span> behaviors</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Hyperorality</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Dysexecutive neuropsychologic profile</p><p/><p>A diagnosis of probable FTD is based on the same clinical criteria, plus demonstrable functional decline and imaging findings that reflect the principal anatomic location of neurodegeneration in bvFTD (ie, frontal <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> temporal lobe atrophy, hypometabolism, or hypoperfusion).</p><p>Both possible and probable bvFTD require the exclusion of other neurologic, medical, and psychiatric disorders that would better account for the pattern of deficits and behavioral disturbance.</p><p>A third diagnostic category, bvFTD with definite FTLD pathology, is satisfied when cases of possible or probable bvFTD are accompanied by either biopsy or postmortem histopathologic evidence of FTLD or evidence of a known pathogenic mutation. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=frontotemporal-dementia-epidemiology-pathology-and-pathogenesis#H10331476\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Frontotemporal dementia: Epidemiology, pathology, and pathogenesis&quot;, section on 'Genetic factors'</a>.)</p><p>Using pathologically confirmed cases of FTLD as a gold standard, the FTDC criteria for possible and probable bvFTD have a sensitivity of 85 and 75 percent, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/frontotemporal-dementia-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H533510349\"><span class=\"h3\">Differential diagnosis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Once systemic medical illness, substance abuse, and non-neurodegenerative neurologic illnesses have been excluded, the main entities considered in the differential diagnosis for bvFTD are psychiatric disorders and other neurodegenerative disorders such as dementia with Lewy bodies and Alzheimer disease (AD). In general, neuroimaging will reliably exclude non-neurodegenerative neurologic diseases affecting the frontal lobes, such as infarction, tumors, abscess, and trauma. </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Psychiatric disorders </strong>&ndash; Depression, obsessive compulsive disorder, and bipolar disorder are often considered in an individual presenting with behavioral or personality changes; in particular, apathy associated with bvFTD is mistaken commonly for depression.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Clues that such changes are early signs of bvFTD rather than depression may include lack of any prior psychiatric history and the emergence of certain specific behaviors such as changes in eating (as opposed to simply decreased appetite) or social faux pas; occasionally, patients with bvFTD can appear euphoric [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/frontotemporal-dementia-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. While the usual age of onset of bvFTD is somewhat older than is typical for a first presentation of major psychiatric disease, there is substantial overlap. Changes are insidious in some, and therefore longitudinal clinical follow-up helps to establish the diagnosis of bvFTD versus psychiatric disease.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Dementia with Lewy bodies</strong> &ndash; In the setting of neurodegenerative disease, delusions and hallucinations are more suggestive of dementia with Lewy bodies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/frontotemporal-dementia-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/43\" class=\"abstract_t\">43</a>]. Psychosis, including hallucinations and delusions, is atypical for FTD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/frontotemporal-dementia-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/43\" class=\"abstract_t\">43</a>], although psychosis may occur in 20 to 50 percent of bvFTD patients who carry the <em>C9ORF72</em> hexanucleotide expansion, the most common genetic cause of sporadic and familial FTD and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/frontotemporal-dementia-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/44,45\" class=\"abstract_t\">44,45</a>].

Patients with AD perform more poorly on measures of cognitive function referable to the medial temporal lobes (ie, episodic memory) and parietal lobes (ie, visuospatial skills and apraxia) than those with bvFTD. Patients with AD often perform poorly on measures of executive function and do not exhibit prominent loss of social cognition.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Structural imaging can help elucidate focal atrophy patterns that differ between bvFTD (frontal and temporal cortices) and AD (medial temporal and parietal cortices) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/frontotemporal-dementia-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/46\" class=\"abstract_t\">46</a>]. Biomarkers that strongly suggest AD include low beta amyloid and high phospho-tau in the cerebrospinal fluid.

It is worth noting that AD and FTLD pathology may co-occur, although this is uncommon. Amyloid PET scans are not covered by most third-party payers, however, rendering them prohibitively expensive for most patients. Clinically, amyloid PET is most helpful in diagnosing early-onset AD.

PPA arises when the language-dominant hemisphere is the principal target of neurodegeneration. PPA is characterized by isolated language deficits during early stages of the disease.</p><p>Three variants of PPA have been described based on the type of language impairment: nonfluent, semantic, and logopenic [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/frontotemporal-dementia-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/49\" class=\"abstract_t\">49</a>]. The patterns of language impairment in PPA reflect the anatomic distribution of peak atrophy sites. As neurodegeneration progresses in later stages of PPA, language remains the most affected cognitive domain, but other cognitive domains may also decline. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H533510605\"><span class=\"h2\">Clinical presentation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The hallmark of PPA is early, progressive language disturbance leading to functional impairment with relative preservation of episodic memory and other cognitive domains. Language dysfunction is apparent during routine conversation <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> through speech and language assessments. Activities of daily living are maintained except those relating to language (eg, difficulty using the telephone) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/frontotemporal-dementia-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/49\" class=\"abstract_t\">49</a>]. While other cognitive functions may be affected later in the course, language dysfunction remains the most impaired domain throughout the disease course. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H533510625\"><span class=\"h3\">Nonfluent variant PPA</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The core feature of nonfluent variant PPA is a motor speech deficit characterized by effortful production of the linguistic units of sound (phonemes). Although word finding is a common complaint across all PPA subtypes, the characteristic that distinguishes the nonfluent variant from other forms of PPA is articulatory difficulty. This is composed of effortful, halting speech with inconsistent speech-sound errors and distortions and agrammatism in language production [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/frontotemporal-dementia-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/49\" class=\"abstract_t\">49</a>].</p><p>At the bedside, apraxia of speech can be tested by having the patient repeat a word such as &quot;caterpillar&quot; or &quot;artillery&quot; rapidly and repeatedly, since these words are particularly challenging to articulate. Vowel distortions and difficulty pronouncing such words iteratively are characteristic of speech apraxia.

(See <a href=\"#H533509472\" class=\"local\">'Clinical presentation'</a> above and <a href=\"#H533511546\" class=\"local\">'Behavioral variant FTD with motor neuron disease'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients with bvFTD typically score well on neuropsychologic tests of executive function and episodic memory early in the disease course. Measures of social cognition may demonstrate impairments in emotion and sarcasm recognition and inability to understand another person's perspective. Apathy and inattention in patients with bvFTD can make the interpretation of neuropsychologic testing challenging. (See <a href=\"#H533509621\" class=\"local\">'Neuropsychologic testing'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Structural imaging in patients with bvFTD often reveals unilateral focal frontal and temporal atrophy that may progress to involve both hemispheres as the disease progresses. Functional imaging reveals hypometabolism and hypoperfusion in the same areas. (See <a href=\"#H533509669\" class=\"local\">'Neuroimaging'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>BvFTD is a clinical diagnosis that requires exclusion of non-neurodegenerative nervous system, medical, and psychiatric disorders in a patient presenting with progressive change in personality and behavior. Diagnostic criteria have been developed by an international consortium, which synthesize clinical features, neuroimaging, neuropathology, and genetic testing. (See <a href=\"#H533510277\" class=\"local\">'Diagnostic criteria for bvFTD'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The differential diagnosis of bvFTD includes primary psychiatric disorders, structural pathology in the frontal or temporal lobes, and other neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer disease (AD) or dementia with Lewy bodies. (See <a href=\"#H533510349\" class=\"local\">'Differential diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The hallmark of PPA is early, progressive language disturbance leading to functional impairment with relative preservation of episodic memory and other cognitive domains. Three variants of PPA have been described based on the type of language impairment: nonfluent, semantic, and logopenic.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>In nonfluent variant PPA, patients present with a motor speech deficit characterized by effortful production of the linguistic units of sound (phonemes). (See <a href=\"#H533510625\" class=\"local\">'Nonfluent variant PPA'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>In semantic variant PPA, patients have impaired single-word comprehension and object naming in the setting of preserved fluency, repetition, and grammar. (See <a href=\"#H533510887\" class=\"local\">'Semantic variant PPA'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>The logopenic variant is characterized by impaired word retrieval and sentence repetition, resulting in slow spontaneous speech with frequent word-finding problems. (See <a href=\"#H533510935\" class=\"local\">'Logopenic variant PPA'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>As with bvFTD, structural and functional imaging in patients with PPA may demonstrate atrophy, hypometabolism, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> hypoperfusion in the frontal <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> temporal lobes, in a pattern specific to the clinical variant. (See <a href=\"#H533510989\" class=\"local\">'Neuroimaging'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>PPA is a clinical diagnosis, made primarily by detailed history and neurologic examination in a patient presenting with progressive language dysfunction with sparing of other cognitive domains. (See <a href=\"#H533511111\" class=\"local\">'Diagnostic criteria for PPA'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>FTD and MND have substantial clinical and neuropathologic overlap. Corticobasal degeneration (CBD) and progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP) are also frequently associated with frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD) pathology, and patients often have clinical features of FTD. (See <a href=\"#H533511510\" class=\"local\">'Motor syndromes associated with FTD'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Genetic testing is available for several mutations that are known to cause familial FTD syndromes. In the absence of a clinical imperative for diagnosis, however, such testing should be done selectively. (See <a href=\"#H533512474\" class=\"local\">'Genetic testing'</a> above.)</p></div><div id=\"topicAgreement\">Use of UpToDate is subject to the <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/legal/license\" class=\"licenseLink\" id=\"sla_in_page\">Subscription and License Agreement</a>.</div><div id=\"references\" class=\"headingAnchor\"><h1>REFERENCES</h1><ol id=\"reference\"><li><a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/frontotemporal-dementia-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/1\" class=\"nounderline abstract_t\">Pick A.
