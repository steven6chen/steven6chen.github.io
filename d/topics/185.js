In children, the spectrum of disease caused by CMV infection ranges from asymptomatic or mild disease in immunologically normal hosts, to severe and potentially life-threatening disease in newborns and immunocompromised children (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F101802\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef101802 \">table 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-cytomegalovirus-infections-in-children/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. </p><p>Postnatally acquired CMV infection in infants, children, and adolescents will be reviewed here. Congenital CMV infection is discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=congenital-cytomegalovirus-infection-clinical-features-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Congenital cytomegalovirus infection: Clinical features and diagnosis&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=congenital-cytomegalovirus-infection-management-and-outcome\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Congenital cytomegalovirus infection: Management and outcome&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">VIROLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Cytomegalovirus (CMV) is a member of the Herpesvirus family, along with Epstein-Barr virus (EBV); herpes simplex viruses (HSV)-1 and 2; varicella-zoster virus (VZV); and human herpesviruses (HHV)-6, -7, and -8. These viruses all share properties, including a genome of double-stranded linear DNA, a virus capsid of icosahedral symmetry, and a viral envelope [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-cytomegalovirus-infections-in-children/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. They also share the biological properties of latency and reactivation, which cause recurrent infections in the host.</p><p>CMV is a member of the subfamily beta <em>Herpesviridae</em>, which also contains HHV-6 and -7. CMV will replicate slowly, often taking as long as 24 hours to produce virus progeny in infected cells and several days to weeks to produce visible cytopathic effect in laboratory cell lines (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F81737\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef81737 \">picture 1</a>). No distinct serotypes of CMV exist; however, strain differences can be detected by molecular analysis of DNA, providing a classification of genotypes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-cytomegalovirus-infections-in-children/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">EPIDEMIOLOGY AND TRANSMISSION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Infection with cytomegalovirus (CMV) occurs commonly; seroepidemiologic studies have shown the prevalence of antibody to CMV is influenced by age, geography, cultural and socioeconomic status, and child-rearing practices. In developing countries, most children are infected by three years of age, whereas in developed countries, such as the United States or United Kingdom, infection occurs throughout childhood and adolescence, with as many as 60 to 80 percent of the population infected with CMV by adulthood [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-cytomegalovirus-infections-in-children/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3568427980\"><span class=\"h2\">Congenital infection</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The epidemiology of congenital CMV infection and CMV infection in pregnancy ares discussed in separate topic reviews. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=congenital-cytomegalovirus-infection-clinical-features-and-diagnosis#H9542611\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Congenital cytomegalovirus infection: Clinical features and diagnosis&quot;, section on 'Epidemiology'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cytomegalovirus-infection-in-pregnancy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Cytomegalovirus infection in pregnancy&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Early postnatal infection</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Early postnatal infection can arise via contact with maternal cervicovaginal secretions during delivery, from breast milk ingestion after delivery, or from blood transfusions. Preterm infants appear to be at greatest risk of acquiring the virus from breast milk [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-cytomegalovirus-infections-in-children/abstract/4-10\" class=\"abstract_t\">4-10</a>]. Transfusion-related postnatal CMV transmission can be prevented by using CMV-seronegative and leukocyte-reduced blood products [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-cytomegalovirus-infections-in-children/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H25\" class=\"local\">'Prevention'</a> below and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cytomegalovirus-infection-in-pregnancy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Cytomegalovirus infection in pregnancy&quot;</a>.)</p><p>CMV infection in very low birth weight (VLBW; birth weight &lt;1500 grams) infants appears to result from reactivation of the virus in the mother. Seropositive mothers who are breast feeding have a high rate of CMV reactivation (96 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-cytomegalovirus-infections-in-children/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. The rate of transmission to the newborn depends upon whether the infant is fed untreated or <span class=\"nowrap\">frozen/thawed</span> breast milk (higher transmission rates occur with untreated breast milk). This was demonstrated in a meta-analysis of 13 studies including 480 VLBW infants, among whom the rate of CMV transmission from breast milk was 15 percent and the rate of symptomatic CMV infection was 7 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-cytomegalovirus-infections-in-children/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. The rate of transmission was higher in studies of infants fed untreated breast milk compared with studies of infants fed <span class=\"nowrap\">frozen/thawed</span> breast milk (18 versus 10 percent). Low birth weight and early transmission of virus in the postnatal period are risk factors for acquiring symptomatic disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-cytomegalovirus-infections-in-children/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].</p><p>In a multicenter, prospective study of 539 very low birth weight infants (VLBW; birth weight &lt;1500 grams), the cumulative incidence of postnatal CMV infection at 12 weeks postnatal age was 7 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-cytomegalovirus-infections-in-children/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. Transmission occurred from CMV-positive breast milk in nearly all (96 percent) of the cases in this cohort and there were no transfusion-related infections. Five of the 29 (17 percent) CMV-infected infants developed symptomatic CMV disease and three infants (10 percent) died. </p><p>Infants with a primary immune disorder of cellular function (eg, severe combined immune deficiency; NK cell disorders; acquired immune disorders, such as human immunodeficiency virus [HIV]) may also manifest severe or fatal postnatally acquired CMV infection. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=severe-combined-immunodeficiency-scid-an-overview\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID): An overview&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nk-cell-deficiency-syndromes-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis#H10\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;NK cell deficiency syndromes: Clinical manifestations and diagnosis&quot;, section on 'Clinical and laboratory features'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Out-of-home child care</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Children not congenitally or perinatally infected with CMV may acquire the virus during the toddler years or preschool years, especially if they are in contact with other children in a group setting. The prevalence of active CMV shedding in the saliva and urine in children in out-of-home child care in the United States ranges from 10 to &gt;80 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-cytomegalovirus-infections-in-children/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. This high prevalence, coupled with the active and often less-than-hygienic daily practices of toddlers, frequently results in horizontal transmission of the virus to both children and adult daycare center workers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-cytomegalovirus-infections-in-children/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. Toddlers who are actively shedding CMV may also transmit the virus to their mothers and family members. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Adolescence</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Adolescence is another period of rapid acquisition of CMV. Sexual activity may be an important risk factor for acquiring CMV infection, and congenital CMV infection and disease can occur in infants born to teenage mothers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-cytomegalovirus-infections-in-children/abstract/13,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,14</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cytomegalovirus-infection-in-pregnancy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Cytomegalovirus infection in pregnancy&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=congenital-cytomegalovirus-infection-clinical-features-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Congenital cytomegalovirus infection: Clinical features and diagnosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Other modes of transmission</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>CMV can be transmitted among family members; a young child most frequently is the index case. CMV infection during pregnancy most often occurs from exposure to an infected toddler in the household, especially if the child attends a group child care setting on a regular basis. Transmission can occur between siblings, from child to parent, and between parents. The sexual transmission of CMV also is well documented. The virus is shed in cervicovaginal secretions and semen. CMV antibody is associated with other indices of sexual activity, such as a history of sexually transmitted disease (STD), and CMV primary infection has been observed in young women with a recent first sexual experience [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-cytomegalovirus-infections-in-children/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>].</p><p>In contrast, nosocomial transmission of CMV from person to person has not been documented. Universal precautions appear adequate to prevent transmission of CMV within hospitals, and isolation of patients known to be CMV-infected is not routinely recommended [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-cytomegalovirus-infections-in-children/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. Pregnant healthcare workers and those contemplating pregnancy are not restricted from caring for CMV-infected patients and should follow universal precautions. However, blood products and organ transplantation are sources of CMV infection in hospitals. Post-perfusion syndrome caused by CMV can be seen in newborns, especially preterm infants, as well as in infants, older children, and adolescents. Immunosuppressed patients, particularly those with HIV infection, cancer, or receipt of a solid organ or bone marrow transplant, are commonly infected with CMV and at risk for developing serious disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-cytomegalovirus-infections-in-children/abstract/1,16\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,16</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL MANIFESTATIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The clinical manifestations of cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection in infants and children depend upon the age and immune status of the patient (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F101802\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef101802 \">table 1</a>).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2434772599\"><span class=\"h2\">Congenital infection</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Clinical manifestations of congenital CMV infection are summarized in the table and are discussed in greater detail separately (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F101802\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef101802 \">table 1</a>).

Most patients with liver involvement have improvement in liver function tests by two to three months [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-cytomegalovirus-infections-in-children/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Preterm infants </strong>&ndash; Infants who are preterm <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> very low birth weight (VLBW; birth weight &lt;1500 grams) are especially vulnerable to severe CMV disease. Infection may become apparent as early as three weeks and as late as three to six months of age. Early transmission of the virus is a risk factor for symptomatic disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-cytomegalovirus-infections-in-children/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">In preterm infants, CMV infection may be serious and even fatal if not diagnosed and treated [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-cytomegalovirus-infections-in-children/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. A sepsis-like syndrome occurs in approximately 15 percent of infected VLBW infants and is associated with hepatosplenomegaly, hepatitis, pneumonitis, and abnormalities of blood counts (including lymphopenia, neutropenia, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> thrombocytopenia) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-cytomegalovirus-infections-in-children/abstract/4,18\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,18</a>]. CMV infection in preterm neonates has also been associated with necrotizing enterocolitis and increased risk of severe retinopathy of prematurity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-cytomegalovirus-infections-in-children/abstract/10,19\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,19</a>].

One study found an association between CMV infection and bronchopulmonary dysplasia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-cytomegalovirus-infections-in-children/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>], while another study did not [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-cytomegalovirus-infections-in-children/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. Based on data from follow-up studies comparing CMV-infected infants with noninfected infants matched for gestational age and birth weight, there appear to be no differences in growth, hearing, or cerebral palsy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-cytomegalovirus-infections-in-children/abstract/22-25\" class=\"abstract_t\">22-25</a>]. Studies are conflicting as to whether early postnatal CMV infection adversely impacts long-term neurodevelopmental outcomes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-cytomegalovirus-infections-in-children/abstract/22-26\" class=\"abstract_t\">22-26</a>]; if there is an effect, it appears to be small. In a study of 356 preterm infants who were prospectively screened for postnatal CMV infection, infected infants (n = 49) and uninfected infants (n = 307) had similar scores on neurodevelopmental tests performed at 24 to 30 months corrected age [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-cytomegalovirus-infections-in-children/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. Among children in this cohort who underwent repeat testing at approximately six years of age, mean scores were in the normal range for infected and uninfected children, but infected children had slightly lower verbal intelligence quotient (IQ) scores (96&plusmn;16 versus 103&plusmn;15). After adjusting for maternal education status and presence of respiratory distress syndrome, postnatal CMV infection was not independently associated with risk of low verbal IQ. No children with postnatally acquired CMV developed sensorineural hearing loss. In another study of 42 adolescents born very preterm, those with early postnatal CMV infection (n = 19) scored lower than those without (n = 23) for overall IQ (93&plusmn;15 versus 103&plusmn;14), though mean scores were in the normal range in both groups [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-cytomegalovirus-infections-in-children/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Infants with primary immune disorders</strong> &ndash; Infants with primary immune disorders of T-cell or natural killer (NK) cell function also may experience severe, even fatal, symptoms associated with postnatally acquired CMV infection.

Treatment is usually is divided into an induction phase and a maintenance phase (also called secondary prophylaxis). The induction phase consists of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ganciclovir-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">ganciclovir</a> 5 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> per dose IV every 12 hours for two to three weeks, depending upon the clinical and virologic response.

Maintenance therapy usually consists of a single daily dose of ganciclovir IV at 5 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> administered every other day or five days a week, skipping the weekend. Oral <a href=\"topic.htm?path=valganciclovir-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">valganciclovir</a>, 15 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> per dose every 12 hours, may be used for maintenance therapy in patients who are able to tolerate and absorb oral medication.

The incidence of neutropenia associated with oral valganciclovir may be lower than with IV ganciclovir. In addition, elevation of liver transaminases may be observed, but rarely to the level requiring cessation of the medication. Patients receiving ganciclovir or valganciclovir should have CBCs, AST, and ALT monitored regularly. Ganciclovir and valganciclovir are excreted renally, and the dose should be adjusted if renal insufficiency or renal failure is present. Local infiltration of the intravenous ganciclovir solution also may produce local reaction, ulcers, and even scarring.</p><p>If clinical or virologic response is not observed within several weeks of treatment with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ganciclovir-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">ganciclovir</a> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=valganciclovir-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">valganciclovir</a>, then <a href=\"topic.htm?path=foscarnet-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">foscarnet</a> may be added to the regimen if renal function allows. <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cidofovir-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">Cidofovir</a> is another antiviral with specific anti-CMV activity that may be used in children with careful monitoring of renal function and metabolic condition.

Although most CMV infections are asymptomatic or cause mild disease, the virus can cause serious disease in preterm and very low birth weight (VLBW) newborns and immunocompromised children (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F101802\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef101802 \">table 1</a>). CMV can be transmitted perinatally from maternal breast milk or cervical vaginal secretions; through contact with toddlers in the child care setting; among family members through kissing and sharing food, drink, or utensils; between partners through intimate or sexual contact; and through transfusion of blood products or organ transplantation. (See <a href=\"#H1\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above and <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Epidemiology and transmission'</a> above and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=congenital-cytomegalovirus-infection-clinical-features-and-diagnosis#H9542611\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Congenital cytomegalovirus infection: Clinical features and diagnosis&quot;, section on 'Epidemiology'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Early postnatal infection can arise from maternal secretions, ingestion of breast milk, or blood product transfusions. Most early postnatal infections in term infants are asymptomatic or cause a mild illness. In preterm and VLBW infants, CMV can cause a variety of clinical symptoms, most commonly sepsis-like syndrome, pneumonitis, hepatitis, and necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC). Preterm infants are at higher risk for developing severe life-threatening disease. (See <a href=\"#H11\" class=\"local\">'Early postnatal infection'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Acquired CMV infection in healthy children and adolescents is most often asymptomatic. Approximately 10 percent of infected children develop a mononucleosis-like illness, including fever, fatigue, pharyngitis, adenopathy (especially cervical adenopathy), and hepatitis. Laboratory abnormalities include lymphocytosis or lymphopenia with thrombocytopenia and elevated transaminases. Tests for acute Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) disease, such as EBV IgM or monospot tests, are negative. (See <a href=\"#H12\" class=\"local\">'Immunocompetent children'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Risk factors for CMV infections in immunocompromised hosts include transplantation of an organ from a CMV-seropositive donor into a CMV-seronegative recipient, depressed T-cell function, natural killer cell disorders, and transplantation of a CMV-infected organ. Clinical manifestations of infection in immunocompromised infants, children and adolescents include fever, leukopenia, and malaise with end-organ involvement such as kidney graft loss, hepatitis, pneumonitis, or myocarditis. (See <a href=\"#H13\" class=\"local\">'Immunocompromised hosts'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Laboratory tools for diagnosis of CMV include virus isolation in culture, detection of CMV DNA using polymerase chain reaction (PCR), and serology. Early postnatal CMV infection is diagnosed by isolation or PCR after the first three weeks of life in conjunction with negative testing performed within the first three weeks (thereby excluding congenital CMV infection). Acquired CMV in older children is ideally diagnosed by documenting seroconversion with CMV IgM antibody. Confirmation of CMV infection in immunocompromised hosts is difficult and can require demonstration of infection in blood and an end organ.
