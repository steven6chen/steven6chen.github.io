The major perianal complications include fissures, fistulas, abscesses, and stenosis, alone or in combination, which affect approximately 35 to 45 percent of patients during the course of the disease. Symptoms can vary from anal pain and purulent discharge to bleeding and incontinence, and can be associated with significant morbidity and impaired quality of life [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/perianal-complications-of-crohn-disease/abstract/1-3\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-3</a>].</p><p>The major perianal complications of Crohn disease will be reviewed here. The role of imaging in diagnosing anal abscesses and fistulas and the medical management of Crohn disease are discussed in detail separately.

When perianal disease is the initial presentation of Crohn disease, it may be difficult to distinguish from the hemorrhoids, fissures, and fistulas seen in patients who do not have Crohn disease. A diagnosis of underlying Crohn disease should be considered:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In patients whose perianal disease does not resolve with routine management</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In patients with unusual presentations (eg, anal fissures that are not located in the midline, complex anal fistulas, or large, indurated hemorrhoids)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In patients who, upon further questioning, report symptoms that might suggest Crohn disease (eg, diarrhea, rashes, joint pains) (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-prognosis-of-crohn-disease-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations, diagnosis and prognosis of Crohn disease in adults&quot;</a>)</p><p/><p>Perianal disease without intestinal symptoms that persists over time is infrequent.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">ANAL FISSURES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>An anal fissure is an ulcer in the lining of the anal canal distal to the dentate line. Anal fissures develop in approximately 20 percent of patients with Crohn disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/perianal-complications-of-crohn-disease/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. In patients with idiopathic anal fissures (ie, fissures that are not associated with Crohn disease), the fissures almost always occur in the midline. Similarly, in patients with Crohn disease, fissures most commonly occur in the posterior midline. However, the fissures are eccentrically located in up to 20 percent of patients with Crohn disease-related fissures [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/perianal-complications-of-crohn-disease/abstract/14,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">14,15</a>]. Anal fissures in patients with Crohn disease spontaneously heal in more than 80 percent of patients (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F51583\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef51583 \">picture 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/perianal-complications-of-crohn-disease/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=anal-fissure-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-prevention\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Anal fissure: Clinical manifestations, diagnosis, prevention&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Differential diagnosis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In addition to inflammatory bowel disease, the differential diagnosis of anal fissures includes local trauma (passage of hard stool), immunodeficiency states, sexually transmitted diseases (eg, chlamydia, gonorrhea, syphilis), neoplasms, and certain drugs. The antianginal drug nicorandil, for example, has been implicated [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/perianal-complications-of-crohn-disease/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>].</p><p>Features that suggest Crohn disease rather than sporadic anal fissures include: location other than the posterior midline; the presence of multiple, recurrent, or nonhealing fissures; and fissures that are asymptomatic. In addition, hypertrophic, edematous, and tender skin tags may be present, which are often mistaken for external hemorrhoids, but are characteristic of Crohn disease and may show granulomas if biopsied (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F75104%7EGAST%2F78460\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef75104 graphicRef78460 \">picture 2A-B</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/perianal-complications-of-crohn-disease/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Clinical manifestations and diagnosis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Anal fissures in Crohn disease may be asymptomatic or present with bleeding, deep ulceration (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F80569\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef80569 \">picture 3</a>), or anal pain, which may be worsened during evacuation. The clinical course of anal fissures is usually benign; however, nonhealing fissures or deeper ulcers may lead to fistula or perianal abscess formation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/perianal-complications-of-crohn-disease/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Treatment</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h3\">Symptomatic relief</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Although healing of the fissures is the ultimate goal, initial treatment should be aimed at relieving symptoms. This includes measures to decrease fecal soilage by reducing diarrhea and local cleansing with sitz baths. The anoderm should be kept clean and dry, but without excessive wiping or use of astringent cleaners. Bathing following defecation is helpful. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=anal-fissure-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-prevention\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Anal fissure: Clinical manifestations, diagnosis, prevention&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h3\">Antibiotics</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There are no controlled trials showing that oral antibiotics are effective in the treatment of perianal fissures associated with Crohn disease.

(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=antibiotics-for-treatment-of-inflammatory-bowel-diseases\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Antibiotics for treatment of inflammatory bowel diseases&quot;</a>.)</p><p>In one series of 21 consecutive patients with chronic, unremitting perianal Crohn disease, drainage, erythema, and induration were improved after therapy with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=metronidazole-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">metronidazole</a> (20 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> per day in divided doses) in all patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/perianal-complications-of-crohn-disease/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. Complete healing was achieved in 10 of 18 (56 percent) patients who were maintained on therapy. </p><p>Side effects of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=metronidazole-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">metronidazole</a> included a metallic taste, peripheral neuropathy, dark urine, paresthesias, and mild gastrointestinal upset. As initial therapy, we suggest using metronidazole, 500 mg orally twice daily, since paresthesias may develop at higher doses [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/perianal-complications-of-crohn-disease/abstract/21,22\" class=\"abstract_t\">21,22</a>]. Metronidazole should be discontinued in patients who develop neuropathy.</p><p>Although controlled trials are lacking, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ciprofloxacin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ciprofloxacin</a> alone or in addition to <a href=\"topic.htm?path=metronidazole-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">metronidazole</a> has been used in patients who have perianal complications in association with active intestinal disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/perianal-complications-of-crohn-disease/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h3\">Topical nitroglycerin</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Topical <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nitroglycerin-glyceryl-trinitrate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">nitroglycerin</a> 0.2 percent is beneficial for patients with spontaneous chronic anal fissures. Its efficacy in patients with anal fissures in Crohn disease has not been evaluated. Other topical ointments such as calcium channel blockers in reduced concentrations (1 percent) have been used. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=anal-fissure-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-prevention\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Anal fissure: Clinical manifestations, diagnosis, prevention&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h3\">Surgery</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Fissures that are resistant to conservative treatment may require surgery. Although there is concern about injuring the sphincter mechanism and the possibility of poor wound healing, procedures such as lateral internal sphincterotomy have been successful [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/perianal-complications-of-crohn-disease/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. This involves careful dissection of only a small portion of the internal sphincter with division of fibers up to the dentate line. Internal sphincterotomy can also be used when chronic fissures led to stricture formation. Surgery should be avoided in the presence of proctitis as it predisposes to poor healing [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/perianal-complications-of-crohn-disease/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>].

Up to 45 percent of these patients develop the fistula before being diagnosed with Crohn disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/perianal-complications-of-crohn-disease/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>].</p><p>Fistulas are usually the consequence of penetration of an abscess into an adjacent organ or the skin. Thus, a fistula may initially present as an abscess that, upon spontaneous draining, evolves into a fistulous tract (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F75104%7EGAST%2F78460\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef75104 graphicRef78460 \">picture 2A-B</a>). In patients without Crohn disease, anal fistulas typically arise from the anal crypts and glands, but this is not always the case in those with Crohn disease. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-prognosis-of-crohn-disease-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations, diagnosis and prognosis of Crohn disease in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h2\">Anatomy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The fistulous openings most commonly involve the perianal skin, but can also be in the groin, vulva, or scrotum. The fistulas can be classified based upon their anatomic extensions. Fistulas may be simple or they may have complicated anatomy, with one or more extensions and accessory tracts. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=operative-management-of-anorectal-fistulas#H22288745\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Operative management of anorectal fistulas&quot;, section on 'Simple fistulas'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=operative-management-of-anorectal-fistulas#H22288751\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Operative management of anorectal fistulas&quot;, section on 'Complex fistulas'</a>.)</p><p>Classification of the area involved with the fistula is helpful in planning surgical intervention.

On physical examination, fistulas appear as single or multiple perianal openings, which may spontaneously discharge purulent material (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F75104%7EGAST%2F78460\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef75104 graphicRef78460 \">picture 2A-B</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F65699\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef65699 \">picture 4</a>). Fistulas involving the urinary bladder or vagina may be associated with pneumaturia or passage of stool or a foul-smelling discharge through the vagina.</p><p>The gold standard for evaluation of the anatomy of fistulas has traditionally been probing under general anesthesia. Less invasive imaging methods, such as fistulography and standard <a href=\"topic.htm?path=barium-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">barium</a> studies, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), helical computed tomography, and ultrasound, are generally less accurate, but may have a role in patients with high tracts into perirectal or pelvic areas who are seen in centers experienced with these techniques [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/perianal-complications-of-crohn-disease/abstract/27-31\" class=\"abstract_t\">27-31</a>]. The combination of different imaging modalities appears to be more accurate than any one modality alone [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/perianal-complications-of-crohn-disease/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]. MRI may have an important role in the evaluation of the completeness of healing of fistulas and the risk of relapse under anti-tumor necrosis factor (TNF) therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/perianal-complications-of-crohn-disease/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>].

Much of the information on the treatment of fistulas in Crohn disease is based upon case series, with few controlled trials. As a general rule, treatment of the underlying Crohn disease should proceed as in patients with Crohn disease without fistulas. Antibiotics have been used in the treatment of perianal fistulas in Crohn disease, although controlled studies are lacking. Immunomodulator therapy with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=infliximab-including-biosimilars-of-infliximab-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">infliximab</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=adalimumab-including-biosimilars-of-adalimumab-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">adalimumab</a>, 6-mercaptopurine, or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=azathioprine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">azathioprine</a> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tacrolimus-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">tacrolimus</a> is also an option in patients with severe or refractory fistulas.

In a randomized trial, 74 patients with active perianal disease were assigned to receive either metronidazole 10 percent ointment three times daily or placebo ointment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/perianal-complications-of-crohn-disease/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>]. Patients who received the metronidazole reported significantly less perianal discharge and there was a trend toward a reduction in perianal pain. There were no differences between the groups with regard to reduction in the Perianal Crohn's Disease Activity Index (the primary endpoint), the patient's global impression of improvement, or quality of live scores. The ointment was generally well tolerated.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15\"><span class=\"h3\">Asymptomatic patients</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Perianal fistulas that are asymptomatic may not require treatment. Many of these patients will remain asymptomatic or spontaneously heal. In one report that included 21 patients with perianal fistulas, 33 percent remained asymptomatic despite continued presence of the fistula, and 38 percent had spontaneous healing during 10 years of follow-up [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/perianal-complications-of-crohn-disease/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H16\"><span class=\"h3\">Patients with mild to moderate symptoms</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In patients with mild to moderate symptoms, treatment with oral <a href=\"topic.htm?path=metronidazole-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">metronidazole</a> has been used as initial therapy, although controlled studies are scarce [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/perianal-complications-of-crohn-disease/abstract/20,21,34,35\" class=\"abstract_t\">20,21,34,35</a>]. In addition, ongoing rectal inflammation should be treated with systemic or topical agents.
