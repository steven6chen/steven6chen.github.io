The tricuspid valve leaflets demonstrate variable degrees of failed delamination (separation of the valve tissue from the myocardium) with fibrous attachments to the right ventricular endocardium (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F103911\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef103911 \">image 1</a>).</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The displacement of annular attachments of septal and posterior (inferior) leaflets into the right ventricle toward the apex and right ventricular outflow tract is the hallmark finding of Ebstein anomaly.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The posterior (inferior) and septal tricuspid valve leaflets are generally most severely affected, related to failure of delamination from the myocardium. The tricuspid valve functional orifice is generally displaced anteriorly and downward from the atrioventricular junction toward the right ventricular apex, and toward the right ventricular outflow tract along the direction of blood flow (rotation of the tricuspid annular plane along the inner curvature of the right ventricle).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The anterior leaflet is the largest leaflet and is usually attached to the anatomic tricuspid valve annulus at the atrioventricular junction, with variable tethering to the right ventricular endocardium; this leaflet is often referred to as being &quot;sail-like.&quot;</p><p/><p>The free edges of the leaflets of the tricuspid valve may attach to chordae, or be directly attached to papillary muscle(s) or the underlying myocardium. </p><p>In Ebstein anomaly, the tricuspid valve typically shows variable degrees of regurgitation. Tissue defects within the leaflets of the tricuspid valve (&quot;fenestrations&quot;) may contribute to the regurgitation. Tricuspid valve stenosis is rare in Ebstein anomaly. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Right ventricle</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The valve divides the right ventricle into two chambers:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The proximal portion is called &quot;atrialized right ventricle&quot; because of a downward displacement of the tricuspid valve and functional annulus</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The distal chamber, the functional right ventricle, is of variable size [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-ebstein-anomaly/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].This portion of the right ventricle may appear small on the echocardiographic apical four-chamber view but often still appears enlarged by cardiac magnetic resonance imaging [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-ebstein-anomaly/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. In some cases, the functional right ventricle consists of only the right ventricular outflow tract.</p><p/><p>Due to the underlying myocardial abnormalities, right ventricular performance is almost always abnormal. The atrialized right ventricle is usually thin walled and demonstrates poor contractility. Furthermore, right ventricular ejection fraction may overestimate true right ventricular contractility in the setting of severe tricuspid regurgitation. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H977796647\"><span class=\"h2\">Associated cardiovascular defects</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Additional cardiac defects other than the tricuspid valve and right ventricular findings are often associated with Ebstein anomaly.

Interatrial communication is commonly identified in patients with Ebstein anomaly. Patients with PFO or ASD can develop cyanosis from right to left shunting, particularly with exercise, and are at risk of paradoxical embolism. In one series, 79 percent of patients had either a persistent or previously closed PFO or atrial septal defect [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-ebstein-anomaly/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>].

Syncope and sudden death have been reported and may be caused by atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response due to conduction through an accessory pathway or from ventricular arrhythmias. Arrhythmias may occasionally precipitate heart failure.

The left ventricle may be small in patients with Ebstein anomaly due to severe tricuspid valve regurgitation, or it may appear small by imaging due to marked right heart involvement. </p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL MANIFESTATIONS</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Symptoms and signs</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The clinical presentation of Ebstein anomaly varies widely. In general, symptoms are related to the degree of anatomic abnormality (ie, the degree of displacement and the functional status of the tricuspid valve leaflets, presence of inter-atrial communication, and severity of right ventricular dilation and dysfunction). The wide spectrum of disease is illustrated by the following clinical presentations:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The anomaly may be fatal in utero or shortly after birth if severe cardiomegaly and heart failure are present [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-ebstein-anomaly/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Children and adults with marked tricuspid leaflet displacement may have severe regurgitation, right-sided heart failure, elevated right atrial pressures, and significant cyanosis due to right-to-left interatrial shunting with or without <span class=\"nowrap\">functional/anatomic</span> pulmonary valve atresia. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In contrast, patients with mild apical displacement and mild dysfunction of the tricuspid valve (mild tricuspid regurgitation) may remain asymptomatic through adulthood or present in adulthood with arrhythmia or paradoxical embolic event [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-ebstein-anomaly/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. </p><p/><p>In a review of 220 patients with Ebstein anomaly, early age at presentation was frequently associated with other cardiac lesions, particularly atrial septal defect and pulmonary stenosis, which predisposes to cyanosis from right-to-left shunting [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-ebstein-anomaly/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. The clinical presentation varied with age at diagnosis:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Fetuses &ndash; An abnormal routine prenatal scan (86 percent)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Neonates &ndash; Cyanosis (74 percent)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Infants &ndash; Heart failure (43 percent)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Children &ndash; Murmur (63 percent)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Adolescents and adults &ndash; Arrhythmia (42 percent)</p><p/><p>Symptomatic neonates with severe cyanosis, severe cardiomegaly, and respiratory distress require intense medical management. Circular shunt and fetal hydrops are markers of the worst prognosis, as there are limited surgical options. Circular shunt can develop in utero, or after birth if pulmonary valve regurgitation and patent ductus arteriosus are present; this is a result of blood flowing from left ventricle to aorta to pulmonary artery (through ductus arteriosus) and then retrograde through the pulmonary valve, right ventricle, and tricuspid valve, across the atrial septum and back into the left ventricle and aorta. This circular shunt adds significant volume load to the ventricles in the presence of hypoxemia, leading to severe congestive heart failure in neonates and hydrops in fetuses with Ebstein anomaly.</p><p>In infants with severe tricuspid regurgitation, dyspnea, heart failure, and cyanosis from shunting across an atrial septal defect may be present soon after birth, because of high pulmonary vascular resistance [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-ebstein-anomaly/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. These symptoms and signs often improve as pulmonary vascular resistance decreases. However, in cases with mechanical obstruction to right ventricular outflow related to pulmonary atresia, small pulmonary arteries, pulmonary valve stenosis, or a noncompliant small ventricle, improvement may not occur or be limited. </p><p>In children, adolescents, and adults, symptoms such as exertional dyspnea, fatigue, cyanosis, and palpitations may occur; these symptoms may be due to right ventricular dysfunction, severe tricuspid valve regurgitation or right-to-left shunt at the atrial level. Atrial tachyarrhythmias are present in approximately 20 to 30 percent of cases across age groups, with greater frequency in adolescents and adults [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-ebstein-anomaly/abstract/14,16\" class=\"abstract_t\">14,16</a>]. Some of these arrhythmias may be due to accessory conduction pathway, present in up to 20 percent of patients; the majority of these pathways are located around the orifice of the malformed tricuspid valve [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-ebstein-anomaly/abstract/10,17,18\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,17,18</a>]. Patients with Ebstein anomaly who have an interatrial communication are at risk for paradoxical embolization and thus may develop symptoms of cyanosis, stroke, transient ischemic attack, or brain abscess [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-ebstein-anomaly/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-the-wolff-parkinson-white-syndrome\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Epidemiology, clinical manifestations, and diagnosis of the Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Physical findings vary with the severity of pathology and the magnitude of right-to-left interatrial shunting [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-ebstein-anomaly/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. The following observations apply to patients with more severe disease (usually neonates and children); those with less severe disease usually present with a murmur and click commonly mistaken for mitral valve prolapse.</p><p>Cyanosis may be severe in infants. Common findings in older children include mild cyanosis, prominent &quot;a&quot; wave in the distended jugular veins, and hepatomegaly. The last finding represents passive hepatic congestion resulting from tricuspid regurgitation and elevated right atrial pressure. There may also be a palpable prominent diffuse parasternal impulse and occasionally a systolic thrill is noted at the left lower sternal border. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=examination-of-the-jugular-venous-pulse\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Examination of the jugular venous pulse&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=examination-of-the-precordial-pulsation\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Examination of the precordial pulsation&quot;</a>.)</p><p>On auscultation, first and second heart sounds are widely split due to right bundle branch block; an early systolic click or &quot;sail sound&quot; may also be heard [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-ebstein-anomaly/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. A prominent S3 <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> a loud S4 give the impression of multiple heart sounds (triple or quadruple gallop). A systolic murmur from tricuspid regurgitation is a common finding; this murmur characteristically increases in intensity with inspiration and may be associated with a mid-diastolic murmur due to the high diastolic flow volume across the tricuspid annulus. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=auscultation-of-cardiac-murmurs-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Auscultation of cardiac murmurs in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p>However, the murmur may be very soft or absent in adults because the low velocity of the to-and-fro flow and rapid equalization of pressure across the tricuspid valve do not result in blood flow turbulence. When tricuspid regurgitation is severe, jugular venous distension and a prominent &quot;v&quot; wave is occasionally seen; the &quot;v&quot; wave is often absent in Ebstein anomaly due to a large right atrium and atrialized right ventricle that absorbs the tricuspid regurgitation. For the same reason, the liver may not be pulsatile even in the setting of severe tricuspid valve regurgitation.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4165414602\"><span class=\"h2\">Initial test results</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>An electrocardiogram and a chest radiograph are common tests obtained in the initial evaluation of cardiac patients.

The four-chamber view is particularly helpful, as it demonstrates the degree of mobility of the anterior leaflet, the displacement of the septal leaflet, and an impression of the severity of the tricuspid regurgitation. All echocardiographic views are important to delineate the severity of the tricuspid valve regurgitation, which may be incompletely visualized using the standard four-chamber view. Three-dimensional echocardiography is being used with increasing frequency to supplement standard two-dimensional images for analysis of tricuspid valve anatomy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-ebstein-anomaly/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>].

In non-Ebstein adults, the criteria for severe tricuspid regurgitation include a vena contracta width &gt;0.7 cm and systolic flow reversal in the hepatic veins [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-ebstein-anomaly/abstract/26,27\" class=\"abstract_t\">26,27</a>]. However, these features are often not present in Ebstein anomaly patients of any age due to the large compliant right atrium and atrialized right ventricle [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-ebstein-anomaly/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. A significant leaflet coaptation gap on 2D echo associated with a large regurgitant jet on color Doppler is the best indicator of severe regurgitation in Ebstein anomaly.

Given the unusual tricuspid valve and right ventricular morphology and lack of standardized CMR imaging protocols, variability of calculated right ventricular volumes may be noted when Ebstein patients are compared with patients with other congenital heart defects; in addition, there may be variability of volumetric measurements between different centers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-ebstein-anomaly/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>]. Furthermore, the right ventricular ejection fraction may overestimate true right ventricular contractility in the setting of severe tricuspid regurgitation. Prediction of right ventricular function after tricuspid valve repair or replacement remains difficult. Right ventricular function is generally depressed immediately after tricuspid valve repair or replacement and may or may not recover over time with right ventricular remodeling. </p><p>Since information obtained from CMR is complementary to that obtained from echocardiography, combined CMR and echocardiographic imaging is usually performed prior to and following surgical tricuspid valve intervention. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H61224182\"><span class=\"h2\">Additional tests</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The following additional tests are generally performed to evaluate patients diagnosed with Ebstein anomaly. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1589510179\"><span class=\"h3\">Exercise testing</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>For patients with Ebstein anomaly, we perform formal exercise testing with oximetry to assess exercise capacity, heart rate and blood pressure response to exercise, potential desaturation with exercise, and exercise-induced arrhythmias.

For patients with tachyarrhythmias, evidence of pre-excitation on ECG, or planned operation for Ebstein anomaly, consultation with a congenital heart rhythm specialist is suggested. As noted above, the ECG may reveal evidence of arrhythmias or preexcitation. We generally suggest annual 24-hour Holter monitoring as a means of identifying arrhythmias. </p><p>Among patients referred to a congenital heart rhythm specialist, further evaluation may include EPS. The role of EPS for identification of accessory pathways and radiofrequency catheter ablation is discussed separately. EPS may also help exclude the presence of ventricular arrhythmias. In our practice, we perform EPS in most adult Ebstein patients prior to operation to detect concealed pathways, guide the extent of intraoperative Maze or cryoablation procedures, and determine the risk of ventricular arrhythmias.

Information concerning pulmonary artery and left ventricular end-diastolic pressure is particularly important if a bidirectional cavopulmonary shunt is being considered [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-ebstein-anomaly/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. </p><p>Comprehensive hemodynamic cardiac catheterization is required prior to potential device closure, as ASD closure may further increase right atrial filling pressures at rest or during exercise and can lead to hemodynamic decompensation. In selected cases, assessment of cardiac hemodynamics during exercise with and without balloon-occlusion of the interatrial septal defect may be helpful for decision making. Since isolated ASD catheter-based or surgical closure may result in hemodynamic decompensation, surgical repair of Ebstein anomaly combined with ASD closure is generally preferred over isolated device ASD closure.
