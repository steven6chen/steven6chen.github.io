The epidemiology, clinical features, diagnosis, and management of molluscum contagiosum will be reviewed here.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">VIROLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Molluscum contagiosum is a member of the poxvirus family but is in a different genus from the orthopoxviruses (variola, vaccinia, and monkeypox viruses) discussed separately (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=the-epidemiology-pathogenesis-and-clinical-manifestations-of-smallpox\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;The epidemiology, pathogenesis, and clinical manifestations of smallpox&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=vaccinia-virus-as-the-smallpox-vaccine\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Vaccinia virus as the smallpox vaccine&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=monkeypox\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Monkeypox&quot;</a>). Molluscum contagiosum causes a chronic localized infection with small papules on the skin of an infected individual in contrast to the acute, sometimes fatal, disease induced by smallpox. Similar to the virus that causes smallpox, the only known host for molluscum is humans.</p><p>Information about molluscum contagiosum at the molecular level has been hampered by the inability to grow the virus in standard cell culture or in an animal model of infection. While there are reports of some success in growth using human foreskin xenograft fragments [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/molluscum-contagiosum/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>], a major advance in understanding the biology of the virus came when the entire 190,000 base pair genome of the molluscum contagiosum virus was sequenced [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/molluscum-contagiosum/abstract/2,3\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,3</a>].</p><p>Like variola and vaccinia viruses, molluscum contagiosum replicates in the cytoplasm of cells, and thus, it is not surprising that more than one-half of the genes are similar to those found in variola and vaccinia viruses. However, since the diseases induced are quite different [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/molluscum-contagiosum/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>], it also is not surprising that many genes found in variola and vaccinia are not present in the molluscum contagiosum genome [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/molluscum-contagiosum/abstract/2,3\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,3</a>]. Molluscum contagiosum contains many unique genes that encode proteins responsible for novel host defense mechanisms; these mechanisms inhibit the host inflammatory and immune responses to the infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/molluscum-contagiosum/abstract/5-9\" class=\"abstract_t\">5-9</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">EPIDEMIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Molluscum contagiosum infection has been reported worldwide. Although four distinct genotypes have been identified, genotype 1 predominates and represents 90 percent of cases in the United States [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/molluscum-contagiosum/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. A population-based Australian seroepidemiology study in 357 people revealed an overall seropositivity rate of 23 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/molluscum-contagiosum/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. The data also indicated that very mild or subclinical cases may be more common in the general community than previously suspected.</p><p>It is estimated that fewer than 5 percent of children in the United States have clinical evidence of molluscum contagiosum infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/molluscum-contagiosum/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. The number of cases in adults has varied over time. In the 1980s, the number of molluscum contagiosum cases increased, apparently as a result of the acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) epidemic [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/molluscum-contagiosum/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]; however, since the introduction of potent antiretroviral therapy (ART), the number of molluscum contagiosum cases in AIDS patients has decreased substantially [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/molluscum-contagiosum/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h1\">RISK FACTORS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Molluscum contagiosum is a common disease of childhood. The disease also occurs in healthy adolescents and adults, often as a sexually transmitted disease or in relation to participation in contact sports [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/molluscum-contagiosum/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. Molluscum contagiosum is also associated with immunodeficient states. It can occur in the setting of underlying cellular immunodeficiency, such as occurs in inherited immunodeficiencies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/molluscum-contagiosum/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>], during human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection, or following treatment with immunosuppressive drugs.</p><p>Although it has been proposed that atopic dermatitis is a risk factor for molluscum contagiosum (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F57836\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef57836 \">picture 1F</a>), data conflict on the relationship between these diseases. An increased risk is suggested by studies that report prevalence rates for atopic dermatitis between 18 and 45 percent among patients with molluscum contagiosum, rates that exceed the estimated prevalence of atopic dermatitis in the general pediatric population (10 to 20 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/molluscum-contagiosum/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. It is theorized that the relative suppression of T-helper cell type 1 responses in acute skin lesions of atopic dermatitis could contribute to a predisposition for molluscum contagiosum in the atopic dermatitis population. </p><p>In contrast to the assertion that atopic dermatitis is a risk factor for this infection, a nursery school-based study of over 1100 children in Japan failed to find a statistically significant increase in molluscum contagiosum among children who had a history of atopic dermatitis compared with children without atopic dermatitis (odds ratio 1.64, 95% CI 1.00-2.68) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/molluscum-contagiosum/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. Thus, the relationship between atopic dermatitis and molluscum contagiosum remains uncertain.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h1\">TRANSMISSION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Like many viruses in the poxvirus family, molluscum contagiosum is spread by direct skin-to-skin contact and thus can occur anywhere on the body. The virus can be transmitted via autoinoculation by scratching or touching a lesion. For example, if the lesions develop on the face, shaving may spread the virus. The only known host for molluscum contagiosum is humans.</p><p>Infection can also be spread via fomites on bath sponges or towels or through skin contact during participation in contact sports [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/molluscum-contagiosum/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. An association of molluscum contagiosum with swimming pool use also has been reported [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/molluscum-contagiosum/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. When it occurs in the genital region in sexually active individuals, molluscum contagiosum is classified as a sexually transmitted disease. In contrast, autoinoculation, rather than sexual contact, is responsible for most anogenital lesions in children [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/molluscum-contagiosum/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. </p><p>Estimates for the incubation period of the virus vary from one week to six months, but it is typically characterized&nbsp;as being between two and six weeks [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/molluscum-contagiosum/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL FEATURES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The molluscum contagiosum virus causes a chronic localized infection characterized by firm, dome shaped papules on the skin (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F55247%7EDERM%2F68001%7EDERM%2F56699%7EDERM%2F81042%7EDERM%2F59150%7EDERM%2F57836\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef55247 graphicRef68001 graphicRef56699 graphicRef81042 graphicRef59150 graphicRef57836 \">picture 1A-F</a>). Lesions are often 2 to 5 mm in diameter, with a shiny surface and central indentation or umbilication. Occasionally, the growths can be polypoid with a stalk-like base. Pruritus may be present or absent, and lesions sometimes become visibly inflamed. </p><p>Molluscum contagiosum may appear anywhere on the body except the palms and soles. The most common areas of involvement include the trunk, axillae, antecubital and popliteal fossae, and crural folds. Lesions on the eyelid can cause conjunctivitis (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F75198%7EDERM%2F66482\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef75198 graphicRef66482 \">picture 2A-B</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/molluscum-contagiosum/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. Oral mucosal involvement is rare [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/molluscum-contagiosum/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. Sexually transmitted molluscum contagiosum typically involves the groin, genitals, proximal thighs, and lower abdomen. In HIV-infected and other immunocompromised patients, lesions can be large (aka giant molluscum) and widespread (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F81275%7EDERM%2F50976\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef81275 graphicRef50976 \">picture 3A-B</a>). </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H106808343\"><span class=\"h1\">ASSOCIATED CLINICAL FINDINGS</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H106808350\"><span class=\"h2\">Molluscum dermatitis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Molluscum dermatitis, which is characterized by the development of eczematous patches or plaques surrounding molluscum contagiosum lesions, is a common phenomenon (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F86487\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef86487 \">picture 4</a>). Estimates of the proportion of patients with molluscum who develop molluscum dermatitis have ranged from 9 to 47 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/molluscum-contagiosum/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. </p><p>Whether the use of topical corticosteroid therapy for molluscum dermatitis impacts the prognosis of molluscum contagiosum is unclear. Although there is some concern that local immunosuppression from topical corticosteroids could inhibit clearance of the infection, this has not been proven [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/molluscum-contagiosum/abstract/21,22\" class=\"abstract_t\">21,22</a>]. On the other hand, it is conceivable that untreated molluscum dermatitis could contribute to spread of the infection through scratching. </p><p>A short course (eg, up to two weeks) of a low or medium potency topical corticosteroid (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F62402\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef62402 \">table 1</a>) can be used to treat sites of molluscum dermatitis in patients in whom the condition is pruritic. Emollients may be used for the management of asymptomatic patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/molluscum-contagiosum/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H106808357\"><span class=\"h2\">Inflamed lesions</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Inflamed molluscum contagiosum, which is characterized by erythema and swelling of individual lesions, is a clinical finding that may portend a higher likelihood of impending clinical improvement [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/molluscum-contagiosum/abstract/15,23\" class=\"abstract_t\">15,23</a>]. In a retrospective study of 696 children with molluscum contagiosum, children with inflamed lesions were less likely to develop an increase in the number of lesions over the course of three months than patients who had neither inflamed lesions nor molluscum dermatitis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/molluscum-contagiosum/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. In a case series of seven children with inflamed molluscum, the duration from onset of inflammation to resolution ranged from three weeks to five months [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/molluscum-contagiosum/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. Inflamed molluscum should not be mistaken for secondary bacterial infection.

Gianotti-Crosti like reactions may portend a higher likelihood of forthcoming clinical improvement [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/molluscum-contagiosum/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h1\">DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The diagnosis of molluscum contagiosum is usually made by the characteristic appearance of the lesions (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F65763\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef65763 \">picture 6</a>). When necessary, histologic examination can confirm the clinical diagnosis. Hematoxylin and eosin staining of a molluscum contagiosum lesion typically reveals keratinocytes containing eosinophilic cytoplasmic inclusion bodies (also known as molluscum bodies or Henderson-Paterson bodies) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F69493\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef69493 \">picture 7</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/molluscum-contagiosum/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. </p><p>Dermoscopic examination can be useful for supporting a clinical diagnosis of molluscum contagiosum. Visualization of a central umbilication with polylobular, white to yellow amorphous structures is typical [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/molluscum-contagiosum/abstract/25,26\" class=\"abstract_t\">25,26</a>]. A peripheral crown of radiating or punctiform vessels is also present [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/molluscum-contagiosum/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>].</p><p>Although usually not indicated, electron microscopy of biopsies demonstrates typical brick-shaped poxvirus particles. Electron microscopy can also identify infected cells that appear normal on light microscopy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/molluscum-contagiosum/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. </p><p>Skin lesions due to cryptococcosis, histoplasmosis, or Penicillium marneffei infection may resemble molluscum lesions (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F59025%7EDERM%2F69214%7EDERM%2F78902%7EDERM%2F80674%7EDERM%2F56450\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef59025 graphicRef69214 graphicRef78902 graphicRef80674 graphicRef56450 \">picture 8A-E</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/molluscum-contagiosum/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. The possibility of these disorders should be considered in immunosuppressed patients. Other lesions that may be mistaken for molluscum contagiosum include flat warts, condyloma acuminatum, condylomata lata (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F77221\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef77221 \">picture 9</a>), pyogenic granuloma (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F67395\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef67395 \">picture 10</a>), adnexal tumors, Langerhans cell histiocytosis (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F69504\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef69504 \">picture 11</a>), basal cell carcinoma (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F67350\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef67350 \">picture 12</a>), and amelanotic melanoma.

Although scarring can occur after spontaneous resolution, most molluscum contagiosum lesions do not resolve with scars. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H106808223\"><span class=\"h1\">LABORATORY TESTS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Laboratory studies usually are not indicated in children with molluscum contagiosum. Sexually active adolescents and adults with genital lesions should be evaluated for the presence of other sexually transmitted diseases. Patients with extensive lesions should be tested for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection, and the possibility of other immune system disorders should also be considered.

Treatment may also reduce patient or parental psychological stress over the appearance of lesions. However, depending on the chosen therapy, treatment can be time consuming or can result in adverse effects such as pain, irritation, dyspigmentation, or scarring.</p><p>In general, adolescents and adults with sexually-transmitted molluscum contagiosum should be treated to avoid spread of the disease to others. Early treatment is also indicated in the setting of immunocompromised individuals, in whom infections can become severe. </p><p>For immunocompetent children with molluscum contagiosum, treatment is optional. One retrospective study utilizing a telephone survey and medical chart review found similar rates of molluscum contagiosum resolution among 46 treated and 124 untreated children; approximately 50 percent of children in both groups had complete resolution within 12 months [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/molluscum-contagiosum/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>].</p><p>We typically inform parents and guardians of the expected course of the disease without treatment and the potential adverse effects of each treatment option. When parents or guardians desire intervention, we proceed with therapy.</p><p>Prior to treatment, <strong>a full skin examination should be performed</strong> on patients with molluscum to identify all lesions. Incomplete treatment may result in continued autoinoculation and failure to achieve cure. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H797795\"><span class=\"h2\">Periocular lesions</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The destructive methods and topical agents reviewed below should not be utilized on lesions involving the ocular mucosa or eyelids.

A systematic review of randomized trials that investigated the efficacy of treatments for nongenital molluscum contagiosum in healthy individuals found insufficient evidence to conclude that any treatment was definitively effective [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/molluscum-contagiosum/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>]. </p><p>Despite the absence of large placebo-controlled trials to support the efficacy of cryotherapy, curettage, and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cantharidin-united-states-not-available-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cantharidin</a>, the rapid, clinically evident response associated with their use offers some support for their utility for the removal of individual lesions. The efficacy of podophyllotoxin is supported by data from a placebo-controlled randomized trial. Thus, when a trial of treatment is desired, we consider cryotherapy, curettage, cantharidin, and podophyllotoxin as first-line therapeutic options. The efficacy and safety of podophyllotoxin for molluscum contagiosum in young children have not been definitively established.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H421447\"><span class=\"h2\">Cryotherapy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Liquid nitrogen is used to perform cryotherapy.

The immediate resolution of lesions has led some clinicians to use this method as their preferred therapy for molluscum contagiosum [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/molluscum-contagiosum/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>]. </p><p>Support for the use of curettage comes from a retrospective study that found that 70 percent of 1878 children treated with curettage were cured after a single treatment session [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/molluscum-contagiosum/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>]. In addition, a trial in which 124 children with molluscum contagiosum were randomly assigned to one of four treatment modalities found that 81 percent of 31 children treated with curettage were cured after a single session [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/molluscum-contagiosum/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H421668\" class=\"local\">'Comparative studies'</a> below.) </p><p>In contrast, a prospective study of 73 children and adults treated with curettage found that 42 out of 64 patients (66 percent) were not cured after a single session, and 25 out of 55 (45 percent) failed to clear after two sessions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/molluscum-contagiosum/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>].

However, the development of molluscum contagiosum has also been reported in association with immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (IRIS) following antiretroviral therapy in patients with HIV infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/molluscum-contagiosum/abstract/94\" class=\"abstract_t\">94</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=immune-reconstitution-inflammatory-syndrome\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H421762\"><span class=\"h1\">SCHOOL AND SPORTS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>It is not necessary to remove children with molluscum contagiosum from daycare or school; however, care should be taken to reduce the risk of transmission to others. Lesions in areas that are likely to come in contact with others should be covered with clothing or a watertight bandage. Bathing with other children should be avoided and towels and sponges should not be shared. </p><p>Affected individuals do not need to be excluded from contact sports activities provided lesions can be covered with clothing or bandages. Individuals with molluscum contagiosum should not be restricted from the use of public swimming pools. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H421776\"><span class=\"h1\">PREGNANCY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Molluscum contagiosum in pregnancy is not common and the vertical transmission rate is not known. Only a small number of cases of congenital transmission have been documented in the literature [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/molluscum-contagiosum/abstract/96\" class=\"abstract_t\">96</a>]. </p><p>Since molluscum contagiosum is spread by direct contact, a woman with genital lesions at the time of a vaginal delivery could theoretically transmit molluscum to her newborn, as is seen with genital warts. However, studies that have examined the incidence of molluscum contagiosum in children reveal that it is extremely uncommon to find molluscum contagiosum in children under the age of one [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/molluscum-contagiosum/abstract/97,98\" class=\"abstract_t\">97,98</a>]. The lack of many cases in this age group may indicate that infants are protected by passive maternal antibodies or that the infection has a very long incubation period.</p><p>There are scant data regarding the management of molluscum contagiosum in pregnancy since it is uncommonly encountered. Due to the toxicity of the chemicals commonly used to treat molluscum contagiosum (eg, podophyllotoxin or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=imiquimod-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">imiquimod</a>), we do not recommend their use during pregnancy. Other options include cryotherapy or curettage or no treatment, since molluscum contagiosum is a self-limited disease. Dressings to cover visible lesions during delivery (eg, Tegaderm) may be considered to avoid skin-to-skin contact and hopefully lessen the risk of transmission.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"PATIENT_INFORMATION\"><span class=\"h1\">INFORMATION FOR PATIENTS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>UpToDate offers two types of patient education materials, &quot;The Basics&quot; and &quot;Beyond the Basics.&quot; The Basics patient education pieces are written in plain language, at the 5<sup>th</sup> to 6<sup>th</sup> grade reading level, and they answer the four or five key questions a patient might have about a given condition.

(See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Virology'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Molluscum contagiosum is commonly seen in children, but can also occur in adults. The virus is transmitted through direct skin contact or fomites. Molluscum contagiosum infection in the genital region may result from transmission during sexual activity. (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Epidemiology'</a> above and <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Transmission'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The incubation period for molluscum contagiosum is uncertain, but has been estimated to be between two and six weeks. (See <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Transmission'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Molluscum contagiosum most commonly presents as single or multiple small, flesh-colored papules with central umbilication (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F55247%7EDERM%2F68001%7EDERM%2F56699%7EDERM%2F81042%7EDERM%2F59150%7EDERM%2F57836\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef55247 graphicRef68001 graphicRef56699 graphicRef81042 graphicRef59150 graphicRef57836 \">picture 1A-F</a>). Immunosuppressed individuals have an increased risk for larger lesions and more widespread disease (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F81275%7EDERM%2F50976\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef81275 graphicRef50976 \">picture 3A-B</a>). (See <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'Clinical features'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The diagnosis of molluscum contagiosum typically is based upon the clinical appearance of skin lesions. Biopsy can confirm the diagnosis when necessary. Histopathologic examination of a lesion of molluscum contagiosum reveals eosinophilic cytoplasmic inclusion bodies within keratinocytes (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F69493\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef69493 \">picture 7</a>). (See <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'Diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Molluscum contagiosum infection is usually self-limited in immunocompetent individuals, and electing not to treat is a satisfactory option. In general, molluscum in the genital region should be treated due to the potential for sexual transmission. (See <a href=\"#H8\" class=\"local\">'Overview of management'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Inflammation of molluscum is common and can be a sign of impending regression. Inflammation should not be mistaken for bacterial infection. (See <a href=\"#H106808357\" class=\"local\">'Inflamed lesions'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>High quality data on the efficacy of treatments for molluscum contagiosum are limited. When a trial of treatment is desired, we suggest the use of cryotherapy, curettage, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cantharidin-united-states-not-available-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cantharidin</a>, or podophyllotoxin over other therapies (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=5\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2B</a>). The use of cantharidin should be avoided in the genital area. The efficacy and safety of podophyllotoxin for molluscum contagiosum in children has not been definitively established. (See <a href=\"#H5283428\" class=\"local\">'First-line therapies'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Prominent hypopigmentation may result from treatment with cryotherapy in patients with dark skin. The risks and benefits of cryotherapy should be considered carefully in these patients. (See <a href=\"#H421447\" class=\"local\">'Cryotherapy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><a href=\"topic.htm?path=imiquimod-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Imiquimod</a>, potassium hydroxide (KOH), salicylic acid, and topical retinoids have also been used for the treatment of molluscum contagiosum. However, data in support of the efficacy of these treatments are insufficient for a recommendation for the routine use of these therapies. (See <a href=\"#H5283833\" class=\"local\">'Other interventions'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The efficacy of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cimetidine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cimetidine</a> for molluscum contagiosum is uncertain. Cimetidine should not be used as a first-line therapy for molluscum contagiosum. (See <a href=\"#H421654\" class=\"local\">'Oral cimetidine'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Immunocompromised patients are at risk for extensive and persistent disease. Improvement in molluscum contagiosum may occur in patients with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection after the initiation of antiretroviral therapy. (See <a href=\"#H5282851\" class=\"local\">'Immunocompromised patients'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Children with molluscum contagiosum should not be excluded from daycare or school. Lesions should be covered with clothing or a bandage to reduce the risk of transmission to others.
