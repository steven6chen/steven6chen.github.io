Common presenting symptoms include fever, headache, photophobia, nausea, and vomiting; patients with fulminant disease may present with coma. Predictors of poor outcome include high cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) cryptococcal antigen levels (titer &gt;1:1024), low body weight, poor CSF inflammatory response (&lt;20 <span class=\"nowrap\">cells/microL</span> of CSF), and altered mental status on presentation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-cryptococcus-neoformans-meningoencephalitis-in-hiv-infected-patients/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-cryptococcus-neoformans-meningoencephalitis-in-hiv-infected-patients#H3\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Epidemiology, clinical manifestations, and diagnosis of Cryptococcus neoformans meningoencephalitis in HIV-infected patients&quot;, section on 'Clinical manifestations'</a>.)</p><p>Clinical trial data demonstrate that the optimal approach to treatment involves three phases: induction therapy for approximately two weeks followed by consolidative therapy for approximately eight weeks [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-cryptococcus-neoformans-meningoencephalitis-in-hiv-infected-patients/abstract/2,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,7</a>]. Many HIV-infected patients with cryptococcal meningoencephalitis have a high burden of infection in the central nervous system (CNS) with yeast concentrations in the range of a million <span class=\"nowrap\">yeasts/mL</span> of CSF. This high burden of infection requires a combination treatment regimen with fungicidal activity such as amphotericin B with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=flucytosine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">flucytosine</a> to rapidly sterilize the cerebrospinal fluid during induction therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-cryptococcus-neoformans-meningoencephalitis-in-hiv-infected-patients/abstract/4,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,8</a>]. Long-term maintenance (ie, suppressive) therapy is required to decrease the risk of relapse. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pharmacology-of-amphotericin-b\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pharmacology of amphotericin B&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pharmacology-of-flucytosine-5-fc\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pharmacology of flucytosine (5-FC)&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pharmacology-of-azoles\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pharmacology of azoles&quot;</a>.)</p><p>An important component of treatment of cryptococcal meningoencephalitis includes immune reconstitution with potent antiretroviral medications. However, the initiation of antiretroviral therapy (ART) can also lead to complications such as immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (IRIS). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-management-and-monitoring-during-antifungal-therapy-of-the-hiv-infected-patient-with-cryptococcal-meningoencephalitis#H14913615\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical management and monitoring during antifungal therapy of the HIV-infected patient with cryptococcal meningoencephalitis&quot;, section on 'Immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome'</a>.)</p><p>Effective patient management also requires careful evaluation for complications directly related to cryptococcal brain infections, such as increased intracranial pressure, which can lead to blindness, herniation, persistent headaches, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> neuropathies, if untreated.

Rapid sterilization also allows conversion from potentially toxic intravenous amphotericin B to better tolerated oral agents. It is critically important to complete this two-week induction fungicidal regimen to optimize clinical outcomes. Thus, lipid formulations of amphotericin B are typically used for initial induction therapy to minimize the risk of toxicity. In addition, adverse events related to amphotericin B or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=flucytosine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">flucytosine</a> should be actively managed, rather than switching to a less potent combination of drugs. (See <a href=\"#H1577289945\" class=\"local\">'Adverse events'</a> below and <a href=\"#H4519047\" class=\"local\">'Approach to antifungal treatment'</a> below and <a href=\"#H5332199\" class=\"local\">'Patients who are intolerant of amphotericin B and/or flucytosine'</a> below.)</p><p>The period of induction therapy should be extended longer than two weeks if the CSF cultures remain positive after two weeks of treatment <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> the patient has not demonstrated significant clinical improvement. Treatment can also be extended if the CSF cultures are anticipated to remain positive at the end of two weeks of treatment (eg, a severely immunosuppressed patient with a CSF culture that is positive after a week of treatment) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-cryptococcus-neoformans-meningoencephalitis-in-hiv-infected-patients/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Although persistence of positive cultures may suggest the development of direct drug resistance, this is an extremely uncommon occurrence.

Two important findings emerged from this trial:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Mortality was higher within the first two weeks among patients assigned to the <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fluconazole-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">fluconazole</a> arm compared with the amphotericin B arm (15 versus 8 percent). </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Compared with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fluconazole-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">fluconazole</a>, treatment with amphotericin B resulted in more rapid CSF sterilization (42 days versus 64 days).</p><p/><p>A multicenter, double-blind trial evaluated the effectiveness of two weeks of amphotericin B (dosed higher at 0.7 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> per day), with or without the <a href=\"topic.htm?path=flucytosine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">flucytosine</a> (100 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> per day), as induction therapy in 381 HIV-infected patients with cryptococcal meningoencephalitis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-cryptococcus-neoformans-meningoencephalitis-in-hiv-infected-patients/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. In addition, the investigators compared eight weeks of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fluconazole-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">fluconazole</a> (400 mg daily) or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=itraconazole-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">itraconazole</a> (400 mg daily) as consolidation therapy. This trial demonstrated that: </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>CSF sterilization at two weeks occurred more frequently among patients receiving combination therapy compared with amphotericin B alone (60 versus 51 percent) without increased toxicity. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Among the patients who underwent a repeat lumbar puncture at the end of the consolidation phase, the CSF culture was negative in 97 percent of patients on the <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fluconazole-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">fluconazole</a> arm (139 of 151) compared with 92 percent in the <a href=\"topic.htm?path=itraconazole-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">itraconazole</a> group (93 of 101 patients). However, the data are somewhat limited since a significant percentage of patients assigned to the itraconazole and fluconazole arms did not undergo repeat lumbar puncture (35 and 26 percent, respectively). Clinical outcomes were similar between the two arms.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Overall mortality was 5.5 percent within the first two weeks and 3.9 percent in the next eight weeks, with no significant difference between groups. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A multivariate analysis demonstrated that the likelihood of CSF sterilization at the end of 10 weeks was highest among those patients who were assigned combination therapy followed by <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fluconazole-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">fluconazole</a>. </p><p/><p>In contrast to the trial described above [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-cryptococcus-neoformans-meningoencephalitis-in-hiv-infected-patients/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>], a subsequent randomized open-label trial that compared the efficacy of three different induction therapy regimens showed a mortality benefit with amphotericin B plus <a href=\"topic.htm?path=flucytosine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">flucytosine</a> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-cryptococcus-neoformans-meningoencephalitis-in-hiv-infected-patients/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].

However since flucytosine is not available in some resource-limited settings, an important question is whether combination therapy with amphotericin B plus an azole results in comparable outcomes as amphotericin B plus flucytosine.

For patients who received amphotericin B plus flucytosine during the induction phase of therapy, we recommend <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fluconazole-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">fluconazole</a> (400 mg per day orally) rather than <a href=\"topic.htm?path=itraconazole-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">itraconazole</a> during the consolidation phase (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=2\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1B</a>). For patients who received amphotericin B plus fluconazole during the induction phase of therapy, we suggest fluconazole at a dose of 800 mg orally daily rather than itraconazole or fluconazole at a lower dose (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). (See <a href=\"#H4521551\" class=\"local\">'Induction and consolidation'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>After the completion of <span class=\"nowrap\">induction/consolidation</span> phases of therapy, we recommend <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fluconazole-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">fluconazole</a> (200 mg daily) for maintenance treatment compared with no therapy (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=1\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1A</a>).

Close follow-up is advised, and fluconazole should be reinitiated if the CD4 cell count declines to &lt;100 <span class=\"nowrap\">cells/microL</span>. (See <a href=\"#H7361633\" class=\"local\">'Discontinuation of maintenance therapy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We suggest not routinely administering antifungal prophylaxis for primary prevention of cryptococcal disease (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=5\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2B</a>). However, for asymptomatic patients with a CD4 count &lt;100 <span class=\"nowrap\">cells/microL</span> not receiving ART, who are from resource-limited settings where the prevalence of cryptococcal antigenemia is &gt;3 percent, we suggest a strategy involving serum cryptococcal antigen screening prior to initiation of ART (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). The management of patients who screen positive for cryptococcal antigen is discussed above. (See <a href=\"#H7361640\" class=\"local\">'Preventing symptomatic disease'</a> above.)</p></div><div id=\"topicAgreement\">Use of UpToDate is subject to the <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/legal/license\" class=\"licenseLink\" id=\"sla_in_page\">Subscription and License Agreement</a>.</div><div id=\"references\" class=\"headingAnchor\"><h1>REFERENCES</h1><ol id=\"reference\"><li><a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-cryptococcus-neoformans-meningoencephalitis-in-hiv-infected-patients/abstract/1\" class=\"nounderline abstract_t\">Bamba S, Lortholary O, Sawadogo A, et al.
