MCD and focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS) are both examples of pathogenic mechanisms that primarily affect the podocyte (&quot;podocytopathies&quot;). These entities are not characterized by immune deposits, but there may be a role for circulating factors in the pathogenesis of both diseases. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Pathogenesis'</a> below and <a href=\"#H4055163931\" class=\"local\">'Primary MCD versus primary FSGS'</a> below.)</p><p>The pathogenesis, etiology, causes, and diagnosis of MCD in adults will be reviewed here. The treatment of MCD as well as the pathogenesis, diagnosis, and treatment of FSGS are discussed separately.

Almost all children with MCD respond to a short course of glucocorticoids. Childhood nephrosis is considered glucocorticoid resistant when no remission is achieved after approximately two months of full-dose glucocorticoid therapy. Pediatricians usually restrict renal biopsy to individuals with glucocorticoid-resistant nephrotic syndrome. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=etiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-nephrotic-syndrome-in-children#H7\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Etiology, clinical manifestations, and diagnosis of nephrotic syndrome in children&quot;, section on 'Idiopathic nephrotic syndrome'</a>.)</p><p>By comparison, adults with MCD present with clinical features that are consistent with other glomerular diseases and may not respond to a short course of glucocorticoids. Some adults remit within eight weeks, while others require up to 16 weeks of glucocorticoid therapy (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEPH%2F58623\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef58623 \">figure 1</a>), with the associated hazards of glucocorticoid toxicity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/etiology-clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-minimal-change-disease-in-adults/abstract/60\" class=\"abstract_t\">60</a>] (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-minimal-change-disease-in-adults#H9\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of minimal change disease in adults&quot;, section on 'Time course and patient age'</a>). Since the diagnosis of MCD (versus other causes of the nephrotic syndrome) cannot be predictably made from the clinical presentation, a renal biopsy is almost always performed in adults who present with the nephrotic syndrome to both establish the diagnosis and guide therapy.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H668779289\"><span class=\"h2\">Differential diagnosis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>As mentioned above, MCD is characterized pathologically by normal-appearing glomeruli on light microscopy and the absence of complement or immunoglobulin deposits on immunofluorescence microscopy. The characteristic histologic lesion is diffuse effacement of the epithelial foot processes on electron microscopy (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEPH%2F58414\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef58414 \">picture 1</a>). Although foot process effacement is also seen in other causes of the nephrotic syndrome (eg, focal segmental glomerulosclerosis [FSGS; including human immunodeficiency (HIV)-associated FSGS], membranous nephropathy [including membranous lupus], diabetic nephropathy, and amyloidosis), these disorders have characteristic findings on light and immunofluorescence microscopy and, in some disorders, blood test abnormalities that are not seen in MCD. (See <a href=\"#H58052618\" class=\"local\">'Pathology'</a> above and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=glomerular-disease-evaluation-and-differential-diagnosis-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Glomerular disease: Evaluation and differential diagnosis in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p>In addition to MCD, there are three other disorders that usually present with the nephrotic syndrome and that may show only minor changes on light microscopy: idiopathic mesangial proliferative glomerulonephritis, immunoglobulin M (IgM) nephropathy, and C1q nephropathy. These disorders may represent variants of MCD or FSGS, but some clinicians believe that they are often separate conditions. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=minimal-change-variants-mesangial-proliferation-igm-nephropathy-c1q-nephropathy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Minimal change variants: Mesangial proliferation; IgM nephropathy; C1q nephropathy&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4055163931\"><span class=\"h3\">Primary MCD versus primary FSGS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There continues to be debate as to whether MCD and focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS) fall within the spectrum of the same disease or whether they represent separate pathogenetic entities [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/etiology-clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-minimal-change-disease-in-adults/abstract/61\" class=\"abstract_t\">61</a>]. Other than the descriptive changes on light microscopy, the two entities can be separated based on clinical and pathological features. On one hand, primary MCD is characterized by the full nephrotic syndrome, complete foot process effacement on electron microscopy, and a complete response to immunosuppression (albeit with a significant chance of recurrence). Although patients may present with acute kidney injury (AKI), they usually recover, and end-stage renal disease (ESRD) is distinctly rare.</p><p>FSGS, on the other hand, is now a descriptive term that encompasses both sclerotic and nonsclerotic glomerular lesions. There are several pathogenic mechanisms associated with FSGS (genetic, hyperfiltration, and drug or viral injury). In the absence of these associations (&quot;secondary forms of FSGS&quot;), the patients are labeled as having &quot;primary&quot; or &quot;idiopathic&quot; FSGS, some of which have been ascribed to circulating factor(s) owing to the recurrence of the disease in kidney transplants. Importantly in primary FSGS, response to immunosuppression is seen only in approximately one-half of patients, typically partial remissions (with the exception of tip lesion FSGS), and progressive renal failure is common in patients with persistent, high-grade proteinuria. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epidemiology-classification-and-pathogenesis-of-focal-segmental-glomerulosclerosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Epidemiology, classification, and pathogenesis of focal segmental glomerulosclerosis&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-primary-focal-segmental-glomerulosclerosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of primary focal segmental glomerulosclerosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p>With primary FSGS, the biopsy diagnosis requires the finding of segmental glomerulosclerosis in at least one glomerulus in addition to diffuse foot process effacement. However, sclerotic lesions are focal, and affected glomeruli may be missed, leading to an incorrect diagnosis of MCD. As an example, sclerotic changes occur first in the juxtamedullary glomeruli, which may not be present in superficial biopsies that contain only the outer cortex or in biopsies that contain fewer than eight glomeruli, where sampling error may be important.</p><p>Specific biomarkers have been proposed separating MCD from FSGS, including podocyte B7-1, dystroglycan, angiopoietin-like 4 (Angptl4), and CD44. Similarly, circulating factors including cardiotrophin-like cytokine factor-1 (CLCF1), soluble urokinase receptor (suPAR), and hemopexin have also been suggested as being specific. Finally, differential gene expression in the glomeruli has been reported. However, these reports have not shown consistent results or have not been validated by other investigators [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/etiology-clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-minimal-change-disease-in-adults/abstract/61\" class=\"abstract_t\">61</a>].</p><p>Lastly, there are clear examples of patients who begin with a classic, clinical presentation of MCD but over time become increasingly refractory to immunosuppression and, on repeat kidney biopsy, show sclerotic lesions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/etiology-clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-minimal-change-disease-in-adults/abstract/62,63\" class=\"abstract_t\">62,63</a>].

If the injury is severe or if repair mechanisms are defective (eg, in the presence of genetic predisposing factors such as the presence of two high-risk apolipoprotein L1 alleles), podocyte loss occurs, leading to sclerosis and the appearance of FSGS lesions. The latter is associated with less glucocorticoid sensitivity and progressive renal insufficiency [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/etiology-clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-minimal-change-disease-in-adults/abstract/61\" class=\"abstract_t\">61</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H668779351\"><span class=\"h2\">MCD in the older adult</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Older adult patients with MCD present with the nephrotic syndrome, as do younger patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/etiology-clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-minimal-change-disease-in-adults/abstract/64\" class=\"abstract_t\">64</a>]. However, the histologic diagnosis of MCD may be more difficult in older patients. The aging kidney commonly shows obsolescent glomeruli along with vascular lesions and interstitial fibrosis. These findings may suggest primary FSGS or MCD superimposed upon changes associated with aging. Standard light, immunofluorescence, and electron microscopy may not easily distinguish between these disorders.</p><p>However, the following features may allow the clinician to distinguish MCD from primary FSGS in older adult patients with superimposed arteriolo- and arterio-nephrosclerosis using morphologic criteria alone:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The glomerulosclerosis that accompanies aging is more often focal and global rather than focal and segmental, as is observed in primary or secondary FSGS.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Extensive &quot;collapsing&quot; or &quot;tip&quot; lesions suggest a primary form of FSGS rather than MCD since these lesions are not the consequence of the aging process in the kidneys.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Extensive focal and segmental IgM deposits support the diagnosis of FSGS rather than MCD, but these are seldom present in the absence of typical focal and segmental lesions on light microscopy.</p><p/><p>Older adult patients for whom a definitive diagnosis of MCD cannot be made because of concurrent lesions of aging sometimes undergo a trial of treatment with glucocorticoids. Remission is induced within two to four months of appropriate-dose glucocorticoid therapy in approximately 75 to 90 percent of patients with MCD (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEPH%2F58623\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef58623 \">figure 1</a>).
