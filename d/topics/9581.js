JDM is primarily a capillary vasculopathy, whereas JPM involves direct T cell invasion of muscle fibers similar to that seen in adult polymyositis (PM) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/juvenile-dermatomyositis-and-polymyositis-epidemiology-pathogenesis-and-clinical-manifestations/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>]. However, as the diagnostic tools become more sophisticated (eg, biopsies that demonstrate inclusion body myositis or inflammatory dystrophies, or autoantibodies that are markers of particular types of myositis such as anti-signal recognition particle [SRP] and necrotizing myopathy), fewer patients are diagnosed with JPM, calling into question whether JPM is a specific entity.

In population-based studies, JDM has a reported annual incidence that ranges from two to four cases per one million children [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/juvenile-dermatomyositis-and-polymyositis-epidemiology-pathogenesis-and-clinical-manifestations/abstract/5-9\" class=\"abstract_t\">5-9</a>].

JDM is associated with systemic vasculopathy. It is sometimes associated with occlusive arteriopathy and capillary necrosis that eventually lead to capillary loss and tissue ischemia. Although the etiology remains unclear, it has been proposed that JDM and JPM are caused by an autoimmune reaction in genetically susceptible individuals, possibly in response to infection or environmental triggers such as prenatal exposure to tobacco smoke and particulate inhalants [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/juvenile-dermatomyositis-and-polymyositis-epidemiology-pathogenesis-and-clinical-manifestations/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>].
