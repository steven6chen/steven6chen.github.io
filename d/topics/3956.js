Decreased bone strength is related to many factors other than bone mineral density (BMD), including rates of bone formation and resorption (turnover), bone geometry (size and shape of bone), and microarchitecture (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F73327\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef73327 \">picture 1</a>). The World Health Organization (WHO) has defined diagnostic thresholds for low bone mass and osteoporosis based upon BMD measurements compared with a young-adult reference population (T-score).</p><p>The majority of postmenopausal women with osteoporosis have bone loss related to estrogen deficiency <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> age. The initial evaluation includes a history to assess for clinical risk factors for fracture and to evaluate for other conditions that contribute to bone loss, a physical examination, and basic laboratory tests. Those with abnormal initial findings may require additional testing to detect potentially reversible causes of osteoporosis. In addition, low BMD Z-scores (age-matched comparison) identify individuals requiring further evaluation for secondary causes of osteoporosis.</p><p>Early diagnosis and quantification of bone loss and fracture risk are important because of the availability of therapies that can slow or even reverse the progression of osteoporosis.</p><p>The clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and evaluation of osteoporosis in postmenopausal women will be reviewed here.

This is an important fact because many patients without symptoms incorrectly assume that they must not have osteoporosis. On the other hand, many patients with achy hips or feet assume that their complaints are due to osteoporosis. This is unlikely to be true in the absence of fracture. In comparison, pain is common in osteomalacia in the absence of fractures or other bone deformities. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epidemiology-and-etiology-of-osteomalacia\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Epidemiology and etiology of osteomalacia&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Vertebral fracture</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Vertebral fracture is the most common clinical manifestation of osteoporosis. Most of these fractures (about two-thirds) are asymptomatic; they are diagnosed as an incidental finding on chest or abdominal radiograph (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F60593\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef60593 \">image 1</a>). The clinical manifestations of symptomatic vertebral fracture, including height loss, are reviewed separately.

Subchondral insufficiency fractures of the femoral head, which may lead to a rapid loss of cartilage space and eventual destructive secondary osteoarthritis, have also been observed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-evaluation-of-osteoporosis-in-postmenopausal-women/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. In addition, distal radius fractures (Colles fractures) may occur. Colles fractures are more common in women shortly after menopause, whereas the risk of hip fracture rises exponentially with age.

Osteoporotic fractures involving the spine also occur spontaneously with minimal or no trauma.

Stress fractures are also not considered fragility fractures, as they are due to repetitive injury.

Thus, the presence of Z-score values more than 2 SD below the mean should prompt careful scrutiny for coexisting problems (eg, glucocorticoid therapy or alcoholism) that can contribute to osteoporosis.

The International Society for Clinical Densitometry (ISCD) has made recommendations for the application of the WHO classification in clinical practice [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-evaluation-of-osteoporosis-in-postmenopausal-women/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Postmenopausal women and men &ge;50 years</strong> &ndash; The ISCD advises that the WHO criteria be used in postmenopausal women and in men age 50 years and older.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Premenopausal women and men &lt;50 years</strong> &ndash; The ISCD advises that the WHO criteria <strong>not</strong> be used in premenopausal women or men under age 50 years because the relationship between BMD and fracture risk is not the same in younger women and men.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Children</strong> &ndash; The WHO classification should <strong>not</strong> be used in children (male or female under age 20 years), and a diagnosis of osteoporosis cannot be made in a child based on densitometric criteria alone. Z-scores, not T-scores, should be used, since it is not appropriate to compare the BMD of someone who has not yet achieved peak bone mass with that of an adult who has. However, there are few well-established standardized reference databases for calculating Z-scores in children [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-evaluation-of-osteoporosis-in-postmenopausal-women/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h3\">Method of BMD measurement</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Several different methods are available to measure bone density. DXA gives an accurate and precise estimate of BMD. Thus, in clinical practice, DXA is the technology used for diagnostic classification. Detailed information about DXA is found elsewhere (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-dual-energy-x-ray-absorptiometry\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry&quot;</a>). Other methods of measuring BMD for fracture risk assessment are reviewed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=osteoporotic-fracture-risk-assessment#H6\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Osteoporotic fracture risk assessment&quot;, section on 'Methods of measurement of BMD'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h3\">Site of measurement</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In women who are candidates for BMD testing, we suggest DXA measurements of the spine and hip because fractures at these sites have the greatest impact on patients' health. Measurement of hip BMD also has the highest predictive value for hip fracture. In addition, if pharmacologic therapy is planned, measurement of spine BMD is useful as it shows less variability and can detect responses to therapy earlier than hip BMD. We make the diagnosis according to the lowest T-score measured.</p><p>Interference from osteophytes and vascular calcifications on the spine measurement are common in aging women and interfere with the assessment of BMD at this site. In this setting, measurement of hip BMD alone or hip and one-third radial site is sufficient.</p><p>In all studies, the risk for most fractures is inversely proportional to bone density [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-evaluation-of-osteoporosis-in-postmenopausal-women/abstract/10-18\" class=\"abstract_t\">10-18</a>]. Some studies suggest that the risk for fracture at a particular site is best estimated by measuring bone density at that site [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-evaluation-of-osteoporosis-in-postmenopausal-women/abstract/19-22\" class=\"abstract_t\">19-22</a>]. Other studies, however, have found that measurement of BMD at any site predicts fracture risk at all sites equally well [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-evaluation-of-osteoporosis-in-postmenopausal-women/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. </p><p>The reference standard for diagnostic purposes is DXA at the hip (femoral neck or total hip) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-evaluation-of-osteoporosis-in-postmenopausal-women/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. The Fracture Risk Assessment Tool (FRAX) was designed to calculate fracture probability with femoral neck BMD measured by DXA. However, the preferred site for measurement of bone density and the number of sites to measure are debatable, and may vary according to the clinical situation. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=osteoporotic-fracture-risk-assessment#H16\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Osteoporotic fracture risk assessment&quot;, section on 'Skeletal site to measure'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=screening-for-osteoporosis#H12\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Screening for osteoporosis&quot;, section on 'Skeletal site to measure'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3329078\"><span class=\"h1\">DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Decreased bone mass can occur because peak bone mass is low, bone resorption is excessive, or bone formation during remodeling is decreased. All three processes are likely to contribute, in varying degrees, to osteoporosis in individual patients. Most postmenopausal women with osteoporosis, however, have either age- or estrogen deficiency-related bone loss due primarily to excessive bone resorption. Other causes of bone fractures and reduced bone mineral density (BMD) include osteomalacia, malignancy (eg, multiple myeloma), Paget disease, and hyperparathyroidism. Most of these diagnoses can be distinguished from estrogen deficiency-related osteoporosis by the clinical history, physical examination, and laboratory testing. (See <a href=\"#H14\" class=\"local\">'Evaluation of low bone mass'</a> below.)</p><p>Physical abuse should always be considered a possibility in a patient with fractures, particularly when the fracture burden exceeds what one would expect based on BMD, or when location of fractures is atypical. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=elder-mistreatment-abuse-neglect-and-financial-exploitation#H13\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Elder mistreatment: Abuse, neglect, and financial exploitation&quot;, section on 'Fractures'</a>.)</p><p>Low BMD may also be seen in conjunction with renal osteodystrophy in patients with decreased kidney function [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-evaluation-of-osteoporosis-in-postmenopausal-women/abstract/25-27\" class=\"abstract_t\">25-27</a>]. It is difficult to distinguish low bone density due to osteoporosis from low bone density due to any of the components of chronic kidney disease-metabolic bone disease. The distinction may be made biochemically in most cases, but may sometimes require bone biopsy. The diagnosis, evaluation, and management of osteoporosis in patients with chronic kidney disease and the diagnosis and management of renal osteodystrophy and secondary hyperparathyroidism are discussed in detail elsewhere.

Decreased bone strength is related to many factors in addition to bone mineral density (BMD), including rates of bone formation and resorption (turnover), bone geometry (size and shape of bone), and microarchitecture (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F73327\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef73327 \">picture 1</a>). (See <a href=\"#H1\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Osteoporosis has no clinical manifestations until there is a fracture. Complications of fractures include pain, deformity, disability, and loss of height. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Clinical manifestations'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A clinical diagnosis of osteoporosis may be made in the presence of a fragility fracture, particularly at the spine, hip, wrist, humerus, rib, and pelvis, without measurement of BMD. In the absence of a fragility fracture, BMD assessment by dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry (DXA) is the standard test to diagnose osteoporosis, according to the classification of the World Health Organization (WHO) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F74190\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef74190 \">table 1</a>). A DXA T-score &le;-2.5 is consistent with osteoporosis, whereas a T-score between -1.0 and -2.5 is low bone mass (osteopenia). (See <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'Bone mineral density'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>All postmenopausal women with osteoporosis (BMD T-score below -2.5 <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> fragility fracture) should have a history, physical examination, and basic laboratory evaluation. Initial laboratory studies should include a complete blood count (CBC), biochemistry profile, and 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25[OH]D). (See <a href=\"#H14\" class=\"local\">'Evaluation of low bone mass'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The need for additional laboratory evaluation depends upon the initial evaluation and Z-score (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F62821\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef62821 \">table 3</a>). Women who have abnormalities on initial laboratory testing, suspicious findings on history and physical examination suggesting a secondary cause of osteoporosis, or Z-scores &le;-2.0 may require additional evaluation for these secondary causes (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F54926\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef54926 \">table 2</a>).
