It is an important cause of infection in three populations:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Neonates &ndash; GBS infection is acquired in utero by ascending infection or during passage through the vagina. Neonatal disease is categorized by the age at onset into early- and late-onset infection. Early-onset most commonly presents at or within 12 hours of birth but, by definition, can occur through day six of life. The most common manifestations are bacteremia without a focus, sepsis, pneumonia, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> meningitis. Late-onset infection occurs after day six and up to 90 days of life. It most often presents as bacteremia without a focus (65 percent of cases) but meningitis (32 percent) and focal infections also occur. Late-onset infections most frequently are caused by serotype III GBS. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=group-b-streptococcal-infection-in-neonates-and-young-infants\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Group B streptococcal infection in neonates and young infants&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pregnant women &ndash; GBS is a frequent cause of urinary tract infection (usually asymptomatic bacteriuria), chorioamnionitis, postpartum endometritis, and peripartum bacteremia. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=group-b-streptococcal-infection-in-pregnant-women\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Group B streptococcal infection in pregnant women&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Nonpregnant adults &ndash; GBS is increasingly recognized as a cause of sepsis, soft tissue infections, and other focal infections in nonpregnant adults. These infections occur predominantly in those with chronic underlying medical conditions, such as diabetes mellitus, malignancy especially breast cancer, and liver disease. However, GBS also can cause infection in healthy patients over the age of 65 years. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=group-b-streptococcal-infections-in-nonpregnant-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Group B streptococcal infections in nonpregnant adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p>The microbiology of GBS will be reviewed here.

Lancefield identified the group B antigen, a cell wall-associated carbohydrate that distinguishes GBS from other streptococcal species [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/group-b-streptococcus-virulence-factors-and-pathogenic-mechanisms/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Clinical microbiology</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>GBS is identified in the clinical laboratory by its characteristic narrow zone of beta hemolysis; by its elaboration of CAMP factor, a phospholipase which enhances the hemolysis caused by beta lysins of many <em>Staphylococcus aureus</em> strains; and by biochemical characteristics, including lack of hydrolysis of bile esculin agar and hydrolysis of hippurate [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/group-b-streptococcus-virulence-factors-and-pathogenic-mechanisms/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>]. Commercial kits with antisera that recognize the group B antigen are used to confirm the identity of isolates. </p><p>Molecular methods such as real-time polymerase chain reaction are also used for rapid identification of GBS and are available commercially [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/group-b-streptococcus-virulence-factors-and-pathogenic-mechanisms/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. Whole genome sequencing may facilitate determination of serotype and antimicrobial resistance [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/group-b-streptococcus-virulence-factors-and-pathogenic-mechanisms/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Virulence factors</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>GBS produces many extracellular substances, some of which have a role either in virulence or as protective antigens [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/group-b-streptococcus-virulence-factors-and-pathogenic-mechanisms/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. The best characterized are the capsular polysaccharides, which confer serotype specificity to GBS [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/group-b-streptococcus-virulence-factors-and-pathogenic-mechanisms/abstract/7-9\" class=\"abstract_t\">7-9</a>]. These complex carbohydrates are composed of approximately 150 repeating oligosaccharide subunits [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/group-b-streptococcus-virulence-factors-and-pathogenic-mechanisms/abstract/10-13\" class=\"abstract_t\">10-13</a>]. The 10 capsular serotypes (Ia, Ib, II, III, IV, V, VI, VII, VIII and IX) currently recognized differ in their arrangements of monosaccharides within the oligosaccharide repeating units. However, each subunit contains a mono-, di-, or trisaccharide side chain terminating in an N-acetylneuraminic acid (sialic acid) residue.</p><p>The capsule confers virulence to the organism, at least in part, by inhibiting the deposition of complement components on the surface of the organism in the absence of serotype-specific antibody. The sialic acid moiety is critical to this function. Antibodies to capsular polysaccharide confer protection against invasive disease, at least in neonates and young infants [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/group-b-streptococcus-virulence-factors-and-pathogenic-mechanisms/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. Subsequent data suggest a role for GBS capsular sialic acid moieties in molecular mimicry of host structures. Capsular residues bind neutrophil Siglec-9 resulting in impaired neutrophil response [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/group-b-streptococcus-virulence-factors-and-pathogenic-mechanisms/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>].</p><p>The invasion associated gene (iagA), which encodes a glycosyltransferase and produces a cell membrane anchor for lipoteichoic acid, plays a role in bacterial invasion of the blood-brain barrier. In a mouse model of hematogenous meningitis, animals challenged with a GBS iagA mutant developed bacteremia comparable to mice challenged with wild-type GBS organisms, but had significantly lower mortality (20 versus 90 percent) and a decreased incidence of meningitis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/group-b-streptococcus-virulence-factors-and-pathogenic-mechanisms/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>].</p><p>For a particular strain of serotype III GBS that has been strongly associated with neonatal meningitis after the first week of life, a surface-anchored protein called hypervirulent GBS adhesin (HvgA) is thought to mediate its hypervirulence [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/group-b-streptococcus-virulence-factors-and-pathogenic-mechanisms/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. Expression of HvgA promotes adherence to the intestinal epithelium and cells that form the blood-brain barrier. When GBS expressing HvgA are inoculated into mice, the bacteria can be detected in their meninges, brain parenchyma, and cerebral vasculature. In contrast, lower numbers of GBS are found at these sites in mice infected with HvgA deletion mutants.</p><p>The two-component <span class=\"nowrap\">CovR/S</span> regulatory system controls numerous gene products that impact the virulence of GBS [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/group-b-streptococcus-virulence-factors-and-pathogenic-mechanisms/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. GBS strains lacking <span class=\"nowrap\">CovR/S,</span> which acts as a hemolysin repressor, accelerate amniotic barrier failure and penetrate chorioamniotic membranes in a hemolysin-dependent manner [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/group-b-streptococcus-virulence-factors-and-pathogenic-mechanisms/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. Some hyperhemolytic clinical isolates from women in preterm labor are associated with <span class=\"nowrap\">CovR/S</span> mutations. These isolates have been shown to allow ascending infection and fetal injury. The hemolysin appears to be an ornithine rhamnolipid pigment known as granadaene [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/group-b-streptococcus-virulence-factors-and-pathogenic-mechanisms/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. Another virulence mechanism for GBS is direct cytotoxicity to host phagocytes.</p><p>C proteins and other related surface proteins also are known to be involved in protective immunity and may have a role in virulence [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/group-b-streptococcus-virulence-factors-and-pathogenic-mechanisms/abstract/21-24\" class=\"abstract_t\">21-24</a>]. As an example, some neonatal isolates contain fewer tandem repeats in the alpha C surface protein than do their corresponding maternal isolate; these organisms, which may be selected for under specific antibody pressure, are less sensitive to killing by specific antibody [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/group-b-streptococcus-virulence-factors-and-pathogenic-mechanisms/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. On the other hand, in vitro studies show that organisms with larger numbers of repeats generate less antibody response [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/group-b-streptococcus-virulence-factors-and-pathogenic-mechanisms/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. The following hypothesis can reconcile these seemingly contradictory findings. In nature, GBS has a relatively high number of repeats, which tends to diminish the antibody response; if an antibody response occurs, the organism loses repeats, thereby removing the inciting antigen. In addition, the alpha C protein has been shown to have a role in invasion by GBS into cultured cervical epithelial cells that is related to binding of host glycosaminoglycans [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/group-b-streptococcus-virulence-factors-and-pathogenic-mechanisms/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. </p><p>Pilins, long known for their role in virulence of gram-negative pathogens, have also been demonstrated to occur in group B streptococci and function as adhesins, promote CNS entry, and enhance biofilm formation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/group-b-streptococcus-virulence-factors-and-pathogenic-mechanisms/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. Antibodies directed against pilus-islands 1, 2a, and 2b are protective in a murine model of lethal infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/group-b-streptococcus-virulence-factors-and-pathogenic-mechanisms/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. Sialylation of the PilA adhesion has been observed and suggests that this may contribute to stability and host interactions of the pilins [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/group-b-streptococcus-virulence-factors-and-pathogenic-mechanisms/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. Other substances produced by GBS, which are less completely characterized, include hemolysins, protease CspA, complement inhibiting protein (CIP), Pbp1a, Serine-rich proteins (Srr1 and Srr2) that bind to host fibrinolytic proteins, CAMP factor, plasminogen-binding protein (PbsP), hyaluronate lyase (hyaluronidase), complement factor 5a (C5a) peptidase, nucleases, and lipoteichoic acid. Among these, the best evidence for virulence in human infection is for beta hemolysin [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/group-b-streptococcus-virulence-factors-and-pathogenic-mechanisms/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>] and C5a peptidase [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/group-b-streptococcus-virulence-factors-and-pathogenic-mechanisms/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p>Multiple complete genomic sequences for GBS have been published and are available through online databases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/group-b-streptococcus-virulence-factors-and-pathogenic-mechanisms/abstract/30,31\" class=\"abstract_t\">30,31</a>]. Complete genomic sequencing of 202 invasive GBS of serotype V belonging to a virulent multilocus sequence type (ST 1) revealed the presence of a novel alpha-like protein [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/group-b-streptococcus-virulence-factors-and-pathogenic-mechanisms/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>]. The genomic analysis also suggested that small genetic changes (often at loci encoding capsule biosynthesis proteins, pilus regulation, and 2-component regulators) drove phenotypic diversity and that recombination appeared relatively unimportant. Analysis of genomic data should enable the identification of new vaccine antigens and improve the understanding of pathogenic mechanisms and epidemiology of GBS. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"PATIENT_INFORMATION\"><span class=\"h1\">INFORMATION FOR PATIENTS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>UpToDate offers two types of patient education materials, &ldquo;The Basics&rdquo; and &ldquo;Beyond the Basics.&rdquo; The Basics patient education pieces are written in plain language, at the 5<sup>th</sup> to 6<sup>th</sup> grade reading level, and they answer the four or five key questions a patient might have about a given condition.
