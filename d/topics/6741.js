A major aspect of the evaluation involves distinguishing between pain due to vaso-occlusion and pain that signifies more serious complications of disease, which often require separate evaluations and treatments in addition to analgesia.</p><p>This topic review discusses the immediate evaluation of the individual with SCD who presents with acute pain, and the testing needed to identify other SCD complications or comorbidities that require treatment. </p><p>Separate topic reviews provide detailed discussions of our approaches to providing analgesia for acute vaso-occlusive pain, chronic SCD pain management, and the role of blood transfusion in treating acute SCD complications such as stroke, acute chest syndrome, and multiorgan failure. </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Analgesia for acute pain</strong> &ndash; (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=vaso-occlusive-pain-management-in-sickle-cell-disease#H730795\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Vaso-occlusive pain management in sickle cell disease&quot;, section on 'Acute pain management'</a>.) </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Chronic pain management</strong> &ndash; (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=vaso-occlusive-pain-management-in-sickle-cell-disease#H3221926409\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Vaso-occlusive pain management in sickle cell disease&quot;, section on 'Chronic pain'</a>.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Transfusion for complications</strong> &ndash; (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=red-blood-cell-transfusion-in-sickle-cell-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Red blood cell transfusion in sickle cell disease&quot;</a>.) &#160;</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H989683048\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL ASSESSMENT OF PAIN</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients with SCD who present with acute pain should have a rapid assessment for the possibility of other serious complications concurrently with the treatment of pain. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3155560087\"><span class=\"h2\">Features associated with vaso-occlusive pain</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Vaso-occlusive pain in SCD is intense; it can begin as early as six months of age and typically lasts throughout life [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-acute-pain-in-sickle-cell-disease/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>]. The intensity can range from mild to debilitating, and the duration can last from hours to days. Common locations for vaso-occlusive pain include the back, chest, abdomen, and long bones. Infants and toddlers may present with dactylitis (pain and swelling from infarctions involving the hands and feet). Premenstrual hormonal changes may be associated with an increase in vaso-occlusive pain episodes. Neuropathic pain, which may include components of central sensitization, peripheral nerve injury, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> hyperalgesia, increases with age and is likely underdiagnosed in individuals with SCD.</p><p>The gold standard for assessment of the pain is the patient's (or family's) report of the pain severity and similarity to or difference from previous vaso-occlusive pain episodes. There are no specific laboratory findings associated with vaso-occlusive pain. Analgesia should not be delayed while awaiting other information such as laboratory tests, and results of laboratory testing should not be used to justify withholding of pain medication or use of a lower dose. Studies have suggested that misperceptions of health care providers can interfere significantly with adequate assessment of pain intensity, and in turn may lead to insufficient treatment. These considerations and supporting evidence are presented in more detail separately.

Analgesia should not be delayed while performing additional evaluations, and triage wait time should not exceed 30 minutes. Our approach to acute pain control in SCD, including these issues, is presented in details separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=vaso-occlusive-pain-management-in-sickle-cell-disease#H730795\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Vaso-occlusive pain management in sickle cell disease&quot;, section on 'Acute pain management'</a>.) &#160;</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H305129128\"><span class=\"h1\">POTENTIALLY SERIOUS CONDITIONS ASSOCIATED WITH PAIN</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4088163291\"><span class=\"h2\">Overview of possible conditions and our approach to distinguishing among them</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>SCD can be associated with vaso-occlusion in almost any site, and this in turn can lead to potentially life-threatening infarction, infection, or other complications. General features that suggest an additional complication are listed above. (See <a href=\"#H2653948092\" class=\"local\">'Features that suggest an additional complication'</a> above.)</p><p>Initially, we review the likelihood of each potential complication based on the patient's clinical presentation, as summarized in the table (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F110434\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef110434 \">table 1</a>). In individuals with high-risk features in their history, abnormal vital signs, physical examination findings, or major changes from the baseline complete blood count (CBC), we obtain targeted laboratory tests <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> observe the patient in the hospital. </p><p>There are several high-risk features and areas of potential concern that we consider to be risk factors for complications, and we pay particular attention to the following findings in a patient with SCD having acute pain:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Comorbidities</strong> &ndash; Individuals with chronic organ dysfunction warrant early intervention and hospitalization; this includes chronic renal failure, chronic lung disease, pulmonary hypertension, cardiac dysfunction, recurrent acute chest syndrome, hypertension, and a history of neurologic disease (eg, stroke, intracranial bleeding). </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Pregnancy or postoperative</strong> &ndash; Individuals who present with acute pain during pregnancy or postoperatively also warrant early intervention and close observation. These individuals are at increased risk for venous thromboembolism, acute chest syndrome, and infection. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Atypical pain</strong> &ndash; Individuals who report that their pain is atypical for their disease (eg, more severe than usual, in a different location) are more likely to have a complication or other undiagnosed comorbidity.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Vital signs</strong> &ndash; Vital signs are especially important. We repeat vital signs serially and thoroughly evaluate any abnormality such as a temperature of 38.5&deg;C (101.3&deg;F) or above; increased respiratory rate, oxygen desaturation by pulse oximetry, or shortness of breath; hypertension; orthostatic hypotension; or marked, persistent tachycardia.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Overall clinical picture</strong> &ndash; The overall clinical picture is important for noting features such as increased jaundice, chest pain, abdominal pain, confusion, or non-focal neurologic symptoms. </p><p/><p>Once the history, vital signs, and examination have been reviewed for possible complications, the need for additional laboratory testing is determined. We systematically review the possible causes of these findings and determine which require further evaluation (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F110434\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef110434 \">table 1</a>). These are discussed in more detail in the following sections. Exclusion of possible complications does not necessarily require ordering of additional testing, but it does require conversation with the patient, a thorough review of the common potential complications, and attention to features that suggest increased risk.</p><p>Observation in the hospital may be especially helpful in identifying or systematically excluding a potentially life-threatening complication, especially if the history suggests high-risk features and initial testing (laboratory values, chest radiography) is unrevealing. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3051012203\"><span class=\"h2\">Acute systemic illness, diffuse pain, or both</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Pain in multiple areas or nonspecific pain may be a sign of an acute systemic illness such as multiorgan failure, an entity known as rapidly progressive acute chest syndrome, or a hemolytic transfusion reaction (HTR). Opioid withdrawal may also cause systemic symptoms in certain individuals.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Multiorgan failure</strong> &ndash; Individuals with multiorgan failure may have a history of organ dysfunction such as chronic lung disease or chronic renal disease, although this may not always be present. Presenting findings may include especially severe, diffuse pain, along with fever, tachycardia, and tachypnea. Blood pressure can be variably high or low. Laboratory studies in multiorgan failure may show evidence of bone marrow suppression (eg, hemoglobin level below the patient's baseline; thrombocytopenia) and evidence of increased hemolysis <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> rhabdomyolysis such as increased lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), increased creatinine kinase (CK), increased creatinine, marked increase bilirubin, and increased liver enzymes. Of note, some individuals with SCD have a low creatinine at baseline, so a clinically significant increase may appear to be within the normal range. Multiorgan failure is life-threatening, and urgent hematology <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> transfusion medicine input is appropriate so that exchange transfusion can be initiated. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=red-blood-cell-transfusion-in-sickle-cell-disease#H213262\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Red blood cell transfusion in sickle cell disease&quot;, section on 'Multiorgan failure'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Rapidly progressive acute chest syndrome</strong> &ndash; A distinct phenotype of acute chest syndrome (ACS) has been identified, referred to as rapidly progressive ACS [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-acute-pain-in-sickle-cell-disease/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. This syndrome is characterized by respiratory failure &le;24 hours after the onset of respiratory symptoms, and is associated with multiorgan failure. It is distinct from ACS that has a more subacute and protracted course. In a cohort of 173 individuals (97 children and 76 adults) with SCD and at least one ACS episode, rapidly progressive ACS occurred in 16 (21 percent) of the adults and 2 (2 percent) of the children [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-acute-pain-in-sickle-cell-disease/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. A decline in platelet count at presentation was the only predictor of developing rapidly progressive ACS (odds ratio 4.82 [95% CI 1.20-19.39]).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">The typical findings of ACS are discussed in more detail below. (See <a href=\"#H2283688223\" class=\"local\">'Chest pain'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Hemolytic transfusion reaction</strong> &ndash; HTRs can occur in the immediate post-transfusion period (ie, acute hemolytic transfusion reaction [AHTR]) or they may occur up to a month after transfusion due to antibody boosting from re-exposure to a red blood cell antigen (ie, delayed hemolytic transfusion reaction [DHTR]). Individuals with SCD are at increased risk of HTRs, especially DHTRs, due to the frequency of transfusions and the greater likelihood of alloimmunization. Delayed hemolytic transfusion reactions may present as an acute vaso-occlusive event. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=red-blood-cell-transfusion-in-sickle-cell-disease#H13341330\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Red blood cell transfusion in sickle cell disease&quot;, section on 'Complications of RBC transfusion'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">AHTRs are generally more clinically severe because they involve a greater degree of hemolysis and the hemolysis is mostly intravascular; intravascular hemolysis can be associated with renal failure and disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC). However, DHTRs can also be clinically significant, especially in individuals with SCD who have ongoing compensated hemolysis at baseline. Presenting findings of AHTRs include acute back or chest pain, <span class=\"nowrap\">fever/chills,</span> red urine, red plasma, oozing from catheter sites, and laboratory evidence of DIC (increased prothrombin time and activated partial thromboplastin time [PT and aPTT], decreased fibrinogen, increased D-dimer). DHTRs may present with painless jaundice. Both AHTRs and DHTRs are associated with laboratory evidence of hemolysis, including reduced hemoglobin compared with the patient's baseline, increased LDH, and increased bilirubin. The evaluation and management of HTRs are presented separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=approach-to-the-patient-with-a-suspected-acute-transfusion-reaction\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Approach to the patient with a suspected acute transfusion reaction&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Opioid withdrawal</strong> &ndash; In a patient receiving opioids or who has recently had opioids discontinued, opioid withdrawal or neuropathic pain may present with diffuse pain. In opioid withdrawal, autonomic findings may be present such as tachycardia, tachypnea, restlessness, rhinorrhea, abdominal cramping, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> diarrhea. Opioid withdrawal syndrome commonly presents as vaso-occlusive pain in patients who have been exposed to recent prolonged opioid use and have not undergone a tapering program [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-acute-pain-in-sickle-cell-disease/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. Laboratory studies may be at the patient's baseline. Management and prevention of opioid withdrawal are presented separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=opioid-withdrawal-in-the-emergency-setting\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Opioid withdrawal in the emergency setting&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=opioid-withdrawal-in-adolescents\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Opioid withdrawal in adolescents&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=vaso-occlusive-pain-management-in-sickle-cell-disease#H22\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Vaso-occlusive pain management in sickle cell disease&quot;, section on 'Weaning of opioids and discharge'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H683253353\"><span class=\"h2\">Jaundice</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Jaundice associated with pain may be a sign of a hemolytic transfusion reaction (AHTR or DHTR) or hepatobiliary disease. (See <a href=\"#H3051012203\" class=\"local\">'Acute systemic illness, diffuse pain, or both'</a> above and <a href=\"#H1573238478\" class=\"local\">'Abdominal pain'</a> below.) </p><p>A markedly elevated bilirubin may be a precursor to multiorgan failure syndrome. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3232640610\"><span class=\"h2\">Headache, mental status changes, or both</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Headache or neck pain in an individual with SCD may signify a vascular complication such as stroke, aneurysm, or migraine; or a central nervous system infection such as meningitis. These complications may also be associated with mental status changes such as confusion and other nonfocal neurologic findings. Hypoxia is another potential contributing factor to mental status changes (eg, due to pulmonary fat embolism or acute chest syndrome).</p><p>Stroke risk is increased in SCD (ischemic and hemorrhagic strokes), especially in those with a prior history of stroke, a history of silent cerebral infarcts, or increased transcranial Doppler velocities. Some individuals develop cerebral aneurysms with a moya-moya-like pattern. Focal or nonfocal neurologic findings may be present. There are no specific laboratory findings associated with stroke. Imaging is indicated to determine the presence, site, and features of a vascular lesion. Treatment with simple blood transfusion is appropriate for those with suspected stroke. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acute-stroke-in-sickle-cell-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Acute stroke in sickle cell disease&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Individuals with SCD are at risk for infection with encapsulated organisms including meningitis, due to their functional asplenia, which occurs by early childhood. This may be especially true in those who do not have access to prophylactic penicillin, but is also possible in those receiving prophylaxis. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sickle-cell-disease-in-sub-saharan-africa#H12701445\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Sickle cell disease in sub-Saharan Africa&quot;, section on 'Infections'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-the-clinical-manifestations-of-sickle-cell-disease#H2922132476\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of the clinical manifestations of sickle cell disease&quot;, section on 'Infection'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2283688223\"><span class=\"h2\">Chest pain</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Chest pain is a common high-risk symptom; it may occur with a number of complications including acute chest syndrome (ACS), pneumonia, pulmonary embolism (PE), pulmonary fat embolism, cardiac ischemia, or rib infarction. The history may be helpful in distinguishing among these (eg, history of deep vein thrombosis [DVT] suggests greater likelihood of PE; history of cardiac disease or pulmonary hypertension suggests increased risk of cardiac ischemia; history of coughing with abrupt pain in the chest wall suggests rib fracture). However, a high level of suspicion for the possibility of ACS should be maintained regardless of history. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=the-acute-chest-syndrome-in-children-and-adolescents-with-sickle-cell-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;The acute chest syndrome in children and adolescents with sickle cell disease&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acute-chest-syndrome-in-adults-with-sickle-cell-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Acute chest syndrome in adults with sickle cell disease&quot;</a>.)</p><p>As noted above, a small proportion of children and approximately 20 percent of adults may develop a syndrome of rapidly progressive ACS associated with multiorgan failure. (See <a href=\"#H3051012203\" class=\"local\">'Acute systemic illness, diffuse pain, or both'</a> above.)</p><p>Asthma or bronchospasm is a serious finding associated with increased risk of complications in an individual with acute pulmonary symptoms, and it warrants close observation and admission if bronchospasm does not resolve. Individuals with these conditions may have associated tachycardia, tachypnea, fever, and hypoxia. Many patients with chest pain and acute respiratory symptoms have had a bronchoactive pulmonary component despite the absence of a history of asthma or wheezing. Cough is more likely in children; adults with ACS may have severe chest pain without cough. Imaging (eg, chest radiography) is indicated if these diagnoses are considered; however, chest radiography may be negative initially in ACS. </p><p>PE may be difficult to diagnose initially and often occurs without antecedent diagnosis of DVT. Additional risk factors for PE include pregnancy, prolonged immobilization, obesity, history of splenectomy, and history of other thrombophilia. An elevated D-dimer is also consistent with PE, as discussed in more detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=venous-thrombosis-and-thromboembolism-in-children-risk-factors-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Venous thrombosis and thromboembolism in children: Risk factors, clinical manifestations, and diagnosis&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-presentation-evaluation-and-diagnosis-of-the-nonpregnant-adult-with-suspected-acute-pulmonary-embolism\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical presentation, evaluation, and diagnosis of the nonpregnant adult with suspected acute pulmonary embolism&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Cardiac chest pain is increasingly recognized in individuals with SCD, especially those with frequent vaso-occlusive pain, even in the absence of large vessel coronary artery disease. Acute myocardial ischemia may present as atypical chest pain that radiates to the arm. While any individual with SCD can develop myocardial ischemia, those with pulmonary hypertension, diastolic dysfunction, and corrected QT interval prolongation (QTc) are at increased risk. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=angina-pectoris-chest-pain-caused-by-myocardial-ischemia\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Angina pectoris: Chest pain caused by myocardial ischemia&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=electrocardiogram-in-the-diagnosis-of-myocardial-ischemia-and-infarction\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Electrocardiogram in the diagnosis of myocardial ischemia and infarction&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Bone infarction of a rib or the sternum typically presents as localized pain that can be elicited by pressing on the site of infarction. While individuals with rib infarction can develop ACS from hypoventilation and splinting, they are less likely to have a concomitant significant pulmonary parenchymal defect than those without rib tenderness. Individuals with rib infarction may have splinting hypoventilation, which predisposes to infection and ACS. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=bone-and-joint-complications-in-sickle-cell-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Bone and joint complications in sickle cell disease&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1573238478\"><span class=\"h2\">Abdominal pain</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Abdominal pain is often a component of a vaso-occlusive pain episode, but it can also be the presentation of an acute surgical abdomen, acute cholecystitis, acute hepatic sequestration, acute splenic sequestration, renal papillary necrosis, urinary tract infection, pyelonephritis, or severe opioid-induced constipation. </p><p>Hepatic or splenic sequestration are characterized by massive shifts of a large proportion of the blood volume into the liver or spleen, which can cause hemodynamic instability tachycardia and hypertension. The spleen or liver may become enlarged and tender. The hemoglobin may decrease dramatically below the patient's baseline. Hepatic sequestration may be exacerbated by underlying liver disease due to iron overload (from transfusions), hepatitis C virus infection (HCV), or other causes of liver disease. These conditions require a high index of suspicion and close monitoring, due to the massive volume shifts and organ failure. Early specialist input is advised. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-the-clinical-manifestations-of-sickle-cell-disease#H1667431315\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of the clinical manifestations of sickle cell disease&quot;, section on 'Splenic sequestration crisis'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-the-clinical-manifestations-of-sickle-cell-disease#H489526878\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of the clinical manifestations of sickle cell disease&quot;, section on 'Hepatobiliary complications'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=red-blood-cell-transfusion-in-sickle-cell-disease#H9587206\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Red blood cell transfusion in sickle cell disease&quot;, section on 'Symptomatic or severe anemia'</a>.)</p><p>Renal and urinary tract disease in children may not be associated with specific findings attributable to the site of infarction or infection (ie, flank pain may be absent). There may be suprapubic tenderness. Adults with urinary tract infection or pyelonephritis often present with dysuria or tenderness in the back, flank, or costovertebral angle. The urinalysis may show abnormalities related to infection (eg, red blood cells, white blood cells, bacteria) or infarction (eg, red blood cells). The creatinine may be increased. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=renal-manifestations-of-sickle-cell-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Renal manifestations of sickle cell disease&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Abdominal or pelvic pain in a sexually active female also raises the possibility of ectopic pregnancy, pelvic inflammatory disease, and tubo-ovarian abscess.

Findings and evaluation are similar to individuals without SCD (eg, increased white blood cell count, increased bilirubin <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> transaminases, positive right upper quadrant ultrasound or other imaging).

Gout and dactylitis tend to affect smaller joints, whereas avascular necrosis tends to affect the hips. However, avascular necrosis of the hip may present as referred pain to the pelvis, buttocks, groin, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> leg. Osteomyelitis may cause variable joint involvement and is significantly less common than bone infarction; the white blood cell count is often increased, and imaging may show periosteal elevation or a fluid collection. The diagnosis of osteomyelitis is often delayed. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=bone-and-joint-complications-in-sickle-cell-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Bone and joint complications in sickle cell disease&quot;</a>.)</p><p>DVT may present with localized tenderness without fever or warmth. Individuals with SCD have a baseline increased risk for DVT, which may be further increased in the setting of pregnancy, recent surgery, or an acute medical illness.

(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=red-blood-cell-transfusion-in-sickle-cell-disease#H9587127\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Red blood cell transfusion in sickle cell disease&quot;, section on 'Overview of indications'</a>.)</p><p>However, as noted in the sections above, blood transfusion is indicated for the treatment of several of the potentially serious complications that may present with pain. Importantly, the decision to use blood transfusion is based on the presence of the complication rather than the hemoglobin level, because transfusions work by reducing the percentage of sickle hemoglobin and sickled red blood cells, not by increasing oxygen delivery. Exchange transfusion is most effective at rapidly lowering the percentage of sickle hemoglobin without causing hyperviscosity, but simple transfusion is often more rapidly available. A discussion of the indications, techniques, and other issues related to transfusion in SCD is presented separately. Early involvement of the specialist(s) with expertise in SCD and exchange transfusion is advised when one of these complications is suspected.

Common locations for vaso-occlusive pain include the back, chest, abdomen, and long bones. (See <a href=\"#H3155560087\" class=\"local\">'Features associated with vaso-occlusive pain'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Certain features suggest the possibility that an additional complication of SCD may be present, which may be potentially life threatening. These include the patient (or family) report that the pain is atypical; abnormal vital signs; major changes from the baseline complete blood count (CBC) or reticulocyte count; and other abnormalities on examination or initial laboratory testing, as discussed above. (See <a href=\"#H2653948092\" class=\"local\">'Features that suggest an additional complication'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Regardless of the cause of pain, appropriate analgesia should not be delayed while awaiting other information such as results of laboratory testing, and triage wait time should not exceed 30 minutes. Misperceptions of health care providers can interfere with adequate assessment and treatment of pain. These issues, and our approach to analgesia in SCD, are discussed in detail separately.

In individuals with high-risk features, we obtain targeted laboratory tests <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> observe the patient in the hospital.

(See <a href=\"#H2283688223\" class=\"local\">'Chest pain'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Abdominal pain may indicate splenic or hepatic sequestration, which are potentially life threatening. Other possible causes include gallstone disease, renal infarct, urinary tract infection or pyelonephritis, and ectopic pregnancy or pelvic inflammatory disease.
