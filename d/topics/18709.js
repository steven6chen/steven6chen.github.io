However, vitamin D deficiency is still a common problem in many populations, particularly older adults.</p><p>This topic reviews the major causes of vitamin D deficiency, including how it is diagnosed and treated, and safe ways to prevent vitamin D deficiency.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">WHAT IS VITAMIN D?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Vitamin D is an oil-soluble vitamin that has several important functions in the body:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>It helps to absorb dietary calcium and phosphorus from the intestines.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>It suppresses the release of parathyroid hormone, a hormone that causes bone resorption.</p><p/><p>Through these actions, vitamin D keeps the calcium and phosphate levels in the blood normal, thereby promoting bone health. Vitamin D may have other benefits, such as improving muscle and immune function, but these areas require more research.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Natural sources of vitamin D</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Vitamin D is made in the skin under the influence of sunlight. The amount of sunlight needed to synthesize adequate amounts of vitamin D varies, depending upon the person's age, skin color, sun exposure, and underlying medical problems. The production of vitamin D from the skin decreases with age. In addition, people who have darker skin need more sun exposure to produce adequate amounts of vitamin D, especially during the winter months.</p><p>Another important source of vitamin D is foods, where it may occur naturally (in fatty fish, cod liver oil, and [to a lesser extent] eggs). In the United States, commercially fortified cow's milk is the largest source of dietary vitamin D, containing approximately 100 international units of vitamin D per 8 ounces. Vitamin D intake can be estimated by multiplying the number of cups of milk consumed per day by 100 (two cups milk = 200 international units vitamin D). In other parts of the world, cereals and bread products are often fortified with vitamin D.</p><p>Although vitamin D is found in cod liver oil, some fish oils also contain high doses of vitamin A. Excessive vitamin A intake can be associated with side effects, including liver damage and fractures.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h1\">CAUSES OF VITAMIN D DEFICIENCY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The main reasons for low levels of vitamin D are:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Lack of vitamin D in the diet, often in conjunction with inadequate sun exposure</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Inability to absorb vitamin D from the intestines</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Inability to process vitamin D due to kidney or liver disease</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Inadequate intake</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Infants, children, and older adults are at risk for low vitamin D levels because of inadequate vitamin D intake. Human breast milk contains low levels of vitamin D, and most infant formulas do not contain adequate vitamin D. Older adults often do not consume enough vitamin D rich foods, and even when they do, absorption may be limited.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Inadequate sun exposure</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Parents of infants and children are often advised to keep their child out of the sun, which reduces vitamin D synthesis from the skin. Exposure to the sun is not recommended as a source of vitamin D for infants and children, due to the potential long-term risks of skin cancer. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sunburn-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">&quot;Patient education: Sunburn (Beyond the Basics)&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Adults who have limited sun exposure are also at increased risk of vitamin D deficiency, especially if their skin is dark. In addition, reduced amounts of vitamin D are made in the skin and stored in the body as we age. This is especially true in the winter months in some northern areas, such as Boston, Massachusetts and Edmonton, Alberta, where the skin virtually ceases to produce vitamin D between October and April. In the summer months, the use of sunscreen limits vitamin D synthesis.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Diseases or surgery that affect fat absorption</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Certain diseases affect the body's ability to absorb adequate amounts of vitamin D through the intestinal tract. Examples of these include celiac disease, Crohn's disease, and cystic fibrosis.</p><p>Surgery that removes or bypasses portions of the stomach or intestines can also lead to low vitamin D levels. An example of this type of surgery is gastric bypass. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=weight-loss-surgery-and-procedures-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">&quot;Patient education: Weight loss surgery and procedures (Beyond the Basics)&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Kidney and liver disease</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The liver and kidney have important enzymes that change vitamin D from sun-exposed skin or food to the biologically active form of vitamin D. People with chronic kidney and liver disease are at increased risk of low active vitamin D levels because they have decreased levels of these enzymes.</p><p>Less common causes of vitamin D deficiency include familial or acquired diseases that impair the enzymes in the liver or kidney that create the biologically active form of the vitamin. This results in inadequate amounts of active vitamin D.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h1\">POTENTIAL COMPLICATIONS OF VITAMIN D DEFICIENCY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The most serious complications of vitamin D deficiency are low blood calcium (hypocalcemia), low blood phosphate (hypophosphatemia), rickets (softening of the bones during childhood), and osteomalacia (softening of the bones in adults). However, these complications have become less common over time because many foods and drinks have added vitamin D.</p><p>&quot;Subclinical&quot; vitamin D deficiency or vitamin D insufficiency is common and is defined as a lower than normal vitamin D level that has no visible signs or symptoms. However, vitamin D insufficiency is often associated with reduced gastrointestinal calcium absorption, decreased bone density (osteopenia or osteoporosis), and, in some cases, a mild decrease of the blood calcium level, elevated parathyroid hormone (which accelerates bone resorption), an increased risk of falls, and possibly fractures, all of which can seriously affect a person's quality of life.</p><p>Thus, identifying and treating vitamin D insufficiency or deficiency is important to maintain bone strength. Treatment may even improve the health of other body systems, such as the immune, muscular, and cardiovascular systems, although more research is needed in these areas.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h1\">DIAGNOSIS OF VITAMIN D DEFICIENCY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A low vitamin D level can be diagnosed with a blood test called 25-hydroxyvitamin D or 25(OH)D (OH = hydroxy, D = vitamin D). Although there is no formal definition of vitamin D deficiency, some groups use the following values in adults:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A normal level of vitamin D is defined as a 25(OH)D concentration greater than 30 <span class=\"nowrap\">ng/mL</span> (75 <span class=\"nowrap\">nmol/L)</span></p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Vitamin D insufficiency is defined as a 25(OH)D concentration of 20 to 30 <span class=\"nowrap\">ng/mL</span> (50 to 75 <span class=\"nowrap\">nmol/L)</span></p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Vitamin D deficiency is defined as a 25(OH)D level less than 20 <span class=\"nowrap\">ng/mL</span> (50 <span class=\"nowrap\">nmol/L)</span></p><p/><p>Although there are differences of opinion regarding the 25(OH)D levels that define vitamin D insufficiency and deficiency, most experts agree that levels lower than 20 <span class=\"nowrap\">ng/mL</span> (50 <span class=\"nowrap\">nmol/L)</span> are suboptimal for skeletal health.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h2\">Who needs testing for vitamin D?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Testing for vitamin D deficiency or insufficiency is not recommended for everyone but may be advised for people who are home bound or in a long-term care facility (eg, nursing home); if the person has a medical condition that increases the risk of vitamin D deficiency or insufficiency; and for anyone with osteoporosis or a past history of a low-trauma fracture (eg, fracture after fall from standing), low blood calcium (hypocalcemia), or phosphate (hypophosphatemia). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=bone-density-testing-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">&quot;Patient education: Bone density testing (Beyond the Basics)&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=osteoporosis-prevention-and-treatment-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">&quot;Patient education: Osteoporosis prevention and treatment (Beyond the Basics)&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h1\">TREATMENT OF VITAMIN D DEFICIENCY</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h2\">Vitamin D supplements</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There are many types of vitamin D preparations available for the treatment of vitamin D deficiency or insufficiency. The two commonly available forms of vitamin D supplements are ergocalciferol (vitamin D2) and cholecalciferol (vitamin D3). We suggest vitamin D3 when possible, rather than vitamin D2, because vitamin D3 is the naturally occurring form of the vitamin and it may raise vitamin D levels more effectively.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14\"><span class=\"h3\">Dosing</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The recommended dose of vitamin D depends upon the nature and severity of the vitamin D deficiency.</p><p>In people who do not have problems absorbing vitamin D:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In people whose 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25[OH]D) is &lt;10 <span class=\"nowrap\">ng/mL</span> (25 <span class=\"nowrap\">nmol/L),</span> treatment usually includes 50,000 international units of vitamin D2 or D3 by mouth once or more per week for six to eight weeks, and then 800 to 1000 (or more) international units of vitamin D3 daily thereafter.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In people whose 25(OH)D is 10 to 20 <span class=\"nowrap\">ng/mL</span> (25 to 50 <span class=\"nowrap\">nmol/L),</span> treatment usually includes 800 to 1000 international units of vitamin D3 by mouth daily, usually for a three-month period. However, many individuals will need higher doses. The &quot;ideal&quot; dose of vitamin D is determined by testing the individual's 25(OH)D level and increasing the vitamin D dose if the level is not within normal limits. Once a normal level is achieved, continued therapy with 800 international units of vitamin D per day is usually recommended.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In people whose 25(OH)D is 20 to 30 <span class=\"nowrap\">ng/mL</span> (50 to 75 <span class=\"nowrap\">nmol/L),</span> treatment with 600 to 800 international units of vitamin D3 by mouth daily may be sufficient to maintain levels in the target range.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In infants and children whose 25(OH)D is &lt;20 <span class=\"nowrap\">ng/mL</span> (50 <span class=\"nowrap\">nmol/L),</span> treatment usually includes 1000 to 5000 international units of vitamin D2 by mouth per day (depending on the age of the child) for two to three months.</p><p/><p>In people who have diseases or conditions that prevent them from absorbing vitamin D normally (eg, kidney or liver disease), the recommended dose of vitamin D will be determined on an individual basis.</p><p>In people whose vitamin D level is normal (&gt;30 <span class=\"nowrap\">ng/mL</span> [&ge;75 <span class=\"nowrap\">nmol/L]),</span> a dose of 800 international units of vitamin D per day is usually recommended. (See <a href=\"#H18\" class=\"local\">'Prevention of vitamin D deficiency'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15\"><span class=\"h2\">Do I need other vitamins or minerals?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>During treatment for vitamin D deficiency, it is important to consume at least 1000 mg of calcium per day for premenopausal women and men and 1200 mg per day for postmenopausal women.</p><p>Calcium can be found in food sources (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F67824\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef67824 \">table 1</a>) or dietary supplements (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F70454\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef70454 \">table 2</a>). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=calcium-and-vitamin-d-for-bone-health-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">&quot;Patient education: Calcium and vitamin D for bone health (Beyond the Basics)&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H16\"><span class=\"h2\">Monitoring</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A blood test is recommended to monitor blood levels of 25(OH)D three months after beginning treatment. The dose of vitamin D may need to be adjusted based on these results and subsequent blood levels of 25(OH)D obtained to assure that normal levels result from the adjusted dose.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H17\"><span class=\"h2\">Side effects</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Side effects of vitamin D are uncommon unless the 25(OH)D level becomes very elevated (&gt;100 <span class=\"nowrap\">ng/mL</span> or 250 <span class=\"nowrap\">mmol/L)</span> and the person is taking high dose calcium supplements. However, it is important to follow dosing instructions closely and to avoid taking multiple products that contain vitamin D (eg, multivitamin and vitamin D).</p><p>If 25(OH)D levels do become very elevated, complications such as high blood calcium levels or kidney stones can develop.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H18\"><span class=\"h1\">PREVENTION OF VITAMIN D DEFICIENCY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>As mentioned previously, the amount of vitamin D you need per day to maintain a normal level of 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25[OH]D) depends upon your skin color, sun exposure, diet, and underlying medical conditions.</p><p>In general, adults are advised to take a supplement containing 800 international units of vitamin D per day to maintain a normal vitamin D level. Older people who are confined indoors may have vitamin D deficiency even at this intake level. (See <a href=\"#H13\" class=\"local\">'Vitamin D supplements'</a> above.)</p><p>All infants and children are advised to take a vitamin D supplement containing 400 international units of vitamin D, starting within days of birth. For infants and children, vitamin D is included in most nonprescription infant multivitamin drops. In some countries, it is possible to buy infant drops that contain only vitamin D.
