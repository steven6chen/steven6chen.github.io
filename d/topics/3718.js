It frequently coexists with medical, psychiatric, sleep, or neurological disorders. It may also be associated with acute stress, medication or substance, poor sleep habits, or changes in the sleep environment. A separate diagnosis of insomnia should be given when the insomnia symptoms show independent onset or variation in relation to a psychiatric or medical condition such as depression or chronic pain, or when the insomnia symptoms persist after adequate treatment of the comorbid condition. However, insomnia can also exist without an associated psychiatric or medical disorder [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-insomnia-in-adults/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. The diagnosis of insomnia requires three main components: persistent sleep difficulty, adequate sleep opportunity, and associated daytime dysfunction.</p><p>The clinical features, diagnosis, and differential diagnosis of insomnia are reviewed here. The epidemiology, consequences, and treatment of insomnia are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-insomnia-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of insomnia in adults&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-insomnia-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of insomnia in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2311471\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL FEATURES</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2311479\"><span class=\"h2\">Symptoms</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients with insomnia complain of difficulty initiating sleep, difficulty maintaining sleep, or waking up too early. Although insomnia can be a presenting complaint, it may also be reported during the evaluation of another complaint or during health maintenance screening.</p><p>The complaint of insomnia occurs despite adequate opportunity and circumstances for sleep. The degree of the sleep disturbance reported varies, but typically occurs at least three times per week and is not related to an inadequate opportunity for sleep (ie, not related to sleep restriction), an inappropriate sleep environment, or another sleep disorder. Patients may also describe variable sleep, such as one or several nights of poor sleep followed by a night of better sleep. Occasionally, patients may report having minimal sleep for several consecutive nights.</p><p>These complaints are accompanied by a report of compromised daytime function [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-insomnia-in-adults/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Fatigue or malaise</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Poor attention or concentration</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Social or <span class=\"nowrap\">vocational/educational</span> dysfunction</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Mood disturbance or irritability</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Daytime sleepiness</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Reduced motivation or energy</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Increased errors or accidents</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Behavioral problems such as hyperactivity, impulsivity or aggression</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Ongoing worry about sleep</p><p/><p>Patients with chronic insomnia are likely to have developed behavioral or adjustment issues associated with chronic poor sleep. They are often worried that their lack of adequate sleep will result in significant compromise of their ability to function during the day in both social and professional settings. This concern can create a cycle that worsens the insomnia. Specifically, when patients are unable to fall asleep rapidly, they become increasingly concerned about their performance the following day. This makes it more unlikely that the patient will be able to fall asleep and sleep well. Many patients with insomnia underestimate their sleep time.</p><p>Patients with short-term insomnia (ie, symptoms for less than three months but with significant concern about sleep) can often identify a stressor that is temporally related to the sleep disturbance. Stressors can be physical, psychological, psychosocial, or interpersonal (job loss, death of a loved one, divorce, argument). Insomnia may be episodic in relation to periodic stressors.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Comorbidities</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Insomnia commonly coexists with psychiatric or medical disorders, other sleep disorders, or use of certain medications or substances. At times there is a clear temporal relationship between the insomnia and the condition that is known to disrupt sleep, and a separate diagnosis of insomnia is not given unless the insomnia is notable by severity or focus. In other instances, the sleep disturbance is related to the condition or substance but has an independent course by appearing first or continuing after adequate treatment of the comorbid disorder (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F50646\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef50646 \">table 1</a>).</p><p>Historically, a distinction has been made between primary insomnia (ie, insomnia without comorbidities or existing independently from other disorders) and secondary insomnia (ie, associated with a comorbid condition such as depression) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-insomnia-in-adults/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. However, it is often not possible to draw firm conclusions about the association or direction of causality between insomnia and co-occurring conditions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-insomnia-in-adults/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H513644283\"><span class=\"h3\">Psychiatric disorders</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Chronic insomnia and psychiatric disorders frequently coexist (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F50646\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef50646 \">table 1</a>). In one study, nearly 45 percent of patients with chronic insomnia also had a psychiatric condition, such as depression or anxiety [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-insomnia-in-adults/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. </p><p>It can be challenging to identify psychiatric comorbidities because patients frequently deny or minimize the role of the psychiatric disorder. As an example, a patient might say, &quot;I would not be depressed if I could get a good night of sleep.&quot; On the other hand, clinicians have historically assumed that the insomnia is secondary to the psychiatric disorder and have treated the psychiatric condition with the expectation that the insomnia will improve as the psychiatric condition improves. However, the insomnia frequently does not improve, suggesting that the insomnia is a comorbidity and not a consequence of the psychiatric disorder [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-insomnia-in-adults/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].</p><p>Insomnia frequently precedes and may predict the development of a number of psychiatric illnesses [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-insomnia-in-adults/abstract/5-7\" class=\"abstract_t\">5-7</a>]. In one study, individuals with insomnia were 34 times more likely to develop a new psychiatric disorder (particularly major depression) within one year, compared to individuals without insomnia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-insomnia-in-adults/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. </p><p>Psychiatric disorders most commonly associated with insomnia include the following:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Depression</strong> &ndash; The diagnosis of depression requires patients to have a depressed mood plus at least four out of eight other symptoms. Insomnia is one of the eight symptoms. Two of the remaining seven symptoms are also diagnostic criteria for insomnia: daytime fatigue and difficulty thinking or concentrating during the day. This overlap of symptoms makes it likely that insomnia and depression will frequently coexist. In one study, insomnia was a symptom in approximately 80 percent of patients with depression [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-insomnia-in-adults/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. Patients frequently report the onset of insomnia prior to the development of depression [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-insomnia-in-adults/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=unipolar-depression-in-adults-assessment-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Unipolar depression in adults: Assessment and diagnosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Early morning awakening is a hallmark symptom of depression, but adolescents and young adults with depression may report difficulty initiating sleep instead. Depressed patients may also complain that they have not slept at all for one or more nights, although sleep recordings of these nights show reduced (not absent) sleep. Depressed patients tend to have a reduced latency to REM sleep with increased REM sleep in the first one-third of the night, although these findings are not necessarily seen in every patient. Resolution of insomnia predicts a favorable response to the treatment of depression. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=stages-and-architecture-of-normal-sleep\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Stages and architecture of normal sleep&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Insomnia may not resolve completely even if underlying depression is identified and treated. As a result, directed treatment of insomnia may be required. The evidence indicates that concurrent treatment of both depression and insomnia with a separate medication for each problem results in an increased likelihood of an effective treatment response for insomnia and more rapid control of depression at lower doses of the antidepressant medication [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-insomnia-in-adults/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Anxiety</strong> &ndash; The diagnosis of generalized anxiety disorder requires patients to have anxiety plus at least three out of six other symptoms. Insomnia is one of the six symptoms. Four of the remaining five symptoms are also diagnostic criteria for insomnia &mdash; fatigue, restlessness, difficulty concentrating, and irritability. This overlap of symptoms makes it likely that insomnia and anxiety will frequently coexist. In one study, insomnia was a symptom in approximately 80 percent of patients with anxiety [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-insomnia-in-adults/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Insomnia can develop before, at the same time, or after the onset of anxiety [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-insomnia-in-adults/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. Among patients with insomnia alone, insomnia predicts the development of generalized anxiety disorder [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-insomnia-in-adults/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. Insomnia is also commonly seen in patients who have panic disorder. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=generalized-anxiety-disorder-in-adults-epidemiology-pathogenesis-clinical-manifestations-course-assessment-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Generalized anxiety disorder in adults: Epidemiology, pathogenesis, clinical manifestations, course, assessment, and diagnosis&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pharmacotherapy-for-panic-disorder-with-or-without-agoraphobia-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pharmacotherapy for panic disorder with or without agoraphobia in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Substance abuse</strong> &ndash; Insomnia is very common among patients with substance use disorders across a variety of substances and stages of illness. It predates alcohol dependency in the majority of patients with alcohol use disorder and is an important risk factor for relapse to drinking among those who have achieved abstinence [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-insomnia-in-adults/abstract/10-12\" class=\"abstract_t\">10-12</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=insomnia-in-patients-with-a-substance-use-disorder\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Insomnia in patients with a substance use disorder&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Posttraumatic stress disorder</strong> &ndash; Patients with posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) frequently have insomnia. Specifically, one review estimated that 70 to 90 percent of patients with PTSD have difficulty falling or staying asleep [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-insomnia-in-adults/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. This is frequently associated with nightmares and fear of falling asleep or returning to sleep [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-insomnia-in-adults/abstract/13,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,14</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=posttraumatic-stress-disorder-in-adults-epidemiology-pathophysiology-clinical-manifestations-course-assessment-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Posttraumatic stress disorder in adults: Epidemiology, pathophysiology, clinical manifestations, course, assessment, and diagnosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H587850433\"><span class=\"h3\">Medical conditions</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Insomnia that follows a chronic course can be comorbid with a medical illness or related to the medications required to treat the medical illness (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F50646\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef50646 \">table 1</a>). Approximately 10 percent of patients with insomnia lasting greater than one month have a coexisting medical condition or take medication [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-insomnia-in-adults/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Conversely, approximately 40 percent of patients with a medical problem have insomnia that follows a chronic course, compared to 8 percent in a control population [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-insomnia-in-adults/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>].</p><p>Medical conditions that are often associated with chronic insomnia include pulmonary disease, hypertension, diabetes, cancer, chronic pain, and heart failure.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Pulmonary disease</strong> &ndash; More than 50 percent of patients with pulmonary disease report insomnia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-insomnia-in-adults/abstract/15,16\" class=\"abstract_t\">15,16</a>]. The high prevalence of insomnia in this patient population may be related to events that occur when the patient lies down and tries to fall asleep: work of breathing increases, secretions pool in the airways, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> nocturnal bronchoconstriction may occur [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-insomnia-in-adults/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. Insomnia may also be related to respiratory stimulant medication taken during the night.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Hypertension &ndash; </strong>Hypertension and insomnia frequently co-occur [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-insomnia-in-adults/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. In addition, patients with primary insomnia have been shown to have increased systolic and diastolic blood pressure during sleep (lack of nocturnal dip) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-insomnia-in-adults/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. Insomnia with decreased total sleep time has also been associated with an increased risk of hypertension [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-insomnia-in-adults/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Diabetes</strong> &ndash; Insomnia has been reported in up to half of patients with diabetes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-insomnia-in-adults/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. This could be due in part to discomfort associated with diabetic neuropathy. In at least one large study, insomnia with reduced objective total sleep time has been identified as an independent risk factor for diabetes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-insomnia-in-adults/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Cancer</strong> &ndash; Between 25 and 60 percent of patients with cancer report insomnia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-insomnia-in-adults/abstract/15,21\" class=\"abstract_t\">15,21</a>]. Symptoms typically relate to side effects of treatment, stress, hospitalization, and pain. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-insomnia-in-palliative-care\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of insomnia in palliative care&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Chronic pain</strong> &ndash; Predictors of insomnia in patients with chronic musculoskeletal pain include the presence of widespread pain, physical limitations, and reduced social participation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-insomnia-in-adults/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. A dose-response relationship has been observed between the extent of pain at baseline and the onset of insomnia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-insomnia-in-adults/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. Even short-term treatment for insomnia can be associated with long-term improvement in sleep, chronic pain, and fatigue [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-insomnia-in-adults/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Heart failure</strong> &ndash; Approximately 30 percent of patients with heart failure may have insomnia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-insomnia-in-adults/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. The insomnia may be related to Cheyne-Stokes breathing or frequent awakenings due to nocturia caused by use of a diuretic. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sleep-disordered-breathing-in-heart-failure\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Sleep-disordered breathing in heart failure&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p>Insomnia is also common in patients with neurologic disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-insomnia-in-adults/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. Among patients with Parkinson disease, approximately 30 percent have insomnia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-insomnia-in-adults/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. As Parkinson disease worsens, sleep deteriorates and a coexisting REM sleep behavior disorder may develop [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-insomnia-in-adults/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-of-parkinson-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations of Parkinson disease&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Among patients with Alzheimer disease, approximately 25 percent have insomnia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-insomnia-in-adults/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. The insomnia may be related to nocturnal agitation, delirium, and wandering, all of which may be related to increased stage 1 sleep and awakenings.

Some of the sleep disorders associated with insomnia include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Sleep apnea </strong>&ndash; Patients with sleep apnea have pauses in respiration during sleep that are frequently associated with brief arousals when they resume respiration.

It is commonly accompanied by painful, creeping, crawling, itching, or jittery sensations in the legs. The urge to move the legs and the associated discomfort are relieved by moving the legs, but the relief only lasts for as long as movement continues. The symptoms of <span class=\"nowrap\">RLS/WED</span> are most common when patients lie down to attempt to fall asleep [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-insomnia-in-adults/abstract/32-35\" class=\"abstract_t\">32-35</a>]. As a result, an estimated 85 percent of patients with <span class=\"nowrap\">RLS/WED</span> have difficulty falling asleep [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-insomnia-in-adults/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>].

Occasionally, PLMS involve the upper limbs. The periodic limb movements may be accompanied by partial arousals, causing sleep fragmentation and difficulty maintaining sleep, although there is controversy among clinicians about whether PLMS alone contribute to insomnia in the absence of <span class=\"nowrap\">RLS/WED</span>.

However, less common circadian rhythm sleep disorders can also cause chronic insomnia. This includes patients who have minimal social or environmental time cues (eg, blind or bedridden patients), who work the night shift (shift work sleep disorder), or whose sleep-wake rhythm favors sleep later (delayed sleep phase syndrome) or earlier (advanced sleep phase syndrome) than the desired clock time.

As examples, excessive oropharyngeal tissue may be seen in obstructive sleep apnea, lower extremity swelling in heart failure, extremity deformity in rheumatologic disease, and an abnormal mental status in dementia. In many cases, the physical examination will be normal even if the patient has a medical or psychiatric condition that is associated with insomnia (eg, asthma, ischemic heart disease, gastroesophageal reflux, and menopause).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h1\">DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Insomnia is a clinical diagnosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-insomnia-in-adults/abstract/37,38\" class=\"abstract_t\">37,38</a>]; therefore, a sleep history is the only diagnostic evaluation that is required to confirm or exclude insomnia.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H513642722\"><span class=\"h2\">Sleep history and sleep log</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The sleep history should elicit a detailed description of the sleep problem (ie, number of awakenings, duration of awakenings, duration of the problem) and sleep times (ie, bedtime, duration until sleep onset, final awakening time, nap times, and nap lengths) over both a 24-hour period and week. It also includes an assessment of any symptoms of disturbed sleep (eg, daytime sleepiness, fatigue), the duration of the symptoms (ie, acute or chronic), and the sleep environment.</p><p>Patients who cannot provide an adequate sleep history or who report considerable day-to-day or night-to-night variability are usually asked to complete a daily sleep log for one or two weeks (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SLEEP%2F87134\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef87134 \">table 2</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F87859\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef87859 \">table 3</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-insomnia-in-adults/abstract/39-42\" class=\"abstract_t\">39-42</a>]. Sleep logs record sleep times, sleep problems, and subjective sleep quality, so that the clinician may review the information for diagnosis and to evaluate treatment efficacy without being misled by recall errors.</p><p>The sleep history may provide clues about the cause of the insomnia or factors contributing to the insomnia. Patients with poor sleep hygiene may describe irregular bedtimes and waking times, while patients whose lifestyle is contributing to their insomnia may report exercising, smoking, or drinking alcohol or caffeine shortly before bedtime. When the bedroom environment is responsible for the insomnia, patients may describe recent changes in light, noise, or other distractions in the bedroom. Patients whose insomnia is due to a primary sleep disorder may report symptoms or signs of the sleep disorder (eg, loud resuscitative snoring in obstructive sleep apnea). </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H513642861\"><span class=\"h2\">Identification of relevant comorbidities</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Although not required to confirm or exclude a diagnosis of insomnia, all patients should undergo additional evaluation to determine whether the insomnia is associated with another condition, medication, or substance, since these may also need to be a focus of treatment for the sleep complaint. The evaluation typically begins with a medical history and physical examination. Patients are asked about the symptoms and signs of medical conditions (eg, wheezing, dyspnea, peripheral edema, pain), psychiatric conditions (eg, depressed mood, anxiety, and suicidal ideation), sleep disorders (eg, snoring, restless leg syndrome), neurological diseases (eg, memory loss), insomnia risk factors (eg, hypertension, diabetes), medications (eg, stimulants), and substances (eg, alcohol, caffeine, illicit drugs) that are frequently associated with insomnia. (See <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'Comorbidities'</a> above.)</p><p>The physical examination should be broad, looking for evidence of any condition associated with insomnia (eg, wheezing in asthma, excessive oropharyngeal tissue in obstructive sleep apnea, and lower extremity swelling in heart failure).

In children or individuals with dementia, the sleep disturbance may manifest as resistance to going to bed at the appropriate time or difficulty in sleeping without caregiver assistance.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Sleep difficulties occur despite adequate opportunity and circumstances for sleep.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The patient describes daytime impairment that is attributable to the sleep difficulties. This may include fatigue or malaise; attention, concentration, or memory impairment; social dysfunction, vocational dysfunction, or poor school performance; mood disturbance or irritability; daytime sleepiness; motivation, energy, or initiative reduction; errors or accidents at work or while driving; and concerns or worries about sleep.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The sleep-wake difficulty is not better explained by another sleep disorder.</p><p/><p>Chronic insomnia is differentiated from short-term insomnia if the sleep disturbance and the associated daytime dysfunction has existed for three months or longer and occurs at least three nights per week. Chronic insomnia may also be diagnosed in individuals who report a pattern of repeated occurrence for weeks at a time over several years, even though an individual episode may not last a full three months. Other insomnia is used for patients who complain of difficulty initiating or maintaining sleep but do not meet all of the criteria for either short-term or chronic insomnia. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-insomnia-in-adults#H3\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of insomnia in adults&quot;, section on 'Types of insomnia'</a>.)</p><p>The degree of sleep disturbance required to assign an insomnia disorder diagnosis is not specified in these criteria and is somewhat arbitrary, in that it relies primarily on individuals&rsquo; subjective sleep complaints [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-insomnia-in-adults/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. In addition, the degree of sleep disturbance required to cause daytime impairment varies among individuals and across age groups. In general, the degree of sleep disturbance should include either a sleep latency of 20 minutes or more in children and young adults or 30 minutes or more in older adults; or wake periods of 20 minutes or more in children or young adults or 30 minutes or more in older adults. Complaints of early morning awakening are substantiated by termination of sleep at least 30 minutes prior to the desired time. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2311852\"><span class=\"h1\">DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Insomnia is often confused with short duration sleep, circadian rhythm disorders, chronic sleep restriction (insufficient sleep syndrome), and sleep-disruptive environmental circumstances.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Short duration sleep &ndash; Sleep for a short duration can be normal, as some individuals simply require less sleep and can sleep fewer hours without daytime complaints. Short duration sleep is distinguished from insomnia by the absence of daytime impairment.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Circadian rhythm disorders:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Delayed sleep-wake phase disorder &ndash; Difficulty initiating sleep needs to be differentiated from delayed sleep-wake phase disorder. Patients with sleep onset insomnia may have trouble whenever attempting to fall asleep, while individuals with delayed sleep-wake phase disorder fall asleep and sleep normally if they go to bed at the correct point in their circadian rhythm.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Advanced sleep-wake phase disorder &ndash; Patients with sleep maintenance insomnia or early morning awakening associated with insomnia need to be differentiated from patients with advanced sleep-wake phase disorder. Patients with sleep maintenance insomnia will have sleep difficulty whenever they attempt to sleep while patients with advanced sleep-wake phase disorder will sleep normally if they go to bed and get up at an earlier clock time.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Chronic sleep restriction &ndash; Chronic sleep restriction and insomnia are both characterized by a short duration of sleep and impaired daytime function; however, chronic sleep restriction is due to volitional partial sleep loss or insufficient opportunity to sleep. Sleep restricted individuals will rapidly fall asleep if given the opportunity, and this distinguishes them from patients with insomnia, who typically feel fatigued during the day, but are unable to fall asleep if given a chance to take a nap.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Sleep-disruptive environmental circumstances &ndash; Environmental factors such as noise, light, or temperature can disturb sleep.

Clinicians should have a high index of suspicion for comorbid sleep disordered breathing in patients with chronic, treatment-refractory insomnia. In these patients, the prevalence of sleep apnea may be as high as 90 percent, and screening instruments such as the Berlin questionnaire may lack sensitivity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-insomnia-in-adults/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>].

In addition, they also complain of compromised daytime function (eg, daytime sleepiness). (See <a href=\"#H2311479\" class=\"local\">'Symptoms'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Insomnia commonly coexists with psychiatric or medical disorders, other sleep disorders, or use of certain medications or substances. (See <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'Comorbidities'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Insomnia is a clinical diagnosis. Therefore, a sleep history is the only diagnostic evaluation that is required to confirm or exclude insomnia. Insomnia is confirmed when all three of the following criteria are met: the patient reports difficulty initiating asleep, difficulty maintaining asleep, or waking up too early; these sleep difficulties occur despite adequate opportunity and circumstances for sleep; and, the patient describes daytime impairment that is attributable to the sleep difficulties. (See <a href=\"#H12\" class=\"local\">'Diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A medical history and physical examination should also be performed to determine whether the insomnia is associated with another condition, medication, or substance, since these may also need to be a focus of treatment for the sleep complaint. Additional testing is guided by the history and physical examination but is not required in most patients. (See <a href=\"#H513642861\" class=\"local\">'Identification of relevant comorbidities'</a> above and <a href=\"#H513643475\" class=\"local\">'Additional testing'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Insomnia is often confused with a short sleep requirement, circadian rhythm disorders or chronic sleep restriction. A short sleep requirement can be distinguished from insomnia because patients with short duration sleep do not have daytime impairment, whereas patients with insomnia do. Patients with advanced or delayed sleep-wake phases fall asleep and sleep normally if they go to bed and get up at times consistent with their circadian rhythm, while patients with chronic insomnia may have sleep difficulty whenever they attempt to sleep. Chronic sleep restriction can be distinguished from insomnia because patients with sleep restriction rapidly fall asleep if given the opportunity, whereas patients with insomnia do not.
