One study surveyed a unique population of 1885 survivors of anaphylaxis in the community and asked about administration of epinephrine [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/long-term-management-of-patients-with-anaphylaxis/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. Users of epinephrine autoinjectors were defined as those who self-injected epinephrine or injected it into a person for whom they were responsible (eg, a child) during anaphylaxis. Users reported problems in deciding whether to use the epinephrine autoinjector, whether to go to the emergency department after using it, holding it in place, choosing the correct site on the thigh for the injection, deciding whether to repeat the dose, and disposing of the autoinjector(s) after use. Nonusers were defined as those who did not self-inject epinephrine or failed to inject it into a person for whom they were responsible (eg, a child) during anaphylaxis. Nonusers reported a variety of reasons for not injecting epinephrine, such as using an H1 antihistamine or an asthma inhaler instead, never receiving a prescription for an epinephrine autoinjector, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> not having the epinephrine autoinjector available when the medical emergency occurred [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/long-term-management-of-patients-with-anaphylaxis/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>].</p><p>In another study of children who had experienced anaphylactic episodes, caregivers' reasons for not using an <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epinephrine-adrenaline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">epinephrine</a> autoinjector included the belief that it was unnecessary (54.4 percent), uncertainty about its necessity (19.1 percent), having called an ambulance (7.8 percent), not having the device available (5.4 percent), fear of using it (2.5 percent), lack of training (2.5 percent), decision to go to the emergency department (1.5 percent), and expired device (1 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/long-term-management-of-patients-with-anaphylaxis/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. Thus, educational efforts should focus on reviewing the following with patients and caregivers: the circumstances under which the autoinjector should be used, the importance of using it even if they have already called an ambulance or are headed to the emergency room, using it even if it is out of date, and having the device available at all times.

Factors amplifying exercise-induced anaphylaxis might include airborne pollen or mold allergens, high humidity, extreme heat, or extreme cold. Based on a detailed history of the patient's previous episodes, avoidance of one or more of these factors might be relevant.
