Although some clinicians consider nasal obstruction to imply a blockage within the nasal cavity, nasal obstruction is most commonly defined as a patient symptom manifested as a sensation of insufficient airflow through the nose [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-diagnosis-and-treatment-of-nasal-obstruction/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Nasal obstruction may be the cardinal presenting symptom of many common disease processes, such as rhinitis, sinusitis, septal deviation, adenoid hypertrophy, and nasal trauma.</p><p>This topic will focus on the clinical manifestations, evaluation, and treatment of nasal obstruction in adults. The structural causes of nasal symptoms and other specific diseases associated with nasal obstruction are discussed separately.

Several common risk factors for nasal obstruction include a history of atopy, recurrent sinusitis, nasal trauma, nasal surgery, having household pets, exposure to poor air quality, and a family history of nasal polyposis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-diagnosis-and-treatment-of-nasal-obstruction/abstract/2-4\" class=\"abstract_t\">2-4</a>]. Nasal obstruction commonly accompanies many other comorbid conditions including asthma and obstructive sleep apnea [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-diagnosis-and-treatment-of-nasal-obstruction/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H16905674\"><span class=\"h1\">PATHOGENESIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The pathogenesis of nasal obstruction may be related to abnormalities occurring with any of the anatomic structures and functions within the nose. Normal nasal anatomy and function are discussed elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=etiologies-of-nasal-symptoms-an-overview#H2\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Etiologies of nasal symptoms: An overview&quot;, section on 'Nasal anatomy and function'</a>.)</p><p>Nasal obstruction may be generally divided into mucosal and structural causes (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F79359\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef79359 \">table 1</a>). The nasal mucosa is a complex tissue that is subject to local and systemic insults, leading to nasal obstruction. Examples of mucosal causes of nasal obstruction include bacterial sinusitis, nasal polyps, and soft tissue turbinate hypertrophy due to allergic rhinitis. There is also a normal, cyclical pattern of turbinate mucosal swelling, which alternates between sides of the nasal septum at intervals of two to five hours, referred to as the nasal cycle [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-diagnosis-and-treatment-of-nasal-obstruction/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. Disruption of the nasal cycle can contribute to nasal obstruction.</p><p>Airflow through the nose is limited structurally by the width of the nasal cavity. The nasal cavity includes the anterior nasal cartilaginous structures as well as the borders of the bony piriform aperture (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F56105\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef56105 \">figure 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F67813\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef67813 \">figure 2</a>). The nasal valve is the narrowest portion of the human airway (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F52471\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef52471 \">figure 3</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-diagnosis-and-treatment-of-nasal-obstruction/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. Collapse of any of the structures making up the nasal cavity can lead to nasal obstruction. Examples of other structural causes include nasal septal deviation (cartilaginous or bony), bony inferior turbinate hypertrophy, concha bullosa formation (air in the middle turbinate), benign and malignant tumors, and choanal atresia or stenosis.</p><p>The underlying pathogenesis of nasal obstruction may be multifactorial. As an example, it is common to have compensatory mucosal hypertrophy of the inferior turbinate on the side opposite a deviated nasal septum [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-diagnosis-and-treatment-of-nasal-obstruction/abstract/8,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,9</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H16905681\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL MANIFESTATIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The most common clinical manifestations of obstruction within the nasal cavity are the patient's complaint of congestion, stuffiness, fullness, or blockage within the nose. Difficulty sleeping is another common complaint, as the inferior turbinates may engorge in the supine position. Patients may report being able to sleep on one side only, as contralateral sleeping causes increased nasal obstruction. Nasal obstruction itself is a risk factor for poor sleep quality, independent of obstructive sleep apnea [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-diagnosis-and-treatment-of-nasal-obstruction/abstract/10,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,11</a>]. Difficulty breathing is a less common complaint, which can occur due to nasal disease on one or both sides of the nose.</p><p>Patients will often report other symptoms that may suggest the underlying etiology of nasal obstruction. In the case of rhinosinusitis, these symptoms include facial congestion, facial pain or pressure, dysosmia, anterior rhinorrhea, postnasal discharge, cough, pruritic conjunctivitis, sneezing, or throat <span class=\"nowrap\">irritation/itching</span>. It is common for symptoms of nasal etiology to wax and wane with respect to daily time course, body position, seasonality, and exposures to environmental stimuli. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=chronic-rhinosinusitis-clinical-manifestations-pathophysiology-and-diagnosis#H3250712\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Chronic rhinosinusitis: Clinical manifestations, pathophysiology, and diagnosis&quot;, section on 'Clinical manifestations'</a>.)</p><p>The natural history of nasal obstruction is difficult to predict and may vary based on underlying etiology. Structural abnormalities such as nasal septal deviation or bony inferior turbinate hypertrophy typically worsen slowly over time. Mucosal abnormalities, such as those caused by seasonal allergies or noxious stimuli, typically fluctuate in duration and severity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-diagnosis-and-treatment-of-nasal-obstruction/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=etiologies-of-nasal-symptoms-an-overview\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Etiologies of nasal symptoms: An overview&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=chronic-rhinosinusitis-clinical-manifestations-pathophysiology-and-diagnosis#H3250712\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Chronic rhinosinusitis: Clinical manifestations, pathophysiology, and diagnosis&quot;, section on 'Clinical manifestations'</a>.)</p><p>The degree of nasal obstruction, as measured objectively by acoustic rhinometry, peak nasal airflow, or rhinomanometry, may not correlate well with the patient's subjective sense of nasal obstruction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-diagnosis-and-treatment-of-nasal-obstruction/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. As an example, minimal changes in nasal patency (measured objectively) may still manifest as a significant symptomatic problem in the individual patient. (See <a href=\"#H492107719\" class=\"local\">'Other testing'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H16905688\"><span class=\"h1\">DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The evaluation of a patient with nasal symptoms involves a detailed history and physical examination. Some patients may require further evaluation involving nasal endoscopy or diagnostic imaging.</p><p>This section provides a general approach to the patient with nasal obstruction. The differential diagnosis of nasal obstruction is broad and includes both structural causes (congenital abnormalities, acquired diseases, tumors) and mucosal causes (medication-induced, infectious, and inflammatory conditions) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F79359\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef79359 \">table 1</a>). Diagnostic criteria for specific etiologies of nasal obstruction are discussed elsewhere.

Most of the underlying causes of nasal obstruction can be determined based on a thorough examination of the nose, nasal cavity, and the nasopharynx [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-diagnosis-and-treatment-of-nasal-obstruction/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H492108362\"><span class=\"h3\">External examination</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The external nasal contour is examined with close attention to any bony and cartilaginous deformities, looking for evidence of prior trauma, the structural integrity of the nasal tip, and indentation or depression of the surrounding nasal bones. In older patients, deterioration or hypertrophy of the cartilage in the nasal tip may contribute to nasal obstruction. The examiner should manually elevate the nasal tip to a neutral (rather than exaggerated) position and assess for improvement of nasal airflow. Airflow improvement suggests disease of the cartilage of the nasal tip. The clinician should also examine airflow both during shallow and deep inspiration. Early collapse of nasal patency suggests nasal valve incompetence.</p><p>The Cottle maneuver is an additional physical examination maneuver to assess nasal valve competency [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-diagnosis-and-treatment-of-nasal-obstruction/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. The Cottle maneuver is performed by retracting the cheek laterally, which pulls the upper lateral cartilage away from the septum and widens the internal nasal valve angle. If the patient&rsquo;s symptoms are relieved with this maneuver, the cause of nasal obstruction is likely related to the nasal valve.</p><p>Palpation of the neck is also important to detect cervical lymphadenopathy, particularly if nasal malignancy is suspected.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H492108355\"><span class=\"h3\">Anterior rhinoscopy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Anterior rhinoscopy can be performed with a nasal speculum or with an otoscope, along with a bright light source to improve visualization. Examination of the nose is conducted with the patient's head tilted back and the clinician sitting directly opposite. To reduce patient discomfort and steady the head, the examiner should position the outer ulnar aspect of the palm not holding an instrument against the patient's forehead; the thumb of that hand is used to elevate the tip of the nose. This procedure allows for optimal visualization of each vestibule, the nasal turbinates, septum, and mucosal surfaces (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F73419\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef73419 \">picture 1</a>).</p><p>The assessment should start at the level of the naris, looking for mucosal abnormalities, patency, and collapse of the soft tissues with respiration (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F52743\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef52743 \">figure 4</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-diagnosis-and-treatment-of-nasal-obstruction/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. Normal mucosal surfaces are pink, and the vestibules are patent and easily visible to the level of the middle turbinates (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F73166\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef73166 \">picture 2</a>). The septum should be midline, although a slight deviation may be normal. Anterior rhinoscopy provides assessment of the size and caliber of the inferior turbinates and the position of the anterior to mid-nasal septum. Although there are no strict definitions for normal size of the nasal cavity, clinicians should assess the overall dimensions of the nasal cavity relative to the septum and the turbinates while identifying septal deviation, significant inferior turbinate hypertrophy, and possible contact between mucosal surfaces (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F53443\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef53443 \">picture 3</a>).</p><p>Occluded nasal passageways caused by boggy, red nasal mucosa may develop as a result of allergies, nonallergic rhinitis, or overuse of nasal decongestants. Ulcerated, friable mucosa may indicate granulomatous disease. Polyps at the level of the middle turbinate or mid-nasal cavity may be visible (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F50105\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef50105 \">picture 4</a>). Identification of purulent nasal discharge is helpful in identifying cases of rhinosinusitis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-diagnosis-and-treatment-of-nasal-obstruction/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H492108348\"><span class=\"h3\">Nasal endoscopy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Posterior nasal structures are best visualized with nasal endoscopy. Fiberoptic nasal endoscopy is a diagnostic tool with low risk and high diagnostic yield but is typically available only to otolaryngologists. Patients in whom the etiology of nasal obstructive symptoms is unclear after initial evaluation, or in whom symptoms persist after treatment for a presumptive cause, should be referred for endoscopy.</p><p>After preparation of the nose with topical decongestant <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> topical anesthetic spray, a rigid or flexible endoscope is used to directly examine the middle meatus, posterior aspects of the nasal cavity, and the nasopharynx to identify polyps, posterior turbinate hypertrophy, middle and posterior nasal septal deviations, adenoid hypertrophy, nasal tumors, choanal atresia, and purulent discharge draining posteriorly in rhinosinusitis (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F79734\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef79734 \">picture 5</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F54181\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef54181 \">picture 6</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-diagnosis-and-treatment-of-nasal-obstruction/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H492107576\"><span class=\"h2\">Diagnostic imaging</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Diagnostic imaging to assess both mucosal disorders and anatomical deformities is indicated when the diagnosis is not clear based upon the history and physical examination alone. Computed tomography (CT) scan of the nose and paranasal sinuses is the primary diagnostic imaging modality [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-diagnosis-and-treatment-of-nasal-obstruction/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. Plain film radiography lacks the sensitivity and specificity required in the diagnostic evaluation of nasal obstruction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-diagnosis-and-treatment-of-nasal-obstruction/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), which allows for more detailed soft tissue assessment compared with CT, is generally a secondary study and is indicated for better characterization of nasal tumors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-diagnosis-and-treatment-of-nasal-obstruction/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].</p><p>Examples of abnormal CT findings include air-fluid levels in acute bacterial rhinosinusitis (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F68163\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef68163 \">image 1</a>), bony narrowing in choanal atresia (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F82266\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef82266 \">image 2</a>), stenosis of the pyriform aperture (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F68161\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef68161 \">image 3</a>), and nasal septal deformities (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F52826\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef52826 \">image 4</a>). Although an anatomic abnormality may be seen on CT scan, the etiology of obstruction may not be apparent. As an example, any cause of inferior turbinate hypertrophy can lead to nasal obstruction, including allergic rhinitis (both seasonal and perennial), nonallergic rhinitis, rhinitis medicamentosa, and other medication-induced rhinitis. In general, more useful clinical information is obtained from the history, physical exam, and, in certain cases, fiber-optic nasal endoscopy than imaging [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-diagnosis-and-treatment-of-nasal-obstruction/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. In general, imaging is not recommended as a first-line diagnostic intervention in most cases of clinically diagnosed allergic rhinitis or septal deviation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-diagnosis-and-treatment-of-nasal-obstruction/abstract/18,19\" class=\"abstract_t\">18,19</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H492107719\"><span class=\"h2\">Other testing</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Several other tests can be performed to help characterize nasal obstruction.

This section will focus on treatments of several causes of nasal obstruction, including nasal polyposis, nasal vestibulitis, nasal septal deviation, mucoceles, and nasal valve abnormalities. Treatments for other specific causes are discussed separately.

Nasal glucocorticoid sprays are first-line therapy for several mucosal etiologies of nasal obstruction (eg, rhinitis, nasal polyposis), and may often be used empirically as a trial of therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-diagnosis-and-treatment-of-nasal-obstruction/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. Topical nasal glucocorticoid sprays are strongly recommended in patients with a clinical diagnosis of allergic rhinitis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-diagnosis-and-treatment-of-nasal-obstruction/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. Some structural causes (eg, adenoidal hypertrophy) can be treated with pharmacologic therapy initially and referred for surgical treatment if medication response is inadequate. Other structural causes of nasal obstruction are less likely to respond to pharmacologic treatment, and surgery is the initial therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-diagnosis-and-treatment-of-nasal-obstruction/abstract/20,21\" class=\"abstract_t\">20,21</a>]. As an example, choanal atresia usually requires transnasal puncture or palatal repair with subsequent stenting (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F51419\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef51419 \">picture 7</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F66077\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef66077 \">picture 8</a>). Malignancy of the nasal cavity usually requires radiation therapy in combination with surgical resection.</p><p>The etiology of nasal obstruction may be multifactorial, and treating more than one condition may be required for effective management of nasal obstruction. A combination of both nasal septal deviation and turbinate hypertrophy leading to nasal obstruction is common. Medical treatment of the turbinate hypertrophy component, possibly due to allergic rhinitis, may provide only partial relief depending on the degree of contribution of the individual elements.
