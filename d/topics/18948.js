The &quot;pet therapy&quot; group patients had improved symptoms of depression and a significant decrease in blood pressure values as compared with the control patients.</p><p>Despite these benefits, pets present zoonotic risks, especially for immunocompromised hosts [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/zoonoses-from-cats/abstract/4-6\" class=\"abstract_t\">4-6</a>]. The epidemiology of cat-related zoonoses will be reviewed here. The epidemiology of pet-related zoonoses other than cats is presented separately (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=zoonoses-from-dogs\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Zoonoses from dogs&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=zoonoses-from-pets-other-than-dogs-and-cats\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Zoonoses from pets other than dogs and cats&quot;</a>). The clinical management of specific zoonotic diseases is discussed under the appropriate topic reviews.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">DEFINITION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A zoonosis is an animal disease that is transmissible to humans. Humans are usually an accidental host that acquire disease through close contact with an infected animal, who may or may not be symptomatic.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">INCIDENCE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The American Pet Association estimates that there are 77 million cats in the United States (<a href=\"http://www.apapets.org/&amp;token=+2oqvu8iPSnBMQoxEVE56k1TdxMO2Sty8OhYbBN8l1I=&amp;TOPIC_ID=5518\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">www.apapets.org</a>). The most common route of infection related to cat contact is through bites and scratches, especially in children. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=soft-tissue-infections-due-to-dog-and-cat-bites\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Soft tissue infections due to dog and cat bites&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Cats can harbor many of the same infections as dogs. In addition, cats may transmit zoonoses specific to felines, such as cat-scratch disease, toxoplasmosis, and <em>Sporothrix schenckii</em> infections.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h1\">RISK FACTORS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Clinicians should ask about pets when taking a medical history and formulating a differential diagnosis. Many of the risks posed by pet ownership can be reduced by good hygiene after handling pets, careful pet selection, and proper pet care. New pets can pose more of a health risk because health history and vaccination records may not be known. Adult pets are generally safer than younger animals, since they are less likely to be involved in playful activities that include scratching and biting. Children are at highest risk for infection because they are more likely to have close contact with pets.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h1\">TRANSMISSION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Cats are responsible for the transmission of an extensive array of infectious pathogens (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F57235%7EID%2F70031\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef57235 graphicRef70031 \">table 1A-B</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/zoonoses-from-cats/abstract/7,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,8</a>]. As an example, free-roaming or feral cats (eg, those born in the wild) can transmit numerous infections, including rabies, toxoplasmosis, cutaneous larval migrans, <em>Yersinia pestis</em>, tularemia, and murine typhus [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/zoonoses-from-cats/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. In addition, exposure to such cats without veterinary care can increase the risk of clinically significant skin infections from fungal (eg, feline sporotrichosis, <em>Microsporum canis</em>, and <em>Arthroderma vanbreuseghemi</em>) and bacterial (eg, <em>Corynebacterium ulcerans</em>) pathogens [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/zoonoses-from-cats/abstract/10,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,11</a>]. </p><p>Many different routes of transmission can cause infections related to pets including:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Infectious saliva that contaminate bite wounds, skin abrasions, or mucous membranes</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Hand-to-mouth transfer of microorganisms, cysts, or oocysts (eggs) from feces of an infected animal</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Aerosol from body fluids (eg, respiratory secretions, placenta)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Tick or flea bites when these vectors are carried into the home by pets</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Direct contact with an infected cat</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Infectious saliva</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Saliva can transmit and contaminate bite wounds, skin abrasions, or mucous membranes. Cat bites are particularly problematic in that the cat's teeth are slender and sharp and can produce deep puncture wounds. Because of the penetrating capabilities of the teeth, contamination of bone and joint can occur and result in osteomyelitis or septic arthritis; infection complicates cat bites in about 50 percent of cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/zoonoses-from-cats/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=soft-tissue-infections-due-to-dog-and-cat-bites\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Soft tissue infections due to dog and cat bites&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h3\">Bartonella henselae</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span><em>Bartonella henselae</em>, the etiologic agent of cat scratch disease (CSD) can cause disease in both normal and immunocompromised hosts. However, 80 percent of cases occur in children, with a peak in the incidence of cases between ages 2 and 14 years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/zoonoses-from-cats/abstract/13,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,14</a>]. One survey noted a peak number of cases in January [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/zoonoses-from-cats/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. In the United States, approximately 40 percent of cats have serologic evidence of past or current <em>B. henselae</em> infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/zoonoses-from-cats/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. However, incidence in cats varies geographically, in one study of 255 cats in Northern California, <em>B. henselae</em> bacteremia was documented in 56 and 34 percent of cats less than one year and at least one year of age, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/zoonoses-from-cats/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. Individual reports from numerous countries suggest a worldwide distribution [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/zoonoses-from-cats/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. Infection in cats, including bacteremia, is asymptomatic. Although preliminary data suggests that asymptomatic bacteremia in cats can be successfully treated with antibiotics, this practice is not recommended [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/zoonoses-from-cats/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>].</p><p>CSD can result from a cat scratch or bite, as well as possibly from a fleabite. CSD is more likely to be transmitted by kittens than adult cats, as kittens are more likely to be bacteremic [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/zoonoses-from-cats/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. Human CSD most often presents as a localized cutaneous and lymph node disorder near the site of organism inoculation. In some individuals, the organisms disseminate and infect the liver, spleen, eye, or central nervous system.

Both healthy (eg, cats and dogs) and diseased (eg, rabbits) wild and domestic animals are the main reservoirs for the organism.</p><p><em>Pasteurella </em>infection is most often secondary to a bite or scratch from a cat, although a lick has also caused infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/zoonoses-from-cats/abstract/20,21\" class=\"abstract_t\">20,21</a>]. <em>Pasteurella</em> can cause serious soft-tissue infections and less commonly septic arthritis, osteomyelitis, sepsis, and meningitis particularly in infants and other immunocompromised hosts [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/zoonoses-from-cats/abstract/22,23\" class=\"abstract_t\">22,23</a>].

In the United States in 2004, of 7170 cases in nonhuman animals, 281 (4.1 percent) cases occurred in cats [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/zoonoses-from-cats/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. However, cats rarely are implicated in rabies transmission to humans. In developing countries, dogs account for 90 percent or more of reported cases, while in the United States, bat bites account for the majority of cases. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-rabies\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of rabies&quot;</a>.) </p><p>Rabies should be considered in the differential diagnosis of patients presenting with acute progressive encephalitis regardless of a history of an animal bite. Because of the nonspecific early symptoms, other more common infectious and noninfectious disorders (eg, encephalitis caused by arboviruses or enterovirus and Guillain-Barr&eacute; syndrome or vasculitis) should be ruled out (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F79957\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef79957 \">algorithm 1</a>).

Although more commonly associated with dog bites, <em>Capnocytophaga canimorsus </em>(formerly CDC group DF-2) is a fastidious, gram-negative rod that forms part of the normal oral flora of dogs and cats.</p><p>Human infection with two species, <em>C. canimorsus</em> and <em>C. cynodegmi</em>, can follow a cat bite or scratch [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/zoonoses-from-cats/abstract/26-28\" class=\"abstract_t\">26-28</a>]. <em>C. canimorsus</em> can cause fulminant sepsis and meningitis, particularly in asplenic patients or alcoholics. Human corneal infection with <em>C. canimorsus</em> has occurred following eye trauma due to a cat bite [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/zoonoses-from-cats/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>].

Cats may develop potentially fatal infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/zoonoses-from-cats/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. Humans are accidental hosts following contact with infected animals or vectors. In the United States, tularemia has been reported from all 49 continental states, but the majority of cases occur in the south central states, mainly Arkansas, Missouri, and Oklahoma. Vector-borne disease, especially by ticks, is the most common way the disease is transmitted in the United States. The rare transmission of tularemia from a cat bite has been reported [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/zoonoses-from-cats/abstract/31,32\" class=\"abstract_t\">31,32</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epidemiology-microbiology-and-pathogenesis-of-tularemia\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Epidemiology, microbiology, and pathogenesis of tularemia&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Patients infected with <em>Francisella </em>spp present with the abrupt onset of fever, chills, headache, and malaise, after an incubation period of 2 to 10 days.

In cats, ulcerated, crusted focal skin lesions can occur, sometimes with mild systemic illness and concurrent oral lesions; young or immunosuppressed animals may develop severe systemic illness [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/zoonoses-from-cats/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>].</p><p>Transmission of cowpox from a domestic cat to a human was first reported in 1985, but cases are still observed, mainly in European countries [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/zoonoses-from-cats/abstract/35-37\" class=\"abstract_t\">35-37</a>]. In humans, cowpox is an uncommon and probably underdiagnosed infection that may mimic anthrax with its painful, hemorrhagic pustules or black eschars (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F53156\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef53156 \">picture 1</a>)&nbsp;[<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/zoonoses-from-cats/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h2\">Fecal transmission</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Common zoonotic pathogens causing feline gastroenteritis include <em>Salmonella</em>, <em>Campylobacter</em>, <em>Cryptosporidium</em>, and <em>Giardia</em>. Thus, cats with diarrhea should have a stool specimen examined for these pathogens [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/zoonoses-from-cats/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. In addition, numerous parasitic diseases can be transmitted from cats to humans through feces, including toxocariasis, cutaneous larva migrans (eg, <em>Ancylostoma braziliense</em>), echinococcosis, and toxoplasmosis. Multidrug-resistant pathogens (eg, <em>Escherichia coli</em>) can also be transmitted [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/zoonoses-from-cats/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14\"><span class=\"h3\">Salmonella</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Infection due to <em>Salmonella</em> species usually results in a mild, self-limited gastroenteritis in humans. However, severe invasive illness, such as septicemia or meningitis, can occur, especially in infants and immunocompromised persons. Most cases of salmonellosis in humans are due to foodborne illness. Salmonellosis may also be transmitted from contact with animals, such as turtles and lizards. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nontyphoidal-salmonella-gastrointestinal-infection-and-carriage\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Nontyphoidal Salmonella: Gastrointestinal infection and carriage&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nontyphoidal-salmonella-microbiology-and-epidemiology#H1058724578\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Nontyphoidal Salmonella: Microbiology and epidemiology&quot;, section on 'Modes of transmission'</a>.)</p><p>Although contact with cats is an uncommon way for humans to get salmonellosis, an outbreak of <em>S. typhimurium</em> was reported in a veterinary clinic in New York State where seven human cases may have been associated with a case in a diabetic cat [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/zoonoses-from-cats/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>]. The cat had chronic intermittent diarrhea attributed to diabetes-related dietary changes and, in retrospect, could have contaminated the clinic. <em>Salmonella</em> contamination has also been implicated in over a dozen recall announcements involving more than 100 pet products such as dry dog and cat food, pet treats, and supplements [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/zoonoses-from-cats/abstract/41,42\" class=\"abstract_t\">41,42</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15\"><span class=\"h3\">Campylobacter</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Like salmonellosis, the mode of transmission of <em>Campylobacter</em> infection is most often foodborne. However, in a substantial proportion of <em>Campylobacter </em>cases the source of infection is unknown. In a survey of 218 human cases of infection that identified the source, 6 percent were due to exposure to an animal with diarrhea [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/zoonoses-from-cats/abstract/43\" class=\"abstract_t\">43</a>].

Approximately 95 percent of cases of Lyme disease in the United State are reported from twelve states: Massachusetts, Connecticut, Maine, New Hampshire, Rhode Island, New York, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Delaware, Maryland, Michigan, and Wisconsin. In highly endemic areas, owners of cats who go outdoors should inspect their cats regularly for ticks, as tick collars have a variable efficacy. Owners should inspect their cats for ticks for two reasons. First, cats can develop symptomatic Lyme disease with painful or stiff muscles and joints, fatigue, fever, and loss of appetite. Second, cat may carry ticks indoors, and if these ticks carry <em>B. burgdorferi</em> and attach to a human, they may then transmit Lyme disease to the pet's human family.</p><p>Human Lyme disease is a multisystem inflammatory disease. One of the first clinical manifestations is the classic erythema migrans (EM) skin lesion (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F81270\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef81270 \">picture 3</a>) that occurs in up to 90 percent of patients.

Most cases of HME have occurred in the southeastern, south-central, and mid-Atlantic regions of the United States. States with the highest incidence of HGA during 2001 to 2002 were Rhode Island, Minnesota, Connecticut, New York, and Maryland. HGA is also reported in Western Europe.</p><p>A cat that goes outdoors should be inspected for ticks, as a tick carrying HME or HGA may infect the animal or the tick may attach to a human once brought indoors by the cat. Infection with <em>A. phagocytophilum</em> is associated with clinical illness in some cats.

Humans are usually an accidental host that acquires disease through close contact with an infected animal, who may or may not be symptomatic. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Definition'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Children are at highest risk for infection because they are more likely to have close contact with pets. (See <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Risk factors'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Cats are responsible for transmission of an extensive array of bacterial, fungal, and parasitic zoonotic pathogens. The route of transmission can be through the saliva (eg, bites or contaminated scratches), feces, respiratory secretions, direct contact, or by the cat acting as a vehicle and source of tick or flea exposure. (See <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Transmission'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Although cats have been implicated in transmission of zoonoses to their owners, risk of transmission from contact with cats is low and may be further reduced by simple precautions. (See <a href=\"#H36\" class=\"local\">'Prevention'</a> above.)</p></div><div id=\"topicAgreement\">Use of UpToDate is subject to the <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/legal/license\" class=\"licenseLink\" id=\"sla_in_page\">Subscription and License Agreement</a>.</div><div id=\"references\" class=\"headingAnchor\"><h1>REFERENCES</h1><ol id=\"reference\"><li><a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/zoonoses-from-cats/abstract/1\" class=\"nounderline abstract_t\">Anderson WP, Reid CM, Jennings GL.
