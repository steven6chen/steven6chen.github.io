In the United States, the adverse health effects from cigarette smoking account for more than 480,000 deaths among adults, or nearly one of every five deaths; more deaths are caused each year by tobacco use than by all deaths from human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), illegal drug use, alcohol use, motor vehicle injuries and firearm-related incidents combined [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-smoking-cessation-in-adolescents/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p>Cancer was among the first diseases causally linked to smoking. Smoking causes cancers of the bladder, oral cavity, pharynx, larynx, esophagus, cervix, kidney, lung, pancreas, and stomach, and acute myeloid leukemia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-smoking-cessation-in-adolescents/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Smoking causes about 90 percent of lung cancer deaths in men and women. The epidemiology of smoking and the benefits of smoking cessation in adults are discussed in separate topic reviews. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=patterns-of-tobacco-use\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Patterns of tobacco use&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cigarette-smoking-and-other-possible-risk-factors-for-lung-cancer\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Cigarette smoking and other possible risk factors for lung cancer&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The prevalence of tobacco smoking among adolescents in the United States has gradually declined since the late 1990s. In 2015, 5.5 percent of 12<sup>th</sup> grade students reported smoking cigarettes daily, compared with 24.6 percent in 1997 (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F79503\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef79503 \">figure 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-smoking-cessation-in-adolescents/abstract/2-4\" class=\"abstract_t\">2-4</a>]. Regional variations, prevalence, and trends in smoking among adolescents are discussed in a separate topic review. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prevention-of-smoking-initiation-in-children-and-adolescents\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Prevention of smoking initiation in children and adolescents&quot;</a>.) &#160;</p><p>Smoking cessation is particularly important in the adolescent population because intervention at this time may prevent nicotine dependence and severe health consequences later in life. Smoking in adulthood is closely associated with smoking during adolescence: 90 percent of adult smokers smoked their first cigarette before the age of 18 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-smoking-cessation-in-adolescents/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. Youth are particularly vulnerable to becoming dependent on nicotine, as compared with adults. (See <a href=\"#H11\" class=\"local\">'Nicotine dependence'</a> below.)</p><p>Motivation to quit smoking, as well as methods to help adolescent patients stop smoking, including smoking bans, adolescent smoking cessation programs, and pharmacological interventions are reviewed here. Behavioral and pharmacological interventions to support smoking cessation in adults are presented separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=behavioral-approaches-to-smoking-cessation\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Behavioral approaches to smoking cessation&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-smoking-cessation-management-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of smoking cessation management in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">PATTERNS OF SMOKING CESSATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A minority of adolescent smokers quit without intervention. In a national survey in the United States, 12.2 percent of adolescents who had ever smoked daily and tried to quit smoking were successful (defined as not smoking during the 30 days prior to the survey) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-smoking-cessation-in-adolescents/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].</p><p>In most populations, the overall prevalence of smoking increases from early to late adolescence, and is fairly stable thereafter, with approximately equal numbers of individuals initiating smoking and quitting [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-smoking-cessation-in-adolescents/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. As an example, a study prospectively followed regular and occasional smokers in Finland from early adolescence until age 28 years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-smoking-cessation-in-adolescents/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. By age 21, 22 percent of daily smokers and 35 percent of occasional smokers had ceased smoking. This yields an annual quitting rate of 4.1 percent between ages 15 and 21. By the age of 28, 26 percent of those who were daily smokers and 46 percent of those who were occasional smokers at age 15 years had quit. The cessation rate was higher among those who were female, married, employed, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> white collar workers.</p><p>However, this overall pattern is made up of several groups with independent trajectories (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F56174\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef56174 \">figure 2</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-smoking-cessation-in-adolescents/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. The risk factors for those who remained stable heavy smokers (alcohol use, deviance from rules, peer smoking, and drug use) are remarkably similar to those who quit or remained stable light smokers after adolescence. Moreover, a distinct group initiates smoking during early adulthood (&quot;late escalators&quot;), and these individuals tend to have few of the risk factors that are associated with initiating smoking earlier in adolescence. A possible exception is that novice smokers who escalate rapidly during early adolescence are particularly likely to remain heavy smokers; it has been suggested that this pattern is a marker for nicotine dependence [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-smoking-cessation-in-adolescents/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H11\" class=\"local\">'Nicotine dependence'</a> below.)</p><p>Thus, clinical risk factors do not reliably identify individual adolescent smokers who are most likely to quit independently, suggesting that intervention to support smoking cessation is appropriate for all adolescents who smoke, regardless of smoking frequency.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">READINESS TO QUIT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Most adolescent smokers report that they want to quit smoking. In a study of adolescents caught smoking at school, 71 percent reported that they had attempted to quit in the last year, and two-thirds intended to quit in the next six months [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-smoking-cessation-in-adolescents/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. Similar rates of attempts to quit smoking were found in a national survey study in the United States [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-smoking-cessation-in-adolescents/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].</p><p>Thus, the majority of adolescents who smoke are interested in quitting, suggesting readiness for intervention.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h1\">ESTABLISHED INTERVENTIONS FOR ADULTS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Among adults, the long-term success rate of an unaided quit attempt is less than 7 percent, whereas the likelihood of success can be increased as much as fourfold with optimal treatment. A variety of studies and meta-analyses have established that both psychosocial counseling and pharmacotherapy are effective, and that combinations of the two methods achieve the best results. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-smoking-cessation-management-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of smoking cessation management in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p>There is considerably less information about the outcomes of related interventions in adolescent smokers, but existing data support the use of similar approaches, as discussed below.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h1\">FOSTERING MOTIVATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Understanding the adolescent's motivations provides an important basis for an effective counseling interaction. Exploring the individual's incentives to smoke or to quit is the first step in effective problem solving. Some of the most common motivations that prompt adolescents to smoke or to want to quit are discussed below.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Incentives to quit</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In surveys of adolescents who smoke, concerns about future and current health, as well as physical appearance, cost of cigarettes, and athletic performance are the most common reasons given for making an attempt to quit smoking [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-smoking-cessation-in-adolescents/abstract/11,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,12</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h3\">Adverse health effects</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Among adolescents who are considering quitting, the long-term adverse health consequences are the most important motivating factor [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-smoking-cessation-in-adolescents/abstract/11,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,12</a>]. As an example, in a survey of adolescents who smoked, 75 percent said that future health was a motivation for quitting smoking, and 35 percent identified this concern as the most motivating factor [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-smoking-cessation-in-adolescents/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. Most of the respondents were older adolescents (average age 16 years); the frequency of this concern did not vary by age or gender. This may not be as strong of a factor for those who are not already considering quitting.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h3\">Monetary costs</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Many adolescents cite the cost of cigarettes as a reason to quit. The cost of regular smoking is considerable. In 2015, the average cost of a pack of cigarettes in the United States was $6.25, and was as high as $10.29 in some states, rising as high as $14 per pack in some areas, due to additional city taxes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-smoking-cessation-in-adolescents/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. Thus, the cost of buying one pack of cigarettes daily averages $2281 per year and can be as high as $5000 per year. Legislative and regulatory strategies that raise prices on tobacco products are effective in reducing smoking initiation and consumption levels, especially among youth and young adults [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-smoking-cessation-in-adolescents/abstract/14,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">14,15</a>]. Accordingly, tobacco product price increases are strongly recommended by the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-smoking-cessation-in-adolescents/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>].</p><p>Helping an adolescent calculate the costs of regular smoking may be motivating as they consider the current and future costs of their habit [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-smoking-cessation-in-adolescents/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. Adolescents may derive more motivation to quit if they realize this money could be put towards music, movies, clothes, or even a car.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h3\">Athletic performance</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Concerns about athletic performance are commonly cited as reasons for attempting to quit. In one study, this was cited as the most important motivator by 16 percent of participants, and was only slightly more common among boys than girls [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-smoking-cessation-in-adolescents/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>].</p><p>Adolescents involved in sports may not be aware of the effects of smoking on current lung function and performance. A discussion of their goals for athletic performance and how smoking may limit their achievements in the future may boost their motivation to quit.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h2\">Barriers to quitting</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A variety of physiologic and psychosocial forces may impede smoking cessation in adolescents, including nicotine dependence, efforts to boost social standing among peers, or assertion of independence from parents or authority figures. Eliciting the adolescent's own reasons for starting or continuing smoking in a nonjudgmental way promotes insight and can help formulate a quitting strategy.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h3\">Nicotine dependence</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Nicotine dependence is characterized by tolerance to nicotine [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-smoking-cessation-in-adolescents/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>], and psychobehavioral symptoms that are triggered by nicotine withdrawal [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-smoking-cessation-in-adolescents/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. These include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Craving for cigarettes</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Dysphoria or depressed mood</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Sleep disturbances</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Irritability and anger</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Anxiety</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Difficulty concentrating</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Restlessness</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Increased appetite</p><p/><p>Youth are particularly vulnerable to becoming dependent on nicotine, as compared with adults [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-smoking-cessation-in-adolescents/abstract/14,19\" class=\"abstract_t\">14,19</a>]. Nicotine dependence can develop after as few as 100 cigarettes. The first symptoms of nicotine dependence can appear within days to weeks of the onset of occasional cigarette use, and often appear before the onset of daily smoking [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-smoking-cessation-in-adolescents/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. With increasing nicotine exposure, smokers progress through a sequence of symptoms of addiction, characterized by &quot;wanting,&quot; then &quot;craving,&quot; then &quot;needing&quot; tobacco [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-smoking-cessation-in-adolescents/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. Adolescents who report early emergence of symptoms of nicotine dependence are significantly more likely to be smokers two years later, compared with those who do not report early symptoms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-smoking-cessation-in-adolescents/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. Similarly, individuals who start smoking at a young age are more likely to develop severe dependence and have lower rates of smoking cessation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-smoking-cessation-in-adolescents/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. </p><p>The likelihood of nicotine dependence increases with the quantity and duration of smoking: smokers who smoke more than 10 cigarettes per day report greater severity of withdrawal symptoms. Furthermore, even non-daily tobacco use triggers the emergence of nicotine dependence [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-smoking-cessation-in-adolescents/abstract/17,23\" class=\"abstract_t\">17,23</a>]. Genetic factors also may influence an individual's predisposition to become dependent on nicotine [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-smoking-cessation-in-adolescents/abstract/14,17,24\" class=\"abstract_t\">14,17,24</a>]. </p><p>In a survey of adolescent smokers, about 20 percent of adolescents were substantially dependent on nicotine, as assessed by a modified Fagerstrom Tolerance Questionnaire (a survey tool to measure symptoms of nicotine dependence), and 42 percent had moderate dependence [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-smoking-cessation-in-adolescents/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. Those with greater evidence of nicotine dependence were less likely to be successful with a quit attempt. Thus, nicotine dependence and nicotine withdrawal can interfere with an adolescent's success in quitting smoking, suggesting a potential role for nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) in the treatment of tobacco use and dependence among adolescents [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-smoking-cessation-in-adolescents/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. To assess for nicotine dependence, it is useful to ask how long a teen can wait after waking up to have the first cigarette. Waiting less than an hour before having the first cigarette of the day is a strong indicator of nicotine dependence [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-smoking-cessation-in-adolescents/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H26\" class=\"local\">'Nicotine replacement'</a> below.) </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h3\">Weight control</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Many teens view smoking as a means of weight control. These concerns may be particularly relevant because of the increasing prevalence of obesity in youth.</p><p>Contemplation of and experimentation with smoking have been found to be related to weight concerns [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-smoking-cessation-in-adolescents/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. A survey found that girls in sixth and seventh grade who reported dieting up to one time per week were almost twice as likely to be smokers as girls who had not dieted [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-smoking-cessation-in-adolescents/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. The odds ratio increased to 3.9 for girls who dieted more than once per week. They did not find such a relationship for boys.</p><p>Among adults, smoking cessation is associated with a long-term average weight gain of about 7 kg [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-smoking-cessation-in-adolescents/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. Weight patterns after smoking cessation in adolescents are not well-characterized, but the 2012 Surgeon General's report concludes that there is no evidence that young smokers weigh less or lose weight because of their smoking [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-smoking-cessation-in-adolescents/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>].</p><p>If concerns about weight gain present a barrier to smoking cessation, the clinician should offer advice about other ways to control weight, such as limiting high calorie foods and sodas, and increasing physical activity. Other strategies include identifying oral cravings and substituting them with healthy snacks, and finding new activities to occupy the hands after cessation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-smoking-cessation-in-adolescents/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]. Although there is little evidence that these strategies attenuate weight gain in adults [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-smoking-cessation-in-adolescents/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>], they have not been studied in adolescents. Adolescent patients who are motivated to quit smoking by an interest in improving athletic performance may be particularly willing to increase their physical activity. Furthermore, engaging in physical activity has been shown to increase the success of a quit attempt [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-smoking-cessation-in-adolescents/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>]. A separate topic review discusses eating habits and misconceptions that are commonly seen in adolescents, and counseling strategies to address these. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=adolescent-eating-habits\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Adolescent eating habits&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h3\">Depression</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Depressed adolescents are significantly more likely to start smoking than those without depression. Symptoms of depression and anxiety increase the likelihood of smoking initiation during adolescence because adolescents tend to smoke cigarettes in order to diminish their depressive feelings [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-smoking-cessation-in-adolescents/abstract/7,33\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,33</a>]. Therefore, treatment of depression may facilitate smoking cessation in this population. Although <a href=\"topic.htm?path=bupropion-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">bupropion</a>, an antidepressant, has been shown to assist with smoking cessation in adults, there is minimal data on the use of bupropion for smoking cessation in adolescents, so decisions about antidepressants should be based on considerations of efficacy and safety for depression rather than for smoking cessation. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pediatric-unipolar-depression-and-pharmacotherapy-choosing-a-medication\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pediatric unipolar depression and pharmacotherapy: Choosing a medication&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-smoking-cessation-management-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of smoking cessation management in adults&quot;</a> and <a href=\"#H29\" class=\"local\">'Other drugs'</a> below and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pharmacotherapy-for-smoking-cessation-in-adults#H451502936\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pharmacotherapy for smoking cessation in adults&quot;, section on 'Bupropion'</a>.) </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14\"><span class=\"h3\">Stress and coping behavior</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Compared with adolescent smokers who had quit, current adolescent smokers have greater levels of perceived stress and are less likely to use cognitive coping methods [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-smoking-cessation-in-adolescents/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>]. Therefore, it may be helpful to incorporate stress reduction techniques and training in problem solving skills into interventions to support cessation efforts. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15\"><span class=\"h1\">OTHER INFLUENCES ON SMOKING BEHAVIOR</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H16\"><span class=\"h2\">Peer/social influences</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Peer habits have a powerful influence on smoking initiation and cessation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-smoking-cessation-in-adolescents/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. In a report of teens caught smoking at school, half reported that all five of their five best friends smoked, and most were daily smokers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-smoking-cessation-in-adolescents/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. Among individuals who started smoking by age 15 years, only 20 percent had quit by age 28 if their best friend was a smoker, whereas 52 percent had quit if their best friend was not a smoker [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-smoking-cessation-in-adolescents/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].</p><p>The cross-sectional studies cited above could be explained by self-selection of friends with like habits, rather than causation. However, longitudinal studies suggest that peer smoking has a causal influence on smoking initiation and cessation. In a study of youth who smoked occasionally but not daily in eighth grade, progression to daily smoking was predicted by their parents' and peers' smoking habits [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-smoking-cessation-in-adolescents/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>]. Furthermore, smoking among parents was the most important influence on smoking initiation in younger adolescents, but smoking among peers became the more important influence in older adolescents [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-smoking-cessation-in-adolescents/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>].</p><p>Peers are often willing to support smoking cessation, particularly if they are a nonsmoker themselves. In a survey of college students, 54 percent reported that they &quot;definitely would&quot; be interested in helping an acquaintance quit smoking [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-smoking-cessation-in-adolescents/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>]. Characteristics significantly associated with willingness to help included being a nontobacco user and whether they had a close relationship with the smoker (a boyfriend, girlfriend, or spouse). Similar degrees of altruism might not be expected in a sample of younger smokers.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H17\"><span class=\"h2\">Parental smoking and cessation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Parental smoking has a large influence on adolescent smoking. Children whose parents smoke are more likely to smoke, particularly if both parents smoke.</p><p>Conversely, smoking cessation efforts by parents can have an impact on their children's efforts [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-smoking-cessation-in-adolescents/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>]. In one study, adolescents whose parents quit smoking were almost one-third less likely to smoke than those whose parents still smoked [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-smoking-cessation-in-adolescents/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>]. The earlier in the child's life the parent quits, the less likely their children will become smokers. Furthermore, adolescents whose parents quit smoking were twice as likely to quit themselves, compared with those whose parents continued to smoke.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H18\"><span class=\"h2\">Smoking bans</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Several studies have shown that household or workplace smoking bans are associated with reduced rates of smoking among adolescents [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-smoking-cessation-in-adolescents/abstract/14,40-42\" class=\"abstract_t\">14,40-42</a>]. Household smoking bans can be helpful even when parents are smokers. However, a no-smoking ban must be strictly enforced in order to be effective [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-smoking-cessation-in-adolescents/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H19\"><span class=\"h1\">INTERVENTIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There are a growing number of studies examining methods to promote and support adolescent smoking cessation.

(See <a href=\"#H11\" class=\"local\">'Nicotine dependence'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The majority of adolescents who smoke report that they would like to quit, suggesting readiness for intervention. (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Readiness to quit'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Adolescents who smoke frequently cite concerns about future and current health, physical appearance, cost of cigarettes, and athletic performance. Discussing these incentives and barriers to quitting is a valuable first step in counseling. (See <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Fostering motivation'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Adolescents who are not interested in quitting should be given serial brief interventions with messages to increase ambivalence about smoking and motivate them to consider quitting by shifting the <span class=\"nowrap\">pro/con</span> balance. (See <a href=\"#H22\" class=\"local\">'Stages of change'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We recommend that clinicians initiate behavioral support for smoking cessation for all adolescents who smoke (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=2\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1B</a>). This may include a brief intervention by the clinician to discuss the potential advantages of quitting and to problem-solve about how to overcome barriers to quitting. We use the maximal frequency and intensity of intervention that is acceptable to the patient; referral to a teen smoking cessation program <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> to self-help interventions may be helpful. (See <a href=\"#H19\" class=\"local\">'Interventions'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For adolescents with symptoms of nicotine dependence, we suggest nicotine patch or gum therapy in conjunction with a counseling intervention&nbsp;(<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F72703\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef72703 \">table 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F75949\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef75949 \">table 3</a>) (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>).
