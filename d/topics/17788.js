Reactivation may lead to cutaneous, and more commonly, mucocutaneous disease, known as herpes labialis, which occurs along the vermillion border of the lip. In general, symptomatic primary HSV infections (ie, initial HSV infection in a seronegative host) are associated with an increased risk of constitutional symptoms, a longer duration of lesions, and prolonged viral shedding compared with recurrent disease.

Reactivation of HSV-1 occurs in the trigeminal sensory ganglion and may lead to mucocutaneous disease, known as herpes labialis, which occurs along the vermillion border of the lip. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Background'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Antiviral agents for HSV infection include <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acyclovir-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">acyclovir</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=valacyclovir-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">valacyclovir</a>, and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=famciclovir-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">famciclovir</a>; metabolites of these nucleoside derivatives interfere with the synthesis of viral DNA and are all well tolerated. (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Available agents'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Although gingivostomatitis and pharyngitis are self-limiting illnesses, severe infection can lead to significant oral pain and dehydration. Early antiviral therapy within 72 hours of symptom onset leads to earlier healing of lesions, decreased pain, and a shorter duration of fever. (See <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Primary infection'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients with gingivostomatitis or pharyngitis due to primary HSV infection, we recommend oral antiviral therapy rather than no antiviral therapy (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=2\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1B</a>). <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acyclovir-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Acyclovir</a> (400 mg three times daily for 7 to 10 days) is a suitable option for both older children and adults.
