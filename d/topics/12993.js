Goodpasture's syndrome and Goodpasture's disease are often used synonymously to refer to anti-GBM antibody-mediated disease, which typically presents with the syndrome of glomerulonephritis and pulmonary hemorrhage, but may present with glomerulonephritis alone. However, some use the term Goodpasture's syndrome for the clinical constellation of glomerulonephritis and pulmonary hemorrhage, regardless of the underlying pathogenesis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-and-diagnosis-of-anti-gbm-antibody-goodpastures-disease/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. The term Goodpasture's disease is often reserved for those patients with glomerulonephritis, pulmonary hemorrhage, and anti-GBM antibodies.</p><p>The pathogenesis, clinical presentation, and diagnosis of anti-GBM disease will be reviewed here. The treatment of this disorder, and other renal conditions associated with pulmonary hemorrhage, are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-anti-gbm-antibody-goodpastures-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of anti-GBM antibody (Goodpasture's) disease&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=glomerular-disease-evaluation-and-differential-diagnosis-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Glomerular disease: Evaluation and differential diagnosis in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The differential diagnosis of glomerular disease and the approach to the patient with suspected kidney disease are discussed in detail elsewhere.

The development of anti-GBM antibodies may precede the onset of clinical signs and symptoms by many months [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-and-diagnosis-of-anti-gbm-antibody-goodpastures-disease/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. The principal target for the anti-GBM antibodies (which are typically immunoglobulin G (IgG) 1 and 3 but sometimes IgA or IgM) is the NC1 domain of the alpha-3 chain of type IV collagen (alpha-3(IV) chain), one of six genetically distinct gene products found in basement membrane collagen [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-and-diagnosis-of-anti-gbm-antibody-goodpastures-disease/abstract/4,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,5</a>]. The specific conformational epitopes are localized to the globular NC1 domain of the alpha-3(IV) (and alpha-5) chain [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-and-diagnosis-of-anti-gbm-antibody-goodpastures-disease/abstract/6-8\" class=\"abstract_t\">6-8</a>]. These antibodies represent approximately one percent of the circulating IgG in these patients. Anti-GBM antibodies may also be directed against other alpha chains [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-and-diagnosis-of-anti-gbm-antibody-goodpastures-disease/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. Antibodies eluted from the kidneys of patients with Goodpasture's disease were shown to bind most strongly to alpha-3(IV) NC, but the majority also recognized alpha-5(IV) and, to a lesser extent, alpha-4(IV). The kidney bound antibodies recognized the EA and EB epitopes in alpha-3(IV), and the EA epitope in alpha-5(IV). They did not bind native cross-linked alpha-3, 4, 5 hexamers until they were dissociated [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-and-diagnosis-of-anti-gbm-antibody-goodpastures-disease/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>].</p><p>The cDNA for the alpha-3(IV) chain was cloned and its chromosomal location identified (q35-37 region of the long arm of chromosome 2) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-and-diagnosis-of-anti-gbm-antibody-goodpastures-disease/abstract/11,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,12</a>]. Cells transfected with the alpha-3(IV) chain cDNA make the protein that binds anti-GBM antibodies, thereby proving that the alpha-3(IV) chain is the target antigen in this disorder [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-and-diagnosis-of-anti-gbm-antibody-goodpastures-disease/abstract/13,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,14</a>].</p><p>The pathogenicity of anti-GBM antibodies has been demonstrated by passive transfer experiments in which antibodies obtained from the plasma or eluted from the glomeruli of patients with this disorder produced glomerulonephritis when infused into animals. The ability of these antibodies to bind rapidly and tightly to the GBM may underlie the typically fulminant nature of this disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-and-diagnosis-of-anti-gbm-antibody-goodpastures-disease/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>].</p><p>The epitope of type IV collagen specifically recognized by anti-GBM antibodies may correlate with the prognosis of the disease. This was illustrated in a review of 77 patients in whom anti-GBM antibodies recognized multiple epitopes of the alpha-3(IV) chain [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-and-diagnosis-of-anti-gbm-antibody-goodpastures-disease/abstract/16,17\" class=\"abstract_t\">16,17</a>]. Titers of antibodies directed against the N-terminus of the NC1 domain correlated with renal survival. By contrast, renal prognosis was unrelated to the titers of antibodies directed against other areas of the NC1 domain.</p><p>The variable pathogenicity of different anti-GBM antibodies is consistent with a report that antibodies against the alpha-3(IV) chain exist in normal individuals without evidence of renal disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-and-diagnosis-of-anti-gbm-antibody-goodpastures-disease/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. In this report, the anti-GBM titers and avidity were substantially lower and of a different IgG subclass distribution than seen in patients with anti-GBM disease.</p><p>Experimental models and clinical studies suggest that autoreactive T cells may contribute to the development of anti-GBM antibody disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-and-diagnosis-of-anti-gbm-antibody-goodpastures-disease/abstract/7,19-23\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,19-23</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>T cells isolated from patients with this disorder, but not from controls, react against the alpha-3 chain of type IV collagen, the same molecule against which the anti-GBM antibodies are directed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-and-diagnosis-of-anti-gbm-antibody-goodpastures-disease/abstract/7,24\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,24</a>]. Regulatory T cells (CD4+ CD25+) appear to play a role in regulation of the autoimmune response [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-and-diagnosis-of-anti-gbm-antibody-goodpastures-disease/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In experimental autoimmune glomerulonephritis, both Th1 and Th17 cells play a role in crescent formation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-and-diagnosis-of-anti-gbm-antibody-goodpastures-disease/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>].

Similarly, regulatory T cells (CD4+ CD25+), which counter the effects of autoreactive T cells, reduce the severity of glomerular lesions in murine anti-GBM glomerulonephritis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-and-diagnosis-of-anti-gbm-antibody-goodpastures-disease/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A T cell epitope inducing anti-GBM disease in experimental models has been characterized [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-and-diagnosis-of-anti-gbm-antibody-goodpastures-disease/abstract/26,27\" class=\"abstract_t\">26,27</a>]. Mucosal tolerance and protection from disease could be induced by nasal administration of a dominant epitope [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-and-diagnosis-of-anti-gbm-antibody-goodpastures-disease/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. Certain microbial peptides have similarities to this T cell epitope and elicit production of anti-GBM antibody and severe glomerulonephritis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-and-diagnosis-of-anti-gbm-antibody-goodpastures-disease/abstract/29,30\" class=\"abstract_t\">29,30</a>]. Peptides complementary to the dominant peptide in alpha-3(IV) can also induce experimental glomerulonephritis via the <span class=\"nowrap\">idiotype/anti-idiotype</span> network [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-and-diagnosis-of-anti-gbm-antibody-goodpastures-disease/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>].

The presence of potentially autoreactive T cells in normal individuals has been demonstrated by a study showing primary T cell responses to peptides derived from the alpha-3(IV) chain [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-and-diagnosis-of-anti-gbm-antibody-goodpastures-disease/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">EPIDEMIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Acute glomerulonephritis due to anti-GBM antibody disease is rare, estimated to occur in fewer than one case per million population [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-and-diagnosis-of-anti-gbm-antibody-goodpastures-disease/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. A study from Ireland reported a national incidence of 1.64 per million population per year and identified both temporal and spatial clusters of cases, suggesting an environmental trigger for disease onset [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-and-diagnosis-of-anti-gbm-antibody-goodpastures-disease/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>]. In case series published before the 1980s, anti-GBM antibody disease accounted for fewer than 20 percent of cases of rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-and-diagnosis-of-anti-gbm-antibody-goodpastures-disease/abstract/35,36\" class=\"abstract_t\">35,36</a>]. In one review of 88 patients who presented with lung hemorrhage and nephritis, 6 had anti-GBM antibodies alone, 7 had both anti-GBM antibodies and positive ANCA titers, and 48 had positive ANCA titers alone [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-and-diagnosis-of-anti-gbm-antibody-goodpastures-disease/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H11\" class=\"local\">'Antineutrophil cytoplasm antibodies'</a> below.)</p><p>The prevalence among patients presenting for evaluation of potential glomerular disease is lower. Crescentic glomerulonephritis due to anti-GBM antibody disease accounted for fewer than 3 percent of all kidney biopsies done over the course of 10 years in one region of the United States [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-and-diagnosis-of-anti-gbm-antibody-goodpastures-disease/abstract/2,35,38\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,35,38</a>].</p><p>The diagnosis of anti-GBM disease is made in older children and in adults of all ages [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-and-diagnosis-of-anti-gbm-antibody-goodpastures-disease/abstract/2,39\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,39</a>]. However, younger patients (&lt;30 years) are more likely to present with the full constellation of Goodpasture's syndrome (eg, with pulmonary hemorrhage), and older patients (&gt;50 years) with isolated glomerulonephritis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-and-diagnosis-of-anti-gbm-antibody-goodpastures-disease/abstract/39,40\" class=\"abstract_t\">39,40</a>].

In the previously described case series of 67 patients, death or dialysis ensued in over 90 percent of patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-and-diagnosis-of-anti-gbm-antibody-goodpastures-disease/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>]. In another review of 32 patients with Goodpasture's syndrome, 29 progressed to renal failure, most of them in less than six months [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-and-diagnosis-of-anti-gbm-antibody-goodpastures-disease/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>]. Among patients with isolated anti-GBM antibody glomerulonephritis, the prognosis was slightly better: 11 progressed to renal failure within six months, seven progressed to renal failure nine months to 22 years later, and three were alive with normal kidney function one to seven years after diagnosis.</p><p>Prognosis improves following treatment, and recovery is more likely if renal disease is less severe [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-and-diagnosis-of-anti-gbm-antibody-goodpastures-disease/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>]. Since antibody production is short-lived, due to T cell regulatory mechanisms, relapses are rare. These issues, and recurrence after kidney transplantation, are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-anti-gbm-antibody-goodpastures-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of anti-GBM antibody (Goodpasture's) disease&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=anti-gbm-antibody-disease-recurrence-after-transplantation\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Anti-GBM antibody disease: Recurrence after transplantation&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL PRESENTATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The presentation of anti-GBM antibody disease is similar to that of other forms of rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis: relatively acute renal failure with a urinalysis showing proteinuria (which is usually not in the nephrotic range), and a nephritic sediment characterized by dysmorphic red cells, white cells, and red cell and granular casts.</p><p>Pulmonary involvement, generally consisting of alveolar hemorrhage, affects approximately 40 to 60 percent of patients; such patients are considered to have Goodpasture's syndrome. In rare cases, pulmonary disease predominates [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-and-diagnosis-of-anti-gbm-antibody-goodpastures-disease/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>]. Pulmonary manifestations include shortness of breath, cough, sometimes overt hemoptysis, pulmonary infiltrates on chest x-ray, and an increased carbon monoxide diffusing capacity (DLCO) due to the presence of hemoglobin in the alveoli. Iron deficiency anemia, possibly due to prolonged pulmonary bleeding, may be seen. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=the-diffuse-alveolar-hemorrhage-syndromes\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;The diffuse alveolar hemorrhage syndromes&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Patients with and without alveolar hemorrhage appear to have similar autoantibodies against the alpha-3(IV) chain [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-and-diagnosis-of-anti-gbm-antibody-goodpastures-disease/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>], and also to the alpha-5 chain [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-and-diagnosis-of-anti-gbm-antibody-goodpastures-disease/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. The variable presence of pulmonary disease appears to reflect a general lack of access of the circulating anti-GBM antibodies to the alveolar basement membrane, or to the cryptic nature of the antigen Thus, patients with pulmonary involvement often have underlying pulmonary injury due to smoking or, less frequently, infection, cocaine inhalation, or hydrocarbon exposure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-and-diagnosis-of-anti-gbm-antibody-goodpastures-disease/abstract/42-44\" class=\"abstract_t\">42-44</a>].</p><p>Systemic complaints and signs, such as malaise, weight loss, fever, or arthralgia, are typically absent. The presence of such signs suggests that the patient has a concurrent vasculitis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-and-diagnosis-of-anti-gbm-antibody-goodpastures-disease/abstract/45\" class=\"abstract_t\">45</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H11\" class=\"local\">'Antineutrophil cytoplasm antibodies'</a> below.)</p><p>The general limitation of injury to the glomeruli and alveoli appears to reflect the tissue distribution of the alpha-3(IV) chain. In comparison to the more widespread distribution of the alpha-1 and alpha-2 chains of type IV collagen, expression of the alpha-3 chain is highest in the glomerular and alveolar basement membranes, lower in the renal tubular basement membranes, detectable in the choroid plexus, cochlea and retina, and virtually absent in many other tissues, such as the small intestine and placenta [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-and-diagnosis-of-anti-gbm-antibody-goodpastures-disease/abstract/46\" class=\"abstract_t\">46</a>].</p><p>A relatively mild degree of renal involvement may be more common than previously appreciated in patients with anti-GBM antibody disease. A retrospective review from one center in Australia found that 5 of 14 patients (36 percent) with this disorder had hematuria <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> proteinuria, but a normal creatinine clearance or serum concentration of creatinine [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-and-diagnosis-of-anti-gbm-antibody-goodpastures-disease/abstract/47\" class=\"abstract_t\">47</a>]. Other series have found that 15 to 35 percent of patients have &quot;normal&quot; renal function, which is variably defined as a normal urinary sediment or no evidence of a fall in glomerular filtration rate [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-and-diagnosis-of-anti-gbm-antibody-goodpastures-disease/abstract/47\" class=\"abstract_t\">47</a>].</p><p>A rare variant of anti-GBM antibody disease, known as &quot;atypical anti-GBM nephritis,&quot; has been reported in a series of 20 patients who presented with hematuria, proteinuria, and mild renal insufficiency, without pulmonary hemorrhage [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-and-diagnosis-of-anti-gbm-antibody-goodpastures-disease/abstract/48\" class=\"abstract_t\">48</a>]. Renal biopsy in these patients demonstrated bright linear immunoglobulin G (IgG) deposition along the GBM but without features of crescentic glomerulonephritis. Anti-GBM antibodies were not detected with conventional assays. One-year patient and renal survival were 93 and 85 percent, respectively. These atypical cases accounted for approximately 12 percent of anti-GBM patients at the center.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Associated factors</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Anti-GBM antibody disease is most often idiopathic, although it can occasionally follow pulmonary infections or be associated with pulmonary injury. The association with infections may lead to clustering of cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-and-diagnosis-of-anti-gbm-antibody-goodpastures-disease/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p>One hypothesis to explain the association of pulmonary involvement with smoking or pulmonary infections is that ensuing damage reveals an epitope that incites an immune response [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-and-diagnosis-of-anti-gbm-antibody-goodpastures-disease/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Another possibility is that damage to alveolar capillaries that occurs in these settings allows access of existing circulating anti-GBM antibodies to antigen in the alveolar basement membrane. Isolated cases of anti-GBM disease with pulmonary hemorrhage, but without renal involvement, have been reported. Damage to the GBM has been proposed as an explanation for the association of anti-GBM renal disease with urinary tract obstruction and lithotripsy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-and-diagnosis-of-anti-gbm-antibody-goodpastures-disease/abstract/1,49\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,49</a>]. Anti-GBM disease is also commonly associated with primary systemic vasculitis (see below) and less commonly occurs on a background of membranous glomerulopathy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-and-diagnosis-of-anti-gbm-antibody-goodpastures-disease/abstract/50\" class=\"abstract_t\">50</a>].</p><p>One interesting setting in which this disorder can occur is 5 to 10 percent of renal transplants in patients with underlying hereditary nephritis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-and-diagnosis-of-anti-gbm-antibody-goodpastures-disease/abstract/51\" class=\"abstract_t\">51</a>]. These patients most commonly have an abnormality in the alpha-5 chain of type IV collagen, although alpha-3 and alpha-4 chain abnormalities may occur. This leads to defective organization of the alpha-5, -4 and -3 collagen chains in the basement membrane and altered Goodpasture antigen in the alpha-3 chain, so it is not recognized by anti-GBM antibodies. By comparison, the Goodpasture antigen is normal in the donor kidney, potentially initiating an immune response against this previously &quot;unseen&quot; antigen in the transplanted kidney [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-and-diagnosis-of-anti-gbm-antibody-goodpastures-disease/abstract/51\" class=\"abstract_t\">51</a>]. The alloantibody produced in X-linked Alport post-transplantation nephritis, however, recognizes a different epitope than the autoantibody in Goodpasture's disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-and-diagnosis-of-anti-gbm-antibody-goodpastures-disease/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>].

Patients with HLA-DR15 and DR4 appear to be at increased risk, while those with DR1 and DR7 are at lesser risk [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-and-diagnosis-of-anti-gbm-antibody-goodpastures-disease/abstract/52\" class=\"abstract_t\">52</a>]. The association with DR15 has been confirmed in Chinese [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-and-diagnosis-of-anti-gbm-antibody-goodpastures-disease/abstract/53\" class=\"abstract_t\">53</a>] and Japanese patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-and-diagnosis-of-anti-gbm-antibody-goodpastures-disease/abstract/54\" class=\"abstract_t\">54</a>]. More specific molecular analysis of DR beta chains has found that a particular six amino acid motif common to DRw15 and DR4 may confer disease susceptibility [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-and-diagnosis-of-anti-gbm-antibody-goodpastures-disease/abstract/55\" class=\"abstract_t\">55</a>]. This motif is not seen in DR1 and is uncommon in blacks, who also have a lower incidence of anti-GBM antibody disease. One experimental study suggests that the protective effect of DR1 is associated with a shift in the phenotype of alpha3(IV) chain<sub>135-145</sub>-specific CD4+ T cells from a proinflammatory to a tolerogenic phenotype [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-and-diagnosis-of-anti-gbm-antibody-goodpastures-disease/abstract/56\" class=\"abstract_t\">56</a>].</p><p>The importance of genetic factors in determining the development of anti-GBM antibody disease is supported by findings in rodent models. In mice immunized with alpha-3(IV) NC1, the emergence of crescentic glomerulonephritis and lung hemorrhage was restricted to mice with MHC haplotypes H-2s, b, or d [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-and-diagnosis-of-anti-gbm-antibody-goodpastures-disease/abstract/57\" class=\"abstract_t\">57</a>]. The nephritogenic response in H-2s maps more specifically to the <span class=\"nowrap\">Ab/Aa</span> region. Organ inflammation was also associated with the emergence of an <span class=\"nowrap\">IL-12/Th1-like</span> T cell phenotype, a finding consistent with a role for T cells as mentioned above. In rats with experimental anti-GBM glomerulonephritis, susceptibility was determined by copy number variation in the Fcgr3 gene [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-and-diagnosis-of-anti-gbm-antibody-goodpastures-disease/abstract/58\" class=\"abstract_t\">58</a>], and by expression of the AP-1 transcription factor JunD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-and-diagnosis-of-anti-gbm-antibody-goodpastures-disease/abstract/59\" class=\"abstract_t\">59</a>]. Studies in congenic rats showed that both of these genetic loci have effects on susceptibility by modulating macrophage activity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-and-diagnosis-of-anti-gbm-antibody-goodpastures-disease/abstract/60\" class=\"abstract_t\">60</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h1\">DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The presence of anti-GBM antibody disease should be suspected in any patient with acute glomerulonephritis, particularly if accompanied by rapid progression <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> pulmonary (alveolar) hemorrhage. Pulmonary hemorrhage can also be seen with other acute nephritides due to pulmonary edema, or to lung involvement in ANCA positive and other forms of systemic vasculitis, and lupus [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-and-diagnosis-of-anti-gbm-antibody-goodpastures-disease/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>]. In one report of 45 such patients, eight had anti-GBM antibody disease, while 25 had a systemic vasculitis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-and-diagnosis-of-anti-gbm-antibody-goodpastures-disease/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>].

Renal biopsy should be performed, unless there is a contraindication, because the accuracy of serologic assays is variable. In addition, renal biopsy provides important information regarding the activity and chronicity of renal involvement that may help guide therapy.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h2\">Renal biopsy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Light microscopy usually shows crescentic glomerulonephritis (although milder cases do occur), whereas immunofluorescence microscopy demonstrates the virtually pathognomonic finding of linear deposition of immunoglobulin G (IgG) along the glomerular capillaries and occasionally the distal tubules (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEPH%2F68861%7ENEPH%2F76472%7ENEPH%2F63060%7ENEPH%2F57096%7ENEPH%2F78020\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef68861 graphicRef76472 graphicRef63060 graphicRef57096 graphicRef78020 \">picture 1A-E</a>). In rare cases, the antibody may be IgA or IgM [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-and-diagnosis-of-anti-gbm-antibody-goodpastures-disease/abstract/61\" class=\"abstract_t\">61</a>].</p><p>In some cases, the tubular staining reflects distinct circulating anti-tubular basement membrane (TBM) antibodies. The observation that the associated tubulointerstitial disease (interstitial infiltrate and fibrosis, tubular atrophy) is more severe in patients with anti-TBM antibodies is consistent with these antibodies being pathogenetically important [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-and-diagnosis-of-anti-gbm-antibody-goodpastures-disease/abstract/62\" class=\"abstract_t\">62</a>]. However, alpha-3(IV) NC1 is present in a proportion of tubules (distal), so tubular deposits may reflect increased access of anti-GBM antibody to the TBM.</p><p>There are two other disorders in which linear IgG staining can be seen in the glomeruli: diabetic nephropathy and fibrillary glomerulonephritis. In the former and perhaps in the latter, the IgG is nonspecifically absorbed onto the highly permeable glomerular capillary wall and onto the fibrils, respectively. Staining is rarely as strong as with anti-GBM disease (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=glomerular-diseases-due-to-nonamyloid-fibrillar-deposits\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Glomerular diseases due to nonamyloid fibrillar deposits&quot;</a>). In diabetic nephropathy, there is also linear deposition of albumin and other plasma proteins [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-and-diagnosis-of-anti-gbm-antibody-goodpastures-disease/abstract/63\" class=\"abstract_t\">63</a>].</p><p>Diabetic nephropathy and fibrillary glomerulonephritis can be easily distinguished from anti-GBM disease on both clinical and histopathologic grounds. Circulating anti-GBM antibodies are absent in both disorders, and crescents are not seen in diabetic nephropathy. The history of diabetes, the finding of diabetic glomerulosclerosis on light microscopy, and, in fibrillary glomerulonephritis, the presence of the characteristic fibrils on electron microscopy are also helpful.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h2\">Serologic testing</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The diagnosis can usually be established rapidly (particularly when biopsy cannot be performed or will be delayed), either by indirect immunofluorescence or by serum assay for anti-GBM antibodies using a direct enzyme-linked immunoassay (ELISA) with purified or semi-purified antigens. Neither method is completely reliable; thus, a renal biopsy to confirm the diagnosis is recommended unless contraindicated.</p><p>Indirect immunofluorescence is rarely performed and requires an experienced renal pathologist. This test involves incubation of the patient's serum with normal renal tissue. Fluorescein-labeled anti-human IgG is then added to see whether IgG deposition has occurred, and the results are compared with those obtained with normal serum. The test has a high false negative rate, possibly as high as 40 percent. However, if performed appropriately and in the proper clinical setting (eg, severe acute glomerulonephritis), a positive test is probably diagnostic, although rigorous studies have not been performed.</p><p>A more common approach is the detection of anti-GBM antibodies in serum using a direct enzyme-linked immunoassay (ELISA); the specificity of the antibody can be confirmed by Western blot [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-and-diagnosis-of-anti-gbm-antibody-goodpastures-disease/abstract/64\" class=\"abstract_t\">64</a>]. High antibody titers are usually found in those with rapidly progressive disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-and-diagnosis-of-anti-gbm-antibody-goodpastures-disease/abstract/65,66\" class=\"abstract_t\">65,66</a>]. The sensitivity varies depending upon the commercial kit used, ranging from 63 to nearly 100 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-and-diagnosis-of-anti-gbm-antibody-goodpastures-disease/abstract/66,67\" class=\"abstract_t\">66,67</a>]. False negative results may occur in those with low antibody titers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-and-diagnosis-of-anti-gbm-antibody-goodpastures-disease/abstract/65\" class=\"abstract_t\">65</a>] and in some patients with Alport syndrome who develop posttransplant anti-GBM disease, with antibodies directed against the alpha-5(IV) chain [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-and-diagnosis-of-anti-gbm-antibody-goodpastures-disease/abstract/68\" class=\"abstract_t\">68</a>]. As mentioned above, circulating anti-GBM antibodies are not detected in patients with the rare variant of &quot;atypical anti-GBM nephritis.&quot; (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=genetics-pathogenesis-and-pathology-of-alport-syndrome-hereditary-nephritis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Genetics, pathogenesis, and pathology of Alport syndrome (hereditary nephritis)&quot;</a> and <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Clinical presentation'</a> above.)</p><p>False positive results occasionally occur with commercial ELISA assays that do not use purified Goodpasture antigen [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-and-diagnosis-of-anti-gbm-antibody-goodpastures-disease/abstract/64,66,69\" class=\"abstract_t\">64,66,69</a>]. ELISA assays for the detection of anti-GBM antibodies that use native or recombinant human alpha-3(IV) antigen substrates are much more sensitive and specific, with reported sensitivity of 95 to 100 percent and specificity of 91 to 100 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-and-diagnosis-of-anti-gbm-antibody-goodpastures-disease/abstract/67\" class=\"abstract_t\">67</a>].</p><p>An alternative is Western blot screening for antibody against the human Goodpasture antigen (alpha-3(IV) NC1) and, as controls, other human alpha chain proteins. Eliminating false positive results is particularly important if renal biopsy confirmation is not available. The patient's a priori probability of having the disease based upon clinical grounds must be strongly considered when interpreting the results of serologic tests.</p><p>One case report provides an example in which commercial tests inaccurately suggested that a patient had anti-GBM antibodies, which was clarified using recombinant human alpha-3(IV) NC1 proteins [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-and-diagnosis-of-anti-gbm-antibody-goodpastures-disease/abstract/69\" class=\"abstract_t\">69</a>]. A patient with slowly progressive dyspnea, hematuria, and proteinuria had positive circulating anti-GBM antibodies as detected by standard testing and, on renal biopsy, trace linear IgG deposits along the GBM. Repeat testing using standard commercial assays and recombinant human alpha-3(IV) NC1 demonstrated that the patient had antibodies against alpha-2(IV) NC1 and not to the Goodpasture antigen alpha-3(IV) NC1. When viewed in combination with the atypical clinical and histologic findings, the positive commercial tests were probably detecting nonspecific cross-reactivity to alpha-3(IV) NC1, and the alpha-2(IV) NC1 antibodies were nonpathogenic bystanders.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h2\">Antineutrophil cytoplasm antibodies</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients with acute glomerulonephritis with or without pulmonary hemorrhage also may have granulomatosis with polyangiitis (Wegener's), or microscopic polyangiitis. Thus, the serum should be tested for antineutrophil cytoplasm antibodies (ANCA), as well as anti-GBM antibodies. Anti-GBM disease and systemic vasculitis not only have similar clinical manifestations, but between 10 and 50 percent of patients with anti-GBM antibody disease also test positively for ANCA (almost always anti-myeloperoxidase, or MPO-ANCA) at the time of diagnosis and may have signs of a systemic vasculitis or a marked systemic inflammatory response [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-and-diagnosis-of-anti-gbm-antibody-goodpastures-disease/abstract/70-72\" class=\"abstract_t\">70-72</a>].</p><p>Low levels of ANCA may be detectable years before the production of anti-GBM antibodies and the onset of clinical symptoms. This was shown by an analysis of stored serum samples that had been obtained at the time of enlistment and every other year thereafter from 30 US military personnel who subsequently developed anti-GBM disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-and-diagnosis-of-anti-gbm-antibody-goodpastures-disease/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Patients who were diagnosed with anti-GBM disease and healthy controls were identified from the military database and serum samples obtained from the Department of Defense Stored Serum Repository. Compared with matching controls, a greater number of patients with anti-GBM disease had anti-proteinase 3 (PR3-ANCA) and anti-myeloperoxidase (MPO-ANCA) levels detected in multiple serum samples that had been obtained in the years preceding the onset of disease (82 versus 14 percent in controls for PR3-ANCA, and 73 versus 27 percent in controls for MPO-ANCA). In all cases, ANCA were detected in earlier samples than anti-GBM antibodies, which were detected months, but not years, prior to the onset of clinical symptoms. These data implicate ANCA in disease pathogenesis though the mechanism remains unknown.</p><p>Even if the patient was negative for ANCA on initial testing, ANCA serology should be repeated if there are signs of recurrent disease. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-spectrum-of-antineutrophil-cytoplasmic-autoantibodies\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical spectrum of antineutrophil cytoplasmic autoantibodies&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The anti-GBM antibodies in patients who also have ANCA (double-positive) have the same antigen specificity as those in patients with anti-GBM antibody disease alone [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-and-diagnosis-of-anti-gbm-antibody-goodpastures-disease/abstract/73\" class=\"abstract_t\">73</a>]. However, a single center Chinese study found that double-positive patients may have lower levels but a broader spectrum of anti-GBM antibodies compared with those with anti-GBM antibodies alone [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-and-diagnosis-of-anti-gbm-antibody-goodpastures-disease/abstract/74\" class=\"abstract_t\">74</a>]. In addition, ANCA positive patients may develop a relapse of systemic vasculitis.</p><p>The detection of ANCA is clinically relevant, as these patients may be more likely to have treatable disease than those who have only anti-GBM antibodies. However, larger series suggest that the initial outcome is similar to those with anti-GBM disease alone [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-and-diagnosis-of-anti-gbm-antibody-goodpastures-disease/abstract/71,72,75\" class=\"abstract_t\">71,72,75</a>].
