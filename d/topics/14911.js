The most common problems are:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Constipation &ndash; This means the child's bowel movements:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Are too hard</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Are difficult to get out</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Happen fewer than 3 times a week</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Diarrhea &ndash; This means the child&rsquo;s bowel movements:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Are watery or runny</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Happen more than 3 times a day</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Problems with the brain or spinal cord &ndash; The spinal cord is the highway of nerves that connects the brain to the rest of the body. It runs through the spine (also called the backbone). Problems with the brain or spinal cord weaken the muscles near the rectum. Conditions that can lead to rectal prolapse include:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Spina bifida &ndash; This condition happens when a baby's spine does not grow normally before birth.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Brain and spinal cord injuries &ndash; These are usually caused by bad car crashes or falls.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Cystic fibrosis &ndash; This disease causes thick mucus and other fluids to build up and clog different parts of the body. Children with cystic fibrosis can have frequent lung infections. They also can have large, bulky bowel movements.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9656415\"><span class=\"h1\">What are the symptoms of rectal prolapse in children?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The main symptom is bright red tissue sticking out of the anus. The tissue might have mucus or blood. Rectal prolapse is not usually painful but can be uncomfortable. The tissue might stay outside the anus or move back inside the body.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9656430\"><span class=\"h1\">Is there a test for rectal prolapse?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>No. But your child's doctor or nurse should be able to tell if your child has the condition by doing an exam. If the tissue has moved back inside your child's body, you can describe the tissue to the doctor. This can help the doctor know if the child has rectal prolapse.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9656445\"><span class=\"h1\">How is rectal prolapse treated?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The doctor will push the rectal tissue back into the child's anus with a gloved finger. Some children need medicines to make them relaxed and sleepy before the doctor does this. The doctor can also teach parents how to push the tissue back if it comes out again.</p><p>If this treatment does not work or the problem keeps coming back, the child might need surgery.</p><p>Other treatments can help prevent rectal prolapse from happening again. The treatment depends on what caused the prolapse the first time.</p><p>A child who is constipated and has rectal prolapse should:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Eat a diet that has lots of fruits and vegetables</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Sit on the toilet for 5 or 10 minutes after meals, if he or she is potty trained. Parents can give rewards just for sitting there.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Stop potty training for a while, if he or she is in the middle of potty training</p><p/><p>Your child's doctor might also give your child medicines that soften bowel movements, such as PEG (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=polyethylene-glycol-3350-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">polyethylene glycol 3350</a>, sample brand name MiraLAX).</p><p>Children with diarrhea need treatment for the cause of the diarrhea. Most of the time, diarrhea is caused by an infection or is a side effect from a medicine.</p><p>Children with rectal prolapse who do not have an obvious cause should be tested for cystic fibrosis. Children who already have cystic fibrosis can take medicines called &quot;pancreatic enzymes.&quot; These help make the child's bowel movements more regular.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9656460\"><span class=\"h1\">More on this topic</span></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=constipation-in-children-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Constipation in children (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=diarrhea-in-children-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Diarrhea in children (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=cystic-fibrosis-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Cystic fibrosis (The Basics)</a></p></div><div id=\"reviewProcess\"><span>All topics are updated as new evidence becomes available and our <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/home/editorial-policy\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"policy policy_editorialpolicy\">peer review process</a> is complete.</span></div><div id=\"topicRetrievedDate\"><span class=\"emphasis\">This topic retrieved from UpToDate on: </span>Apr 03, 2018.</div><div id=\"disclaimer\">The content on the UpToDate website is not intended nor recommended as a substitute for medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.
