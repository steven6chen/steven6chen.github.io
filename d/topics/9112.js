It is reasonable to proceed directly to a therapeutic trial in a diabetic patient with suspected gastroparesis who has typical clinical features, in whom intestinal obstruction has been ruled out and other common causes of upper gastrointestinal symptoms have been considered and in whom other features of diabetic microvascular disease are present.</p><p>If the patient responds to treatment, this confirms the diagnosis. It is usually helpful to recommend a diet of multiple small meals, soft solids, and low fat without undigestible fiber to maintain nutrition until the pharmacologic treatment starts to work, a process that may take several days to several weeks.</p><p>Several tests are recommended for the evaluation of the patient suspected of having diabetic gastroparesis, including radionuclide gastric emptying studies, radiolabeled breath tests, and wireless motility capsules. None of these tests is sufficiently sensitive or specific to be reliable. The availability and use of these procedures vary from one institution to another, although a consensus recommendation has been published [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/interactive-diabetes-case-13-deterioration-of-metabolic-control-in-a-59-year-old-man-with-type-2-diabetes-complicated-by-retinopathy-nephropathy-and-neuropathy-c2/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. The findings on the radionuclide gastric emptying studies often do not correlate with the presence, absence, or severity of symptoms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/interactive-diabetes-case-13-deterioration-of-metabolic-control-in-a-59-year-old-man-with-type-2-diabetes-complicated-by-retinopathy-nephropathy-and-neuropathy-c2/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p>In patients with normal renal function, one would ordinarily use a <a href=\"topic.htm?path=metoclopramide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">metoclopramide</a> dose of 10 mg by mouth four times a day (before meals and at bedtime). The patient under consideration has renal insufficiency. His estimated creatinine clearance based on his serum creatinine level, height, and weight is 28.5 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/minute</span>. At a creatinine clearance of &lt;40 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/min,</span> 50 percent of the usual metoclopramide dose should be used.</p><p>Evaluation and management of this patient is discussed in the comment card.
