Cesarean delivery is scheduled earlier in gestation than for previa alone and preoperative preparation includes planning for cesarean-hysterectomy (which is usually required) and interventions that will reduce the risk of massive hemorrhage (which is more common than with previa alone). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-the-placenta-accreta-spectrum-placenta-accreta-increta-and-percreta\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of the placenta accreta spectrum (placenta accreta, increta, and percreta)&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1692802564\"><span class=\"h2\">Reducing risk of bleeding</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>For an individual patient, it is not possible to accurately predict whether spontaneous bleeding will occur, nor the gestational age, volume, or frequency of bleeding. Sonographic features reported to be associated with a higher likelihood of antepartum bleeding are described separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=placenta-previa-epidemiology-clinical-features-diagnosis-morbidity-and-mortality#H524431\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Placenta previa: Epidemiology, clinical features, diagnosis, morbidity and mortality&quot;, section on 'Bleeding'</a>.)</p><p>We avoid digital cervical examination. It is clear from anecdotal experience that palpation of placenta previa through a partially dilated cervix can result in severe hemorrhage.</p><p>We advise women with placenta previa after 20 weeks of gestation (earlier if they have experienced vaginal bleeding) to avoid any sexual activity that may lead to orgasm. The rationale is that this activity, especially if orgasm occurs, may be associated with transient uterine contractions, which, in turn, may provoke bleeding. Additionally, there is concern that vaginal intercourse (or putting any object deep into the vagina) might cause direct trauma to the previa, resulting in bleeding. There are no published studies that either support or refute this recommendation. However, as discussed above, palpation of placenta previa through a partially dilated cervix can result in severe hemorrhage.</p><p>We also advise asymptomatic women to avoid moderate and strenuous exercise, heavy lifting (eg, more than about 20 pounds), or standing for prolonged periods of time (eg, &gt;4 hours). This degree of activity has been linked to small but statistical increases in preterm birth in a meta-analysis of observational studies (median odds ratios 1.10 to 1.20) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/placenta-previa-management/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p>Women should also be advised to seek immediate medical attention if contractions or vaginal bleeding occur, given the potential for severe bleeding and need for emergency cesarean delivery.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1145156119\"><span class=\"h2\">Screening for growth restriction</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Pregnancies complicated by placenta previa are at no or minimally increased risk of intrauterine growth restriction. There is no evidence that specifically monitoring fetal growth with serial ultrasound examinations is useful; however, this information is generally available since fetal growth is estimated whenever ultrasound examination is performed for assessment of placental position.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1871949227\"><span class=\"h2\">Inpatient versus outpatient maternal monitoring</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>It is unclear whether asymptomatic women with placenta previa benefit from hospitalization. Findings from observational studies suggest that women who have not experienced any antepartum bleeding are at low risk of sudden hemorrhage requiring an emergency cesarean delivery for control of bleeding [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/placenta-previa-management/abstract/3-6\" class=\"abstract_t\">3-6</a>]. These women can generally be managed on an outpatient basis until vaginal bleeding occurs or until admission for scheduled cesarean birth.</p><p>However, patient-specific risk factors need to be taken into account. Such factors may include short cervical length on ultrasound examination (eg, we discuss increased risk of preterm labor if &le;25 mm and we consider hospitalization if &le;15 mm), rapid cervical shortening (eg, &gt;10 mm over a one- to two-week period on transvaginal ultrasound) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/placenta-previa-management/abstract/7-9\" class=\"abstract_t\">7-9</a>], inability to get to the hospital promptly (within about 20 minutes), and lack of home support in case of an emergency. These parameters, which are based on personal <span class=\"nowrap\">experience/expert</span> opinion and data from studies on risk of preterm birth across the spectrum of cervical length, represent our approach and should not be considered a standard of care. The Society for Maternal-Fetal Medicine does not recommend routine cervical length screening in the late preterm period for women with placenta previa [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/placenta-previa-management/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3570594046\"><span class=\"h2\">Antenatal corticosteroids</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>We administer an initial course of antenatal corticosteroids to asymptomatic women 48 hours before a cesarean delivery scheduled at less than 37 weeks of gestation. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=antenatal-corticosteroid-therapy-for-reduction-of-neonatal-respiratory-morbidity-and-mortality-from-preterm-delivery#H2439085065\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Antenatal corticosteroid therapy for reduction of neonatal respiratory morbidity and mortality from preterm delivery&quot;, section on 'Gestational age at administration'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4766607\"><span class=\"h2\">Timing of delivery</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>We perform a cesarean delivery at 36+0<sup> </sup>to 37+6<sup> </sup>weeks in pregnancies with uncomplicated placenta previa, without documentation of fetal lung maturity by amniocentesis, in agreement with recommendations from a workshop held by the Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development and the Society for Maternal-Fetal Medicine [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/placenta-previa-management/abstract/10-12\" class=\"abstract_t\">10-12</a>]. Uncomplicated placenta previa is defined as without fetal growth restriction, superimposed preeclampsia, and or other issues that take precedent for delivery decision-making. Review of available evidence suggests that the risks associated with continuing the pregnancy (severe bleeding, emergency unscheduled delivery) are greater than the risks associated with prematurity at this gestational age range [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/placenta-previa-management/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>].

At a minimum, we obtain a complete blood count, send blood for type and antibody screen, and notify the blood bank that a patient with placenta previa has been admitted. We cross-match two to four units of packed red blood cells when bleeding is heavy or increasing, delivery is likely for any reason, or we anticipate difficulty in procuring compatible blood.</p><p>Evaluation for coagulopathy (fibrinogen level, activated partial thromboplastin time, prothrombin time) is indicated in patients suspected of coexistent abruption or with heavy blood loss resulting in hemodynamic instability. A crude test for identifying patients with impaired clotting function can be performed at the bedside with a clot observation test. Prolonged oozing from needle puncture sites also suggests coagulopathy. Thromboelastography (TEG) or rotational thromboelastometry (ROTEM)-based transfusion algorithms may be helpful, if available. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=postpartum-hemorrhage-medical-and-minimally-invasive-management#H80107638\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Postpartum hemorrhage: Medical and minimally invasive management&quot;, section on 'Postvaginal delivery'</a>.)</p><p>Fetal bleeding can occur if disruption of fetal vessels in placental villi, vasa previa, or a velamentous cord occurs, and can be detected by performing a Kleihauer-Betke or flow cytometry test on a specimen of vaginal blood. However, fetal bleeding from disruption of one of these sources is rare and typically results in fetal demise or a nonreassuring fetal heart rate tracing necessitating emergency delivery. Therefore, it is unlikely that results of the test will impact management.

It is important to not get behind in replacement of blood products.</p><p>Acute hemorrhage may not be associated with an immediate reduction in either blood pressure or hematocrit in an otherwise healthy young woman. Thus, a low threshold for ordering a transfusion should be maintained in patients with antepartum hemorrhage once the diagnosis of placenta previa is made. A failure to rapidly correct tachycardia or hypotension with a normal saline bolus, or documentation of a hemoglobin value &lt;10 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/dL</span> should prompt immediate transfusion.</p><p>Types and actions of blood replacement products are shown in the table (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F53854\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef53854 \">table 1</a>).

The goal of transfusion is a final hemoglobin value &gt;10 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/dL</span>. If the patient fails to stabilize, a massive transfusion protocol should be initiated. If a massive transfusion protocol is not available, type O Rh-negative blood should be administered until type-specific or typed and cross-matched blood is available.</p><p>If the patient continues to bleed, we suggest using the same blood product transfusion ratios used for patients with severe hemorrhage of other etiologies: a 1:1:1 ratio of PRBC:fresh frozen plasma:platelets. Point-of care testing with TEG or ROTEM, if available, can be used to guide blood product replacement.

If the compression sutures are placed first, then they will have to be removed in order to place a balloon.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3314819015\"><span class=\"h4\">Intrauterine balloon tamponade</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Intrauterine balloon tamponade is a fast and often effective procedure for control of hemorrhage in patients who have not responded to drug therapy or focal placental site suture ligation. Hemostasis was achieved in 88 percent of cases in two small studies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/placenta-previa-management/abstract/61,62\" class=\"abstract_t\">61,62</a>]. In a trial of 13 patients with placenta previa randomly assigned to insertion of a balloon or hemostatic square sutures for control of intractable postpartum bleeding, operative time and amount of intraoperative bleeding were lower in the balloon group (time: 63 versus 78 minutes; intraoperative bleeding: 1520 versus 1946 mL) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/placenta-previa-management/abstract/63\" class=\"abstract_t\">63</a>].</p><p>The stem of a balloon catheter can be passes through the uterine incision, through the cervical os, and then into the vagina; an assistant then pulls the end of the catheter out of the introitus. If it is difficult to pass the catheter through the cervical os, an assistant can pass the tip of a small forceps from the vagina through the cervical os to the uterine incision [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/placenta-previa-management/abstract/64\" class=\"abstract_t\">64</a>]. The surgeon then places the stem of the catheter into the open tip so the assistant can pull it into the vagina while the surgeon places the balloon end in an appropriate place within the uterine cavity. The balloon can be left deflated or inflated with 50 to 100&nbsp;mL sterile saline to reduce the risk of puncture when the hysterotomy incision is closed. After the uterine incision is closed, the assistant inflates the balloon to its maximum volume with sterile fluid (eg, 500 mL for the Bakri tamponade balloon catheter and BT-Cath, 750 mL for the ebb Complete Tamponade System) while the surgeon inspects the uterus from above. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=intrauterine-balloon-tamponade-for-control-of-postpartum-hemorrhage\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Intrauterine balloon tamponade for control of postpartum hemorrhage&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1285853240\"><span class=\"h4\">Uterine compression sutures</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>If balloon tamponade is ineffective, the balloon can be deflated and a B-Lynch uterine compression suture is applied (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F71907\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef71907 \">figure 3</a>). The hysterotomy site is then closed, the uterus replaced in the pelvis (if previously exteriorized), and the balloon is reinflated, thereby applying pressure to both the outer and inner surfaces of the myometrium. [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/placenta-previa-management/abstract/64,65\" class=\"abstract_t\">64,65</a>]. It is important to observe the myometrium and stop instilling fluid before undue blanching occurs at the compression suture sites, which might lead to rupture or uterine necrosis. It is also important to observe for vaginal bleeding to see if hemorrhage has been controlled.

We believe embolization is preferable to surgical internal iliac artery ligation.

Ideally, it should be performed before severe hypovolemia, tissue hypoxia, hypothermia, electrolyte abnormalities, and acidosis have developed, which further compromise the patient's status.

The fetal head may tamponade the adjacent placenta, thus preventing hemorrhage.</p><p>One of the larger retrospective studies that looked at the outcome of this specific group of pregnancies reported vaginal birth in <span class=\"nowrap\">6/24</span> (25 percent) women with a cervix-to-placenta distance of 1 to 10 mm and in <span class=\"nowrap\">20/29</span> (69 percent) women with cervix-to-placenta distance of 11 to 20 mm [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/placenta-previa-management/abstract/66\" class=\"abstract_t\">66</a>]. In another study of 14 women with singleton pregnancies and a placental edge between 11 and 20 mm from the internal cervical os, 13 had an uncomplicated vaginal delivery, and 1 required emergency cesarean delivery for intrapartum bleeding [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/placenta-previa-management/abstract/67\" class=\"abstract_t\">67</a>].</p><p>Although a variety of factors influence the decision to perform cesarean delivery, these data support allowing a trial of labor in pregnancies in which the placenta is more than 10 mm from the internal os. If this distance is &le;10 mm, these pregnancies are at high risk of intrapartum hemorrhage; therefore, we suggest scheduled cesarean delivery to minimize the risk of emergency delivery and need for transfusion.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H33\"><span class=\"h1\">PREGNANCY TERMINATION IN WOMEN WITH PLACENTA PREVIA</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Clinicians should discuss with patients the various options for pregnancy termination in the setting of placenta previa (eg, hysterotomy, dilation and evacuation, use of abortifacient) and document the discussion in the medical record. The presence of a placenta previa does not preclude second trimester pregnancy termination by standard techniques, although data are limited to a few studies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/placenta-previa-management/abstract/68-71\" class=\"abstract_t\">68-71</a>].</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>One series of 131 consecutive women undergoing elective pregnancy termination by dilation and evacuation (D&amp;E) after laminaria placement at 13 to 24 weeks of gestation compared the outcome of those with (n = 23) and without placenta previa based upon an ultrasound examination before the procedure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/placenta-previa-management/abstract/68\" class=\"abstract_t\">68</a>]. Women with a placenta previa had greater intraoperative blood loss (21 mL), but no significant increase in operative time, time to discharge, infection, hemorrhage, or other complications.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The second series consisted of 306 consecutive women undergoing pregnancy termination by D&amp;E at 19 to 24 weeks [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/placenta-previa-management/abstract/69\" class=\"abstract_t\">69</a>]. An ultrasound diagnosis of complete previa was made in eight patients. None of these women had excessive bleeding with laminaria insertion or required blood transfusion due to procedure related hemorrhage. Operative time was comparable to women without complete previa.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The third series included 15 second- or third-trimester terminations of pregnancy by administration of systemic abortifacients in women with complete previa [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/placenta-previa-management/abstract/70\" class=\"abstract_t\">70</a>]. Preinduction feticide was performed 2 to 14 days prior to the procedure. Four of nine women who underwent labor induction without previous feticide required blood transfusions and one required hysterectomy; none of the six patients with preinduction feticide required transfusion. The authors concluded that preinduction feticide might help to reduce blood loss in these cases.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The fourth series included 158 women undergoing second trimester termination in whom 11 had placenta previa, 4 underwent D&amp;E and 7 had gemeprost termination [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/placenta-previa-management/abstract/71\" class=\"abstract_t\">71</a>].

Acute hemorrhage may not be associated with an immediate reduction in either blood pressure or hematocrit in an otherwise healthy young woman. Thus, a low threshold for ordering a transfusion should be maintained in patients with antepartum hemorrhage once the diagnosis of placenta previa is made. A failure to rapidly correct tachycardia or hypotension with a normal saline bolus, or documentation of a hemoglobin value &lt;10 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/dL</span> should prompt immediate transfusion.

Indications for emergency cesarean delivery include active labor, refractory life threatening maternal hemorrhage, nonreassuring fetal status, and significant vaginal bleeding after 34 weeks of gestation.

We counsel these patients to avoid excess physical activity, including sexual intercourse, and to call their provider promptly if bleeding or labor occurs. They should be able to return to the hospital quickly if rebleeding occurs and should not have additional pregnancy complications. (See <a href=\"#H11\" class=\"local\">'Expectant management of stable patients after a bleed'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We recommend a course of antenatal corticosteroid therapy for symptomatic patients between 23 and 34 weeks of gestation to enhance fetal pulmonary maturity (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=1\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1A</a>). We would give a first course of steroids (but not a second course) to women whose first bleed is at 34+0 to 36+6 weeks and to asymptomatic women in whom cesarean delivery is planned between 36+0 and 37+6 weeks. We also recommend anti-D <a href=\"topic.htm?path=immune-globulin-intravenous-subcutaneous-and-intramsucular-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">immune globulin</a> for symptomatic Rh(D)-negative women to prevent possible alloimmunization (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=2\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1B</a>). Readministration of anti-D immune globulin is not necessary if delivery or rebleeding occurs within three weeks, unless a large fetomaternal hemorrhage is detected.
