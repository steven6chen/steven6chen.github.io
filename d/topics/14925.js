Most recurrences are thought to represent reinfection rather than relapse, although occasionally a persistent focus can produce relapsing infection. It is useful to try to distinguish clinically between relapse and reinfection, because relapsing infection warrants more extensive urologic evaluation, longer therapy, and, in some cases, surgery.</p><p>However, this distinction is rarely necessary in young healthy women with recurrent UTIs. There is no evidence that recurrent UTI leads to health problems, such as hypertension or renal disease, in the absence of anatomic or functional abnormalities of the urinary tract.</p><p>The epidemiology, pathogenesis, and prevention of recurrent acute uncomplicated cystitis and pyelonephritis in young, healthy non-pregnant women will be reviewed here. These infections are generally caused by the same organisms and share clinical features, diagnostic testing, and treatment regimens with sporadic uncomplicated infection. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acute-uncomplicated-cystitis-in-women\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Acute uncomplicated cystitis in women&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The management of asymptomatic bacteriuria, including in pregnancy, is discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=approach-to-the-adult-with-asymptomatic-bacteriuria\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Approach to the adult with asymptomatic bacteriuria&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">EPIDEMIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Recurrent uncomplicated UTIs are common among young, healthy women even though they generally have anatomically and physiologically normal urinary tracts. In a study of college women with their first UTI, 27 percent experienced at least one culture-confirmed recurrence within the six months following the initial infection and 2.7 percent had a second recurrence during this same time period [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/recurrent-urinary-tract-infection-in-women/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. When the first infection is caused by <em>Escherichia coli</em>, women appear to be more likely to develop a second UTI within six months than those with a first UTI due to another organism [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/recurrent-urinary-tract-infection-in-women/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. In a Finnish study of women ages 17 to 82 who had <em>E. coli</em> cystitis, 44 percent had a recurrence within one year [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/recurrent-urinary-tract-infection-in-women/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Recurrent pyelonephritis in healthy women is very uncommon, but there are no prevalence data available.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">PATHOGENESIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The pathogenesis of recurrent UTI is assumed to be the same as with sporadic infection. Thus, in the normal host, most uropathogens originate in the rectal flora, colonize the periurethral area and urethra, and ascend to the bladder. Increasing evidence suggests that alteration of the normal vaginal flora, especially loss of H2O2-producing lactobacilli, may predispose women to introital colonization with <em>E. coli</em> and to UTI [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/recurrent-urinary-tract-infection-in-women/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].</p><p>Some recurrences of UTI in women due to the same strain may be due to reinfection from a reservoir of pathogens in the epithelium of the bladder which persist following a previous UTI. Intracellular populations of bacteria have been identified in exfoliated cells in urine of women with cystitis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/recurrent-urinary-tract-infection-in-women/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. Further studies are needed to determine whether this pathway causes same-strain recurrent UTI and if so, how it might influence treatment and prophylactic strategies.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Reinfection versus relapse</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A recurrent UTI is classified as a reinfection if the recurrence is caused by a different strain of microorganism than the one responsible for the original infection. However, infecting pathogens frequently persist in the rectum; when a recurrence is due to the same organism, it is often impossible to distinguish between a relapse and reinfection. In clinical practice, a recurrent UTI is arbitrarily defined as a relapse if the infecting strain is the same and the recurrence occurs within two weeks of the completion of treatment for the original infection. By contrast, a recurrent UTI arising more than two weeks after treatment is considered to be a reinfection, even if the infecting pathogen is the same as the original. When a sterile urine culture is documented between the two UTIs in a patient off antibiotics, the recurrence is also classified as a reinfection.</p><p>The vast majority of recurrences of cystitis appear to be reinfections. The initially infecting strain can persist in the fecal flora after elimination from the urinary tract, subsequently recolonizing the introitus and bladder and causing recurrent UTI [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/recurrent-urinary-tract-infection-in-women/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. In fact, long-term prospective studies have demonstrated that <em>E. coli</em> strains are capable of causing recurrent UTI one to three years later, despite appropriate treatment and disappearance of the organism in repeated urine cultures prior to the development of the next infection. However, most recurrences occur in the first three months after the initial infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/recurrent-urinary-tract-infection-in-women/abstract/7,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,8</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Risk factors</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Several host genetic, biologic, and behavioral factors appear to predispose young healthy women to uncomplicated UTI.</p><p>A number of factors also appear to increase the risk of recurrent UTIs.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h3\">Biologic or genetic factors</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Women with recurrent UTI have been shown to have an increased susceptibility to vaginal colonization with uropathogens, even during asymptomatic periods, compared with women without a history of recurrences [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/recurrent-urinary-tract-infection-in-women/abstract/9-13\" class=\"abstract_t\">9-13</a>]. This difference appears to partially result from a greater propensity for uropathogenic coliforms to adhere to the uroepithelial cells of women with a history of recurrent UTIs as opposed to those without recurrent infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/recurrent-urinary-tract-infection-in-women/abstract/14-18\" class=\"abstract_t\">14-18</a>].</p><p>Genetic determinants appear to account for this underlying predisposition in some women. The nonsecretor [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/recurrent-urinary-tract-infection-in-women/abstract/19-21\" class=\"abstract_t\">19-21</a>] and the P1 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/recurrent-urinary-tract-infection-in-women/abstract/22,23\" class=\"abstract_t\">22,23</a>] phenotypes are overrepresented among girls and women with recurrent UTI and recurrent pyelonephritis, respectively. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=bacterial-adherence-and-other-virulence-factors-for-urinary-tract-infection\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Bacterial adherence and other virulence factors for urinary tract infection&quot;</a>.)</p><p>In addition, uroepithelial cells from women who are nonsecretors of ABH blood group antigens show enhanced adherence of uropathogenic <em>E. coli</em> compared with cells from secretors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/recurrent-urinary-tract-infection-in-women/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. The uroepithelial cells of nonsecretors selectively express unique globoseries glycolipid receptors that bind uropathogenic <em>E. coli</em>, which may provide a biochemical explanation for the propensity of nonsecretors to develop recurrent UTI [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/recurrent-urinary-tract-infection-in-women/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. The association between nonsecretor phenotype and recurrent UTI may be less important in women who have other strong risk factors for recurrent UTI, such as spermicide use or frequent sexual intercourse [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/recurrent-urinary-tract-infection-in-women/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].</p><p>The interleukin (IL)-8 receptor, IL-8R or CXCR1, is another factor with genetic variability that may influence the development of UTI. IL-8 is an inflammatory cytokine that promotes neutrophil migration across the infected uroepithelium [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/recurrent-urinary-tract-infection-in-women/abstract/26,27\" class=\"abstract_t\">26,27</a>]. A family study of pyelonephritis-prone children found that 15 percent of 130 relatives of case children but only 3 percent of 101 relatives of controls had a UTI history [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/recurrent-urinary-tract-infection-in-women/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. CXCR1 expression was significantly lower in the pyelonephritis-prone children and their relatives than in control subjects.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h3\">Behavioral risk factors</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Sexual intercourse, diaphragm-spermicide use, and a history of recurrent UTI are strong and independent risk factors for UTI [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/recurrent-urinary-tract-infection-in-women/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. Even spermicide-coated condom use results in an increased risk of UTI [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/recurrent-urinary-tract-infection-in-women/abstract/30,31\" class=\"abstract_t\">30,31</a>]. Recent antimicrobial use, which adversely affects vaginal flora in animals and humans [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/recurrent-urinary-tract-infection-in-women/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>], also is strongly associated with an increased risk of UTI [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/recurrent-urinary-tract-infection-in-women/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>]. However, risk factors specific for recurrent UTI have received relatively less attention. In one large case-control study of women with and without a history of recurrent UTI, the frequency of sexual intercourse was the strongest risk factor for recurrent UTI in a multivariate analysis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/recurrent-urinary-tract-infection-in-women/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>]. Other risk factors identified were:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Spermicide use during the past year</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Having a new sex partner during the past year</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Having a first UTI at or before 15 years of age</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Having a mother with a history of UTIs</p><p/><p>The latter two associations are further evidence that inherited factors may be important in some women with recurrent UTI. No associations were found in this large study or earlier studies between a history of recurrent UTI and pre- and postcoital voiding patterns, frequency of urination, delayed voiding habits, wiping patterns, douching, use of hot tubs, frequent use of pantyhose or tights, or body mass index [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/recurrent-urinary-tract-infection-in-women/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h3\">Pelvic anatomy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Pelvic anatomy may predispose to recurrent UTI in some women, especially those who do not have exogenous risk factors for UTI. In one study of 213 women, 100 with a history of recurrent UTI and 113 controls without this history, perineal anatomic measurements, post-void residual urine volume, and urine voiding characteristics (eg, peak flow rate, time to peak flow) were assessed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/recurrent-urinary-tract-infection-in-women/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>]. The mean distance from the urethra to anus was significantly shorter in cases than in controls (4.8 versus 5.0 cm, p = 0.03). This was most pronounced among non-spermicide users. However, there were no differences between cases and controls in urethral length, post-void urine residual, or urine voiding characteristics.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h3\">Postmenopausal women</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In a case-control study of 149 healthy postmenopausal women with a history of recurrent UTI and 53 controls without a history of UTI, mechanical <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> physiologic factors that affect bladder emptying were found to be strongly associated with recurrent UTIs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/recurrent-urinary-tract-infection-in-women/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>]. These results contrast with the predominantly behavioral risk factors described above for premenopausal women. Three urologic factors were found to be significant factors for recurrent UTI in this study:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Urinary incontinence (41 versus 9 percent for cases and controls, respectively)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Presence of a cystocele (19 versus 0 percent)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Postvoiding residual urine (28 versus 2 percent)</p><p/><p>Multivariate analysis showed the following factors were most strongly associated with recurrent UTI (presence of a cystocele or a postvoiding residual urine were excluded because of low frequency in the controls):</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Urinary incontinence (OR 5.79)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A history of UTI before menopause (OR 4.85)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Nonsecretor status (OR 2.9)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h3\">Virulence determinants of uropathogens</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Certain virulence determinants of uropathogens have been demonstrated to provide a selective advantage for the ability to colonize and cause infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/recurrent-urinary-tract-infection-in-women/abstract/37,38\" class=\"abstract_t\">37,38</a>]. Colonization with P-fimbriated strains of <em>E. coli</em>, for example, is a strong risk factor for acute uncomplicated pyelonephritis. However, it is not clear whether bacterial virulence determinants of strains causing recurrent UTIs differ from those causing sporadic UTIs. It is also not known whether women with recurrent UTI have a propensity for colonization with urovirulent strains compared with women who do not have recurrent UTI.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h1\">PREVENTION STRATEGIES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A number of strategies have been used in an attempt to prevent recurrent UTIs. Although many behavioral approaches have not been adequately tested in studies, patients and providers often hold very strong biases about their effectiveness. It is reasonable to consider such approaches for the prevention of UTI as a way of minimizing antibiotic exposure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/recurrent-urinary-tract-infection-in-women/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h2\">Changes in behavior</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Women with frequent recurrent UTIs can choose a different contraceptive (avoiding spermicides) or attempt other behavior modifications. However, for those who do not wish to change their method of contraception or who do not respond to other behavioral approaches, antimicrobial management should be considered. (See <a href=\"#H17\" class=\"local\">'Antimicrobial prophylaxis'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h3\">Contraception</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Women with recurrent UTI who are sexually active or who use spermicides (particularly in conjunction with diaphragms), should be counseled about the possible association between their infections and sexual intercourse and use of spermicides. Abstinence or a decrease or elimination of the usage of spermicide-containing products would be expected to reduce the risk of UTI.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14\"><span class=\"h3\">Postcoital voiding and liberal fluid intake</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>It is reasonable to suggest to women that early postcoital voiding and more liberal fluid intake to increase the frequency of micturition might be helpful. These have not been shown in controlled studies to be associated with a reduced risk of recurrent UTI but are unlikely to be harmful.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H17\"><span class=\"h2\">Antimicrobial prophylaxis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Antimicrobial prophylaxis has been demonstrated to be highly effective in reducing the risk of recurrent UTI in women [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/recurrent-urinary-tract-infection-in-women/abstract/40,41\" class=\"abstract_t\">40,41</a>]. Prophylaxis has been advocated for women who experience two or more symptomatic UTIs within six months [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/recurrent-urinary-tract-infection-in-women/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>] or three or more over 12 months [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/recurrent-urinary-tract-infection-in-women/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>]. However, the degree of discomfort experienced by the woman from these infections and concerns about antimicrobial resistance are the most important determinant of whether antimicrobial prophylaxis should be tried.</p><p>Continuous prophylaxis, postcoital prophylaxis, and intermittent self-treatment (which is not really a prophylaxis method) have all been demonstrated to be effective in the management of recurrent uncomplicated cystitis. The choice of approach depends upon the frequency and pattern of recurrences and patient preference. Regimens for continuous and post-coital prophylaxis are shown in Tables 1 and 2 (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F80898\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef80898 \">table 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F68989\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef68989 \">table 2</a>). The choice of antibiotic should be based upon the susceptibility patterns of the strains causing the patient's previous UTIs and any history of drug allergies. Before any prophylaxis regimen is initiated, eradication of a previous UTI must be assured by obtaining a negative urine culture one to two weeks after treatment.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H18\"><span class=\"h3\">Continuous</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Numerous studies have demonstrated that continuous prophylaxis decreases recurrences by up to 95 percent compared with placebo or with patients' prior experience [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/recurrent-urinary-tract-infection-in-women/abstract/41,43,44\" class=\"abstract_t\">41,43,44</a>]. A meta-analysis from the Cochrane database evaluated 10 trials involving 430 healthy nonpregnant women with two to three or more UTIs during the previous 12 month period who were treated with continuous or postcoital prophylaxis for 6 to 12 months [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/recurrent-urinary-tract-infection-in-women/abstract/45\" class=\"abstract_t\">45</a>]. The following findings were noted during active prophylaxis:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The range of microbiologic recurrence per patient-year was significantly reduced (0 to 0.9 in the antibiotic group versus 0.8 to 3.6 in the placebo group; relative risk of having one microbiologic recurrence 0.21, 95% CI 0.13-0.33). The number needed to treat (NNT) to prevent one recurrence in one year was 1.85.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Clinical recurrence of UTI per patient-year was also significantly reduced (relative risk 0.15, 95% CI 0.08-0.28). The NNT was 2.2.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Side effects, including vaginal and oral candidiasis and gastrointestinal symptoms, were significantly more common with antibiotic therapy.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>There was no significant difference between continuous daily and postcoital <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ciprofloxacin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ciprofloxacin</a>. (See <a href=\"#H19\" class=\"local\">'Postcoital'</a> below.)</p><p/><p>The review also evaluated the small number of studies that compared different antibiotics, the same antibiotic in different regimens, and antibiotics to other pharmacologic interventions. In the meta-analysis overall, no conclusions could be made with regard to the best antibiotic choice or the optimal duration of prophylaxis (the maximal duration tested was one year), schedule, or doses.</p><p>Most authorities advocate a six-month trial of antibiotics administered nightly, followed by observation for further infection. The choice of six months is based upon observations that UTIs seem to cluster in some women [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/recurrent-urinary-tract-infection-in-women/abstract/7,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,8</a>]. However, it appears that most women revert back to the previous pattern of recurrent infections once prophylaxis is stopped (relative risk for at least one microbiologic recurrence 0.82, 95% CI 0.44 -1.53 in the above meta-analysis) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/recurrent-urinary-tract-infection-in-women/abstract/45\" class=\"abstract_t\">45</a>]. Modification of other risk factors, such as sexual activity or diaphragm-spermicide use, would probably be beneficial in this regard.</p><p>Some authorities advocate prophylaxis for two or more years in women who continue to have symptomatic infections [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/recurrent-urinary-tract-infection-in-women/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>]. Use of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole-co-trimoxazole-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole</a> or other agents for as long as five years has been reported to be effective and well-tolerated [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/recurrent-urinary-tract-infection-in-women/abstract/8,46\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,46</a>]. <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nitrofurantoin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Nitrofurantoin</a> has also been shown to be safe and well-tolerated in long-term (12 months) prophylaxis regimens, although 16 percent of women did not benefit in one study [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/recurrent-urinary-tract-infection-in-women/abstract/47\" class=\"abstract_t\">47</a>]. Of note, there are concerns about toxicity with long term nitrofurantoin use, as discussed below.</p><p>Data on use of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fosfomycin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">fosfomycin</a> for prophylaxis are limited. In one randomized trial of 317 nonpregnant women with a history of recurrent UTIs, administration of fosfomycin (3 g every 10 days for six months) reduced the number of UTIs per patient year (0.14 versus 2.97) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/recurrent-urinary-tract-infection-in-women/abstract/48\" class=\"abstract_t\">48</a>]. The time to first infection recurrence was significantly longer in the fosfomycin group than in the placebo group (38 versus 6 days) and the drug was well tolerated.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H19\"><span class=\"h3\">Postcoital</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Postcoital prophylaxis (a single postcoital dose) may be a more efficient and acceptable method of prevention than continuous prophylaxis in women whose UTIs appear to be temporally related to sexual intercourse. Depending upon the frequency of intercourse, postcoital prophylaxis usually results in receipt of smaller amounts of antimicrobials than continuous prophylaxis.</p><p>In the only placebo-controlled trial, the infection rate was lower in patients receiving postcoital <a href=\"topic.htm?path=trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole-co-trimoxazole-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole</a> (40 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/200</span> mg) compared with placebo (0.3 versus 3.6 per patient-year) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/recurrent-urinary-tract-infection-in-women/abstract/49\" class=\"abstract_t\">49</a>]. Uncontrolled studies suggest a comparable reduction in infection rates with postcoital trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nitrofurantoin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">nitrofurantoin</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cephalexin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cephalexin</a>, and the fluoroquinolones (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F68989\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef68989 \">table 2</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/recurrent-urinary-tract-infection-in-women/abstract/44,50-53\" class=\"abstract_t\">44,50-53</a>]. In a randomized trial, postcoital <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ciprofloxacin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ciprofloxacin</a> was as effective as daily ciprofloxacin in sexually active young women [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/recurrent-urinary-tract-infection-in-women/abstract/54\" class=\"abstract_t\">54</a>].</p><p>Postcoital prophylaxis is also effective when women with recurrent UTIs become pregnant. However, the choice of drugs is more limited.

Although there are plausible biological mechanisms for such an effect, clinical studies to date have not definitively demonstrated efficacy in prevention of recurrent uncomplicated cystitis. However, for women with recurrent UTI who are interested in trying cranberry products and can tolerate it, there is likely little harmful effect (other than an increase in calorie and glucose intake with juice). There may also be an increased likelihood of gastrointestinal side effects such as heartburn with cranberry juice, as suggested by some studies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/recurrent-urinary-tract-infection-in-women/abstract/72\" class=\"abstract_t\">72</a>].</p><p>Clinical studies on the efficacy of cranberry juice have been limited by suboptimal study design (underpowered, not blinded, or limited by other design flaws) and mixed results [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/recurrent-urinary-tract-infection-in-women/abstract/72-82\" class=\"abstract_t\">72-82</a>]. In a meta-analysis of nine randomized trials, there was a decreased risk of UTI among 639 patients who used cranberry products compared with 536 control patients (RR 0.62, 95% CI 0.49-0.80) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/recurrent-urinary-tract-infection-in-women/abstract/80\" class=\"abstract_t\">80</a>]. This reduction was even more marked in patients with recurrent UTI (RR, 0.53; 95% CI, 0.33-0.83). However, the meta-analysis was limited by&nbsp;substantial statistical and clinical heterogeneity, including lack of appropriate controls in several studies, extensive variability in dosing and administration of cranberry products, and variable definitions of UTI across studies. Furthermore, the meta-analysis excluded a randomized trial of 319 women presenting with an acute UTI, among whom drinking 8 ounces of 27 percent cranberry juice twice per day did not decrease the six-month incidence of recurrent UTI compared with drinking a placebo juice [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/recurrent-urinary-tract-infection-in-women/abstract/73\" class=\"abstract_t\">73</a>].

An updated Cochrane meta-analysis included data from this latter study and concluded that cranberry products did not significantly reduce the occurrence of symptomatic UTI in women with recurrent UTIs (RR 0.74, 95% CI 0.42-1.31). They also concluded that cranberry juice may be unacceptable to consume over a long period [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/recurrent-urinary-tract-infection-in-women/abstract/81\" class=\"abstract_t\">81</a>]. Similarly, in a subsequent trial of 185 female nursing home residents randomly assigned to cranberry capsules (72 mg of the active ingredient) or placebo for a year, cranberry capsules did not reduce adjusted rates of bacteriuria plus pyuria (29 percent for both groups) or symptomatic UTI (10 versus 12 episodes) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/recurrent-urinary-tract-infection-in-women/abstract/84\" class=\"abstract_t\">84</a>].

However, most of these studies did not determine whether the probiotic led to vaginal colonization with the probiotic strain. A subsequent trial, in which postmenopausal women with a history of recurrent UTI were randomly assigned to take <a href=\"topic.htm?path=trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole-co-trimoxazole-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole</a> (n = 127) or <em>Lactobacillus</em> tablets (n = 125) for 12 months, reported that women in the <em>Lactobacillus</em> group had more frequent clinical recurrences over the year (mean 3.3 versus 2.9 events) and shorter time to recurrence (three versus six months) than women in the antibiotic group [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/recurrent-urinary-tract-infection-in-women/abstract/59\" class=\"abstract_t\">59</a>]. Notably, a higher proportion of patients in the <em>Lactobacillus</em> group discontinued therapy because of adverse effects (12.2 versus 5.2 percent) and the probiotic strain of <em>Lactobacillus</em> tested for could not be identified by polymerase chain reaction in the vaginal flora of any women. Delivery of <em>Lactobacillus</em> through other methods may be more promising. Thus, a placebo-controlled trial evaluated the effect of a strain of <em>Lactobacillus crispatus </em>(which constitutes nearly 90 percent of the vaginal microbial flora), administered as a vaginal capsule, among premenopausal women with recurrent cystitis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/recurrent-urinary-tract-infection-in-women/abstract/90\" class=\"abstract_t\">90</a>]. Vaginal <em>Lactobacillus</em> treatment (n = 50) was well tolerated, achieved high levels of vaginal colonization, and was associated with decreased rates of recurrent UTI (15 versus 27 percent of women in the placebo group).</p><p>While the probiotic approach has a credible scientific basis, additional adequately designed clinical trials need to be performed before its routine use can be recommended.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H243572567\"><span class=\"h3\">Antiseptics</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The use of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methenamine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">methenamine</a> salts, which are converted to formaldehyde in acidified urine and thus have general antibacterial activity, has been proposed for preventing UTI, but its efficacy is unconfirmed and we do not recommend routine use of methenamine for this purpose in young healthy women.

A subgroup analysis of patients from three studies did demonstrate a reduction in the incidence of UTI with the use of a short course of methenamine (one week or less) among women without renal tract abnormalities who recently underwent gynecologic surgery (RR 0.14; 95% CI 0.05&ndash;0.38). However, this is not a group in which we would recommend use of methenamine since such women are at low risk for UTI and are otherwise easily treated with a short course of antimicrobials. There was no benefit among patients on longer methenamine treatment courses or patients with renal tract abnormalities or neuropathic bladder. In women with recurrent UTI caused by multi-drug resistant uropathogens in whom other preventive strategies have not worked, methenamine is occasionally tried and appears to be safe and generally well tolerated, but there is only anecdotal evidence of its success. Further study of methenamine as an antimicrobial-sparing approach for the prevention of recurrent UTI, especially given the increased prevalence of multi-drug resistant uropathogens, is warranted. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H276231456\"><span class=\"h3\">Vaccines</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A safe and effective vaccine to reduce the risk of recurrent UTI would be a welcome breakthrough.

(See <a href=\"#H12\" class=\"local\">'Changes in behavior'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Antimicrobial prophylaxis has been demonstrated to be highly effective in reducing the risk of recurrent UTI in women. Prophylaxis has been advocated for women who experience two or more symptomatic UTIs within six months or three or more over 12 months. However, the degree of discomfort experienced by the woman from these infections and concerns about antimicrobial resistance are the most important determinant of whether antimicrobial prophylaxis should be tried. (See <a href=\"#H17\" class=\"local\">'Antimicrobial prophylaxis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Continuous prophylaxis, postcoital prophylaxis, and intermittent self-treatment (which is not really a prophylaxis method) have all been demonstrated to be effective in the management of recurrent uncomplicated cystitis. The choice of approach depends upon the frequency and pattern of recurrences and patient preference. Regimens for continuous and post-coital prophylaxis are shown in Tables 1 and 2 (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F80898\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef80898 \">table 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F68989\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef68989 \">table 2</a>). The choice of antibiotic should be based upon the susceptibility patterns of the strains causing the patient's previous UTIs and any history of drug allergies. (See <a href=\"#H17\" class=\"local\">'Antimicrobial prophylaxis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Women who prefer to minimize their intake of antimicrobials may be candidates for self-diagnosis and self-treatment with a short course regimen of an antimicrobial, such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole-co-trimoxazole-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole</a> or a fluoroquinolone. Use of this strategy should be restricted to those women who have clearly documented recurrent infections and who are motivated, compliant with medical instructions, and have a good relationship with a medical provider. (See <a href=\"#H11944444\" class=\"local\">'Self-treatment'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Excretory urography and cystoscopy have been shown to uncover few abnormalities to influence subsequent management of UTI in women with recurrent UTIs. Thus, urologic evaluation of women with recurrent cystitis generally results in unnecessary expense and potential toxicity. However, further evaluation of the urinary tract is recommended if suspicion arises with any of the recurrences about complicating factors, such as structural or functional abnormalities of the genitourinary tract. (See <a href=\"#H25\" class=\"local\">'Urologic evaluation'</a> above.)</p></div><div id=\"topicAgreement\">Use of UpToDate is subject to the <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/legal/license\" class=\"licenseLink\" id=\"sla_in_page\">Subscription and License Agreement</a>.</div><div id=\"references\" class=\"headingAnchor\"><h1>REFERENCES</h1><ol id=\"reference\"><li><a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/recurrent-urinary-tract-infection-in-women/abstract/1\" class=\"nounderline abstract_t\">Foxman B.
