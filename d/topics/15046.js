This article stirred an emotional debate, with many people criticizing what they saw as nonvoluntary euthanasia involving a lethal injection delivered by a physician who did not know the patient and who had only ambiguous evidence of her wishes (&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s get this over with&rdquo;) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/physician-assisted-dying-understanding-evaluating-and-responding-to-requests-for-medical-aid-in-dying/abstract/2,3\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,3</a>]. The case later turned out to be a fabrication. A later (true) case report describing a patient, &ldquo;Diane,&rdquo; with a terminal illness who made an intensely personal decision for a physician-assisted death involving a self-administered drug prescribed only after extensive discussion with her own physician was received with less criticism and more balanced discussion; it was eventually considered by a grand jury, which recommended against indicting her physician [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/physician-assisted-dying-understanding-evaluating-and-responding-to-requests-for-medical-aid-in-dying/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. Less volatile discussion and legal toleration had already begun in the Netherlands in the early 1970s, but it was these two cases, &ldquo;Debbie&rdquo; and &ldquo;Diane,&rdquo; that set the stage for the current disputes in the United States over PAD.</p><p>In recent years, much of the developed world, those countries with long life expectancies, highly developed health care systems, and mortality characterized primarily by diseases with long downhill courses (cancer, heart and other organ system failure, and dementia), has seen the emergence of end of life debates and increasing pressures for legalization of, as it is increasingly frequently called, medical aid in dying (MAiD).</p><p>Many physicians, particularly those in the fields of oncology and palliative care, will be faced with a request for assistance in dying sometime in their professional lifetimes. No matter where clinicians stand ethically and morally on the permissibility of this practice, and regardless of whether these practices are legally permitted or prohibited in a given jurisdiction, clinicians have to carefully consider and decide how they will respond to these requests. </p><p>This topic focuses first on the background definitional and theoretical aspects of physician-assisted death, including the ethical, legal, and public policy issues surrounding euthanasia and assisted suicide, and then on clinical aspects of evaluating and responding to such requests, emphasizing the importance of full evaluation, including the adequacy of palliative care and the availability of alternative treatments to alleviate suffering, and finally on practical approaches that respect the values of the patient, the family, and the clinician, as well as the particular legal constraints under which they reside.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1872188661\"><span class=\"h1\">BACKGROUND DEFINITIONAL AND THEORETICAL ASPECTS: ETHICAL, LEGAL, AND PUBLIC POLICY ISSUES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Appropriate terminology is debated: </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For the practice where a physician provides terminally ill patients, at their explicit request, with a prescription for a lethal medication that they can take on their own, we use the term physician-assisted dying (PAD). Other terms used to describe this practice are outlined in the table (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PALC%2F102923\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef102923 \">table 1</a>). Where legal, the prescription is for a specific drug (usually a barbiturate), which an appropriately licensed physician may dispense or for which the patient (or a family member) fills a prescription at a pharmacy. (See <a href=\"#H687412701\" class=\"local\">'Physician-assisted dying'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Voluntary active euthanasia (VAE) differs from PAD in that the physician administers the lethal medication at the patient&rsquo;s request, usually by injection. VAE allows a response to a wider range of patient circumstances than PAD (in particular, for patients who are not physically capable of self-administration) and is more certain in its lethal effect. VAE is not legal anywhere in the United States; it is legal in several European countries and requires that the patient be facing intolerable suffering that cannot be alleviated in ways acceptable to the patient. It is also legal in Canada. (See <a href=\"#H239077773\" class=\"local\">'Voluntary active euthanasia'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In working clinically, we recommend using the language used by patients and families if they raise the subject or indirectly ask about it. Many will ask to be &ldquo;put to sleep&rdquo; or will use other euphemisms, avoiding terms like &ldquo;death&rdquo; <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> &ldquo;suicide.&rdquo; Asking patients in an open-ended way to clarify exactly what they are asking about is the proper initial response to such a request. (See <a href=\"#H986667984\" class=\"local\">'Terms to use with patients'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1316232684\"><span class=\"h2\">The debate over terminology</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In this rapidly changing legal context, controversy abounds as to whether to label this practice &ldquo;physician-assisted suicide&rdquo; (a negatively-valanced term typically used by opponents); to use the more neutral terms &ldquo;physician-assisted death,&rdquo; &ldquo;physician-assisted dying&rdquo; (PAD), and &ldquo;medical aid in dying&rdquo; (MAiD); or to use &ldquo;death with dignity&rdquo; (a positively-valanced term that has been favored by proponents) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/physician-assisted-dying-understanding-evaluating-and-responding-to-requests-for-medical-aid-in-dying/abstract/5-8\" class=\"abstract_t\">5-8</a>]. In United States jurisdictions where the practice is legally permitted, it is referred to casually and clinically in all these ways. Legally, however, it is often labeled on a state-by-state basis with the title of the relevant statue. In Oregon, for instance, it is referred to as &ldquo;death under the Oregon Death with Dignity Act.&rdquo; The Canadian Society of Palliative Care Physicians is endorsing the term &ldquo;patient-administered physician-hastened death&rdquo; (and &ldquo;physician-administered physician-hastened death&rdquo; for VAE) to ensure there is no misunderstanding and to clearly distinguish these practices from &ldquo;palliative care.&rdquo; In Canada, the term VAE is being replaced by &ldquo;clinician-assisted medical assistance in dying,&rdquo; &ldquo;assisted suicide&rdquo; is being replaced by &ldquo;self-administered medical assistance in dying,&rdquo; and all of these terms are being supplanted by MAiD, a term now increasingly frequently used in North America [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/physician-assisted-dying-understanding-evaluating-and-responding-to-requests-for-medical-aid-in-dying/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. </p><p>The term &ldquo;euthanasia&rdquo; also varies in its negative or positive connotations in different regions. In the Netherlands, &ldquo;euthanasia&rdquo; is reserved for the intervention by a physician to help a patient die by the intravenous route <strong>after a request</strong><em>,</em> or what is elsewhere defined as <strong>voluntary</strong> active euthanasia (VAE) or &ldquo;physician-administered physician-hastened death.&rdquo; Nonvoluntary euthanasia is known in the Netherlands as LAWER, &ldquo;life-ending acts without explicit (current) request,&rdquo; typically performed in a no-longer-competent patient who is close to death. In contrast, the broader term &ldquo;euthanasia&rdquo; is avoided in Germany, where it is often associated with Nazi extermination policies, suggesting a politically motivated death that is against the victim&rsquo;s wishes or interests (in this case, <strong>involuntary</strong> euthanasia). The term &ldquo;passive euthanasia,&rdquo; referring to death brought about by &ldquo;allowing to die&rdquo; or by withholding or withdrawing life-sustaining treatment, is no longer in common use in the United States or elsewhere. In Canada, the term &ldquo;voluntary euthanasia&rdquo; is being replaced by &ldquo;clinician-assisted medical assistance in dying,&rdquo; and &ldquo;assisted suicide&rdquo; is being replaced by &ldquo;self-administered medical assistance in dying.&rdquo; Terms relevant to this discussion are outlined in the table (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PALC%2F102923\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef102923 \">table 1</a>).</p><p>In this topic, we use the relatively neutral descriptive term PAD as synonymous with physician-assisted suicide, physician aid in dying, MAiD, patient-administered physician-hastened death, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> self-administered medical assistance in dying. We use VAE rather than &ldquo;physician-administered physician-hastened death&rdquo; because of its common usage in the literature and because there is no internationally recognized neutral term available.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H986667984\"><span class=\"h3\">Terms to use with patients</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>When working clinically, we recommend using the language used by patients and families, making sure to clarify exactly what they are requesting if they raise the subject or indirectly ask about it.

If a patient&rsquo;s request is for &ldquo;help in dying&rdquo; now or potentially in the future, then forcing him or her and his or her family to use the language of &ldquo;suicide&rdquo; in these discussions, if it is not their chosen descriptor, is problematic for several reasons:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The term &ldquo;suicide&rdquo; is often conflated in many circles with mental illness and irrationality.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The term &ldquo;suicide&rdquo; may seem to imply &ldquo;self-destruction,&rdquo; and the act may be cast that way in some cultural and religious traditions.

In the United States, the patient must be terminally ill (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PALC%2F101011\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef101011 \">table 4</a>); in the Netherlands, Canada, and several other European countries, the patient must be seriously ill and be facing &ldquo;unbearable&rdquo; or &ldquo;intolerable&rdquo; suffering that cannot be alleviated by means acceptable to the patient (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F71554\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef71554 \">table 5</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F58741\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef58741 \">table 6</a>). (See <a href=\"#H3959511334\" class=\"local\">'Current legal status'</a> below.)</p><p>Where legal, the prescription is for a specific drug (usually a barbiturate, such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pentobarbital-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">pentobarbital</a> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=secobarbital-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">secobarbital</a>, in an oral formulation), which an appropriately licensed physician may dispense. In the United States, the patient or a family member typically fills the prescription at a pharmacy and stores the medication until the time of use. In contrast, in the Netherlands, the physician brings the medication to the patient at the time of use, and if the patient decides to postpone the intervention (for what is typically a short period), the physician normally takes the lethal medication out of the house and back to his or her practice. Where PAD is not legal, the patient will sometimes ask a physician to recommend, and perhaps to assist with accessing, a suitable drug or combination of drugs. There are books (eg, &ldquo;Final Exit&rdquo; [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/physician-assisted-dying-understanding-evaluating-and-responding-to-requests-for-medical-aid-in-dying/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]) and some websites (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PALC%2F101013\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef101013 \">table 7</a>) that supply terminally ill patients with information concerning end of life options, ranging from refusing treatment, to cessation of eating and drinking, to PAD with lethal medications, to methods not requiring the involvement of a physician.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H239077773\"><span class=\"h3\">Voluntary active euthanasia</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>VAE differs from PAD in that the physician administers the lethal medication at the patient&rsquo;s request [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/physician-assisted-dying-understanding-evaluating-and-responding-to-requests-for-medical-aid-in-dying/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>], usually by intravenous injection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/physician-assisted-dying-understanding-evaluating-and-responding-to-requests-for-medical-aid-in-dying/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. VAE allows a response to a wider range of patient circumstances than PAD (in particular, for patients who are not physically capable of self-administration) and is more certain in its lethal effect. VAE is not legal anywhere in the United States. In countries where it is legal (eg, the Netherlands, Belgium, some provinces in Canada), it generally requires that the patient be facing &ldquo;unbearable&rdquo; or &ldquo;intolerable&rdquo; suffering that cannot be alleviated in any way acceptable to the patient.</p><p>In some countries where VAE is legal (eg, the Netherlands), it is widely considered to be morally equivalent to PAD and is subject to similar safeguards. In other countries, where it is not legal (eg, the United States), VAE is generally regarded as ethically distinct from PAD and much less <span class=\"nowrap\">socially/morally</span> acceptable. VAE tends to be preferred over PAD in environments where both are legal because of its reliability, efficiency, and relative absence of unwanted side effects and because the clinician is present to respond to any unforeseen circumstances. (See <a href=\"#H2887509649\" class=\"local\">'Possible complications of performing VAE and PAD'</a> below.)</p><p>In environments where both are illegal, the legal risks of VAE, if revealed or discovered, are greater than PAD because of the more direct and tangible connection between the physician&rsquo;s actions and the patient&rsquo;s death. Whether in a legal or illegal environment, VAE may be more psychologically difficult for physicians than PAD, as the link between the physician&rsquo;s intervention and the patient&rsquo;s death is more explicit and immediate. (See <a href=\"#H1411196385\" class=\"local\">'Personal and professional challenges'</a> below.)</p><p>By contrast, patients may find VAE psychologically easier, as the clinician takes direct responsibility for the final act, albeit at the patient&rsquo;s explicit request. On the other hand, some patients and families may consider VAE to be disadvantageous in that the timing of the final act may depend (to some degree) on the clinician&rsquo;s availability, rather than solely on the patient and family&rsquo;s preference. It can also be argued that providing PAD without offering VAE unfairly discriminates against similarly situated patients who do not have the physical abilities to self-administer [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/physician-assisted-dying-understanding-evaluating-and-responding-to-requests-for-medical-aid-in-dying/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>], as for instance, in advanced amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), although it may be that such patients have access to other potentially life-ending last resort options (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PALC%2F101014\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef101014 \">table 8</a>). </p><p>Physicians should also be aware of extralegal practices involving self-administered lethal drugs, often obtained over the internet, and of methods and technologies designed to provide an easy death without the assistance of a physician. The latter, which were developed by researchers in Australia, the United States, and elsewhere in response to legal opposition to PAD, include devices such as helium hood delivery systems [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/physician-assisted-dying-understanding-evaluating-and-responding-to-requests-for-medical-aid-in-dying/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>], the &ldquo;exit bag,&rdquo; rebreathing systems that use inert gases, drug combinations involving legal substances such as nicotine, and other modalities grouped under the label NuTech (New Technology in Self-Deliverance) developed in association with the Euthanasia Research &amp; Guidance Organization (ERGO) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/physician-assisted-dying-understanding-evaluating-and-responding-to-requests-for-medical-aid-in-dying/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. Helium suppliers responded by diluting the gas in party balloon tanks so that it is no longer reliably fatal, but other methods a physician may encounter are under continuing development.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2813744498\"><span class=\"h2\">Potential alternatives to PAD and VAE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>When working with a patient who has requested PAD or VAE, either exploring it as a potential future option, if needed to avoid suffering, or requesting assistance <strong>right now</strong>, the clinician should provide a clear account of alternatives that might both reduce or avoid suffering and be consonant with the patient&rsquo;s values and legal constraints. (See <a href=\"#H3396228690\" class=\"local\">'Responding to the patient&rsquo;s request for assisted dying'</a> below.)</p><p>Hospice <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> palliative care should be standard care, always available to dying patients and their families. Palliative care, which currently is best integrated into the care of patients with advanced life-threatening illness in high-income countries such as the United States, Canada, and those in Western Europe, typically allows for concomitant treatment of a wide range of disease-related issues alongside state-of-the-science pain and symptom management. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=benefits-services-and-models-of-subspecialty-palliative-care\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Benefits, services, and models of subspecialty palliative care&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=palliative-care-and-hospice-outside-of-the-united-states\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Palliative care and hospice outside of the United States&quot;</a>.) </p><p>Hospice programs are committed to providing effective management of pain and other symptoms and to ensuring adequate patient and family support, in any setting, through the last phases of the patient&rsquo;s life, including bereavement care for the family. Hospice care is typically offered when disease-directed treatments are no longer effective or acceptable to the patient and the prognosis is thought to be six months or less. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hospice-philosophy-of-care-and-appropriate-utilization-in-the-united-states\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Hospice: Philosophy of care and appropriate utilization in the United States&quot;</a>.) </p><p>Hospice, palliative care, and PAD are not incompatible; in Oregon, approximately 90 percent of patients who die under the Oregon Death with Dignity Act have had or are currently receiving hospice care [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/physician-assisted-dying-understanding-evaluating-and-responding-to-requests-for-medical-aid-in-dying/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>].</p><p>Potential alternative responses to intractable suffering other than PAD and VAE include intensification of pain and symptom management, withdrawing from or foregoing life-sustaining therapy, voluntarily stopping eating and drinking, and palliative sedation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/physician-assisted-dying-understanding-evaluating-and-responding-to-requests-for-medical-aid-in-dying/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. They are described below. (See <a href=\"#H3010941794\" class=\"local\">'Other end of life options to address suffering unacceptable to the patient'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1467387384\"><span class=\"h2\">Ethical arguments for and against</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In the past several decades, PAD has been the focus of often intense public controversy, as well as physician concern. Proponents appeal to the principles of autonomy, mercy, nonmaleficence, and beneficence that would honor the patient&rsquo;s choice and avoid or minimize the patient&rsquo;s suffering. Opponents claim that the principles of the wrongness of taking innocent life <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> the wrongness of suicide preclude the choice of a hastened death in terminal illness and that legalizing this practice would threaten the integrity of the physician and invite abuse.</p><p>Over the last several decades, general agreement has emerged about the moral permissibility of a patient refusing or discontinuing life-sustaining care, even when it means he or she will die, and this is now recognized in law, but disagreement persists over the ethics of PAD and VAE. A small sample of argumentation back and forth is listed below:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>First, proponents argue that the principle of autonomy justifies PAD <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> VAE. Autonomy, or self-determination, means that individuals have the right to pursue their own personal views of what kind of life is best, including when and how to die. Thus, to respect autonomy requires permitting individuals to weigh their own values and decide when it is better to end their lives rather than continue living in the face of terminal illness.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Opponents object that this construes autonomy too broadly and fails to take its limits into account, including challenges to the possibility of autonomy and limitation by the harm principle. The exercise of autonomy cannot include the ending of one&rsquo;s own life because that would mean ending the possibility of exercising autonomy and because ending one&rsquo;s own life would cause harm to others in multiple ways, including grief, loss of support, and setting dangerous precedents for others. They also point to classical writers on ethics, among them Aristotle, Thomas Aquinas, and Kant, who argued that suicide is deeply morally wrong. Proponents reply with examples of other writers on ethics, eg, Plato, the Stoics, and Hume, who did not oppose suicide in all circumstances and would not oppose it in this one.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Second, proponents argue that the principles of mercy, nonmaleficence, and beneficence also support permitting PAD or VAE. In some cases of terminal illness, living creates more pain and suffering than death. It is also claimed that the reassurance of having the option of PAD or VAE, even if it is not used, can provide &ldquo;psychological insurance&rdquo; and be beneficial in the sense of relieving anxiety about the prospect of future pain and suffering.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Opponents argue that quality care for the dying is not always provided to such patients, leading to needless pain and suffering [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/physician-assisted-dying-understanding-evaluating-and-responding-to-requests-for-medical-aid-in-dying/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>], and insist that adequate palliative care and hospice would relieve most pain and suffering. Proponents point out that, even with optimal end of life care, a small percentage of patients may still suffer uncontrolled pain and suffering. Opponents respond that it is unjustified to use the condition of these few patients as a justification to permit <span class=\"nowrap\">PAD/VAE</span> for any dying patients. Proponents then reply that it is unethical to sacrifice the interests of a few persons to ostensibly serve the interests of others.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Third, proponents argue that PAD and VAE may be considered not significantly different from terminating life-sustaining treatments, which is recognized as ethically justified. In both cases, the patient consents to hastened death, and in both cases, the physician intends to end the patient&rsquo;s life to relieve their suffering and takes some action to cause this to happen; the final result is the patient&rsquo;s death. If there is no difference in patient consent, physician intention, or the final result, there can be no difference in the ethical justification. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ethical-issues-in-palliative-care#H6538727\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Ethical issues in palliative care&quot;, section on 'Requests to discontinue life sustaining treatment'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Opponents counter that the distinction between intentionally ending a life and terminating life-sustaining treatments is reasonable based on the right to bodily integrity. The actual acts are different; injecting a life-ending medication or providing a prescription for one is not the same as removing or refraining from introducing an invasive, uncomfortable medical intervention. Patients who have life-sustaining interventions discontinued do not always die; some, such as Karen Ann Quinlan, live for years. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=legal-aspects-in-palliative-and-end-of-life-care-in-the-united-states#H3198409630\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Legal aspects in palliative and end of life care in the United States&quot;, section on 'The Quinlan case'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Proponents respond that the physician&rsquo;s intention in PAD is not malevolent; the intention is to relieve the patient&rsquo;s suffering by making possible an earlier, easier death, at the patient&rsquo;s earnest request, when after all, the death is already in the process of occurring. They also insist that intention is not the only relevant factor and that the line between killing and letting die is not a sharp one; many other medical strategies for negotiating death, such as removing a ventilator or discontinuing artificial hydration and nutrition, foreseeably have death as the outcome, and it is implausible to claim that the physician does not intend this. It is simply not possible to distinguish reliably between &ldquo;intended&rdquo; and &ldquo;unintended&rdquo; consequences of a given act in these circumstances.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Fourth, opponents argue that there are potential adverse consequences of permitting PAD or VAE. The medical profession could be corrupted, or expensive or burdensome patients could be urged, nudged, pressured, or coerced into requesting death. This argument, from the potential for abuse, is often called the &ldquo;slippery slope&rdquo; argument. However, proponents of legalization note that there is no current evidence for this argument and that the data from jurisdictions where <span class=\"nowrap\">PAD/VAE</span> is already legal (eg, Oregon and the Netherlands) show that it is patients of privilege who die in this way, educated, affluent, nonminority whites rather than poor, disabled, less educated, or minority individuals. Nevertheless, the risk of abuse argument continues to play a major role in public policy argumentation.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Fifth, results of surveys of physicians find that, even in countries where PAD is illegal, physicians receive and carry out requests to hasten death in some situations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/physician-assisted-dying-understanding-evaluating-and-responding-to-requests-for-medical-aid-in-dying/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>].

Parliamentary action in 2016 was intended to prohibit the provision of assistance in a way that is &ldquo;Gesch&auml;ftsm&auml;ssig&rdquo; (like a business), a move apparently directed against organizations or clinics, such as several located in Switzerland, that provide such services, including aid in dying for nonresidents, for sometimes large fees. The German law has been sharply criticized for its lack of clarity, in particular whether it prohibits accepting fees or repeated occasions of assistance, something that would be a particular problem for physicians with large populations of patients facing death (eg, oncologists).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3948180696\"><span class=\"h3\">Canada</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In early 2015, the Canadian Supreme Court found that the fundamental right to choose medical assistance in dying (including both patient self-administered and physician-administered medications, ie, PAD and VAE) was not limited to terminally ill patients but available to a broader group suffering from a &ldquo;grievous and irremediable medical condition (including an illness, disease, or disability) that causes enduring suffering that is intolerable to the individual in the circumstances of his or her condition&rdquo; [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/physician-assisted-dying-understanding-evaluating-and-responding-to-requests-for-medical-aid-in-dying/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. Regulatory policies in all provinces came into effect on June 6, 2016, although there has been continuing disagreement about the degree to which they do or do not comply with the Supreme Court&rsquo;s directive. Some provinces permit only physicians to assist; others permit nurse practitioners to do so. Quebec, which had legalized assistance earlier than the Supreme Court decision, permits only VAE; elsewhere in other Canadian provinces, VAE rather than PAD is by far the more frequent choice. For either PAD or VAE, a physician or nurse practitioner must be involved, but additional help may also be provided by pharmacists, family members, or others whom the patient has asked to help, as well as other health care providers who help physicians or nurse practitioners. A specific terminal prognosis is not required, but the patient must be at a point where his or her natural death has become &ldquo;reasonably foreseeable.&rdquo; The requirement of informed consent includes the provision of information about diagnosis, available forms of treatment, and available options to relieve suffering, including palliative care.

This study found that, with the single exception of AIDS (largely based on data from before the development of potent antiretroviral drugs), the potential risks to vulnerable populations had not materialized; the majority of patients receiving PAD or VAE in both jurisdictions were comparatively well-educated, affluent, and nonminority white [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/physician-assisted-dying-understanding-evaluating-and-responding-to-requests-for-medical-aid-in-dying/abstract/66\" class=\"abstract_t\">66</a>].

(See <a href=\"#H2559572481\" class=\"local\">'Responding to inquiries about future PAD or VAE'</a> below.)</p><p>A request for assistance in dying because of current, unacceptable, predominantly physical suffering should be treated as a medical emergency, ie, not to be deflected or postponed, but addressed immediately and explicitly [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/physician-assisted-dying-understanding-evaluating-and-responding-to-requests-for-medical-aid-in-dying/abstract/88\" class=\"abstract_t\">88</a>]. The clinician need not immediately act upon the request for PAD or VAE if prompt attention to the patient&rsquo;s suffering provides other ways of reducing distress so it is acceptable to the patient, but postponing attention or ignoring the patient&rsquo;s urgent plea can contribute to even greater distress. Comprehensive assessment of an urgent request requires time and often reveals intense emotional distress. Since a patient&rsquo;s will to live may fluctuate and therapeutic options to address suffering are almost always available, an initial request should initially be met with in-depth exploration of the patient&rsquo;s distress. The prescription of a potentially life-ending medication should be delayed until this careful assessment occurs.

In most reports, uncontrolled pain is not the primary determinant of interest in or use of PAD or VAE.

Some 6.5 percent of deaths are preceded by an explicit request for PAD or VAE, but only 3.1 percent of deaths are attributed to one of these practices [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/physician-assisted-dying-understanding-evaluating-and-responding-to-requests-for-medical-aid-in-dying/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2559572481\"><span class=\"h2\">Responding to inquiries about future PAD or VAE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Many terminally ill patients and their family members and caregivers are concerned about what future options they might have if the patient&rsquo;s suffering becomes intolerable (eg, if they develop intractable pain, dyspnea, or severe nausea and uncontrolled vomiting) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/physician-assisted-dying-understanding-evaluating-and-responding-to-requests-for-medical-aid-in-dying/abstract/90,91\" class=\"abstract_t\">90,91</a>]. Other patients, somewhat hypothetically, foresee wanting to be able to control the circumstances of their own death when the time comes, such that the main issue is not as much current physical suffering but rather a desire to avoid both future suffering and the loss of control that can accompany the final stages of the dying process (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PALC%2F101016\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef101016 \">table 9</a>). </p><p>Advocates of PAD typically support such &ldquo;self-determination&rdquo; choices, observing that having access to the medication provides reassurance, even if it is never used; opponents often cite the &ldquo;need for control&rdquo; as a negative factor. Regardless of whether the request is perceived as an act of self-determination or in a more negative light, carefully evaluating requests for PAD requires considerable clinical judgment.</p><p>In such cases, the physician may be asked to respond to a patient inquiry without full knowledge of the patient&rsquo;s eventual condition or potential future intent. As part of the evaluation, as in a request for PAD or VAE <strong>right now</strong><em>, </em>the physician should ensure that the inquiry or an associated request is genuine and not influenced by mental illness, pressures or coercion, lack of insurance coverage for potentially effective treatments, or lack of access to hospice, and that the request is voluntary and originates from the patient, not from a clinician or family member [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/physician-assisted-dying-understanding-evaluating-and-responding-to-requests-for-medical-aid-in-dying/abstract/92\" class=\"abstract_t\">92</a>].</p><p>Clinicians should use the language used by patients and families, clarifying exactly what is being requested if the language is unclear. (See <a href=\"#H986667984\" class=\"local\">'Terms to use with patients'</a> above.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1712378340\"><span class=\"h3\">Addressing the patient&rsquo;s concerns</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Regardless of whether clinicians personally support or reject the option of PAD or VAE, they should openly address inquiries about assisted dying [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/physician-assisted-dying-understanding-evaluating-and-responding-to-requests-for-medical-aid-in-dying/abstract/92\" class=\"abstract_t\">92</a>]. General guidelines for responding to requests for assistance in dying are presented in the table (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PALC%2F101009\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef101009 \">table 10</a>). </p><p>The first step is to explore specifically what the patient <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> family are afraid of, with attention to what kinds of deaths they have witnessed or heard about (eg, &ldquo;Tell me what you are most worried about,&rdquo; &ldquo;Tell me about the last phase of life among your family and friends who have died&rdquo;). The evaluating clinician(s) should also develop a clear understanding of why the request is coming at this point in time [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/physician-assisted-dying-understanding-evaluating-and-responding-to-requests-for-medical-aid-in-dying/abstract/93\" class=\"abstract_t\">93</a>] (eg, &ldquo;What is the most difficult part of your current situation?&rdquo; &ldquo;Was there anything in particular that made you decide to ask for this kind of help right now?&rdquo;).</p><p>In-depth exploration of the fears and concerns underlying these inquiries and reassurance that clinicians will be responsive if suffering becomes unacceptable in the future are central to finding a way of responding to their request. Responses frequently (but not always) involve outlining palliative options other than PAD or VAE. (See <a href=\"#H3010941794\" class=\"local\">'Other end of life options to address suffering unacceptable to the patient'</a> below.)</p><p>Most often, clinicians can reassure the patient and family that extreme distress is not inevitable or even likely, and that palliative and hospice care is generally very effective in alleviating such suffering. Nevertheless, to tell a patient who has personally witnessed severe suffering in his or her own life experience that this is clinically unlikely is not to address the patient&rsquo;s anxieties and concerns in a responsive way. Sometimes, considering potential interventions that help patients maintain control, independence, and self-care in their home environment may be an effective means of addressing serious requests for a hastened death [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/physician-assisted-dying-understanding-evaluating-and-responding-to-requests-for-medical-aid-in-dying/abstract/94\" class=\"abstract_t\">94</a>], but it does not supplant the need for direct attention to the request.</p><p>Clinicians should also be prepared to give patients, if asked, a realistic, unbiased, evidence-based account of what to expect in the final stages of their terminal illness. The patient and family may even need to be advised about situations in which considerable physical or psychosocial distress is reasonably foreseen (eg, severe dyspnea with end-stage heart failure or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [COPD]). Often, reassurance about effective management strategies to prevent <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> respond to such outcomes is all that is needed. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=assessment-and-management-of-dyspnea-in-palliative-care\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Assessment and management of dyspnea in palliative care&quot;</a>.)</p><p>However, patients should not be promised perfect symptom control where it is medically unlikely to be achievable without diminishment of cognitive function (eg, some forms of brain cancer). Note that &ldquo;We won&rsquo;t let you suffer&rdquo; is often (mis)understood as &ldquo;We won&rsquo;t let you suffer at all&rdquo; and is, in some cases, patently false [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/physician-assisted-dying-understanding-evaluating-and-responding-to-requests-for-medical-aid-in-dying/abstract/88\" class=\"abstract_t\">88</a>]. Thus, clinicians should acknowledge that there are uncommon occasions where standard measures are less than ideal, focusing on the circumstances about which the patient and family are most worried, and then describe how, together, they could approach such situations. </p><p>It is very important, and potentially reassuring, to articulate how you can help in such difficult circumstances by exploring alternative &ldquo;last resort&rdquo; options and clearly articulating both those options you would and those you would not feel comfortable pursuing (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PALC%2F101014\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef101014 \">table 8</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/physician-assisted-dying-understanding-evaluating-and-responding-to-requests-for-medical-aid-in-dying/abstract/11,95\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,95</a>]. Palliative sedation may be a reassuring alternative for some (eg, those who have witnessed an undertreated, agitated terminal delirium), although not for all patients (eg, those for whom alertness and control are paramount values). The option of voluntary stopping of eating and drinking (VSED) may also be a comfort to some, although it is not always as easy to follow through with and must not be casually recommended. (See <a href=\"#H3010941794\" class=\"local\">'Other end of life options to address suffering unacceptable to the patient'</a> below.)</p><p>Besides physical distress, the patient&rsquo;s suffering may include a broad range of psychosocial, spiritual, and existential factors, and every effort should be made to understand and address these aspects as well. Many of the nonphysical dimensions of suffering (eg, psychological, social, spiritual, religious, existential) may be outside the competence of the main treating clinicians, so involvement of those with special expertise (eg, psychiatry, chaplaincy, social work) is critical. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=psychosocial-issues-in-advanced-illness\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Psychosocial issues in advanced illness&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=assessment-and-management-of-depression-in-palliative-care\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Assessment and management of depression in palliative care&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-comprehensive-patient-assessment-in-palliative-care#H11672056\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of comprehensive patient assessment in palliative care&quot;, section on 'Domains of palliative assessment'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-spirituality-in-palliative-care#H1662647145\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of spirituality in palliative care&quot;, section on 'Differentiating spiritual, existential, and psychological suffering'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1845735502\"><span class=\"h3\">Defining physician limitations</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>If, after fully exploring what hospice <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> palliative care can and cannot promise, <span class=\"nowrap\">PAD/VAE</span> remains an important consideration for the patient, the clinician should clearly define his or her approach, as well as his or her limitations (such as those posed by legal barriers or by personal beliefs about moral permissibility). Clinicians should forthrightly describe how they can<em> </em>respond to such difficult circumstances, but they should not promise what they cannot deliver, and they should not violate their own strongly held personal values, even in environments where PAD <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> VAE are legally permitted. If the patient and clinician cannot find common ground in terms of how to address these hypothetical circumstances, the patient should be helped with finding another physician for consultation or care. (See <a href=\"#H1411196385\" class=\"local\">'Personal and professional challenges'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H336357317\"><span class=\"h3\">Concrete options for responding to an advance request</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>If the clinician is comfortable with the request and is practicing in a jurisdiction where PAD <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> VAE are legal (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PALC%2F101010\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef101010 \">table 2</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PALC%2F101012\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef101012 \">table 3</a>), and if all of the legal requirements are met, he or she may make a verbal commitment to provide such assistance in the future should the need arise. However, the patient may prefer to receive the medication well in advance of need, especially in jurisdictions that require waiting periods between the initial request and the provision of the medication. </p><p>Possession of potentially lethal medication may be reassuring to such patients who have satisfied the criteria for access and can take it at a time of their own choosing. Clinicians should also be aware that some patients stockpile other medications that they believe will be effective in causing death, especially in environments where PAD and VAE are not legally permitted. However, if a significant delay is anticipated between the time the legal prescription is written and when the patient plans to take it, the clinician should consider requesting a face-to-face meeting with the patient and family at a future date to ensure that all requisite criteria for access are still met. This later meeting is not legally required but is clinically recommended. If a patient who meets the criteria for PAD and receives the lethal prescription does not plan to take it right away, safe storage should also be discussed. If medications are eventually not taken and the patient dies of other causes, then family members should be counseled about safe disposal.</p><p>Clinicians must assure the patient that his or her request for PAD can be withdrawn at any time, whether or not the prescription has been already written, and that there is no obligation to use the medication. In Oregon, only approximately two-thirds<sup> </sup>of patients who have received a prescription actually take it.</p><p>Clinician <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> family presence at the time the patient takes the medication is generally desirable, if the patient wishes and the physician is comfortable doing so, but physicians are not obligated to do so. The physician should prepare the patient and family (and him or herself) for the small possibility that the medication may not work and should make contingency plans for how to manage such circumstances. Such presence and contingency planning are much more safely and effectively accomplished in legal environments than illegal ones. In either situation, the physician must assure the patient that their request for PAD or VAE may be withdrawn at any time and for any reason. (See <a href=\"#H2887509649\" class=\"local\">'Possible complications of performing VAE and PAD'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1021362212\"><span class=\"h2\">Handling a current urgent request</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Some patients request assistance in dying because of unacceptable, predominantly physical suffering, even in the face of skillfully-delivered state-of-the-art-and-science palliative care treatments. Such requests should be addressed explicitly. If the patient uses a euphemism for death or refers to it indirectly, ask for clarification. Do not assume that a wish for death to come soon is a request for a lethal prescription, but do not dismiss the request either. However, in contrast to the patient requesting potential future assistance, urgent requests should be treated as a &ldquo;medical emergency&rdquo; [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/physician-assisted-dying-understanding-evaluating-and-responding-to-requests-for-medical-aid-in-dying/abstract/88\" class=\"abstract_t\">88</a>], ie, not to be deflected or postponed, but addressed immediately (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PALC%2F101009\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef101009 \">table 10</a>). The clinician need not provide PAD or VAE right now if prompt attention to the patient&rsquo;s suffering reveals other ways of reducing distress, but postponing attention or ignoring the patient&rsquo;s urgent plea can contribute to even greater distress.</p><p>When a seriously ill patient makes an urgent request for assistance in dying <strong>right now</strong>, as distinct from a request for potential assistance sometime in the future (see <a href=\"#H2559572481\" class=\"local\">'Responding to inquiries about future PAD or VAE'</a> above), this should elicit a rapid, comprehensive evaluation to be sure that the clinician understands the root cause(s) of the request. Why is the request occurring at this particular point in time, why are usual state-of-the-science palliative approaches inadequate, and why are alternative approaches (eg, intensification of symptom management, withdrawal of life-sustaining treatment, sedation for refractory symptoms) unacceptable [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/physician-assisted-dying-understanding-evaluating-and-responding-to-requests-for-medical-aid-in-dying/abstract/90,92,96,97\" class=\"abstract_t\">90,92,96,97</a>]? In the United States, formal clinical criteria were published in 2016 by a group of experts to ensure that physicians willing to provide PAD have the guidance they need to do so in a safe and effective manner [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/physician-assisted-dying-understanding-evaluating-and-responding-to-requests-for-medical-aid-in-dying/abstract/98\" class=\"abstract_t\">98</a>].

Unfortunately, not all families are sympathetic or able to work together in helpful ways in contexts such as these. A patient&rsquo;s refusal to inform close family members should be thoroughly explored and understood as part of the request evaluation. Statutes such as the Oregon Death with Dignity Act require the physician to indicate whether or not the patient has informed their family; in the first 18 years of Oregon&rsquo;s law, 4.4 percent of patients who died chose not to inform their families of their decision [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/physician-assisted-dying-understanding-evaluating-and-responding-to-requests-for-medical-aid-in-dying/abstract/102\" class=\"abstract_t\">102</a>].

Not all patients making requests for a hastened death are mentally ill, and such a request cannot be taken in itself as a symptom of depression, demoralization, or mental illness.</p><p>Nevertheless, the possibility that clinical depression or anxiety may be clouding the patient&rsquo;s judgment should be considered and comprehensively addressed before any &ldquo;last resort&rdquo; or other end of life decisions are made. If there is serious concern that mental illness could be a factor in the request for PAD or VAE (eg, chronic preexisting mental illness or acute psychological distress or demoralization [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/physician-assisted-dying-understanding-evaluating-and-responding-to-requests-for-medical-aid-in-dying/abstract/106,107\" class=\"abstract_t\">106,107</a>], which could distort judgment about matters related to physical illness) or that decisional capacity may be impaired, psychiatric or psychological consultation may be legally required and should be obtained (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PALC%2F101011\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef101011 \">table 4</a>).

One challenge with self-administration of the lethal medication, as required under United States statutes, is that the short-acting oral barbiturates normally used must be removed from their capsules (it would not be possible to swallow some 90 capsules quickly enough) and mixed with a substance such as applesauce or custard, but they are nevertheless extremely bitter in taste and must be swallowed within 30 to 120 seconds. VAE by injection is more certain than patient-administered oral medication and, for that reason, is preferred by a majority of physicians and patients where both are legal. For oral administration, an antiemetic is normally given at an appropriate interval in advance; in Oregon in 2015, regurgitation was reported in two cases, although no patient has been reported to have regained consciousness after ingesting the Death with Dignity Act medications. Initial reports from Oregon about PAD suggested that &ldquo;there were no reported adverse events, although one patient who was still conscious 30 minutes after taking the lethal medication was given more of the medication to take&rdquo; [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/physician-assisted-dying-understanding-evaluating-and-responding-to-requests-for-medical-aid-in-dying/abstract/115\" class=\"abstract_t\">115</a>]. Other reports from past decades have suggested complication rates of as low as under 1 percent to as high as 15 percent among PAD cases in the United States [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/physician-assisted-dying-understanding-evaluating-and-responding-to-requests-for-medical-aid-in-dying/abstract/13,45,50,56,116-118\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,45,50,56,116-118</a>].</p><p>Where VAE is legal, as in the Netherlands, minor technical problems, such as inability to insert an intravenous line, can occur; this is now usually circumvented by asking ambulance personnel to insert an intravenous catheter prior to the euthanasia appointment. Such problems would not be relevant in the United States, where the patient must self-administer the medication. In early data from the Netherlands, in 5 percent of euthanasia cases and 15 percent of PAD cases, the patient either did not die or took a very long time to die, and in these cases, physicians completed the process by administering further medication, converting them into euthanasia. In self-administered oral PAD, regurgitation and reawakening, although infrequent, can cause distress to family members [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/physician-assisted-dying-understanding-evaluating-and-responding-to-requests-for-medical-aid-in-dying/abstract/56\" class=\"abstract_t\">56</a>]; these complications typically occur when the patient does not ingest the medication quickly enough or does not ingest the entire amount.

VSED is distinct from the &ldquo;natural&rdquo; process of gradually losing the ability to eat and drink that often accompanies the very late stages of dying. VSED requires considerable patient resolve, especially to stop drinking (appetite fades as patients become ketotic, but thirst persists and can be difficult to manage). Clinicians should play a central role in careful patient assessment before this process is initiated, and they may be needed to help palliate symptoms of oral mucosal dryness or delirium as the patient becomes dehydrated prior to death. The dying process usually lasts 7 to 14 days from time of initiation if the patient is vigilant about avoiding all fluids; if only nutrition is refused, the dying process can extend over a much longer period of time and involve difficult issues around malnutrition. If symptoms (especially dry mouth) are not well managed, many patients may give up on the effort. VSED should never be casually recommended as a preferable alternative to PAD, for it can be difficult for the patient to sustain, for the clinician to help manage, and for the family to watch, although there are also reports that it is a gentle and easy method [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/physician-assisted-dying-understanding-evaluating-and-responding-to-requests-for-medical-aid-in-dying/abstract/127\" class=\"abstract_t\">127</a>].

There is a strong consensus about the permissibility of palliative sedation, particularly for suffering that is predominantly physical. In these cases, the minimal amount of sedation that is needed to relieve the suffering is generally used. However, palliative sedation to unconsciousness is a generally accepted option, especially for major end of life catastrophes (eg, bleeding out externally, acute agitated delirium at the end of life). Usually, but not always, artificial hydration and nutrition are not initiated, or are stopped if already being utilized, when palliative sedation is begun, although it should be explicitly addressed as an independent decision.

Others challenge this distinction, asking how plausible is it that physicians could &ldquo;foresee&rdquo; that sedating to unconsciousness while withholding nutrition and hydration will result in death, yet not in some robust sense &ldquo;intend&rdquo; it [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/physician-assisted-dying-understanding-evaluating-and-responding-to-requests-for-medical-aid-in-dying/abstract/120,125\" class=\"abstract_t\">120,125</a>].

If available, the health care proxy or &ldquo;next of kin&rdquo; would consent on the patient&rsquo;s behalf. If no health care proxy or potentially consenting family members are available and if there is no other advance directive, the provision of comfort measures (including, if necessary, the use of sedation) should be considered standard practice and the default strategy for clinician treatment decisions. This allows palliative sedation to be an option for conditions such as terminal agitated delirium, where a last resort response is sometimes needed, but the patient cannot personally consent.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1066068795\"><span class=\"h1\">RELATED ISSUES</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1957283438\"><span class=\"h2\">PAD and VAE in minors</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Physician-assisted dying (PAD) is legal under statutes in the United States only for adults 18 years of age or older. In the Netherlands, mature and relatively mature minors are understood to have some decision-making capacity and are not excluded under the guidelines, but because they are below the age of majority, they must be regarded as &ldquo;vulnerable,&rdquo; and such decisions require heightened scrutiny. In the Netherlands, both PAD and voluntary active euthanasia (VAE) are legal for minors between 12 and 16 years of age, requiring the consent of both parents. Teenagers between 16 and 18 years of age are adults in medical issues, including euthanasia and PAD. In 2001, less than 1 percent of all deaths of persons aged 1 to 17 years were the result of VAE, and no cases of PAD were found in this group [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/physician-assisted-dying-understanding-evaluating-and-responding-to-requests-for-medical-aid-in-dying/abstract/66\" class=\"abstract_t\">66</a>]. </p><p>In Belgium, PAD and VAE are legal for terminally ill people of any age [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/physician-assisted-dying-understanding-evaluating-and-responding-to-requests-for-medical-aid-in-dying/abstract/128\" class=\"abstract_t\">128</a>].

In these jurisdictions, the term &ldquo;euthanasia&rdquo; is understood in the Greek sense of &ldquo;eu-thanatos&rdquo; (good death) and is regarded as a practice that, although extremely rare, is sometimes the best alternative in a bad situation where an infant is so severely affected that death is likely to occur anyway. </p><p>The decision of when to start and withhold medical treatment for severely affected neonates with a poor prognosis is one of the most difficult facing the pediatrician and neonatologist. Even more difficult would be deciding whether and when euthanasia should be considered in the care of an infant who is faced with severe suffering and no hope for improvement. Although neonatal euthanasia is neither a legal nor accepted practice in the United States, it is legal in the Netherlands under careful guidelines, known as the Groningen Protocol [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/physician-assisted-dying-understanding-evaluating-and-responding-to-requests-for-medical-aid-in-dying/abstract/129,130\" class=\"abstract_t\">129,130</a>], which require heightened scrutiny and the informed consent of both parents; it is also legal in Belgium. In approximately 8 percent of deaths that occurred in Dutch infants under one year of age (about 87 deaths), all in newborns with spina bifida and hydrocephalus, the decision to stop life-sustaining treatments was followed by the &ldquo;use of drugs with the explicit intention to hasten death&rdquo; [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/physician-assisted-dying-understanding-evaluating-and-responding-to-requests-for-medical-aid-in-dying/abstract/131\" class=\"abstract_t\">131</a>]. In 1 percent of all infant deaths (approximately 11 cases per year), drugs were administered with the intention of ending the infant&rsquo;s life when the infant was not dependent upon life-sustaining interventions. In the early Belgian cases, many of the infants were born prematurely and had intracranial hemorrhages, lung hypoplasia, or severe congenital malformations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/physician-assisted-dying-understanding-evaluating-and-responding-to-requests-for-medical-aid-in-dying/abstract/132\" class=\"abstract_t\">132</a>].</p><p>Importantly, the Groningen Protocol explicitly concerns infants who are not on life-sustaining interventions but who have &ldquo;a hopeless prognosis and experience what parents and medical experts deem to be unbearable suffering.&rdquo; The authors of the protocol acknowledge that &ldquo;it is difficult to define [such suffering] in the abstract.&rdquo; They give children with the most serious form of spina bifida as an example of the type of patient for whom the protocol was intended.</p><p>For some, the Groningen Protocol represents the very slippery slope they warned about when they opposed legalization of VAE and PAD. For others, it constitutes humane treatment of patients who are suffering. While it is assumed that the parents have the best interests of their child at heart, their opinions and reasoning may be at odds with that of pediatricians and neonatologists in their roles as patient advocates. There is no doubt that such decisions involve painful circumstances for the parents and physicians, but euthanasia is never performed unless the parents and physicians are in agreement about what best serves the welfare of the infant perceived as suffering intolerably without hope of recovery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/physician-assisted-dying-understanding-evaluating-and-responding-to-requests-for-medical-aid-in-dying/abstract/133\" class=\"abstract_t\">133</a>]. </p><p>In the United States, euthanasia is not permitted in adults, much less neonates. When such cases of severe suffering and poor prognosis are faced, they are usually managed by a combination of aggressive symptom management and withdrawal of potentially life-sustaining therapies, accompanied by aggressive sedation if needed.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2505546219\"><span class=\"h2\">PAD and VAE in mental illness</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In the United States, death with dignity statutes require decision-making capacity; where mental illness, including depression that affects decision-making capacity, is suspected by either evaluating physician, a psychological or psychiatric consultation may be required, and a positive finding can be grounds for exclusion (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PALC%2F101011\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef101011 \">table 4</a>). </p><p>In the Netherlands and Belgium, euthanasia and PAD may be permitted for patients with psychiatric disorders because not all chronic psychiatric patients are found to be incompetent with respect to a request to be helped to die. A 2015 study reviewing 66 cases of assisted dying by patients with psychiatric disorders in the Netherlands from 2011 to 2014, approximately two thirds of them women, found that most patients had chronic, severe conditions with histories of attempted suicide and psychiatric hospitalization associated with personality disorders, social isolation, loneliness, depressive disorders (the primary psychiatric issue in 55 percent), psychotic posttraumatic stress or anxiety, or somatoform, neurocognitive, and eating disorders, as well as prolonged grief and autism [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/physician-assisted-dying-understanding-evaluating-and-responding-to-requests-for-medical-aid-in-dying/abstract/134\" class=\"abstract_t\">134</a>]. Comorbidities with functional impairments were common.

An editorial critiquing this Dutch study raises a number of concerns, among them the stability of the desire to die in some such cases, whether <span class=\"nowrap\">PAD/VAE</span> served as a substitute for effective psychosocial intervention and support, and the fact that over one-half the patients refused at least some recommended treatment, usually on the basis of previously experienced and ineffective treatments [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/physician-assisted-dying-understanding-evaluating-and-responding-to-requests-for-medical-aid-in-dying/abstract/135\" class=\"abstract_t\">135</a>]. </p><p>There is also disagreement between physicians in general when it comes to participating in ending the life of patients with psychiatric illness [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/physician-assisted-dying-understanding-evaluating-and-responding-to-requests-for-medical-aid-in-dying/abstract/136,137\" class=\"abstract_t\">136,137</a>].

Similar concerns are raised about the practice in Belgium, as well as concerns about inducing hopelessness in other psychiatric patients. The general view in the Netherlands and Belgium, however, is that the suffering involved in profound, intractable psychiatric disorders can be as severe as physical pain or suffering, and hence, assistance in dying is warranted in at least some particularly difficult cases. However, others raise the possibility that some correlates of suffering in psychiatric patients (such as low income) represent societal failures, for which assisted dying should not be used [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/physician-assisted-dying-understanding-evaluating-and-responding-to-requests-for-medical-aid-in-dying/abstract/139\" class=\"abstract_t\">139</a>].</p><p>The issue of assisted dying for psychiatric disorders is also debated in Canada [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/physician-assisted-dying-understanding-evaluating-and-responding-to-requests-for-medical-aid-in-dying/abstract/140\" class=\"abstract_t\">140</a>], where according to the 2015 Canadian Supreme Court ruling, the right to PAD is not limited to terminally ill patients but is available to a broader group suffering from a &ldquo;grievous and irremediable medical condition (including an illness, disease, or disability) that causes enduring suffering that is intolerable to the individual in the circumstances of his or her condition,&rdquo; including psychiatric disorders [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/physician-assisted-dying-understanding-evaluating-and-responding-to-requests-for-medical-aid-in-dying/abstract/141\" class=\"abstract_t\">141</a>]. </p><p>These questions are not directly relevant in the United States, where PAD is not legal for reasons of mental illness alone, but may be indirectly relevant where a patient&rsquo;s terminal physical illness is complicated by psychiatric issues that do not appear to interfere with his or her capacity for decision-making.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H985747866\"><span class=\"h1\">CHALLENGES FOR THE CLINICIAN</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1411196385\"><span class=\"h2\">Personal and professional challenges</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Health care practitioners, as well as ethicists, religious leaders, philosophers, lawyers, and laypersons with considerable palliative care knowledge, are represented on both sides of the debate over the boundaries of the physician&rsquo;s role in assisting in the death of a terminally ill patient [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/physician-assisted-dying-understanding-evaluating-and-responding-to-requests-for-medical-aid-in-dying/abstract/22,23\" class=\"abstract_t\">22,23</a>]. However, no matter where clinicians stand ethically and morally on the permissibility of physician-assisted dying (PAD) or voluntary active euthanasia (VAE), and no matter whether these practices are legally permitted or prohibited in a given jurisdiction, clinicians will still have to carefully consider and decide how they will respond to requests for assisted dying from their patients. Clinicians, ethicists, and lawmakers in different jurisdictions disagree about whether assisted dying should be reserved just for cases where excellent palliative care is insufficient to adequately relieve the suffering of a seriously ill patient, that is, as a &ldquo;last resort,&rdquo; or whether patients facing eventual death may choose the timing and circumstances of their own death, given their own values, preferences, circumstances, and what counts for them as the &ldquo;least worst&rdquo; death among those they may face, and thereby forgo much of the predictable downhill course of their disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/physician-assisted-dying-understanding-evaluating-and-responding-to-requests-for-medical-aid-in-dying/abstract/142\" class=\"abstract_t\">142</a>].

Nevertheless, patients for whom the possibility of PAD or VAE is important should not be &ldquo;led on&rdquo; by ambiguous promises to help if the clinician knows that he or she cannot assist. In such circumstances, clinicians who cannot help in this way should be prepared as early as possible to refer the patient to another clinician who can.</p><p>If a clinician is considering providing either PAD or VAE, whether or not permitted by law, he or she should fully consider the potential psychosocial and legal consequences for him or herself [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/physician-assisted-dying-understanding-evaluating-and-responding-to-requests-for-medical-aid-in-dying/abstract/144,145\" class=\"abstract_t\">144,145</a>]. Formal or informal professional consultation, preferably with someone who has significant palliative care experience, is important. In an illegal environment, it can be particularly challenging to find a trusted colleague with which to confidentially discuss one&rsquo;s potential participation before making a commitment to provide PAD or VAE to a patient and then with which to discuss the outcome afterward. Even in a legal environment, it may be challenging to find a colleague with the right amount of experience and expertise to provide clinical consultation and support. In the United States, a service called <a href=\"https://www.compassionandchoices.org/doc2doc-program/&amp;token=Ln+aUTwgC8EMAFcUVr4LujIWW8+u0U3mFzrb6gRj1qrkxgZzfSMI/g1dMhtNAOuK9qvB7n0NS2UbnaGeZRVDUw==&amp;TOPIC_ID=95251\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">Doc2Doc</a>, provided by the advocacy organization Compassion &amp; Choices, provides information for clinicians about a wide range of end of life practices, including PAD; physician information and consultation services are also available in the Netherlands. (See <a href=\"#H234132741\" class=\"local\">'Consultation services for physicians'</a> above.)</p><p>In jurisdictions where the practice of PAD or VAE is illegal, clinicians who might otherwise be willing to support the practice must consider their willingness to take a legal risk on behalf of the patient and family. If the act were ever revealed or discovered, they might be subject to legal prosecution and professional sanction. This concern sometimes drives the entire process &ldquo;underground,&rdquo; which generally means no second opinions or documentation, and thus, ironically, places the patient at risk for receiving inadequate counseling and support.</p><p>There are also risks for clinicians who try to protect themselves legally by having ambiguous conversations, such as &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t take too much of this or it will kill you&rdquo; [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/physician-assisted-dying-understanding-evaluating-and-responding-to-requests-for-medical-aid-in-dying/abstract/146\" class=\"abstract_t\">146</a>]. Such conversations can easily be misunderstood. Is the clinician saying that &ldquo;now is the time to call it quits&rdquo;? Or is it just a warning about the dangers of the medications? Is the doctor suggesting this lethal option, offering it, or urging it? In all clinical environments, when exploring any end of life option, there is a need for honesty and clarity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/physician-assisted-dying-understanding-evaluating-and-responding-to-requests-for-medical-aid-in-dying/abstract/90\" class=\"abstract_t\">90</a>]. Physicians should emphasize their commitment to the patient and, above all, that the patient will not be abandoned by the clinician, even if there is disagreement about a potential last resort option, such as <span class=\"nowrap\">PAD/VAE</span> or what counts for this particular patient as the &ldquo;least worst&rdquo; way of dying that they can foresee [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/physician-assisted-dying-understanding-evaluating-and-responding-to-requests-for-medical-aid-in-dying/abstract/142\" class=\"abstract_t\">142</a>]. If the desired treatment cannot be provided by the main treating physician for moral or legal reasons, he or she still has an obligation to seek common ground and a mutually acceptable approach with the patient to avoid the sense of feeling abandoned at this critical juncture [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/physician-assisted-dying-understanding-evaluating-and-responding-to-requests-for-medical-aid-in-dying/abstract/147\" class=\"abstract_t\">147</a>].</p><p>Few studies attempt to measure the impact of participation in PAD or VAE on physicians [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/physician-assisted-dying-understanding-evaluating-and-responding-to-requests-for-medical-aid-in-dying/abstract/115,148\" class=\"abstract_t\">115,148</a>]. When this issue was explored in Oregon seven years after legalization, physicians interviewed said they often felt unprepared and experienced apprehension and discomfort when receiving a request; these reactions stemmed from concerns about adequately managing symptoms and suffering, from not wanting to abandon patients, and from an incomplete understanding of a patient&rsquo;s preferences, especially if they did not know the patient well [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/physician-assisted-dying-understanding-evaluating-and-responding-to-requests-for-medical-aid-in-dying/abstract/149\" class=\"abstract_t\">149</a>]. Some physicians report that they regret that they did not provide help to a dying patient. Physicians also reported that participating in &ldquo;assisted suicide,&rdquo; as the language of this study put it, required a large investment of time and was emotionally intense. They sometimes found themselves in tension with highly independent patients who were so determined that it undermined the physician&rsquo;s sense of control. Nevertheless, these physicians did not express major regrets about their decisions, whether they prescribed the lethal medication or not; they said it was &ldquo;the right thing to do,&rdquo; even though some were uncertain about how they might respond to future requests. This study reported that going through the assisted suicide decision-making process &ldquo;had a positive impact on them personally&rdquo; and that it increased their capacity to discuss end of life issues with other patients. </p><p>Studies of PAD or VAE as a secret practice in the United States are very difficult to do [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/physician-assisted-dying-understanding-evaluating-and-responding-to-requests-for-medical-aid-in-dying/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. Yet, the associated secrecy would seem to make the decision-making and grieving process even more complex and difficult for clinicians and family members than it would be in an environment where psychological responses could be openly shared and processed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/physician-assisted-dying-understanding-evaluating-and-responding-to-requests-for-medical-aid-in-dying/abstract/150\" class=\"abstract_t\">150</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2056040994\"><span class=\"h1\">SUMMARY</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Many physicians, particularly those in the fields of oncology and palliative care, will be faced with a request for assistance in dying over their professional lifetimes. No matter where clinicians stand ethically and morally on the permissibility of this practice, and regardless of whether these practices are legally permitted or prohibited in a given jurisdiction, clinicians should carefully consider and decide how they will respond to these requests. (See <a href=\"#H773979840\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Appropriate terminology is debated:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>For the practice where a physician provides a terminally ill patient, at his or her explicit request, with a prescription for a lethal medication that they can take on their own, we use the term physician-assisted dying (PAD). Other terms used to describe this practice are outlined in the table (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PALC%2F102923\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef102923 \">table 1</a>). Where legal, the prescription is for a specific drug (usually a barbiturate), which an appropriately licensed physician may dispense or for which the patient (or a family member) fills a prescription at a pharmacy. (See <a href=\"#H687412701\" class=\"local\">'Physician-assisted dying'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Voluntary active euthanasia (VAE) differs from PAD in that the physician administers the lethal medication at the patient&rsquo;s request, usually by injection. VAE allows a response to a wider range of patient circumstances than PAD (in particular, for patients who are not physically capable of self-administration) and is more certain in its lethal effect. VAE is not legal anywhere in the United States; it is legal in some provinces in Canada and in several European countries. It requires that the patient be facing intolerable suffering that cannot be alleviated in ways acceptable to the patient. (See <a href=\"#H239077773\" class=\"local\">'Voluntary active euthanasia'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>In working clinically, we recommend using the language used by patients and families if they raise the subject or indirectly ask about it. Many will ask to be &ldquo;put to sleep&rdquo; or will use other euphemisms, avoiding terms like &ldquo;death&rdquo; <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> &ldquo;suicide.&rdquo; Asking patients in an open-ended way to clarify exactly what they are asking about is the proper initial response to such a request. (See <a href=\"#H986667984\" class=\"local\">'Terms to use with patients'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>As of October 2017, PAD <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> VAE are legal in the Netherlands, Belgium, Luxembourg, Switzerland, Germany, Colombia, and Canada, while PAD alone is <span class=\"nowrap\">legal/permitted</span> in seven United States jurisdictions: Oregon, Washington, Vermont, Montana, California, Colorado, and the District of Columbia (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PALC%2F101010\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef101010 \">table 2</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PALC%2F101012\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef101012 \">table 3</a>). (See <a href=\"#H3959511334\" class=\"local\">'Current legal status'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Multiple surveys reveal divisions of opinion, especially in North America, about the morality of PAD and VAE. There are also significant framing effects in the public&rsquo;s response to questions about PAD and VAE, based not only on how the questions are phrased, but also on how the answer categories are provided. Support for these practices also varies widely among health care professionals. (See <a href=\"#H2168049655\" class=\"local\">'Attitudes of the public and of physicians'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Although rates of inquiry are high, rates of utilization of <span class=\"nowrap\">PAD/VAE</span> are generally low. Less than 1 percent of all dying Americans, less than 4 percent of those dying in the Netherlands, and less than 7 percent of those dying in Belgium have these interventions. Rates in other European countries are also below 1 percent (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F58741\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef58741 \">table 6</a>). (See <a href=\"#H2921279092\" class=\"local\">'Experiences with PAD and VAE'</a> above and <a href=\"#H1130059683\" class=\"local\">'Practices in Europe'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The majority of requests for VAE or PAD come from patients who have cancer, although the frequency of requests for assisted dying is increasing in other terminal conditions. Although many patients requesting and receiving PAD or VAE have significant physical suffering, the predominant reason for most patients&rsquo; requests seems to have more to do with staying &ldquo;in control&rdquo; of the dying process and avoiding future suffering, rather than escaping from overwhelming, immediate physical suffering, especially uncontrolled pain. Depression, hopelessness, and general psychological distress are consistently associated with initial inquiries about PAD and VAE, but not necessarily with practice. The data are conflicting regarding the frequency with which real or perceived caregiving burden affects the decision to request VAE or PAD among terminally ill patients. (See <a href=\"#H2921279092\" class=\"local\">'Experiences with PAD and VAE'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Most patients who inquire about assisted dying do not follow through with a formal request, and of those who do, many do not die in this way (see <a href=\"#H3557719081\" class=\"local\">'Who asks about assistance in dying?'</a> above). In Oregon, approximately two-thirds of those who receive the medication actually take it. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>When evaluating and responding to requests for PAD or VAE, regardless of whether made urgently or for future assistance, a full evaluation should be undertaken that includes the reason for the request, the adequacy of palliative care, and the availability of alternative treatments to alleviate suffering (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PALC%2F101009\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef101009 \">table 10</a>). Hospice care should be the standard care always made available to dying patients and their families. (See <a href=\"#H2813744498\" class=\"local\">'Potential alternatives to PAD and VAE'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Alternative end of life options to <span class=\"nowrap\">PAD/VAE</span> are outlined in the table (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PALC%2F101014\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef101014 \">table 8</a>). These alternatives should be considered whenever PAD or VAE are being contemplated in earnest. (See <a href=\"#H3010941794\" class=\"local\">'Other end of life options to address suffering unacceptable to the patient'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients who are asking about PAD because they are concerned about what future options they might have if their suffering becomes intolerable (eg, if they develop intractable pain, dyspnea, or severe nausea and uncontrolled vomiting), in-depth exploration of both fears and concerns is central to finding a way of responding to their request, which frequently (but not always) involves palliative options other than PAD. (See <a href=\"#H2559572481\" class=\"local\">'Responding to inquiries about future PAD or VAE'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A request for assistance in dying because of current, unacceptable, predominantly physical suffering should be treated as a medical emergency, ie, not to be deflected or postponed, but addressed immediately and explicitly. The clinician need not immediately act upon the request for PAD or VAE if prompt attention to the patient&rsquo;s suffering provides other ways of reducing distress so it is acceptable to the patient, but postponing attention or ignoring the patient&rsquo;s urgent plea can contribute to even greater distress. The clinician must always assure a patient who has made a request that it can be withdrawn at any time and for any reason. (See <a href=\"#H1021362212\" class=\"local\">'Handling a current urgent request'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>After fully evaluating the patient, but before finally responding to a request for PAD or VAE, clinicians should be fully aware of the law surrounding these practices in their jurisdiction (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PALC%2F101010\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef101010 \">table 2</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PALC%2F101012\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef101012 \">table 3</a>). (See <a href=\"#H2066676423\" class=\"local\">'Assessing decisional capacity'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Several services are available that provide consultation for physicians who are unsure about how to proceed, about legal constraints and about who seeks consultation about a specific case (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PALC%2F101013\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef101013 \">table 7</a>). (See <a href=\"#H234132741\" class=\"local\">'Consultation services for physicians'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Clinicians evaluating patients who have inquired about PAD <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> VAE should also be respectful of their own personal boundaries. Strongly held clinician personal values that would prohibit participation in PAD or VAE should not be violated, even if the practice is legal and the patient would clearly qualify. In such situations, the clinician must be prepared to refer the patient as early as possible to another clinician who can help. If a clinician is considering providing either PAD or VAE where it is not permitted by law, he or she should fully consider the potential psychosocial and legal consequences for him or herself if the act were revealed or discovered. (See <a href=\"#H1993134624\" class=\"local\">'Defining clinician limitations'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Public perception of VAE and PAD is that they are quick, painless, and guaranteed ways to die. The few reported complications are usually associated with incomplete ingestion of the medication in patients undergoing PAD; patients either reawoke or took a very long time to die. (See <a href=\"#H2887509649\" class=\"local\">'Possible complications of performing VAE and PAD'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>PAD is legal under statutes in the United States only for adults 18 years of age or older. PAD <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> VAE are legal for children older than age 12 in Luxembourg and the Netherlands, and for terminally ill children of any age in Belgium (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PALC%2F101012\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef101012 \">table 3</a>).
