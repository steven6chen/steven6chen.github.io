It is also modulated in order to coexist with the mother's immune system. Soon after birth, the newborn is exposed to the &quot;hostile world&quot; of bacteria, viruses, fungi, and parasites and must immediately defend itself. The immunologic competence of the neonate progresses rapidly in the first three months of life as the cells involved in acquired immunity mature and gain antigenic experience. During this period, the neonate mainly depends upon components of the innate or antigen-independent immune system, including phagocytes, natural killer (NK) cells, antigen-presenting cells (APCs), humoral mediators of inflammation, and complement [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/immunity-of-the-newborn/abstract/1-3\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-3</a>]. The breastfed infant also receives antimicrobial components in breast milk that help prevent certain acute infections. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=infant-benefits-of-breastfeeding#H4\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Infant benefits of breastfeeding&quot;, section on 'Anti-microbial components'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=infant-benefits-of-breastfeeding#H9\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Infant benefits of breastfeeding&quot;, section on 'Prevention of illnesses while breastfeeding'</a>.)</p><p>The overall performance of the immune system in the neonatal period is diminished in several important respects. As a result, very young infants are more susceptible than older infants to serious bacterial infection, as well as some viral and fungal infections.</p><p>Specifically, organisms that can cause significant morbidity in neonates include group B streptococci, <em>Escherichia coli</em>, herpes simplex virus (HSV), cytomegalovirus (CMV), varicella-zoster virus (VZV), respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), and <em>Candida</em> species [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/immunity-of-the-newborn/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. These specific organisms cause neonatal infections more frequently than other organisms because the newborn has an increased risk of exposure to these pathogens, not because these organisms have special virulence determinants that are unique.</p><p>This review summarizes the knowledge about the function of the different arms of neonatal immunity, including what is known about neonatal defense against the pathogens mentioned above. More comprehensive reviews are available elsewhere [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/immunity-of-the-newborn/abstract/4-7\" class=\"abstract_t\">4-7</a>]. Additional information about the development of the cellular components of the immune system is provided separately.</p><p>Certain clinical scenarios, such as recurrent severe infections, chronic diarrhea, and failure to thrive, should prompt immediate evaluation for immunodeficiency states. The presentation of these disorders is presented in more detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=severe-combined-immunodeficiency-scid-an-overview\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID): An overview&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=recognition-of-immunodeficiency-in-the-newborn-period\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Recognition of immunodeficiency in the newborn period&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Clinical information regarding the evaluation and management of fever in neonates is reviewed elsewhere.

Leukopenia is seen more commonly in preterm than term infants. In one series, absolute counts of all cord blood immune cell subsets except regulatory T cells were significantly lower in preterm infants compared with term infants [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/immunity-of-the-newborn/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Cellular (T cell-mediated) immunity</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>T cell-mediated cellular immunity is not transferred from mother to fetus, in contrast to humoral immunity (see <a href=\"#H9\" class=\"local\">'Humoral immunity (B cells and immunoglobulins)'</a> below). Thus, young infants rely exclusively on their own T cells, plus elements of the innate immune system, to fight infections caused by intracellular pathogens, respond to vaccination, and reject foreign tissue.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h3\">Skewing of the T helper cell response</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The immune system in the newborn is skewed toward a T helper cell type 2 (Th2) response. A brief review of T helper cells is given here to better understand the role of Th skewing in altered neonatal immune function. Activated T cells are subdivided into distinct functional categories, including helper and regulatory T cells, depending upon the profile of cytokines they secrete [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/immunity-of-the-newborn/abstract/9,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,10</a>].</p><p>Substantial evidence exist that human neonates have a limitation in CD4+ T cell immunity, particularly for T helper cell type 1 (Th1) cells. Upon challenge with immune stimuli, newborn express an innate Th2 and T helper cell type 17 (Th17) polarization, weak Th1 polarization, and low innate antiviral type 1 interferon responses, rendering them vulnerable to certain infections [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/immunity-of-the-newborn/abstract/6,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,11</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=t-helper-subsets-differentiation-and-role-in-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;T helper subsets: Differentiation and role in disease&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=role-of-cytokines-in-the-immune-system#H13\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Role of cytokines in the immune system&quot;, section on 'T cell subsets'</a>.)</p><p>The Th1 response is initiated when a pathogen is taken up by a dendritic cell (DC) or macrophage and induces the production and secretion of the cytokine interleukin-12 (IL-12). IL-12 both stimulates natural killer (NK) cells and induces naive CD4+ T cells to become Th1-type effector cells. These CD4+T and NK cells produce interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma), which in turn activates the infected macrophage and initiates the transcription genes within the nucleus [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/immunity-of-the-newborn/abstract/12,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,13</a>]. Sequelae of IFN-gamma activation on phagocytes include the production of proinflammatory cytokines, such as interleukin-1-beta (IL-1-beta) and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), and further upregulation of IL-12 production. IFN-gamma also promotes pathogen killing by macrophages through an unclear mechanism. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=the-adaptive-cellular-immune-response\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;The adaptive cellular immune response&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The ability of proinflammatory cytokines to induce spontaneous abortion is probably an important reason for the strong bias of the maternal and fetal immune system toward Th2-polarizing cytokines [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/immunity-of-the-newborn/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. Delayed maturation of an IL-12-producing DC subset may explain, at least in part, the early Th2 bias in neonatal immunity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/immunity-of-the-newborn/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. As a consequence, neonates have impaired Th1 responses [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/immunity-of-the-newborn/abstract/15,16\" class=\"abstract_t\">15,16</a>]. The production of IFN-gamma (either by CD4+ T cells, NK cells, or both) is reduced compared with that in adults during some, but not all, infections. In addition, neonatal macrophages and mononuclear phagocytes demonstrate reduced or abbreviated responses to IFN-gamma. These differences may contribute to the pathogenesis of several of the infections that disproportionately afflict neonates. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=immunology-of-the-maternal-fetal-interface\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Immunology of the maternal-fetal interface&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H458140262\"><span class=\"h3\">T cell function</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>T cell function is partially intact at birth. The CD3+CD4+ T helper cells have relatively preserved Th2 responses and can provide help to newborn B cells for antibody synthesis. However, these cells are deficient in Th1-polarizing cytokine production, which is important for cellular immune responses. In addition, the function of neonatal CD3+CD8+ cytotoxic T cells is impaired such that newborns are susceptible to pathogenic viruses requiring T cell cytotoxicity for effective host defense (eg, cytomegalovirus [CMV] or human immunodeficiency virus [HIV]). (See <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Skewing of the T helper cell response'</a> above.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h4\">Viral infections</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Although it is reasonable to speculate that infants might be more susceptible than adults to viral infections, most infants overcome viral infections with little difficulty. Nevertheless, certain specific immune impairments can be demonstrated (these impairments are not virus specific):</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The cytotoxic CD8+ T cell response to CMV is similar in neonates and adults, although the CD4+ T cell response is reduced [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/immunity-of-the-newborn/abstract/17,18\" class=\"abstract_t\">17,18</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Both CD8+ and CD4+ T cells responses to HIV infection appear lower than in adults, probably explaining the rapid progression of the disease in neonates in the absence of antiretroviral therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/immunity-of-the-newborn/abstract/5,19\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,19</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The neonatal adaptive response to herpes simplex virus (HSV) infection is characterized by delayed IFN-gamma production compared with adult cells, possibly accounting for the occasional fulminant infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/immunity-of-the-newborn/abstract/20,21\" class=\"abstract_t\">20,21</a>]. T regulatory CD4+Foxp3+ cells may contribute to the attenuated primary CD8+ and CD4+ T cell responses to HSV type 2 in neonatal mice [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/immunity-of-the-newborn/abstract/22,23\" class=\"abstract_t\">22,23</a>]. In contrast, neonatal NK cells produce the same amount of IFN-gamma when exposed to HSV as adult NK cells [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/immunity-of-the-newborn/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h4\">Graft rejection</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Neonates, including premature infants, are capable of rejecting foreign grafts, solid tissue allografts, transplanted bone marrow, and in utero transfusions of irradiated red blood cell from unrelated donors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/immunity-of-the-newborn/abstract/25-29\" class=\"abstract_t\">25-29</a>]. Thus, the recognition and response to nonself appears to be functional even in utero.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h4\">Vaccination</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The neonatal T cell response to some vaccines is reduced, although responses to others may be vigorous. Infants immunized at birth with anti-hepatitis B (HBVac) or oral poliovirus (OPV) vaccines develop protective but lower Th1-type responses than those seen in adults [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/immunity-of-the-newborn/abstract/30,31\" class=\"abstract_t\">30,31</a>]. In contrast, newborn responses to Bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG), the live-attenuated <em>Mycobacterium bovis</em> vaccine, are vigorous and comparable with adult responses, likely due to the high antigenicity of BCG [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/immunity-of-the-newborn/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>].</p><p>Exposure of cord blood to BCG induces a strong innate response mediated by monocytes and NK cells [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/immunity-of-the-newborn/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>]. IFN-gamma was detected within T cells rather than NK cells in peripheral blood samples collected from infants 13 weeks post-BCG vaccination. This variability may reflect the quality of the signal delivered by antigen-presenting cells (APCs) to T cells rather than an intrinsic difference in T cell function. This hypothesis is supported by the observation that BCG immunization (a strong stimulus for APCs) in infants induced higher cytokine and antibody responses to unrelated vaccines given concomitantly [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/immunity-of-the-newborn/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h4\">Delayed-type hypersensitivity</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Delayed-type hypersensitivity (DTH) skin test responses to antigens such as <em>Candida</em> and tetanus toxoid are absent or decreased in the newborn. These reactions require the presence of functional APCs and antigen-specific CD4+ T cells [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/immunity-of-the-newborn/abstract/25,35\" class=\"abstract_t\">25,35</a>]. The poor response to these antigens is due in part to lack of exposure to antigens, selective defects of T cell cytokines and chemokines, and diminished monocyte chemotaxis. Lack of reactivity generally persists up to one year of age [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/immunity-of-the-newborn/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H458140349\"><span class=\"h3\">Laboratory evaluation of cellular immunity</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Evaluation of T cell-mediated immune function in the newborn and young infant is discussed separately.

The following is a brief review of B cells and immunoglobulin levels in the fetus and newborn. A detailed summary of immunoglobulin levels in infancy is presented elsewhere.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H151779608\"><span class=\"h3\">Immunoglobulins</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In utero, fetal serum immunoglobulin concentrations remain very low (below 100 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL)</span> until 18 to 20 weeks of gestation. Most of the newborn's serum immunoglobulins are derived from the transfer of maternal immunoglobulin G (IgG) across the placenta during the third trimester of pregnancy. At birth, neonatal serum IgG levels are equal or slightly higher than maternal serum IgG levels due to this combination of produced and acquired immunoglobulin (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F99496\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef99496 \">figure 1</a>). This passively acquired IgG includes vaccine antibodies as a result of maternal immunizations given before or during pregnancy. The IgG level gradually falls to approximately 400 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> by three months of age as the maternal IgG is metabolized (IgG half-life approximately 30 days) and then progressively increases as the infant&rsquo;s own IgG synthesis becomes established (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F99496\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef99496 \">figure 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/immunity-of-the-newborn/abstract/37,38\" class=\"abstract_t\">37,38</a>]. This period of low IgG between approximately three to six months of age is termed <strong>physiologic hypogammaglobulinemia of infancy</strong> and is not usually associated with illness.</p><p>Premature infants have lower IgG concentrations due to diminished time for transfer and lower production levels. These infants demonstrate low opsonic activity for all types of organisms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/immunity-of-the-newborn/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>]. Small for gestational age (SGA) neonates may have somewhat lower IgG levels than full-term neonates, possibly reflecting impaired placental transport. In both premature and SGA infants, concentrations may drop further after birth due to the normal &quot;physiologic&quot; hypogammaglobulinemia that occurs in all infants. The period of physiologic hypogammaglobulinemia may also be prolonged by blood loss due to phlebotomy and surgery and is shortened by stimulation such as infection. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=recognition-of-immunodeficiency-in-the-newborn-period#H2424730061\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Recognition of immunodeficiency in the newborn period&quot;, section on 'Secondary immunodeficiency'</a>.)</p><p>Immunoglobulin A (IgA), IgM, immunoglobulin D (IgD), and immunoglobulin E (IgE) do not cross the placenta under normal circumstances, and the presence of elevated levels of IgM or IgA in cord blood suggests intrauterine infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/immunity-of-the-newborn/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>]. In normal infants, IgM concentration rises rapidly from the first month after birth, presumably in response to the massive antigenic stimulation present in the new environment. However, this IgM may not be as functionally effective as antibodies produced later. Specifically, neonatal IgM may not provide sufficient heat-stable opsonins against gram-negative organisms. IgA levels also increase gradually during the first year of life. The breast-fed infant receives maternal secretory IgA antibodies that offer protection against gastrointestinal and respiratory infection. These IgA antibodies are present only in the gastrointestinal tract and upper respiratory tract and are not absorbed into the infant&rsquo;s circulatory system.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H151779770\"><span class=\"h3\">Antibody response</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The newborn and young infant have a limited ability to make antibodies to microbial antigens and certain vaccines. These responses are further blunted by maternal transplacental antibodies to vaccine antigens such as measles, mumps, and rubella [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/immunity-of-the-newborn/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>]. The infant&rsquo;s antibody response is initially an IgM response, followed by an IgG response.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h4\">Protein antigens</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Full-term neonates can produce specific antibodies to T cell-dependent protein antigens, such as tetanus and diphtheria toxoids, hepatitis B surface antigen, and OPV [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/immunity-of-the-newborn/abstract/42,43\" class=\"abstract_t\">42,43</a>]. Even premature infants as young as 24 weeks gestation, as well as SGA infants, respond vigorously to protein vaccines [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/immunity-of-the-newborn/abstract/44,45\" class=\"abstract_t\">44,45</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h4\">Polysaccharide antigens</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In contrast, responses to polysaccharide, T cell-independent antigens, such as the capsular polysaccharides of <em>Haemophilus influenzae</em> type b or Group B streptococci, are severely blunted until approximately 18 to 24 months of age [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/immunity-of-the-newborn/abstract/46-48\" class=\"abstract_t\">46-48</a>]. The same attenuation has been observed in premature and SGA infants.</p><p>IgG2, and to a lesser degree, IgG4, are the predominant antibodies produced following natural exposure to polysaccharide antigens. The blunted response to these antigens could be partially explained by the slow rise of IgG2 and IgG4 concentrations after birth (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F58666\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef58666 \">figure 2</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/immunity-of-the-newborn/abstract/49\" class=\"abstract_t\">49</a>]. It is not clear whether the increased susceptibility of neonates to infections with gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria that express polysaccharide capsules reflects an isolated intrinsic B cell immaturity, decreased function of other cells such as APCs, or both. Deficiencies in the complement system may also contribute to the poor response to polysaccharide antigens. (See <a href=\"#H21\" class=\"local\">'Complement'</a> below.)</p><p>Pneumococcal and <em>H. influenzae</em> conjugate vaccines were devised to circumvent the poor response to polysaccharide antigens by complexing polysaccharide antigens to immunogenic proteins, thus converting them into T cell-dependent antigens [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/immunity-of-the-newborn/abstract/50\" class=\"abstract_t\">50</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H151779854\"><span class=\"h3\">Laboratory evaluation of humoral immunity</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Laboratory evaluation of the humoral immune system in the newborn and young infant is discussed separately.

Newborns must rely on their innate immunity for protection against infection, given the limited exposure to antigens in utero and the relative immaturity of the adaptive immune system [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/immunity-of-the-newborn/abstract/51,52\" class=\"abstract_t\">51,52</a>].</p><p>Innate immunity refers to those components of the immune system that are present at birth and are independent of gene rearrangements. Innate immunity comprises both cellular and soluble, extracellular components expressed at anatomic sites such as the skin, spleen, and mucus membranes, as well as in tissue fluids, blood, and secretions, such as tears and saliva. Although present at birth, innate immunity changes with age, and distinct features of early life innate immunity influence both the risk of infection and responses to vaccines [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/immunity-of-the-newborn/abstract/7,53,54\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,53,54</a>].

Many aspects of these functions are reduced in the neonate.</p><p>The expression of major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I and class II molecules by fetal tissues is evident by 12 weeks gestation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/immunity-of-the-newborn/abstract/55\" class=\"abstract_t\">55</a>]. MHC I and MHC II molecules are required for processing and presentation of intracellular and extracellular antigens, respectively. All of the major antigen presenting cells (APCs), including DCs, <span class=\"nowrap\">monocytes/macrophages,</span> and B cells, are also present by this time. Expression of MHC class II molecules on neonatal APCs is similar to that of adult cells, whereas class I MHC expression on neonatal lymphocytes is less intense than that of adult cells [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/immunity-of-the-newborn/abstract/56,57\" class=\"abstract_t\">56,57</a>]. The relevance of lower class I MHC expression is unclear because generation of functional cytolytic CD8+ T cells is intact based upon the observation that fetal tissues are vigorously rejected after transplantation into non-MHC matched hosts.

They are the primary APCs for na&iuml;ve T cells. Certain properties of neonatal DCs may explain some of the limitations observed in T helper cell type 1 (Th1) immunity. Cord blood monocyte-derived DCs express lower levels of human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-DR, CD1a, and costimulatory molecules, such as CD40 and CD80, than do adult peripheral cells. As a consequence, these cells show decreased allostimulatory activity for T cells. These cells also have a low capacity to produce interleukin-12 (IL-12), which may account for the decreased production of interferon (IFN)-gamma by neonatal CD4+ T cells after allogeneic stimulation with cord blood monocyte-derived DCs as compared with adult DCs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/immunity-of-the-newborn/abstract/60,61\" class=\"abstract_t\">60,61</a>]. These findings may also help explain the reduced delayed-type hypersensitivity (DTH) reactivity seen in neonates.

Neonatal macrophages may have decreased responses to pathogen-derived products like lipopolysaccharide (LPS), as well as to stimulatory mediators like IFN-gamma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/immunity-of-the-newborn/abstract/62,63\" class=\"abstract_t\">62,63</a>].</p><p>LPS is the primary immunostimulatory component of the bacterial wall of this and other gram-negative bacteria. LPS normally induces an inflammatory response by signaling through toll-like receptor 4 (TLR-4) complexed to CD14 and MD-2 (an associated extracellular molecule) on the surface of macrophages. Although neonatal cells appear to have normal levels of each of these components, the signaling that results from the complex is reduced, as is subsequent tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) production [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/immunity-of-the-newborn/abstract/62,63\" class=\"abstract_t\">62,63</a>].

However, ongoing phagocytosis and killing are not sustained in neonatal cells, as demonstrated by a lack of response to IFN-gamma, which enhances and extends killing by adult cells [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/immunity-of-the-newborn/abstract/68\" class=\"abstract_t\">68</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H18\"><span class=\"h3\">Neutrophils</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Granulocytes are white blood cells that have cytoplasmic granules containing cationic antimicrobial proteins and peptides (APPs) that kill micro-organisms <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> disable their toxins by oxygen-dependent and -independent mechanisms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/immunity-of-the-newborn/abstract/69\" class=\"abstract_t\">69</a>].

Neonates manifest both quantitative and qualitative defects in the amplification, mobilization, and function of the neutrophil response.</p><p>The best characterized neutrophil deficit in neonates is the limited ability to accelerate neutrophil production in response to infection, mainly due to a diminished bone marrow pool [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/immunity-of-the-newborn/abstract/70\" class=\"abstract_t\">70</a>]. This deficit is more pronounced in premature infants. Neutropenia is an indicator of poor prognosis in newborns presenting with bacterial sepsis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/immunity-of-the-newborn/abstract/71\" class=\"abstract_t\">71</a>]. Treatment of neonatal sepsis with granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) or granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) was studied. Although cell counts increased, there was no reduction in mortality [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/immunity-of-the-newborn/abstract/72\" class=\"abstract_t\">72</a>]. This suggests that the diminished function of these cells is not due to simple deficiency of these growth factors.

However, decreased activity is seen against <em>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</em>, <em>Staphylococcus aureus</em>, and some strains of group B streptococci due to reduced generation of hydroxyl radicals and bactericidal permeability-increasing (BPI) protein [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/immunity-of-the-newborn/abstract/80,81\" class=\"abstract_t\">80,81</a>]. Some APPs are found in reduced amounts in neonatal neutrophils, including lactoferrin and BPI protein (approximately 50 and 30 percent of adult levels, respectively), although defensin levels are comparable with that in adults [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/immunity-of-the-newborn/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H19\"><span class=\"h3\">Monocytes</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Monocytes, the circulating precursors of macrophages, are amoeboid leukocytes with a large cytoplasm that play a key role in early recognition of microbes and induction of cytokine responses. The number of blood monocytes, as well as the capacity to produce monocytes, is similar in neonates and adults [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/immunity-of-the-newborn/abstract/82\" class=\"abstract_t\">82</a>]. However, the influx of monocytes into sites of inflammation and the subsequent inflammatory response is delayed and attenuated in neonates. These differences compared with adult monocytes are described below:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Neonatal monocytes ingest and kill gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria as effectively as adult monocytes, although IL-12 production by these cells is lower than adult levels following exposure to group B streptococci [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/immunity-of-the-newborn/abstract/83-85\" class=\"abstract_t\">83-85</a>]. MHC class II expression on monocytes is lower in premature than full-term infants, with a greater decrease seen in infants who become septic, suggesting endotoxin hyporesponsiveness (immunoparalysis) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/immunity-of-the-newborn/abstract/3,86\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,86</a>]. Also, monocytes from premature infants produce less TNF-alpha, IL-1, and IL-6 in response to LPS than do term monocytes, which could contribute to susceptibility to gram-negative bacteria [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/immunity-of-the-newborn/abstract/87\" class=\"abstract_t\">87</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Basal TLR expression of blood monocytes from full-term neonates is similar to that of adults, although the functional consequences of neonatal TLR activation are very different. Neonatal monocytes that are activated via PRRs, such as TLRs, have a reduced capacity to produce Th1-polarizing proinflammatory cytokines (eg, TNF-alpha, IL-12p70, and type I interferons [IFN-alpha and IFN-beta]) important to host defense against intracellular pathogens [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/immunity-of-the-newborn/abstract/88\" class=\"abstract_t\">88</a>]. In contrast, TLR-mediated production of IL-6, IL-10, and IL-23 by neonatal monocytes is actually enhanced relative to adult cells. This polarization is beneficial because excessive production of the proinflammatory cytokines is associated with spontaneous abortion and intrauterine growth retardation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/immunity-of-the-newborn/abstract/6,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,7</a>]. However, it leaves newborns and young infants particularly sensitive to infection with a broad array of micro-organisms, including intracellular pathogens that require efficient proinflammatory Th1 cell responses for clearance, such as <em>Listeria monocytogenes</em> and herpes simplex virus (HSV) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/immunity-of-the-newborn/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The response of cord blood monocytes to varicella-zoster virus (VZV) may be impaired compared with that of adult monocytes. In one in vitro study, VZV exposure resulted in the release of large amounts of IFN-gamma from adult monocytes, but release from cord blood monocytes was minimal [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/immunity-of-the-newborn/abstract/1,89\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,89</a>]. The importance of this impaired response is illustrated by the severity of varicella infection that occurs in the perinatal period. If the virus is transmitted to the infant before the mother has mounted a protective immune response and passively transferred protective immunoglobulin to the fetus, then the infant is entirely dependent upon innate immunity for protection. Severe infection with organ involvement and death may result [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/immunity-of-the-newborn/abstract/90\" class=\"abstract_t\">90</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=varicella-zoster-infection-in-the-newborn\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Varicella-zoster infection in the newborn&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) can cause severe neonatal pneumonia and bronchiolitis, with the highest morbidity during the first six months of life [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/immunity-of-the-newborn/abstract/91\" class=\"abstract_t\">91</a>]. Transplacentally transferred maternal antibody against RSV does not protect neonates against infection. However, cord blood mononuclear cells respond to RSV with the release of various cytokines and chemokines. The profile of the released cytokines differs from that of adult cells, with overproduction of &quot;innate&quot; cytokines (particularly IL-6, TNF-alpha, and IL-10) and minimal release of &quot;adaptive&quot; cytokines, whereas adult cells released both types of cytokines, suggesting that the adaptive response may be critical for a successful immune defense [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/immunity-of-the-newborn/abstract/92\" class=\"abstract_t\">92</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Monocyte chemotaxis may also be diminished in infants and young children.

Neonatal monocytes produce higher levels of the proinflammatory cytokines IL-6 and IL-8 (compared with adult monocytes) in response to stimulation with HSV-1, which is consistent with the exaggerated clinical manifestations of the disease that can be seen [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/immunity-of-the-newborn/abstract/94,95\" class=\"abstract_t\">94,95</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H151780535\"><span class=\"h3\">Natural killer cells</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>NK cells are lymphoid cells that express a broad array of activating and inhibiting receptors (eg, TLRs) but not antigen-specific receptors. They play an important role in the response to virus-infected and malignant cells. The percentage of NK cells in cord blood is often slightly lower than in the blood of children and adults; however, the absolute number is approximately the same, owing to the higher lymphocyte count in infancy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/immunity-of-the-newborn/abstract/96\" class=\"abstract_t\">96</a>]. NK cells are distinct from cytolytic CD8+ T cells by their capacity to mediate non-MHC restricted natural cytotoxicity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/immunity-of-the-newborn/abstract/97\" class=\"abstract_t\">97</a>]. NK cells also kill target cells that are coated with IgG antibodies in a process known as antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC). NK cells express killer inhibitory receptors (KIRS) that recognize certain MHC antigens and inhibit the killing of normal allogeneic cells.</p><p>CD56 is an NK cell-specific marker whose presence on the cell surface parallels cytolytic function. Approximately 50 percent of neonatal NK cells are CD56-. Consistent with this, the capacity of full-term and premature infant cord blood NK cells to mediate cytolysis is roughly one-half (15 to 60 percent in various studies) that of adult NK cells [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/immunity-of-the-newborn/abstract/98-100\" class=\"abstract_t\">98-100</a>]. Neonatal NK cell ADCC activity is also reduced to approximately 50 percent of adult NK cells [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/immunity-of-the-newborn/abstract/100\" class=\"abstract_t\">100</a>]. However, when exposed to different cytokines such as IL-2, IL-12, IL-15, and IFN-gamma, circulating neonatal NK cells increase cytotoxic activity to adult levels [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/immunity-of-the-newborn/abstract/101\" class=\"abstract_t\">101</a>]. Similarly, when exposed to HSV, IFN-gamma production is identical in neonatal and adult NK cells [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/immunity-of-the-newborn/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. These findings suggest that there is no intrinsic abnormality in the NK cells of neonates.

Low C3 levels, as well as reduced levels of complement receptor 2 (CR2, CD21) on B cells, are believed to play a role in the poor response to polysaccharide antigens as such antigens are capable of activating complement through the alternative pathway [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/immunity-of-the-newborn/abstract/103,105\" class=\"abstract_t\">103,105</a>].

This relative deficiency in multiple plasma complement components probably contributes to the increased risk of bacterial sepsis in neonates, particularly in those born prematurely.
