In addition, parents are often anxious about the surgery, further increasing the anxiety level of their children. Children's preoperative anxiety can influence their postoperative pain experiences. Effective measures to reduce preoperative anxiety also improve postoperative pain. Thus, whenever possible, children and their families should be educated about the T&amp;A procedure using a comprehensive approach in an effort to reduce anxiety and improve postoperative recovery.</p><p>A prospective study of 241 children, aged 5 to 12 years, undergoing T&amp;A found that the children who were more anxious preoperatively experienced significantly more pain postoperatively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tonsillectomy-and-or-adenoidectomy-in-children-preoperative-evaluation-and-care/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>]. These children consumed more pain medication, had a higher incidence of emergence delirium after anesthesia, and had a higher incidence of postoperative anxiety and sleep problems.</p><p>Children perceived a comprehensive family-centered, behaviorally-oriented approach to pain education as helpful. A prospective study of 408 children who were scheduled to undergo elective surgery compared standard preoperative care with standard care plus one of three additional measures: a preoperative program consisting of a 23-minute videotape, three pamphlets, and a mask practice kit, parental presence during induction of anesthesia, or oral <a href=\"topic.htm?path=midazolam-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">midazolam</a> preoperatively prior to parental separation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tonsillectomy-and-or-adenoidectomy-in-children-preoperative-evaluation-and-care/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>]. The parents and children who underwent the preoperative preparation program had significantly lower anxiety in the preoperative holding area and were less anxious during induction of anesthesia than parents and children in the other three groups. These children also had a lower incidence of emergence delirium after surgery, required significantly less analgesia in the recovery room, and were discharged from the recovery room earlier.</p><p>Providing children with a preoperative pain education booklet alone made no difference in children's postoperative pain level, quality of pain, anxiety level, sleep, or oral intake in one study [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tonsillectomy-and-or-adenoidectomy-in-children-preoperative-evaluation-and-care/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>].
