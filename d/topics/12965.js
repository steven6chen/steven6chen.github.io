The first antrectomy for gastric cancer was performed by Ludwik Rydygier in 1880 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/partial-gastrectomy-and-gastrointestinal-reconstruction/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. The patient lived for 12 hours, passing away from postoperative shock. The first antrectomy in which the patient survived the operation was performed by Theodor Billroth in 1881 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/partial-gastrectomy-and-gastrointestinal-reconstruction/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. The patient subsequently passed away from metastatic disease. Antral resection was felt by many to be too severe for the treatment of benign disease, but partial gastrectomy became the treatment of choice for ulcer disease after a seminal paper was published in 1910 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/partial-gastrectomy-and-gastrointestinal-reconstruction/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>]. However, surgery is uncommonly needed in the era of modern anti-ulcer therapies, being reserved predominantly for complications or refractory disease. </p><p>The extent of gastric resection and type of reconstruction chosen impacts the nature of perioperative and later complications, particularly the development of postgastrectomy syndromes. In Japan and other countries where the incidence of early gastric cancer is common, function-preserving techniques, including pylorus preserving segmental gastrectomy (PPSG) and vagus nerve preservation, have been promoted. The role of these techniques in treating patients in North America has not been well studied. A variety of options following partial gastrectomy are available to restore gastrointestinal continuity, the most common of which are the Billroth I, Billroth II, and Roux-en-Y reconstructions. </p><p>The indications and techniques for partial gastric resection and reconstruction, perioperative care, and complications will be reviewed here. The diagnosis and management of pathologies that may indicate the need for partial gastric resection are discussed in separate topic reviews. Total gastrectomy and reconstruction are discussed separately.

Duodenal continuity is important for preventing loss of fat-soluble vitamins, while jejunal continuity is important for preventing retrograde flow of jejunal contents, which can occur because transection of the jejunum interrupts the electrical activity normally initiated by the duodenal pacemaker, thus impairing antegrade peristalsis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/partial-gastrectomy-and-gastrointestinal-reconstruction/abstract/55\" class=\"abstract_t\">55</a>]. </p><p>Ideally, gastric reconstruction would avoid adverse consequences related to the loss of stomach tissue and function (ie, postgastrectomy syndromes), but each type of reconstruction is associated with, at a minimum, some degree of dumping (early or late) since the pylorus is typically removed (except for pylorus-preserving segmental gastrectomy). The characteristics and postgastrectomy syndromes associated with each of these reconstructions are given in the table (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F89212\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef89212 \">table 5</a>).

This reconstruction preserves jejunal but not duodenal continuity and is used when a Billroth I reconstruction is not possible, such as with more extended distal gastrectomy (ie, more than the antrum is resected). The Billroth II reconstruction has an afferent limb from the duodenum and an efferent limb extending distally. For a Billroth II reconstruction, the jejunal anastomosis can be performed in an antecolic or retrocolic, isoperistaltic or antiperistaltic fashion (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F80302\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef80302 \">figure 14</a>).

However, Roux-en-Y reconstruction may lead to gastric atony and this, together with the adverse effect of jejunal transection, contributes to a syndrome of abdominal pain and vomiting, known as the &quot;Roux syndrome&quot; or &quot;Roux stasis syndrome&quot;. Patients with severe Roux stasis syndrome may require completion gastrectomy.<strong> </strong>(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=postgastrectomy-complications\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Postgastrectomy complications&quot;</a>.)<strong> </strong></p><p>Roux-en-Y gastrojejunostomy can be used in the same situations as a Billroth II, although it does not preserve duodenal or jejunal continuity.

The optimal length of the afferent limb has received little attention. There is a balance between a limb that is too short, which increases the risk of bile (alkaline) reflux gastritis, and one that is too long, which may increase the risk of Roux stasis syndrome. In observational studies, the appropriate length to minimize reflux and reduce the risk of Roux stasis syndrome appears to be approximately 40 cm [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/partial-gastrectomy-and-gastrointestinal-reconstruction/abstract/57-59\" class=\"abstract_t\">57-59</a>].

However, based upon randomized trials, Roux-en-Y reconstruction appears to be tolerated better overall and leads to a better quality of life compared with Billroth reconstruction (Billroth I or Billroth II). Whether to preferentially perform a Roux-en-Y in patients whose anatomy supports a Billroth I or Billroth II, or convert to a Roux-en-Y only if complications occur remains controversial. For patients who have not undergone vagotomy, we suggest a primary Roux-en-Y reconstruction. Patients who have had a vagotomy have an increased risk of roux stasis syndrome.

(See <a href=\"#H465972182\" class=\"local\">'Follow-up'</a> above and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=surgical-management-of-invasive-gastric-cancer#H23\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Surgical management of invasive gastric cancer&quot;, section on 'Posttreatment surveillance'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Several reconstructions are used to restore gastrointestinal continuity following partial gastrectomy. The most common are the Billroth I, Billroth II, and Roux-en-Y reconstructions with the choice between these depending upon the remnant anatomy available for reconstruction and the status of the vagus nerves. For patients who have not undergone vagotomy, we suggest Roux-en-Y reconstruction over Billroth reconstruction (Billroth I or Billroth II) (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=5\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2B</a>). (See <a href=\"#H182357342\" class=\"local\">'Gastrointestinal reconstruction'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Complications following partial gastrectomy can be related to anatomic or physiologic alterations. The most concerning postoperative complication is anastomotic leak. The nature and severity of postgastrectomy syndromes depend upon the extent of gastric resection and the type of gastric reconstruction (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F89212\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef89212 \">table 5</a>).
