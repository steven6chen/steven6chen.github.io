However, glaucoma is more accurately defined as an optic neuropathy involving a characteristic atrophy of the optic nerve head, which may or may not be accompanied by elevated IOP. In open-angle glaucoma, optic nerve damage results in a progressive loss of retinal ganglion cell axons, which is manifested initially as visual field loss and, ultimately, irreversible blindness if left untreated [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/open-angle-glaucoma-treatment/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p>This topic will focus on the treatment of primary open-angle glaucoma, where the etiology is unknown. Treatment of known causes (eg, uveitis, trauma, glucocorticoid therapy), in addition to lowering IOP, should be considered in patients with secondary open-angle glaucoma. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=uveitis-treatment\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Uveitis: Treatment&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=major-side-effects-of-systemic-glucocorticoids#H8\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Major side effects of systemic glucocorticoids&quot;, section on 'Ophthalmologic effects'</a>.)</p><p>Glaucoma in children, angle-closure glaucoma, and epidemiology and diagnosis of open-angle glaucoma are discussed elsewhere.

In a meta-analysis of two randomized trials of patients with open-angle glaucoma, those randomly assigned to IOP-lowering treatment were less likely to have progression of visual field <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> optic disc deterioration compared with those randomly assigned to placebo (hazard ratio [HR] 0.65, 95% CI 0.49-0.87) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/open-angle-glaucoma-treatment/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p>Other factors such as blood supply, nerve metabolism, and extracellular matrix likely play a role in the progressive optic neuropathy of glaucoma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/open-angle-glaucoma-treatment/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. However, treatment targeting these other factors in patients with open-angle glaucoma has not been well studied [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/open-angle-glaucoma-treatment/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].</p><p>Therapy must be individualized, taking into account the patient's disease state, target pressure, and medical comorbidities. Patient education, informed participation in decision-making, and emphasis on adherence are particularly important, since open-angle glaucoma is largely asymptomatic. (See <a href=\"#H6891123\" class=\"local\">'Medication adherence'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H447093519\"><span class=\"h1\">INITIATION OF THERAPY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There is no clear consensus regarding a threshold intraocular pressure (IOP) for the initiation of open-angle glaucoma treatment. Randomized trials that investigated the effect of lowering IOP in patients with elevated IOP without visual defects have found some benefit in delaying or preventing the onset of open-angle glaucoma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/open-angle-glaucoma-treatment/abstract/2,6,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,6,7</a>]. However, there are patients with IOP 22 to 24 mmHg who have thicker corneas and healthy optic nerves by field <span class=\"nowrap\">testing/imaging</span> and do not require treatment.</p><p>Most clinicians would initiate treatment for a patient with two instances of IOP &gt;25 mmHg, while some would do so for IOP &gt;22 mmHg. Alternatively, a patient with an IOP of 18 who has cupping and field loss should be treated for glaucoma. A randomized trial comparing treatment with a prostaglandin inhibitor or placebo in 516 patients with newly diagnosed glaucoma (mean IOP approximately 19 mmHg) is ongoing to evaluate visual field outcomes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/open-angle-glaucoma-treatment/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].</p><p>Patients at high risk for visual field deterioration should also be treated. In an exploratory analysis of a randomized trial, patients with disc hemorrhage had more rapid visual field deterioration over a mean of 12 years than patients without disc hemorrhage (mean rate of change -0.17 versus -0.07) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/open-angle-glaucoma-treatment/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. Thus, patients with disc hemorrhage require a more aggressive approach to therapy.</p><p>Open-angle glaucoma tends to be bilateral but can be quite asymmetric. The decision to treat is made for each eye rather than for each patient. Monocular treatment may be indicated, at least initially.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2211761117\"><span class=\"h1\">CHOOSING THERAPY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Intraocular pressure (IOP) can be lowered by pharmacologic therapy, laser therapy, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> surgery (see <a href=\"#H447093482\" class=\"local\">'Types of therapy'</a> below). In the United States, medical therapy is generally undertaken before laser or surgical therapy.</p><p>A panel of United States glaucoma experts recommended medical therapy as initial treatment, using RAND Corporation consensus methodology in combination with an evidence-based review [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/open-angle-glaucoma-treatment/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. A subsequent American Academy of Ophthalmology technology assessment found that initial argon laser trabeculoplasty has acceptable long-term efficacy compared with initial medical therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/open-angle-glaucoma-treatment/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. Two subsequent systematic reviews concluded that it is unclear whether medical or surgical treatments are more effective at preventing visual deterioration and improving patient-reported outcomes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/open-angle-glaucoma-treatment/abstract/12,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,13</a>]. All available studies have methodologic weaknesses. We recommend pharmacologic or laser therapy as first-line treatment of open-angle glaucoma, especially in light of well-documented complications associated with surgical therapy.</p><p>A representative trial is the Collaborative Initial Glaucoma Treatment Study (CIGTS) of 607 patients with newly diagnosed open-angle glaucoma that examined the benefits of medical versus surgical therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/open-angle-glaucoma-treatment/abstract/14,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">14,15</a>]. The primary outcome, visual field loss, did not differ between the two groups at four to five years of follow-up. Quality-of-life measures were also similar. The IOP in the medical and surgical therapy groups averaged 17 to 18 mmHg and 14 to 15 mmHg, respectively. The patients who underwent surgery (trabeculectomy) had a higher rate of cataract requiring removal and more local eye symptoms. There was also minimal change in visual field loss between the medical and surgical treatment arms at nine-year follow-up [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/open-angle-glaucoma-treatment/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. However, initial surgery was beneficial in a subset of patients with severe visual field loss at baseline and was detrimental in those patients with diabetes. Patients undergoing surgery were still at increased risk of cataract requiring removal after a median follow-up of eight years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/open-angle-glaucoma-treatment/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>].</p><p>If medical therapy has been chosen as initial treatment for open-angle glaucoma, prostaglandins are generally considered first-line therapy. Most [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/open-angle-glaucoma-treatment/abstract/18-20\" class=\"abstract_t\">18-20</a>], but not all [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/open-angle-glaucoma-treatment/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>], meta-analyses have found prostaglandins to be more effective than beta blockers, carbonic anhydrase inhibitors, and alpha adrenergic agonists for the treatment of open-angle glaucoma. In addition, initial therapy with prostaglandins has been suggested by consensus panels, in part due to the low side effect profile [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/open-angle-glaucoma-treatment/abstract/10,22\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,22</a>]. Beta blockers may be more appropriate as initial therapy for those patients who cannot afford a topical prostaglandin.</p><p>Combining drops from different classes (ie, beta blocker plus prostaglandin, or beta blocker plus carbonic anhydrase inhibitor) can cause a greater reduction in the IOP than monotherapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/open-angle-glaucoma-treatment/abstract/18,23,24\" class=\"abstract_t\">18,23,24</a>], and several drugs are available as fixed combination products. Adding a second medication is reasonable if initial monotherapy is not effective.</p><p>Patients with advanced open-angle glaucoma who do not respond to medications or laser therapy should be offered surgical intervention [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/open-angle-glaucoma-treatment/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>].</p><p>The optimal therapy for patients with normal-pressure glaucoma remains uncertain, but control of IOP remains one major goal [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/open-angle-glaucoma-treatment/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. Thus, similar treatment strategies are generally applied for patients with high- and normal-pressure glaucoma.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H447093482\"><span class=\"h1\">TYPES OF THERAPY</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6891053\"><span class=\"h2\">Pharmacologic therapy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Topical medications work either by increasing aqueous outflow (prostaglandins, alpha adrenergic agonists, cholinergic agonists) or by decreasing aqueous production (alpha adrenergic agonists, beta blockers, carbonic anhydrase inhibitors) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F76771\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef76771 \">table 1</a>). Systemic carbonic anhydrase inhibitors also decrease aqueous production. </p><p>Pharmacologic therapy often requires administration of multiple medications. Many older drugs require dosing three or four times a day. Newer drugs can be administered once or twice daily, but these drugs can be expensive in the United States.</p><p>Glaucoma medications have potential side effects and may be particularly inconvenient to use for some older adult or incapacitated patients.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6891060\"><span class=\"h3\">Prostaglandins</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The topical prostaglandins are increasingly chosen over topical beta blockers and other medications as initial therapy in open-angle glaucoma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/open-angle-glaucoma-treatment/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. Prostaglandins may decrease IOP more than beta-blockers. In meta-analyses of randomized trials comparing prostaglandins and beta blockers in patients with primary open-angle glaucoma, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=latanoprost-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">latanoprost</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=bimatoprost-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">bimatoprost</a> were found to have greater reductions in IOP compared with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=timolol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">timolol</a> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/open-angle-glaucoma-treatment/abstract/18,27\" class=\"abstract_t\">18,27</a>]. Although all of the prostaglandins were associated with hyperemia, latanoprost was less likely to cause hyperemia compared with bimatoprost.</p><p>Prostaglandins have been consistently shown in randomized trials to be effective and well tolerated, with few systemic side effects [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/open-angle-glaucoma-treatment/abstract/18,20,28,29\" class=\"abstract_t\">18,20,28,29</a>]. Generic <a href=\"topic.htm?path=latanoprost-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">latanoprost</a> is available in the United States as of March 2011. Proprietary prostaglandins are expensive, which may impact drug adherence. Prostaglandins do have the advantage of once--daily dosing.</p><p>In addition to conjunctival hyperemia, ocular side effects include eye irritation, increase in the number and length of eyelashes, and changes in iris and lash pigmentation; the latter two are most notable if only one eye is treated. Local irritation (itching and dryness) may be due to corneal irritation from benzalkonium chloride, used as a preservative in several preparations. <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tafluprost-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Tafluprost</a> is available in the United States as of April 2012 (and has been available in other countries previously) and contains no preservative. However, refrigeration and care in handling the single-use packets is needed to minimize risk of infection, with immediate discard of any unused solution [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/open-angle-glaucoma-treatment/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6891067\"><span class=\"h3\">Beta blockers</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Beta-blockers have traditionally been considered first-line therapy, but more recent publications promote prostaglandins for initial therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/open-angle-glaucoma-treatment/abstract/31-33\" class=\"abstract_t\">31-33</a>]. Randomized trials have found that topical beta blockers (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=timolol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">timolol</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=betaxolol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">betaxolol</a>) can lower IOP, have a long duration of action which allows once- or twice-daily dosing, and are associated with few ocular side effects [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/open-angle-glaucoma-treatment/abstract/21,34,35\" class=\"abstract_t\">21,34,35</a>]. As an example, one meta-analysis of randomized trials found a weak, borderline benefit of beta blockers in preventing incidence of visual field deficits in patients with primary open-angle glaucoma or ocular hypertension, compared with placebo or no treatment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/open-angle-glaucoma-treatment/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>].</p><p>Major side effects are similar to those associated with systemic beta blocker therapy, including worsening of heart failure, bradycardia, heart block, and increased airway resistance, and topical beta blockers are contraindicated in some patients with cardiac or pulmonary disease. Airway obstruction has been reported with topical beta blocker therapy even in patients who do not have a history of airway disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/open-angle-glaucoma-treatment/abstract/36,37\" class=\"abstract_t\">36,37</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=major-side-effects-of-beta-blockers\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Major side effects of beta blockers&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6891074\"><span class=\"h3\">Other drugs</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Alpha adrenergic agonists (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=brimonidine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">brimonidine</a>) appear to be similarly effective to beta blockers in lowering IOP in open-angle glaucoma, but are associated with a number of ocular side effects including allergic conjunctivitis, hyperemia, and ocular pruritus [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/open-angle-glaucoma-treatment/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>]. The nonselective agents (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=epinephrine-adrenaline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">epinephrine</a>) also may be associated with arrhythmia, hypertension, and tachycardia.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Alpha adrenergic agonists may have a role in treatment of normal pressure glaucoma. In a randomized trial of 99 patients with open-angle glaucoma and IOP &lt;22 mmHg, those assigned to <a href=\"topic.htm?path=brimonidine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">brimonidine</a> were less likely to experience progression of visual field deficit compared with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=timolol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">timolol</a>, after a mean follow-up of 30 months [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/open-angle-glaucoma-treatment/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>]. However, patients receiving brimonidine were more likely to drop out, most commonly due to localized ocular allergy. As the mean IOP in both arms was similar throughout the study period, any effectiveness of brimonidine in delaying or preventing visual field progression is likely due to a mechanism not related to IOP reduction.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Systemic carbonic anhydrase inhibitors have largely been replaced by newer topical preparations that have fewer systemic side effects. Topical carbonic anhydrase inhibitors do not appear to be as effective in treating open-angle glaucoma compared with other pharmacologic therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/open-angle-glaucoma-treatment/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Cholinergic agonists have fewer systemic adverse effects than beta blockers, but ocular side effects such as fixed, small pupils, myopia, and increased subjective visual disturbance related to coexistent cataract have decreased the popularity of these drugs.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Combination products are available for several classes of drugs, including a carbonic anhydrase <span class=\"nowrap\">inhibitor/alpha</span> agonist; an alpha <span class=\"nowrap\">agonist/beta</span> blocker; and a beta <span class=\"nowrap\">blocker/carbonic</span> anhydrase inhibitor [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/open-angle-glaucoma-treatment/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>]. Such combinations should not be used as initial treatment, but for patients requiring treatment with two of these drug classes they offer convenience and cost advantages. Combination products containing prostaglandin analogs are available in Canada but not in the United States.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6891081\"><span class=\"h2\">Laser therapy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Laser therapy (trabeculoplasty) increases aqueous outflow. Randomized trials confirm that it is successful in lowering IOP for patients with open-angle glaucoma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/open-angle-glaucoma-treatment/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>]. A review of the literature, prepared for the American Academy of Ophthalmology, found high-quality evidence that the long-term efficacy of initial argon laser trabeculoplasty is comparable with initial medical therapy for open-angle glaucoma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/open-angle-glaucoma-treatment/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. The report found no literature to establish the superiority of newer forms of laser trabeculoplasty over the argon laser. The cost-effectiveness of laser therapy compared with prostaglandin medications for newly diagnosed, mild open-angle glaucoma is about equivalent in one modelling study; laser therapy may be slightly more cost-effective if, as expected, medical adherence in community settings is lower than reported in clinical trials, while medication provides somewhat greater value assuming optimal adherence [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/open-angle-glaucoma-treatment/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6891088\"><span class=\"h2\">Surgery</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Surgical therapy involves the creation of a filtration bleb to allow egress of aqueous humor from the eye. This is an alternative route to the normal pathway via the trabecular meshwork and the canal of Schlemm (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F71234\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef71234 \">figure 1</a>).</p><p>Filtration surgery sometimes fails because of excessive scar tissue formation. There are reports of the use of adjuncts before, during, or after surgery, such as beta irradiation and antimetabolites (5-fluorouracil and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=mitomycin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">mitomycin</a> C), to increase the rate of surgical success [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/open-angle-glaucoma-treatment/abstract/43,44\" class=\"abstract_t\">43,44</a>]. There is great variation in use and choice of adjuncts worldwide, and adjuncts can be associated with a higher complication rate. For example, beta irradiation at the time of trabeculectomy can minimize scar tissue formation and increase the likelihood that surgery will effectively lower the IOP, but increases the risk of cataract formation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/open-angle-glaucoma-treatment/abstract/45\" class=\"abstract_t\">45</a>]. Successful repeat trabeculectomy using topical mitomycin C adjunctively has been reported in patients who do not achieve or sustain normal IOP readings with their initial surgery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/open-angle-glaucoma-treatment/abstract/46\" class=\"abstract_t\">46</a>].</p><p>Glaucoma surgery sometimes involves the placement of mechanical shunts (also called &quot;valves&quot;). Shunts are typically only placed in patients with advanced disease in whom medical and laser therapies are inadequate and who have an underlying diagnosis that increases the risk of failure of conventional surgery (eg, neovascular glaucoma, cornea transplant, iridocorneal endothelial [ICE] syndrome). An expanding role for shunts may be emerging, including use in eyes that have had previous conjunctival incisions (cataract extraction). A 2017 meta-analysis that included three randomized controlled trials (380 patients; very low-quality evidence) found that the IOP was not different in patients who underwent aqueous shunt compared with trabeculectomy (mean difference 2.55 mmHg, 95% CI -0.78 to 5.87) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/open-angle-glaucoma-treatment/abstract/47\" class=\"abstract_t\">47</a>]. Visual acuity and number of antiglaucoma medications needed were also not different between the groups. The largest trial reporting outcomes at five years found that, while the IOP and visual acuity were similar in both groups, fewer patients receiving a shunt required reoperation compared with those who underwent trabeculectomy (9 versus 29 percent, respectively) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/open-angle-glaucoma-treatment/abstract/48\" class=\"abstract_t\">48</a>].</p><p>Surgical therapy is associated with a number of attendant risks and complications, including cataract and permanent loss of vision. There is a group of interventions emerging called &ldquo;minimally invasive glaucoma surgery&rdquo; (MIGS), which offers promise as a less risky approach to surgical control of glaucoma progression [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/open-angle-glaucoma-treatment/abstract/49\" class=\"abstract_t\">49</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6891109\"><span class=\"h1\">TARGET INTRAOCULAR PRESSURE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Once glaucoma is diagnosed, the treating clinician typically defines a target pressure at which no further damage is likely to occur for that eye. A damaged nerve, as assessed by imaging <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> field testing, is likely to require a lower target pressure.</p><p>There are no standard guidelines for the optimal target intraocular pressure (IOP). The Early Manifest Glaucoma Trial (EMGT) study found a graded effect of IOP lowering and risk of visual field loss [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/open-angle-glaucoma-treatment/abstract/50\" class=\"abstract_t\">50</a>]. Ophthalmologists must determine appropriate target pressures for individual patients and individual eyes, with adjustments based on close follow-up of visual fields and evaluation for cup progression. The target pressure must be lowered if nerve damage occurs despite achieving the target. Typically, patients with more advanced disc damage and field loss need lower target pressures.</p><p>Data from EMGT and the Collaborative Initial Glaucoma Treatment Study (CIGTS) have suggested a target IOP of &ge;25 to 30 percent below initial IOP [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/open-angle-glaucoma-treatment/abstract/14,15,50\" class=\"abstract_t\">14,15,50</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6891116\"><span class=\"h1\">MONITORING</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients with open-angle glaucoma require lifetime therapy and monitoring of intraocular pressure (IOP), the optic disc, and visual fields. Some ophthalmologists also use optical coherence tomography, which may be more sensitive than visual field testing in identifying progression in early glaucoma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/open-angle-glaucoma-treatment/abstract/51\" class=\"abstract_t\">51</a>]. The appropriate interval for follow-up varies based upon the extent of damage, whether or not there is recent disease progression, the stability of IOP control, and the level of adherence with medical therapy and follow-up care. Most patients with open-angle glaucoma are seen at least twice yearly. Patients with progressive disease may require assessment every one to three months. When there is evidence of progression, we seek to reduce the IOP by adding or changing pharmacologic agents or by performing laser therapy or surgery as described above.</p><p>Patients who undergo glaucoma surgery also require regular monitoring for failure of the filtration bleb and the development of cataracts.

In a cross-sectional observational study of over 1000 patients on a variety of topical and oral therapies, 24.7 percent were non-adherent, with non-adherence associated with male sex and increased dosing frequency of the prescribed medications [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/open-angle-glaucoma-treatment/abstract/52\" class=\"abstract_t\">52</a>]. Glaucoma therapy and monitoring are often neglected as patients age and become less able to care for themselves and more apparent concerns move to the forefront. Prospective population-based studies of glaucoma tend to be confounded by high dropout rates for this reason [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/open-angle-glaucoma-treatment/abstract/53\" class=\"abstract_t\">53</a>].</p><p>Bottles containing ophthalmic drops generally have different color caps depending on the pharmacologic class.

(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=open-angle-glaucoma-epidemiology-clinical-presentation-and-diagnosis#H447095064\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Open-angle glaucoma: Epidemiology, clinical presentation, and diagnosis&quot;, section on 'Screening'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"PATIENT_INFORMATION\"><span class=\"h1\">INFORMATION FOR PATIENTS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>UpToDate offers two types of patient education materials, &ldquo;The Basics&rdquo; and &ldquo;Beyond the Basics.&rdquo; The Basics patient education pieces are written in plain language, at the 5<sup>th</sup> to 6<sup>th</sup> grade reading level, and they answer the four or five key questions a patient might have about a given condition. These articles are best for patients who want a general overview and who prefer short, easy-to-read materials. Beyond the Basics patient education pieces are longer, more sophisticated, and more detailed. These articles are written at the 10<sup>th</sup> to 12<sup>th</sup> grade reading level and are best for patients who want in-depth information and are comfortable with some medical jargon.</p><p>Here are the patient education articles that are relevant to this topic. We encourage you to print or e-mail these topics to your patients. (You can also locate patient education articles on a variety of subjects by searching on &ldquo;patient info&rdquo; and the keyword(s) of interest.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Basics topics (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=open-angle-glaucoma-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">&quot;Patient education: Open-angle glaucoma (The Basics)&quot;</a>)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6891144\"><span class=\"h1\">SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Lowering intraocular pressure (IOP) is the primary goal of therapy, which has been shown to reduce the progression of visual field loss. IOP can be lowered by pharmacologic therapy, laser therapy, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> surgery. (See <a href=\"#H6891046\" class=\"local\">'Goals of therapy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>There is no clear consensus regarding a threshold IOP for the initiation of treatment. We suggest initiating treatment for patients with two instances of IOP &gt;25 mmHg (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). (See <a href=\"#H447093519\" class=\"local\">'Initiation of therapy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Once the decision has been made to treat a patient with open-angle glaucoma, we recommend pharmacologic or laser therapy as first-line treatment rather than surgery (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=2\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1B</a>). (See <a href=\"#H2211761117\" class=\"local\">'Choosing therapy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>If pharmacologic therapy is chosen, we suggest topical prostaglandins as first-line pharmacologic therapy rather than other topical or systemic medications (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=5\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2B</a>). (See <a href=\"#H2211761117\" class=\"local\">'Choosing therapy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Combining drops from different classes (ie, beta blocker plus prostaglandin or beta blocker plus carbonic anhydrase inhibitor) can cause a greater reduction in the IOP than monotherapy. Adding a second medication is reasonable if initial monotherapy is not effective. (See <a href=\"#H2211761117\" class=\"local\">'Choosing therapy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The target IOP and subsequent monitoring intervals depends on several factors, including the extent of intraocular damage, whether or not there is recent progression of damage, the stability of IOP, and the level of patient adherence. (See <a href=\"#H6891109\" class=\"local\">'Target intraocular pressure'</a> above and <a href=\"#H6891116\" class=\"local\">'Monitoring'</a> above and <a href=\"#H6891123\" class=\"local\">'Medication adherence'</a> above.)</p></div><div id=\"topicAgreement\">Use of UpToDate is subject to the <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/legal/license\" class=\"licenseLink\" id=\"sla_in_page\">Subscription and License Agreement</a>.</div><div id=\"references\" class=\"headingAnchor\"><h1>REFERENCES</h1><ol id=\"reference\"><li><a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/open-angle-glaucoma-treatment/abstract/1\" class=\"nounderline abstract_t\">Weinreb RN, Khaw PT.
