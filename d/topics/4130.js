Some of these products may be substituted by the transfusion service if FFP has been ordered.</p><p>FFP is a licensed plasma product that must be prepared from whole blood or apheresis and frozen within eight hours of collection. Additional products include the following:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Plasma Frozen Within 24 Hours After Phlebotomy (PF24)</strong> &ndash; Plasma Frozen Within 24 Hours After Phlebotomy (PF24) is plasma that is frozen more than eight hours but less than 24 hours after collection. This product is also referred to as Frozen Plasma.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Thawed Plasma</strong> &ndash; Thawed Plasma is plasma that was frozen (ie, FFP or PF24), thawed, and kept at refrigerator temperature for up to five days.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Liquid Plasma</strong> &ndash; Liquid Plasma is plasma that has never been frozen.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong><span class=\"nowrap\">Solvent/Detergent</span> Plasma <span class=\"nowrap\">(S/D</span> Plasma)</strong> &ndash; <span class=\"nowrap\">Solvent/Detergent</span> <span class=\"nowrap\">(S/D)</span> Plasma is plasma treated with viral inactivating agents (eg, solvents and detergents) prior to freezing.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Plasma Cryoprecipitate Reduced</strong> &ndash; Plasma Cryoprecipitate Reduced is plasma from which Cryoprecipitate has been removed. This product is also referred to as Cryo-Poor Plasma. </p><p/><p>In addition to <span class=\"nowrap\">S/D</span> plasma, other methods for pathogen inactivation of plasma, such as <span class=\"nowrap\">psoralen/ultraviolet</span> (UV) light, are available. These systems are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pathogen-inactivation-of-blood-products\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pathogen inactivation of blood products&quot;</a>.)</p><p>In clinical practice, physicians in most hospitals who wish to transfuse plasma will place an order either for FFP or for &quot;plasma&quot; without further specification. The transfusion service will fill that order using FFP, PF24, or Thawed Plasma according to inventory management practices, without notifying the physician of which specific product is used. Most plasma transfused in the United States is PF24, not FFP.</p><p>FFP, PF24, and Thawed Plasma are generally considered clinically interchangeable (ie, of equivalent efficacy) because they contain essentially the same amounts of coagulation factors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-use-of-plasma-components/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. However, none of these products have been directly compared with each other in randomized trials. Ideally, the policy concerning which of these products can be used (or substituted) will have been previously established by appropriate hospital committees.</p><p>Units of FFP, PF24, and Thawed Plasma are also comparable in volume, since each is prepared from a unit of whole blood. However, there is some inherent variability in volume among plasma units based on differences in hematocrit between donors. In some hospitals, larger volume plasma units prepared by apheresis may also be available.</p><p>The use of plasma products is thought to be unnecessarily high in the United States [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-use-of-plasma-components/abstract/2,3\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,3</a>], as well as in other countries [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-use-of-plasma-components/abstract/4-6\" class=\"abstract_t\">4-6</a>], despite the presence of guidelines concerning their use [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-use-of-plasma-components/abstract/7,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,8</a>]. Many experts believe that the use of plasma for transfusion should be closely monitored and curtailed wherever possible, both because plasma products carry infectious and other risks, and because plasma serves as a limited resource for the further manufacture of plasma derivatives (eg, albumin, gamma globulin, purified coagulation factors) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-use-of-plasma-components/abstract/9,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,10</a>]. Guidelines for the use of plasma in trauma and other emergency settings are under active evaluation. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=massive-blood-transfusion#H8\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Massive blood transfusion&quot;, section on 'Trauma'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9714875\"><span class=\"h2\">FFP</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Fresh Frozen Plasma (FFP) is prepared from single units of whole blood or from plasma collected by apheresis techniques. It is frozen at -18 to -30&deg;C within eight hours of collection and, when appropriately stored, is usable for one year from the date of collection. Standard FFP units derived from a single unit of whole blood have a volume of approximately 200 to 250 mL; &quot;jumbo&quot; units prepared by apheresis may be as large as 600 mL.</p><p>FFP contains all of the coagulation factors and other proteins present in the original unit of blood, slightly diluted by the citrate-containing anticoagulant solution used to collect the blood.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9715088\"><span class=\"h2\">Plasma Frozen Within 24 Hours After Phlebotomy (PF24)</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Plasma frozen within 24 hours of collection (rather than eight hours for FFP) is a licensed product called PF24, or Frozen Plasma. PF24 maintains all the clotting factors at approximately the same levels as in FFP, except that factor VIII levels are in the range of 65 to 80 percent of normal and protein C is decreased [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-use-of-plasma-components/abstract/11-13\" class=\"abstract_t\">11-13</a>]. While other factor levels may also be slightly reduced, these levels are perfectly acceptable for normal coagulation, especially in light of the fact that the &quot;normal&quot; range of factor VIII is roughly 50 to 150 percent of normal [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-use-of-plasma-components/abstract/11,12,14-16\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,12,14-16</a>].</p><p>Of note, PF24 was previously called FP24.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9715100\"><span class=\"h2\">Thawed Plasma</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In the 1996 edition of Standards for Blood Banks and Transfusion Services, the transfusion expiration time for FFP was extended from no more than 24 hours after thawing to up to five days when stored at refrigerator temperature (ie, 1 to 6&deg;C), when used to treat coagulopathies other than factor VIII deficiency [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-use-of-plasma-components/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. This component, which after 24 hours of storage must be relabeled as &quot;Thawed Plasma,&quot; and which, as a non-US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) licensed product, cannot be shipped across state lines, is a valuable and versatile product. Studies have confirmed earlier observations regarding the stability of clotting factors other than factors V and VIII in Thawed Plasma that has been stored at refrigerator temperatures for up to five days [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-use-of-plasma-components/abstract/11,14,18-22\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,14,18-22</a>].</p><p>Thawed Plasma has the advantage of being available for immediate use; this is particularly important in both emergency department and operating room settings. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=initial-management-of-moderate-to-severe-hemorrhage-in-the-adult-trauma-patient\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Initial management of moderate to severe hemorrhage in the adult trauma patient&quot;</a>.)</p><p>However, Thawed Plasma should not be used as a predominant source of either factor V or factor VIII, and its usefulness in neonates is not yet known. In one study, levels of plasticizers (eg, di(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate, DEHP) leached from the plastic storage bags increased from 22 ppm at the time of thawing to 66 ppm on day 5, suggesting that such long storage of Thawed Plasma may not be safe for neonates and infants [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-use-of-plasma-components/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>].</p><p>The use of Thawed Plasma as an alternative to FFP or PF24 simplifies the logistics of managing bleeding patients in complex settings, and also provides the additional benefit of a substantial reduction in the wastage of FFP or PF24 thawed for use and discarded when not transfused within the first 24 hours [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-use-of-plasma-components/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. This is a particularly valuable benefit to minimize the wastage of group AB plasma, which is often in short supply.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9715717\"><span class=\"h2\">Liquid Plasma</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Liquid Plasma is plasma that has never been frozen. It is separated and infused no later than five days after the expiration date of the whole blood from which it is prepared; it is stored at 1 to 6&deg;C. Some trauma surgeons use liquid plasma in early trauma management based on the potential role of an &quot;endotheliopathy&quot; associated with severe trauma that responds better to plasma that has never been frozen; improved outcomes with this have not been demonstrated by a randomized controlled trial. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9715112\"><span class=\"h2\">Solvent/Detergent-Treated Plasma (S/D Plasma)</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Because plasma is essentially acellular, it can be virally inactivated using agents that would otherwise lyse cellular blood components. Treatment of pooled plasma prior to freezing with a solvent and a nonionic detergent inactivates a number of viruses with lipid envelopes, including HIV, hepatitis B virus, and hepatitis C virus [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-use-of-plasma-components/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. Non-lipid-enveloped viruses (eg, hepatitis A virus, parvovirus B19) are not inactivated by this process, nor are prions. The <span class=\"nowrap\">Solvent/Detergent</span> <span class=\"nowrap\">(S/D)</span> method is similar to that used to inactivate viruses in <a href=\"topic.htm?path=immune-globulin-intravenous-subcutaneous-and-intramsucular-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">immune globulin</a> and coagulation factors.

Methods of preparation include lyophilization (removal of liquid under vacuum pressure) and spray-drying (exposure of a stream of plasma to high temperature gas for less than a second to remove liquid without denaturing proteins). The major advantage of these products is that they can be stored at room temperature, making them potentially available in settings that lack on-site equipment for freezing, refrigerating, and thawing. Various products have been developed for military use, and some of these are available from French and German manufacturers, including lyophilized plasma treated with pathogen inactivation technologies and single donor plasm [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-use-of-plasma-components/abstract/26,27\" class=\"abstract_t\">26,27</a>].
