These tumors have been referred to as &quot;epitheliomas&quot; because of their low metastatic potential. However, the term carcinoma is appropriate, since they are locally invasive, aggressive, and destructive of skin and the surrounding structures including bone (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F68274%7EDERM%2F81632\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef68274 graphicRef81632 \">picture 1A-B</a>).</p><p>The epidemiology, pathogenesis, clinical presentation, and differential diagnosis of BCC will be reviewed here. The treatment and prognosis of BCC are discussed separately.

The American Cancer society estimates that in 2012, 5.4 million cases of nonmelanoma skin cancers (NMSCs) were diagnosed in 3.3 million people, of which approximately 8 in 10 cases would have been BCC [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-pathogenesis-and-clinical-features-of-basal-cell-carcinoma/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. A population-based study with several methodologic limitations estimated that 3.5 million NMSCs were treated in the United States in 2006 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-pathogenesis-and-clinical-features-of-basal-cell-carcinoma/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. One study using data from a commercially insured population in the Unites States estimated an age-adjusted prevalence and incidence of BCC of 226 and 343 per 100,000 persons per year, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-pathogenesis-and-clinical-features-of-basal-cell-carcinoma/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].</p><p>In addition, an incidence-based mathematical model supports a high prevalence of nonmelanoma skin cancer in the United States [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-pathogenesis-and-clinical-features-of-basal-cell-carcinoma/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. According to the model, approximately 13 million white non-Hispanic individuals living in the United States in 2007 may have had a personal history of at least one NMSC.</p><p>Individuals with a history of BCC are at increased risk for subsequent lesions. Approximately 40 percent of patients who have had one BCC will develop another lesion within five years, although the probability of developing a subsequent BCC following a first BCC is significantly less than after a non-first BCC (12.8 versus 33.9 percent at one year; 20 versus 51.8 percent at two years; and 34.6 versus 75 percent at five years) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-pathogenesis-and-clinical-features-of-basal-cell-carcinoma/abstract/5-7\" class=\"abstract_t\">5-7</a>].

In white populations in the United States, the incidence of BCC has increased by more than 10 percent per year, and the lifetime risk of developing a BCC is 30 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-pathogenesis-and-clinical-features-of-basal-cell-carcinoma/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. An increasing incidence over time has also been noted in other countries, such as Canada, Finland, and Australia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-pathogenesis-and-clinical-features-of-basal-cell-carcinoma/abstract/9-11\" class=\"abstract_t\">9-11</a>]. Of greater concern, there may be an increasing incidence of aggressive-growth histologic subtypes, which are more difficult to treat [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-pathogenesis-and-clinical-features-of-basal-cell-carcinoma/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The incidence in men is 30 percent higher than in women, particularly with the superficial type [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-pathogenesis-and-clinical-features-of-basal-cell-carcinoma/abstract/9,13,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,13,14</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>There is striking geographic variation in incidence.

Northern European countries, such as Finland, have an incidence one-fourth that of the Midwestern United States. This contrasts with Australia where rates are 40 times that of Finland [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-pathogenesis-and-clinical-features-of-basal-cell-carcinoma/abstract/9,10,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,10,13</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The incidence of BCC increases with age; persons aged 55 to 75 have about a 100-fold higher incidence of BCC than those younger than 20 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-pathogenesis-and-clinical-features-of-basal-cell-carcinoma/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. Although increasing longevity may underlie some of the increasing incidence of BCC, the incidence of BCC among Americans younger than 40 also appears to be increasing, particularly among women [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-pathogenesis-and-clinical-features-of-basal-cell-carcinoma/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">RISK FACTORS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Both environmental and genetic factors contribute to the development of BCC. Exposure to ultraviolet (UV) radiation in sunlight is the most important. Other established risk factors include chronic arsenic exposure, radiation therapy, long-term immunosuppressive therapy, and the basal cell nevus syndrome. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">UV radiation</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H66376604\"><span class=\"h3\">Sun exposure</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Sun exposure is the most important environmental cause of BCC, and most risk factors relate directly to a person's sun exposure habits or susceptibility to solar radiation. These risk factors include having fair skin, light-colored eyes, red hair, northern European ancestry, older age, childhood freckling, and an increased number of past sunburns [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-pathogenesis-and-clinical-features-of-basal-cell-carcinoma/abstract/18-20\" class=\"abstract_t\">18-20</a>].</p><p>The type, quantity, and timing of sun exposure associated with an increased risk of BCC are not clearly defined. Childhood sun exposure appears to be more important than exposure during adult life [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-pathogenesis-and-clinical-features-of-basal-cell-carcinoma/abstract/18,21\" class=\"abstract_t\">18,21</a>]. Evidence supporting this hypothesis comes from case control studies and clinical trials [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-pathogenesis-and-clinical-features-of-basal-cell-carcinoma/abstract/19-22\" class=\"abstract_t\">19-22</a>]. </p><p>In a Canadian case control study that included 226 men with BCC and 406 age-matched controls, the development of BCC was strongly correlated with childhood and adolescent sun exposure but <strong>not</strong> cumulative or recent sun exposure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-pathogenesis-and-clinical-features-of-basal-cell-carcinoma/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. In other studies, however, adult sun exposure was a risk factor for BCC [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-pathogenesis-and-clinical-features-of-basal-cell-carcinoma/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. </p><p>The frequency and intensity of sun exposure may also be important. Solar exposure in intermittent, intense increments increases the risk of BCC more than a similar dose delivered more continuously over the same period of time [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-pathogenesis-and-clinical-features-of-basal-cell-carcinoma/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. Evidence in renal transplant recipients provides additional support to the concept that acute or intermittent sun exposure increases the risk of BCC [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-pathogenesis-and-clinical-features-of-basal-cell-carcinoma/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=development-of-malignancy-following-solid-organ-transplantation#H14\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Development of malignancy following solid organ transplantation&quot;, section on 'Sun exposure and skin cancer'</a>.)</p><p>Additional, indirect support for an important role for sun exposure is derived from a large, nested case-control study of female nurses [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-pathogenesis-and-clinical-features-of-basal-cell-carcinoma/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. In the study, a contributory role of extensive sun exposure was suggested by the finding that women in the highest quartile for baseline serum vitamin D levels were at greater risk for the subsequent development of BCC than women in the lowest quartile (odds ratio 2.07, 95% CI 1.52-2.80). The authors proposed that the plasma vitamin D level was a potential indicator of the degree of long-term sun exposure. A prospective cohort study from the same population demonstrated a relative risk of 2.35 for BCC in participants in the highest quintile of cumulative UV flux in adulthood [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-pathogenesis-and-clinical-features-of-basal-cell-carcinoma/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>].</p><p>It has been estimated that aggressive sun protection before the age of 18 years could reduce the number of nonmelanoma skin cancers (NMSCs) by almost 80 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-pathogenesis-and-clinical-features-of-basal-cell-carcinoma/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. Several trials provide evidence that sunscreen use decreases the incidence of SCCs and that there are no adverse effects from sunscreen use [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-pathogenesis-and-clinical-features-of-basal-cell-carcinoma/abstract/28-30\" class=\"abstract_t\">28-30</a>]. However, a randomized trial evaluating the effects of sunscreen and the antioxidant <a href=\"topic.htm?path=beta-carotene-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">beta-carotene</a> over a four-year period found that those using topical sunscreen had a 40 percent reduction in SCCs but no decrease in BCCs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-pathogenesis-and-clinical-features-of-basal-cell-carcinoma/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>].

A cohort study of approximately 73,000 female nurses found that women who used tanning beds more than six times per year during high school or college were more likely to develop BCC than women who did not use tanning booths during these time periods (adjusted hazard ratio 1.73, 95% CI 1.52-1.98) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-pathogenesis-and-clinical-features-of-basal-cell-carcinoma/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>].</p><p>A contribution of ultraviolet light exposure from indoor tanning to BCC is also suggested by the results of a 2012 meta-analysis of observational studies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-pathogenesis-and-clinical-features-of-basal-cell-carcinoma/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>]. Subjects with a history of any tanning bed use were more likely to develop BCC than those who had never used tanning beds (relative risk 1.29, 95% CI 1.08-1.53). The relative risk for BCC for individuals who began tanning prior to age 25 was 1.40 (95% CI 1.29-1.52).</p><p>A subsequent population-based case-control study, including approximately 650 cases of BCCs and 450 controls, found that tanning bed users had a 60 percent increased risk of developing a BCC at or before the age of 50 years (odds ratio 1.6; 95% CI 1.3-2.1) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-pathogenesis-and-clinical-features-of-basal-cell-carcinoma/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>]. The risk was doubled for those reporting a first use of tanning devices before the age of 20. </p><p>However, the possibility that the association between tanning bed use and BCC in fair-skinned individuals is overestimated due to confounding cannot be excluded. Tanning bed use may be a marker of populations more exposed to the sun. Studies have shown that tanning bed users are more likely to be regular sunbathers and to have poorer sun-protection behavior than nonusers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-pathogenesis-and-clinical-features-of-basal-cell-carcinoma/abstract/35,36\" class=\"abstract_t\">35,36</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h3\">Therapeutic exposure</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Therapeutic exposure to psoralen plus ultraviolet A light (PUVA) for cutaneous disorders such as psoriasis increases the risk of NMSC, particularly SCC [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-pathogenesis-and-clinical-features-of-basal-cell-carcinoma/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>]. The risk of BCC in patients treated with PUVA is lower than the risk for cutaneous SCC. In a 30-year prospective cohort study documenting the incidence of NMSC in patients given PUVA for psoriasis, the increase in risk for BCC was modest compared with cutaneous SCC [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-pathogenesis-and-clinical-features-of-basal-cell-carcinoma/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>].

Although some observational studies have reported a small increased risk for BCC after UVB therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-pathogenesis-and-clinical-features-of-basal-cell-carcinoma/abstract/40,41\" class=\"abstract_t\">40,41</a>], others have reported no increased risk [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-pathogenesis-and-clinical-features-of-basal-cell-carcinoma/abstract/42-45\" class=\"abstract_t\">42-45</a>]. As an example, in a retrospective study of 3867 phototherapy patients (of which 352 received &ge;100 narrowband UVB treatments), narrowband UVB was not associated with an increased risk of BCC, except in cases where patients were treated with both narrowband UVB and PUVA [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-pathogenesis-and-clinical-features-of-basal-cell-carcinoma/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H347651021\"><span class=\"h3\">Photosensitizing drugs</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The association of BCC with ultraviolet light exposure has led to questions about the impact of photosensitizing drugs on development of BCC.

In addition, an American population-based case-control study of 1567 adults with BCC and 1906 controls found a minor increase in risk for multiple BCC (odds ratio 1.4, 95% CI 1.0-2.1) and BCC before the age of 51 (odds ratio 1.5, 95% CI 1.1-2.1) among participants who recalled use of a photosensitizing medication [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-pathogenesis-and-clinical-features-of-basal-cell-carcinoma/abstract/46\" class=\"abstract_t\">46</a>].

The latency period for development of BCCs is about 20 years, and lesions are limited to sites within the radiation field. Due to the advent of other effective therapies, the use of ionizing radiation for the treatment of inflammatory skin conditions has declined.</p><p>Ionizing radiation used to treat childhood cancers also increases the risk for the subsequent development of BCC. This was illustrated in a study of 776 subjects, five of whom developed BCCs, approximately 10-fold more than was expected in this population [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-pathogenesis-and-clinical-features-of-basal-cell-carcinoma/abstract/55\" class=\"abstract_t\">55</a>]. All of the BCCs were located within the radiation field. In addition, a case-control study of 199 patients with a history of both childhood cancer and BCC and 597 controls with a history of childhood cancer without BCC found a linear dose-response relationship between the radiation dose and risk for BCC [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-pathogenesis-and-clinical-features-of-basal-cell-carcinoma/abstract/56\" class=\"abstract_t\">56</a>].

(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nevoid-basal-cell-carcinoma-syndrome\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Nevoid basal cell carcinoma syndrome&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=the-genodermatoses#H523750964\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;The genodermatoses&quot;, section on 'Xeroderma pigmentosum'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H27\"><span class=\"h1\">DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Clinicians who are familiar with the clinical manifestations of BCC are often able to make the diagnosis based upon clinical examination. Even so, a skin biopsy is usually performed to provide histologic confirmation of the diagnosis. </p><p>In cases for which the clinical diagnosis of BCC appears certain and the tumor lacks clinical features associated with a high risk for tumor recurrence, clinicians experienced in the diagnosis of BCC sometimes elect to perform the biopsy at the same time as definitive treatment (eg, immediately prior to electrodesiccation and curettage). In addition, some clinicians choose to treat lesions without a biopsy when high-risk clinical features are absent and the patient has a history of multiple similar low-risk BCCs. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-basal-cell-carcinomas-at-high-risk-for-recurrence#H12329758\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of basal cell carcinomas at high risk for recurrence&quot;, section on 'Features associated with high risk for recurrence'</a>.)</p><p>However, the decision not to perform a biopsy prior to definitive treatment is not without risk. Because the histologic features of a tumor provide additional information on the risk for tumor recurrence following treatment, not performing a biopsy prior to definitive treatment may result in a failure to detect a tumor with aggressive histologic features that might be best managed with a different approach to therapy. The misdiagnosis of a different tumor as BCC (eg, amelanotic melanoma) is an additional risk of deferring a biopsy (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F62791%7EDERM%2F51998\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef62791 graphicRef51998 \">picture 6A-B</a>).

Although these tumors have a low metastatic potential, they are locally invasive and can be destructive of skin and the surrounding structures (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F68274%7EDERM%2F81632\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef68274 graphicRef81632 \">picture 1A-B</a>).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>BCC is the most common malignancy of Caucasians, and its incidence is increasing worldwide. BCC has been linked to exposure to ultraviolet (UV) light, especially during childhood. Most other risk factors act through an interaction with UV exposure. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Epidemiology'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>About 70 percent of BCCs present on the face and head. The most common presentations for BCC are the nodular and superficial forms, which together account for about 90 percent of cases. (See <a href=\"#H21\" class=\"local\">'Clinical presentation'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Biopsies are useful for confirming a diagnosis of BCC and determining the histologic subtype of a tumor. A biopsy is particularly indicated in cases in which the diagnosis is uncertain, the patient lacks a history of BCC, the lesion exhibits features suggestive of an increased risk for tumor recurrence after treatment, or when the tumor exhibits atypical clinical features. (See <a href=\"#H27\" class=\"local\">'Diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Once the diagnosis is established, appropriate treatment offers a high probability of cure, although the patient remains at increased risk for additional skin malignancies.
