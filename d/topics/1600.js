The number of new cases peaked in April 2013 and then declined [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/avian-influenza-a-h7n9-epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>], likely related, at least in part, to implementation of control strategies including closure of live bird markets and increased public awareness. Since then, annual epidemics have occurred during influenza season; most cases have occurred in China [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/avian-influenza-a-h7n9-epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/10-13\" class=\"abstract_t\">10-13</a>].

One study, which was based on the first four human isolates, showed the following results [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/avian-influenza-a-h7n9-epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The novel H7N9 avian influenza A virus appears to have derived from at least four different avian influenza viruses. The H7 gene is genetically close to sequences isolated from ducks in Zhejiang province. The NA gene is genetically close to genes from H7N9 viruses isolated from wild ducks in South Korea. The six internal genes are clustered together with H9N2 viruses isolated from poultry and ducks in China. Analyses suggest at least two different origins of H9N2 viruses, one for the NS gene and one for the remaining internal genes. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Detailed analyses show that ducks and chickens probably acted as intermediate hosts in which viruses reassorted, leading to the emergence of this novel virus. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The authors hypothesize that the HA genes were circulating in wild birds and ducks along the East Asian flyway (which covers eastern China, South Korea, and Japan) and that the NA genes were introduced from European lineages and transferred to ducks in China by wild birds through migration along the East Asian flyway. H9N2 avian influenza viruses circulating in chicken and duck populations in eastern China possibly reassorted with the H7 and N9 avian influenza viruses in ducks, which led to the emergence of the new H7N9 lineage. After these reassortment events took place, the new H7N9 viruses began to circulate in chickens. The isolates causing the human cases and avian outbreaks appear to form two separate subclades, with one of the human isolates differing from the other three in the HA, NA, and internal genes. </p><p/><p>The role of avian species in the spread of infection is discussed below. (See <a href=\"#H322712181\" class=\"local\">'Role of avian species'</a> below.) </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H718998919\"><span class=\"h2\">Genetic characteristics</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Several genetic characteristics of the first four avian influenza A H7N9 viruses isolated from humans in 2013, as well as isolates collected at a Shanghai market from a pigeon, a chicken, and the environment, have allowed experts to evaluate and possibly predict the behavior of H7N9 influenza viruses in humans and birds [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/avian-influenza-a-h7n9-epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The HA cleavage sequence possesses a single basic amino acid, suggesting that these viruses are of low pathogenicity in avian species [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/avian-influenza-a-h7n9-epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. This has important public health implications, since viruses with low pathogenicity are able to spread in poultry undetected and potentially cause &quot;silent&quot; epidemics and outbreaks resulting in sporadic infections in humans who come into direct contact with infected birds. In contrast, highly pathogenic avian influenza viruses (such as H5N1) have a series of basic amino acids at the HA cleavage site that confer virulence and kill birds rapidly. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The amino acid sequence of the receptor-binding site of HA determines the preference for human-type (alpha 2-6 galactose) or avian-type (alpha 2-3 galactose) receptors. Certain mutations at the HA receptor-binding site (eg, the Q226L mutation) may increase the binding of avian influenza viruses to human-type receptors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/avian-influenza-a-h7n9-epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/14,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">14,15</a>]. In one study, recombinant viruses containing avian influenza A H7N9 HA genes possessing the Q226L or Q226I mutation bound preferentially to human-type receptors, whereas a recombinant virus lacking these mutations bound equally well to both human-type and avian-type receptors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/avian-influenza-a-h7n9-epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H74441494\" class=\"local\">'Receptor and tissue tropism'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Several other nucleotide sequences are present in the avian influenza A H7N9 isolates that are expected to increase virulence in mammals [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/avian-influenza-a-h7n9-epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. </p><p/><p>Avian influenza A H7N9 viruses isolated during the second wave in late 2013 and early 2014 differed genetically in five of eight RNA segments from viruses isolated during the first wave in early 2013 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/avian-influenza-a-h7n9-epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. The five novel RNA segments were similar to those of locally circulating H9N2 influenza viruses, suggesting that continued reassortment with H9N2 influenza viruses occurred during the second wave.</p><p>Viruses isolated during the fifth wave in late 2016 and early 2017 belong to two distinct lineages, the Pearl River Delta and Yangtze River Delta lineages [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/avian-influenza-a-h7n9-epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. Among 74 hemagglutinin gene sequences tested, 69 (93 percent) have been Yangtze River Delta lineage viruses. Preliminary data suggest that Yangtze River Delta viruses have reduced cross-reactivity with existing candidate vaccine viruses, whereas Pearl River delta viruses are well inhibited by antisera raised to candidate vaccine viruses. These results indicate that the Yangtze River Delta lineage viruses are antigenically distinct from earlier H7N9 viruses. </p><p>All avian influenza A H7N9 viruses isolated during the first four waves were low pathogenic avian influenza viruses, but analysis of 10 specimens, including 3 from humans, during the fifth wave show that these viruses contain a four amino acid insertion in a host protease cleavage site in the hemagglutinin protein that is characteristic of highly pathogenic avian influenza viruses [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/avian-influenza-a-h7n9-epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. However, there is no evidence yet that this mutation has been associated with a change in pathogenicity or transmissibility in humans [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/avian-influenza-a-h7n9-epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H74441454\"><span class=\"h1\">PATHOGENESIS</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H74441494\"><span class=\"h2\">Receptor and tissue tropism</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Tropism of avian influenza A H7N9 viruses for human-type (alpha 2-6 galactose) or avian-type (alpha 2-3 galactose) receptors may affect their pathogenicity (see <a href=\"#H718998919\" class=\"local\">'Genetic characteristics'</a> above). Human upper respiratory tract tissues and trachea contain mainly alpha 2-6 galactose receptors, whereas human lung tissues contain a mixture of alpha 2-3 galactose and alpha 2-6 galactose receptors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/avian-influenza-a-h7n9-epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. Avian influenza A H7N9 viruses appear to bind to human-type receptors, suggesting that they have tropism for cells in the human upper and lower respiratory tract and that they may be transmissible among humans [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/avian-influenza-a-h7n9-epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/20,23-26\" class=\"abstract_t\">20,23-26</a>]. However, in one study, the H7 hemagglutinin showed a strong preference for binding avian-type receptors over human-type receptors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/avian-influenza-a-h7n9-epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>].</p><p>In a study in which sections of explanted human tracheal and lung tissues were infected with avian influenza A H7N9, epithelial cells in the lower respiratory tract and type II pneumocytes in alveoli were susceptible to infection as evidenced by the expression of viral nucleoprotein; the virus titer in lung tissues was approximately 10-fold higher than in tracheal tissues and the viruses bound to both human-type and avian-type receptors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/avian-influenza-a-h7n9-epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>].</p><p>Influenza virus infection begins with attachment of hemagglutinin to the cellular receptor and subsequent fusion of viral envelope and cellular endosomal membrane [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/avian-influenza-a-h7n9-epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. Posttranslational cleavage of hemagglutinin by host protease is a prerequisite for fusion and therefore for virus infectivity, tissue tropism, and pathogenicity. Transmembrane protease S2 (TMPRSS2) is a host protease that cleaves and activates the hemagglutinin of influenza viruses in the human respiratory tract. In a genome-wide association study, a polymorphism that upregulates TMPRSS2 expression was associated with severe H7N9 influenza infection.</p><p>Receptor binding and tissue tropism among avian influenza A H5N1 viruses are discussed separately.

To date, there is no evidence of sustained human-to-human transmission, although several small clusters of infections have been reported. (See <a href=\"#H2853520\" class=\"local\">'Epidemiology'</a> below.)</p><p>Ferrets are often used as a model for human influenza infections because transmission is similar in ferrets and humans. In some studies in ferrets, avian influenza A H7N9 viruses isolated from humans were transmitted via respiratory droplets [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/avian-influenza-a-h7n9-epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/20,24,29,30\" class=\"abstract_t\">20,24,29,30</a>]. However, in another study in ferrets, these viruses were transmitted efficiently by direct contact, but were not readily transmissible via respiratory droplets [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/avian-influenza-a-h7n9-epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H74441507\"><span class=\"h2\">Chemokines and cytokines</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>High levels of chemokines and cytokines might contribute to the severity of infection. In a study that measured the concentrations of chemokines and cytokines in the serum of patients with avian influenza A H7N9 infection, the levels of several chemokines and cytokines (eg, interferon inducible protein-10 [IP-10], monocyte chemoattractant protein-1, interleukin [IL]-6, IL-8) were elevated compared with levels in healthy individuals [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/avian-influenza-a-h7n9-epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. </p><p>In another study, IP-10, IL-6, IL-17, and IL-2 concentrations were increased in the serum of patients infected with avian influenza A H7N9 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/avian-influenza-a-h7n9-epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>].

The majority of cases have occurred in mainland China, but a few cases have been reported elsewhere. (See <a href=\"#H1498234893\" class=\"local\">'Geographic distribution'</a> below.)</p><p>Of 130 laboratory-confirmed cases, the median age of patients was 62 years (interquartile range 47 to 73 years) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/avian-influenza-a-h7n9-epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. In contrast, the median age of avian influenza A H5N1 cases in China is 26 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/avian-influenza-a-h7n9-epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/9,38\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,38</a>].

In urban areas, the male-to-female ratio was 2.9 to 1, whereas in rural areas, the ratio was 1.6 to 1; this difference is likely due to varying patterns of exposure to poultry, with men in urban areas having greater exposure to poultry in live markets. </p><p>Forty-seven of 111 cases (42 percent) occurred in patients &ge;65 years of age [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/avian-influenza-a-h7n9-epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>]. Of the first 100 adult cases, men and women were equally represented in the youngest age group (20 to 34 years), but men were two- to threefold more frequently affected in older age groups [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/avian-influenza-a-h7n9-epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>]. Few cases have been detected in children.

In a case-control study, chronic medical conditions (excluding hypertension) were a risk factor for infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/avian-influenza-a-h7n9-epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>]. In another study, obesity, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and immunosuppressive medications were associated with avian influenza A H7N9 infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/avian-influenza-a-h7n9-epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>].

The man became ill five to six days after his last exposure to poultry, and his daughter, who had no known exposure to poultry, provided bedside care to him while he was hospitalized and became ill six days after her last contact with him. The viruses isolated from these patients were nearly identical. Forty-three close contacts of both patients were identified. One had mild illness but had negative results for avian influenza A H7N9 virus by real-time reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction. All 43 close contacts tested negative for avian influenza A H7N9 hemagglutinin-inhibition antibodies.</p><p>Likely nosocomial transmission was reported in China, involving a 57-year-old man admitted for an exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease who developed influenza-like symptoms after sharing a hospital ward for five days with a patient who was ill with influenza A H7N9 infection after visiting a live poultry market [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/avian-influenza-a-h7n9-epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/48\" class=\"abstract_t\">48</a>]. Genome sequences of the viruses isolated from both patients were nearly identical to one another and were also genetically similar to a fecal virus isolate from a chicken at the live poultry market.</p><p>Among 2675 close contacts of 139 confirmed cases, respiratory symptoms developed in 28 (1 percent) during the seven-day surveillance period [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/avian-influenza-a-h7n9-epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. All of the throat swabs collected from these 28 individuals were negative for avian influenza A H7N9 by real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction. In another study, none of 330 close contacts of 14 patients who died from avian influenza A H7N9 infection developed infection within seven days of monitoring [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/avian-influenza-a-h7n9-epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/49\" class=\"abstract_t\">49</a>].</p><p>One case of human coinfection with avian influenza A H7N9 and influenza A H3N2 was reported in a previously healthy 15-year-old boy in Jiangsu province, China [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/avian-influenza-a-h7n9-epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/50\" class=\"abstract_t\">50</a>].

The earliest cases occurred in eastern China, but additional cases have been detected in other parts of mainland China as well as in Hong Kong, Macao, Taiwan, Malaysia, and Canada. Since then, annual epidemics have occurred during influenza season. The largest wave was the fifth wave in late 2016 and early 2017. (See <a href=\"#H2853508\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above and <a href=\"#H2853520\" class=\"local\">'Epidemiology'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Some of the affected patients had exposures to poultry before becoming ill. To date, there is no evidence of sustained human-to-human transmission. (See <a href=\"#H2853520\" class=\"local\">'Epidemiology'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Avian influenza A H7N9 virus appears to have derived from reassortment of at least four avian influenza viruses. (See <a href=\"#H3096168\" class=\"local\">'Sources of the reassortant virus'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Several genetic characteristics of avian influenza A H7N9 viruses isolated from humans suggest that it may have potential for high virulence. As an example, mutations at the receptor-binding site suggest that it has adapted to be able to bind to human-type (alpha 2-6 galactose) receptors in the respiratory tract. (See <a href=\"#H718998919\" class=\"local\">'Genetic characteristics'</a> above and <a href=\"#H74441494\" class=\"local\">'Receptor and tissue tropism'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients have presented with respiratory tract infections, many of which have progressed to severe pneumonia. Other clinical features have included acute respiratory distress syndrome, septic shock, multiorgan failure, rhabdomyolysis, and encephalopathy. (See <a href=\"#H2854679\" class=\"local\">'Clinical manifestations'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Real-time reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction is the preferred diagnostic test for avian influenza A H7N9, since rapid antigen tests may be insensitive for novel or avian influenza strains. Nasopharyngeal swabs or aspirates should be obtained for testing.
