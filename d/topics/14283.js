Collaboration between pediatric primary care providers and dentists <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> provision of dental services in medical settings may be necessary to ensure follow-up with dental care [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/preventive-dental-care-and-counseling-for-infants-and-young-children/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>].</p><p>Oral health assessment by six months of age is recommended by the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) and the American Academy of Pediatric Dentistry [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/preventive-dental-care-and-counseling-for-infants-and-young-children/abstract/10,18,21\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,18,21</a>]. The AAP recommends repeat oral health assessment at 12, 18, 24, and 30 months, and 3, 4, 5, and 6 years of age if the child has not yet established a dental home [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/preventive-dental-care-and-counseling-for-infants-and-young-children/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. Prospective studies evaluating the effectiveness of these recommendations in preventing caries are lacking [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/preventive-dental-care-and-counseling-for-infants-and-young-children/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>], but there is little risk of harm. Retrospective studies have inconsistent findings and methodologic limitations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/preventive-dental-care-and-counseling-for-infants-and-young-children/abstract/20,23-31\" class=\"abstract_t\">20,23-31</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h1\">DENTAL REFERRAL</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>All children should receive a dental referral at or near their first birthday [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/preventive-dental-care-and-counseling-for-infants-and-young-children/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. However, if dental providers in the area are unwilling to see children who are younger than three years of age, the pediatric health care provider may continue to provide preventive dental care and counseling for infants and children who are at low risk of developing dental disease and have no abnormalities on screening examination. Children with risk factors for caries <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> abnormalities on screening examination should be referred preferably to a pediatric dentist who accepts infants and toddlers. The American Academy of Pediatric Dentistry (AAPD) provides a <a href=\"http://www.aapd.org/finddentist/&amp;token=TCZoDJKkgSsgDea9026wfBNPkbkpnz4BNy1mQUkOJpKwEpYnWJvEsuUZJ/C5vDlm&amp;TOPIC_ID=6279\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">website</a> to help find a pediatric dentist.</p><p>Making a dental referral provides the pediatric care provider with an opportunity to explain the concept of the dental home and encourage the parents to establish one as soon as possible after the first birthday, and certainly by the time the child is three years of age. Once the referral is made, pediatric and dental care providers should communicate regarding the child's diagnosis and treatment plans. The pediatric care provider should verify that the child kept the initial appointment and continues to be seen by the dentist at least annually. The pediatric care provider should continue to provide oral health anticipatory guidance at regularly scheduled health maintenance visits. (See <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'Dental home'</a> below and <a href=\"#H8\" class=\"local\">'Anticipatory guidance'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">First dental visit</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The AAPD, the American Dental Association, the American Public Health Association, and the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) recommend that the first dental visit occur at or near one year of age [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/preventive-dental-care-and-counseling-for-infants-and-young-children/abstract/10,32,33\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,32,33</a>]. We support the recommendation for initiation of dental care as soon as possible after the child's first birthday, particularly for children who are at risk for development of oral health problems.</p><p>The rationale for the early dental visit centers on the early initiation of preventive care and counseling, including evaluation of dental risks (ie, caries, malocclusion) and anticipatory guidance regarding dental hygiene, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fluoride-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">fluoride</a>, diet, dietary habits, and oral habits [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/preventive-dental-care-and-counseling-for-infants-and-young-children/abstract/34-36\" class=\"abstract_t\">34-36</a>]. In addition, early dental referral can provide a pleasant, nonthreatening introduction to the dentist [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/preventive-dental-care-and-counseling-for-infants-and-young-children/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=oral-habits-and-orofacial-development-in-children\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Oral habits and orofacial development in children&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The potential benefits of early initiation of dental care were demonstrated in a retrospective study of 42,532 children (zero to seven years of age) who had a first dental visit during 2004 and eight years of dental follow-up [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/preventive-dental-care-and-counseling-for-infants-and-young-children/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>]. Having had the first dental visit before four years of age (40 percent of subjects) was associated with fewer dental procedures (eg, restorations, crowns, pulpotomies, extractions) during the follow-up period (7.69 versus 11.27) and lower cost of dental care.</p><p>In another study, an oral examination and comprehensive preventive dental program (including monitoring of oral bacteria and referral for dental treatment if needed) were provided to 36 pregnant women who delivered 47 children [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/preventive-dental-care-and-counseling-for-infants-and-young-children/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. After delivery, the mothers were instructed on how to care for their infants' teeth (eg, brushing, use of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fluoride-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">fluoride</a> toothpaste, dietary habits), and professional examinations were provided to the mothers and children every six months until the children were four years of age. When the children were three and four years of age, the study group was compared with an age-matched control group who received neither pre- nor postnatal dental care. The oral health of the study group at four years of age was better than that of the control group, as indicated by the following parameters:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Naturally healthy dentition (91 versus 58 percent in the study and control groups, respectively)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Presence of caries (9 versus 42 percent)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Mean decayed, missing, filled teeth score (DMF-s) (1.5 versus 7.0)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><em>Streptococcus mutans</em> score &ge;2 (&gt;10<sup>5</sup> colony-forming units <span class=\"nowrap\">[cfu]/mL)</span> (21 percent versus 60 percent)</p><p/><p>In a cost-benefit analysis of dental claims for 94,574 privately insured children from four states, initial dental visit at one year of age was associated with decreased costs and number of complex procedures; it was estimated that a preventive dental visit at or before one year of age could reduce complex procedures over five years by as much as 22 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/preventive-dental-care-and-counseling-for-infants-and-young-children/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>].</p><p>The number of children with a first dental visit at 12 months of age has improved since 2003 (when the AAP lowered the recommended age for the first visit from 3 years to 12 months [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/preventive-dental-care-and-counseling-for-infants-and-young-children/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]) but continues to be suboptimal.

Before the eruption of the child's primary dentition, the provider can discuss nonnutritive sucking and the teething process. The need for <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fluoride-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">fluoride</a> supplementation should be evaluated before the six-month check-up so that, if it is necessary, it can be initiated at the six-month visit (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F69038\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef69038 \">table 2</a>). Feeding habits, the use of the bottles and cups, and cleaning the teeth become more important as the primary dentition erupts.</p><p>Studies evaluating the effectiveness of specific educational or counseling interventions are lacking. However, there is some evidence that education combined with other interventions (eg, provision of toothbrushes and toothpaste, additional training of primary care providers) is associated with decreased caries in high-risk children younger than five years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/preventive-dental-care-and-counseling-for-infants-and-young-children/abstract/47-49\" class=\"abstract_t\">47-49</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h2\">Nonnutritive sucking</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Nonnutritive sucking is a normal part of early development; it is self-soothing behavior that occurs in 70 to 90 percent of infants in various populations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/preventive-dental-care-and-counseling-for-infants-and-young-children/abstract/45,50-52\" class=\"abstract_t\">45,50-52</a>]. The frequency of sucking on digits or pacifiers decreases with increasing age; by the age of four to five years, nonnutritive sucking is usually replaced by other coping mechanisms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/preventive-dental-care-and-counseling-for-infants-and-young-children/abstract/50\" class=\"abstract_t\">50</a>]. Compared with pacifier sucking, digit sucking is more likely to persist into the fourth or fifth year of life [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/preventive-dental-care-and-counseling-for-infants-and-young-children/abstract/53,54\" class=\"abstract_t\">53,54</a>]. If it persists into the period of permanent tooth eruption, nonnutritive sucking, especially pacifier use, may contribute to the development of malocclusion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/preventive-dental-care-and-counseling-for-infants-and-young-children/abstract/55\" class=\"abstract_t\">55</a>].

The acid that is produced when the bacteria in plaque metabolize carbohydrates decreases the pH of the oral cavity. Saliva is able to buffer the acid until the oral pH is less than 5.5; at this pH, demineralization of the dental enamel occurs. With continued exposure to pH &lt;5.5 (eg, from constant snacking or grazing), the surface enamel develops a chalky texture, known as the white spot lesion (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F73374\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef73374 \">picture 2</a>).

The increased risk of caries in children breastfed &gt;12 months may be due to the eruption of additional primary teeth after 12 months, the introduction of cariogenic foods and beverages, and inadequate oral hygiene [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/preventive-dental-care-and-counseling-for-infants-and-young-children/abstract/67,68\" class=\"abstract_t\">67,68</a>], but studies specifically evaluating these issues were lacking.</p><p>Ingestion of sugars is necessary for caries to develop, and sugars along with acidogenic oral bacteria are the root cause of caries [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/preventive-dental-care-and-counseling-for-infants-and-young-children/abstract/69\" class=\"abstract_t\">69</a>]. The cariogenic potential of foods and beverages is determined by their macronutrient composition, oral clearance, and consumption patterns (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F117027\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef117027 \">table 3</a>). Foods and beverages that contain carbohydrates are considered cariogenic. Simple sugars (ie, monosaccharides and disaccharides, such as glucose, fructose, and sucrose) are more readily metabolized by bacteria than modified starches (oligosaccharides [short chains of monosaccharides]) and starches (polysaccharides); thus simple sugars generally are considered more cariogenic than modified starches and starches. However, foods and beverages containing only sugars that are readily cleared from the mouth (eg, sugar-sweetened beverages) may be less cariogenic than foods containing a combination of sugars and starches that are retained in the mouth (eg, baked sweets, salty snacks). The presence of protein <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> fat within the food item (eg, milk) or in foods consumed with the carbohydrate-containing food (eg, meat, cheese) lessen the cariogenic potential of the carbohydrate. Finally, frequent <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> prolonged consumption of the carbohydrate-containing food increases the food's cariogenic potential [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/preventive-dental-care-and-counseling-for-infants-and-young-children/abstract/70\" class=\"abstract_t\">70</a>].</p><p>Strategies to decrease the cariogenicity of sugar-containing foods and beverages include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Consumption in the context of a meal or snack that also includes protein <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> fat</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Avoid added-sugar beverages as much as possible, but when consuming them, do so over a limited period of time rather than sipping throughout the day</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Include sweetened items as part of meals rather than as separate snacks or &quot;grazing&quot; throughout the day</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Rinsing the mouth with water or chewing sugar-free gum immediately after consumption</p><p/><p>The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends that infants be breastfed exclusively for the first six months of life, that breastfeeding continue until the child is one year of age, and that solid foods be introduced at approximately six months of age [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/preventive-dental-care-and-counseling-for-infants-and-young-children/abstract/1,71\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,71</a>].

Fluorosis can be prevented by limitation of excessive fluoride consumption (eg, through the swallowing of fluoridated toothpaste or mouth rinses) early in life and appropriate fluoride supplementation.</p><p>A prospective study found that using optimally fluoridated water to reconstitute powdered infant formula concentrate increased the risk of dental fluorosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/preventive-dental-care-and-counseling-for-infants-and-young-children/abstract/110\" class=\"abstract_t\">110</a>]. As a result of this and other similar observations, the ADA's Council on Scientific Affairs recommends that clinicians be cognizant of this risk in counseling parents regarding the use of infant formulas [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/preventive-dental-care-and-counseling-for-infants-and-young-children/abstract/111\" class=\"abstract_t\">111</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2168049794\"><span class=\"h1\">DENTAL SEALANTS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Dental sealants are plastic coatings that are bonded to the chewing surfaces of the teeth. They prevent cariogenic bacteria from colonizing the pits and fissures of the teeth <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> having access to ingested sugars, which the bacteria metabolize into acids [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/preventive-dental-care-and-counseling-for-infants-and-young-children/abstract/112\" class=\"abstract_t\">112</a>]. Sealants typically are applied by dentists or dental hygienists in dental offices or clinics. However, school-based sealant programs are common and generally target schools in lower-income neighborhoods.</p><p>Dental sealants generally are recommended for permanent molars [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/preventive-dental-care-and-counseling-for-infants-and-young-children/abstract/113\" class=\"abstract_t\">113</a>], but some clinicians also use them for primary molars in children at high risk for caries [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/preventive-dental-care-and-counseling-for-infants-and-young-children/abstract/114\" class=\"abstract_t\">114</a>]. Sealants often are used combination with topical <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fluoride-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">fluoride</a> for comprehensive caries prevention. Sealants prevent caries on chewing surfaces and surfaces with anatomic pits and fissures, whereas topical fluorides are most effective on smooth tooth surfaces.</p><p>Sealants usually are applied soon after eruption of the molars (eg, approximately six years of age for the first molar). They are effective as long as they remain on the tooth surfaces. Sealant retention is variable, typically ranging from two to four years, but may last for 10 years or longer [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/preventive-dental-care-and-counseling-for-infants-and-young-children/abstract/115\" class=\"abstract_t\">115</a>].</p><p>In a systematic review of 15 studies comparing resin-based sealants with no sealant in 3620 children, the incidence of caries in the control groups ranged from 16 to 70 percent at 24 months of follow-up compared with 5 to 19 percent in the sealant groups [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/preventive-dental-care-and-counseling-for-infants-and-young-children/abstract/116\" class=\"abstract_t\">116</a>]. In a meta-analysis of seven randomized trials in &gt;1300 children age 5 to 10 years, resin-based sealants reduced the risk of caries in first permanent molars over 24 months of follow-up (odds ratio 0.12, 95% CI 0.08-0.12) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/preventive-dental-care-and-counseling-for-infants-and-young-children/abstract/116\" class=\"abstract_t\">116</a>]. Sealants were estimated to decrease the absolute risk of caries by 11 to 51 percent (from 16 to 5 percent using the lower range of incidence in the control group and from 70 to 19 percent using the upper range of incidence in the control group). &#160; &#160;</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H16909661\"><span class=\"h1\">SILVER COMPOUNDS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Silver compounds, particularly <a href=\"topic.htm?path=silver-nitrate-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">silver nitrate</a>, were widely used in dentistry during the 19<sup>th</sup> and early 20<sup>th</sup> centuries and have received renewed attention for the treatment and prevention of caries in children despite limited evidence of their efficacy in the published literature.
