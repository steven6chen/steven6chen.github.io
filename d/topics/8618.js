Although persons with ASDs are often asymptomatic until adulthood, potential complications of an undetected lesion include irreversible pulmonary hypertension, right ventricular failure, progressive tricuspid valve regurgitation from annular dilatation, atrial arrhythmias, paradoxical embolization, and cerebral abscess. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-atrial-septal-defects-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of atrial septal defects in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p>This topic will review the methods used for diagnosis and assessment of ASDs, including identification of the precise anatomy of the defect and associated anomalies, evaluation of right ventricular overload, evaluation of pulmonary artery pressures, and estimation of the pulmonary-to-systemic flow ratio [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/identification-and-assessment-of-atrial-septal-defects-in-adults/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>]. In most cases, echocardiography provides all the required information. Other modalities such as cardiovascular magnetic resonance and cardiac computed tomography may be helpful in selected cases, especially when echocardiography is technically suboptimal or inconclusive. Cardiac catheterization is rarely required to diagnose and assess an ASD because the requisite information including hemodynamics can be obtained noninvasively in the majority of individuals.</p><p>The pathophysiology, clinical features, and management of ASDs in adults and issues related to ASD in children are discussed separately.

Imaging of an ASD should include demonstration of the presence and direction of shunting across the defect and evaluation of associated anomalies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/identification-and-assessment-of-atrial-septal-defects-in-adults/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p>In most patients, echocardiography identifies the ASD, its size and direction of flow, associated abnormalities, and complications. Partial anomalous pulmonary venous drainage of the right upper and middle pulmonary veins frequently accompanies superior sinus venosus defects and less frequently occurs with secundum ASDs. Primum ASDs are generally accompanied by cleft anterior mitral valve leaflet. Since the sensitivity of echocardiography varies with technology, acoustic windows, and <span class=\"nowrap\">operator/patient</span> factors, prior negative suboptimal echocardiograms do not definitively exclude an ASD.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Echocardiography</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Echocardiography is the imaging modality of choice for the diagnosis of ASD. Transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) is usually definitive in secundum and primum defects (the latter generally accompanied by cleft mitral leaflet and co-planar mitral and tricuspid valves). Transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) may aid in the sizing of secundum ASDs (as well as determination of suitability for transcatheter device closure), the diagnosis of sinus venosus defects of superior vena cava or inferior vena cava type, and the assessment of associated congenital anomalies such as anomalous pulmonary venous connection.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H686082590\"><span class=\"h3\">Transthoracic echocardiography</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>TTE is the primary imaging test in the diagnosis and assessment of ASDs. A comprehensive TTE includes two-dimensional imaging as well as color-flow, pulsed-wave, and continuous-wave Doppler to determine the presence, flow characteristics, and hemodynamic implications of the ASD. The addition of intravenous-agitated saline contrast injection may be helpful in select cases. The preferred injection site is in the left upper extremity, such that unroofed coronary sinus defects with persistent left superior vena cava can also be excluded by injection.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h4\">Two-dimensional TTE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Secundum and primum ASDs can generally be visualized with two-dimensional TTE (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F80448\" class=\"graphic graphic_movie graphicRef80448 \">movie 1A</a>). Clues to the presence of an ASD include abrupt discontinuity of the septum and slight thickening at its termination. Hypermobility of the septum, particularly in association with an abrupt discontinuity, is also suggestive. Since initial imaging of the interatrial septum may be inconclusive, other evidence of ASD such as right atrial and ventricular enlargement due to volume overload (ie, diastolic interventricular septal flattening and increased pulmonary artery velocities without anatomic stenosis) and pulmonary artery dilatation should be sought. (See <a href=\"#H686081490\" class=\"local\">'Evaluation for RV overload'</a> below.)</p><p>The interatrial septum can be seen in the apical four chamber view (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F67977\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef67977 \">image 1</a>); however, an erroneous diagnosis of ASD may result from relying solely on the two-dimensional and color Doppler appearance in this view due to artifactual echo dropout (low signal) of the septum caused by the parallel orientation of the echo beam to the atrial septum in this view and the thinness of the fossa ovalis.</p><p>The interatrial septum is often best visualized in the subcostal view in which the ultrasound beam is generally nearly perpendicular to the atrial septum [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/identification-and-assessment-of-atrial-septal-defects-in-adults/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. However, this view is suboptimal in some individuals, particularly in obese subjects. Off-axis apical, parasternal short axis, and other non-standard views are frequently necessary to interrogate the whole interatrial septum.</p><p>The diagnostic sensitivity of two-dimensional echocardiographic imaging using the subcostal approach was evaluated in a review of 154 patients (mean age 31 years) with a documented ASD (105 secundum, 32 primum, and 16 sinus venosus) in whom a satisfactory image of the atrial septum could be obtained by TTE [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/identification-and-assessment-of-atrial-septal-defects-in-adults/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. The defect was successfully visualized in 89 percent of secundum ASDs, 100 percent of primum ASDs, and only 44 percent of sinus venosus ASDs. Contrast echocardiography using peripheral vein injection of agitated saline, when performed, identified all defects missed by two-dimensional TTE.</p><p>The size of an ASD on two-dimensional TTE does not correlate well with shunt flow measured at catheterization. This is better assessed with color flow and pulsed-wave Doppler or three-dimensional TTE or TEE imaging.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H686082402\"><span class=\"h4\">Doppler</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Color flow, pulsed, and continuous wave Doppler all provide information in patients with an ASD. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=principles-of-doppler-echocardiography\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Principles of Doppler echocardiography&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The addition of color flow Doppler imaging can help confirm the presence of an ASD, estimate the defect size, and indicate the overall direction of the flow across the atrial septum. The addition of color-flow imaging may also aid in determining the feasibility of percutaneous device closure. A left-to-right shunt across an ASD in a patient without pulmonary hypertension typically shows low velocity flow acceleration in the direction of the shunt and minimal flow in the opposite direction (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F80448%7ECARD%2F54350\" class=\"graphic graphic_movie graphicRef80448 graphicRef54350 \">movie 1A-B</a>).</p><p>The maximal width of the color flow jet across the interatrial septum in the view from which it is best visualized correlates well with the size of the shunt at catheterization. A jet width greater than 15 mm in adults can distinguish patients with a shunt ratio of greater than 2:1 (an indication for closure of the ASD) from those with a lesser shunt [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/identification-and-assessment-of-atrial-septal-defects-in-adults/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-and-outcome-of-isolated-atrial-septal-defects-in-children\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management and outcome of isolated atrial septal defects in children&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=indications-for-closure-and-medical-management-of-atrial-septal-defects-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Indications for closure and medical management of atrial septal defects in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p>There are several limitations to color flow Doppler in the diagnosis of ASD:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Ghosting of color across the interatrial septum sometimes gives the false impression of shunt flow (in particular with apical imaging).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>An ASD may be missed in several circumstances. When the right heart is enlarged, a meticulous search for ASD should be undertaken. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>An ASD can be missed by TTE when there is associated severe pulmonary hypertension. The shunt flow across the ASD becomes unimpressive by color-flow imaging due to equalization of atrial pressures. In this setting, TEE or agitated saline injection should be considered. It is important to differentiate these entities, since it has therapeutic implications. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Shunt flow may be missed if the frame rate is too low, since flow across the ASD may occur only during a part of the cardiac cycle. Reducing the Nyquist limit (the upper limit of velocity that can be detected with a given Doppler pulse frequency) may enable detection of the turbulent shunt flow. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Unusual ASD location is another possible cause for missing an ASD; specifically, the sinus venosus and coronary sinus ASDs should be sought in this setting. Sinus venosus defects that are high or low in the septum (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F52106\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef52106 \">figure 1</a>) may not be visualized with routine TTE imaging (only seen in 7 of 16 patients in one report) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/identification-and-assessment-of-atrial-septal-defects-in-adults/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. A sinus venosus defect is one of the disorders that should be suspected in a patient with right heart enlargement and features of shunt physiology but no overt evidence for an ASD on TTE. Agitated saline contrast or TEE can identify almost all of these patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/identification-and-assessment-of-atrial-septal-defects-in-adults/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Cross-sectional imaging with cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) or computerized tomographic (CT) imaging can also be used to assess anomalous pulmonary veins and sinus venosus ASD when the diagnosis is not confirmed by echo imaging. Cardiac catheterization is performed primarily in patients having device closure of a secundum ASD, or in patients with pulmonary hypertension to determine whether closure is possible.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Shunt estimation using the size of the jet width across the ASD does not take into account additional shunt flow due to any associated anomalous pulmonary venous connections. Shunt estimation is usually not performed by echocardiography.</p><p/><p>Pulsed wave Doppler permits sampling of blood flow velocities from a specific region of interest. It is particularly useful for assessing relatively low velocity flows and can therefore identify flow across the atrial septum. It has been used to aid in estimation of the pulmonary flow to systemic flow ratio, although such estimation may not be reliable due to difficulty accurately measuring the size of the right ventricular outflow tract. (See <a href=\"#H15\" class=\"local\">'Estimation of the Qp/Qs'</a> below and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=principles-of-doppler-echocardiography\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Principles of Doppler echocardiography&quot;</a>.)</p><p>In comparison, continuous-wave Doppler echocardiography is particularly useful for assessing higher velocity flows (ie, velocity &gt;2 meters per second), such as determination of right ventricular, and thus indirectly pulmonary artery pressure. This is done by obtaining the peak tricuspid regurgitation continuous wave Doppler signal, using the modified Bernoulli equation, and adding the estimated right atrial pressure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/identification-and-assessment-of-atrial-septal-defects-in-adults/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=echocardiographic-assessment-of-the-right-heart#H9033356\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Echocardiographic assessment of the right heart&quot;, section on 'Pulmonary artery pressure'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h3\">Agitated saline contrast</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>If comprehensive TTE with two-dimensional and color Doppler imaging is not conclusive for ASD, imaging following agitated saline contrast injection in a peripheral vein at rest and with one or more maneuvers (Valsalva or cough) is helpful to confirm the diagnosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/identification-and-assessment-of-atrial-septal-defects-in-adults/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Contrast injection can be via any peripheral vein, but will only exclude unroofed coronary sinus defects with persistent left superior vena cava with an injection site in the left upper extremity. Agitated saline contrast can be performed with TTE or TEE imaging.</p><p>An adequate contrast injection causes opacification of the right atrium and ventricle. If there is a right-to-left interatrial shunt (transient or net), early appearance of contrast can be seen in the left atrium. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=contrast-echocardiography-clinical-applications\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Contrast echocardiography: Clinical applications&quot;</a>.)</p><p>A right-to-left interatrial shunt can be detected by contrast echocardiography in three circumstances:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>With an uncomplicated ASD with net left-to-right shunt, when flow is temporarily reversed with transient increases in right atrial pressure relative to left atrial pressure (eg, with a Valsalva maneuver or coughing) or briefly during the onset of left ventricular contraction (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F61938\" class=\"graphic graphic_movie graphicRef61938 \">movie 2</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F67067\" class=\"graphic graphic_movie graphicRef67067 \">movie 3</a>).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>With an ASD complicated by severe pulmonary hypertension with reversal of shunting across the ASD.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>With a patent foramen ovale, with no or net left-to-right shunt, with transient elevation in right atrial pressure above left atrial pressure (generally timed during the end of the T wave) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F56656\" class=\"graphic graphic_movie graphicRef56656 \">movie 4</a>). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=patent-foramen-ovale\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Patent foramen ovale&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p>Contrast echocardiography may also be used in the detection of a left-to-right shunt. Negative contrast in the right atrium is an insensitive and nonspecific sign of left-to-right interatrial shunting [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/identification-and-assessment-of-atrial-septal-defects-in-adults/abstract/6,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,7</a>]. In this setting, flow from the contrast-free left atrium produces areas in the right atrium in which contrast is not seen. Care must be taken to distinguish this finding from lack of contrast opacification of the right atrium due to streaming of blood from vena cava inflow.</p><p>Although there are only scant reports of complications from agitated intravenous saline contrast, contrast injections should generally be avoided in pregnant patients or in patients with severe pulmonary hypertension. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=contrast-echocardiography-contrast-agents-safety-and-imaging-technique#H8\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Contrast echocardiography: Contrast agents, safety, and imaging technique&quot;, section on 'Agitated saline safety'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h3\">TEE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>TEE is superior to TTE for imaging the interatrial septum and pulmonary veins and is often used when a definitive diagnosis is not made by TTE due to indeterminate findings or technically suboptimal images (eg, in patients with chest wall deformities, lung disease, or other causes for poor acoustic windows).</p><p>TEE is highly accurate for the diagnosis of all types of septal defects (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F79348\" class=\"graphic graphic_movie graphicRef79348 \">movie 5</a>) in the hands of an experienced operator. It is particularly helpful for detection of sinus venosus defects, which are often missed with TTE [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/identification-and-assessment-of-atrial-septal-defects-in-adults/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].</p><p>When performed with color flow Doppler (with or without an additional agitated saline contrast study), TEE can detect right-to-left shunting when there is transient reversal of flow through the ASD when right-sided pressure is increased (eg, with a Valsalva maneuver) or briefly during the onset of left ventricular contraction (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F61938\" class=\"graphic graphic_movie graphicRef61938 \">movie 2</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F79804\" class=\"graphic graphic_movie graphicRef79804 \">movie 6</a>). It is more sensitive than TTE for the detection of left-to-right shunting as negative right atrial contrast (93 versus 58 percent in one report) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/identification-and-assessment-of-atrial-septal-defects-in-adults/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. TEE can also detect flow through multiple ASDs (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F59313\" class=\"graphic graphic_movie graphicRef59313 \">movie 7</a>).</p><p>Estimation of ASD size using the diameter of the Doppler color flow jet on TEE or three-dimensional TEE imaging generally correlates well with direct measurement at the time of surgery or balloon measurement at the time of percutaneous device placement [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/identification-and-assessment-of-atrial-septal-defects-in-adults/abstract/8,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,9</a>].</p><p>TEE imaging can also be used to identify pulmonary venous connections; however, anomalous venous connection to the superior or inferior vena cava may be beyond the imaging plane [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/identification-and-assessment-of-atrial-septal-defects-in-adults/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. In this setting, CMR or CT should be used to define the anatomy of the anomalous venous connections.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H31860519\"><span class=\"h3\">Three-dimensional</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Three-dimensional echocardiography can facilitate precise sizing of ASDs and provide information that may be important for treatment (eg, transcatheter closure), such as the shape of the ASD and its relationship to atrial superior and inferior limbic band tissue, the aortic root, and the atrioventricular valves [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/identification-and-assessment-of-atrial-septal-defects-in-adults/abstract/8,11,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,11,12</a>].

Quantification of left to right shunting by CMR correlates well with shunt flow calculation based upon cardiac catheterization (invasive oximetry) with a small but not clinically significant overestimation of Qp:Qs by CMR [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/identification-and-assessment-of-atrial-septal-defects-in-adults/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. ASD can be diagnosed and treated based on CMR data and CMR has also been reliable for detecting anomalous pulmonary venous connections [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/identification-and-assessment-of-atrial-septal-defects-in-adults/abstract/14-17\" class=\"abstract_t\">14-17</a>]. Thus, in the majority of subjects there is only occasionally the need for cardiac catheterization. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-utility-of-cardiovascular-magnetic-resonance-imaging\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical utility of cardiovascular magnetic resonance imaging&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Cardiac CT may also be used to identify ASD location and size and detect anomalous pulmonary venous connections.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h2\">Cardiac catheterization</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Invasive cardiac catheterization is rarely required for diagnosis of ASDs since the evaluation can generally be performed using noninvasive means.</p><p>Determination of the presence of an ASD by catheterization involves sampling of the oxygen content in the inferior vena cava, superior vena cava, right atrium, right ventricle, and pulmonary artery; a &quot;step-up&quot; in oxygen saturation is indicative of a left-to-right shunt.

When performed, optimal direct visualization of left-to-right shunting through an ASD is achieved by an injection of contrast just outside the orifice of the right upper pulmonary vein in the cranially angulated left anterior oblique projection (also known as the four-chamber view). With this view, secundum ASDs are seen in the middle of the atrial septum, and sinus venous and atrioventricular canal defects are seen at the superior and inferior aspect of the atrial septum, respectively.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H686081490\"><span class=\"h1\">EVALUATION FOR RV OVERLOAD</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Once an atrial septal defect (ASD) has been identified, the right heart should be assessed to identify any associated right atrial enlargement and right ventricular (RV) volume overload, since RV overload is the chief indication for ASD closure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/identification-and-assessment-of-atrial-septal-defects-in-adults/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>].</p><p>On noninvasive imaging, RV volume overload is suggested by RV enlargement with diastolic flattening of the interventricular septum. The pulmonary arteries may also be dilated. Echocardiography is the primary means of assessment of RV size and function.

While some studies have shown good agreement with invasive cardiac catheterization [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/identification-and-assessment-of-atrial-septal-defects-in-adults/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>], the calculation of <span class=\"nowrap\">Qp/Qs</span> by TTE has limited reliability given the difficulty measuring the right ventricular outflow tract diameter.</p><p>With pulsed Doppler echocardiography, the stroke volume through each outflow tract is measured using the following formula:</p><p>Stroke volume = cross sectional area x velocity time integral (VTI) of Doppler flow signal</p><p>Systemic stroke volume through the left ventricular outflow tract (LVOT) is estimated by assuming a circular geometry. The diameter of the LVOT is measured in the parasternal long axis view. The Doppler flow velocity time integral in the LVOT (VTI-LVOT) is recorded in the apical five-chamber view. The right-sided velocity time integral (VTI-PA) is measured in the main pulmonary artery well before the bifurcation. The diameter of the pulmonary artery (PA) is then measured at the same location. Substitution into the stroke volume formula results in the following formula:</p><p> &#160;<span class=\"nowrap\">Qp/Qs</span> = &#160;[(PA diameter)<sup>2</sup> &#160;x &#160;VTI-PA] &#160;&divide; &#160;[(LVOT diameter)<sup>2</sup> &#160;x &#160;VTI-LVOT]</p><p>The equation requires squaring of the diameters of the LVOT and PA, making exact measurements of these diameters of prime importance in the calculation of the shunt ratio. Thus, the diameters are the terms in the equation that are most often responsible for inaccurate estimates of the shunt ratio. The PA diameter can be measured in the parasternal short axis view at the base of the heart or in the subcostal view with the main PA visualized along its long axis alongside the aorta in cross-section.</p><p>Shunt flow volume can be estimated using the area of the defect (again assuming a circular geometry) and the velocity time integral of the shunt flow measured with the Doppler beam parallel to shunt direction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/identification-and-assessment-of-atrial-septal-defects-in-adults/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>].

Transthoracic echocardiography is usually definitive in ostium secundum and primum defects. Transesophageal echocardiography may aid in the diagnosis of sinus venosus defects of superior vena cava or inferior vena cava type, and the assessment of associated anomalies such as anomalous pulmonary venous connection. Transesophageal echocardiography may also aid in the sizing and anatomic evaluation of defects for potential device closure.

(See <a href=\"#H11\" class=\"local\">'CMR and CT'</a> above and <a href=\"#H686081490\" class=\"local\">'Evaluation for RV overload'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Cardiac catheterization is not generally required for diagnosis and assessment of ASDs but is most commonly performed for device closure if significant pulmonary hypertension is present to determine the pulmonary vascular resistance and reversibility with vasodilator therapy.

The ASD can be missed in the setting of unusual location such as sinus venosus or coronary sinus defect. Pulmonary hypertension further complicates the diagnosis of ASD; the presence of right heart enlargement and pulmonary hypertension should prompt a search for an ASD.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H450073\"><span class=\"h1\">ACKNOWLEDGMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The UpToDate editorial staff would like to thank Thomas P Graham, Jr, MD for his contributions as a Section Editor to previous versions of this topic review.</p></div><div id=\"topicAgreement\">Use of UpToDate is subject to the <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/legal/license\" class=\"licenseLink\" id=\"sla_in_page\">Subscription and License Agreement</a>.</div><div id=\"references\" class=\"headingAnchor\"><h1>REFERENCES</h1><ol id=\"reference\"><li><a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/identification-and-assessment-of-atrial-septal-defects-in-adults/abstract/1\" class=\"nounderline abstract_t\">Warnes CA, Williams RG, Bashore TM, et al.
