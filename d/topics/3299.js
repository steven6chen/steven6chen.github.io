However, the vast majority of men eventually develop progressive disease that is resistant to further hormonal treatment.</p><p>Prior to the development of the taxanes, cytotoxic chemotherapy was considered to be relatively ineffective in men with castration-resistant prostate cancer. In early trials, objective response rates were 10 to 20 percent, and median survival generally did not exceed 12 months.</p><p>However, taxane-based regimens have been associated with higher rates of objective tumor regression and biochemical (prostate-specific antigen [PSA]) response, as well as longer overall survival. As discussed below, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=docetaxel-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">docetaxel</a> has an established role in chemotherapy-naive patients, and a second-generation taxane, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cabazitaxel-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cabazitaxel</a>, is active in patients who have received prior docetaxel.</p><p>The use of cytotoxic chemotherapy for the treatment of castration-resistant prostate cancer will be reviewed here. The use of chemotherapy in combination with androgen deprivation therapy for castration-sensitive disease is discussed separately, as are experimental approaches.
