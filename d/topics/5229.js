Active pulmonary tuberculosis often cannot be distinguished from inactive disease on the basis of radiography alone, and readings of &quot;fibrosis&quot; or &quot;scarring&quot; must be interpreted in the context of the clinical and epidemiologic presentation.</p><p>Reactivation pulmonary tuberculosis classically presents with focal infiltration of the upper lobe(s) (usually of the apical <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> posterior segments) or the lower lobe(s) (usually of the apical, also called superior, segments) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F74846%7EID%2F70220%7EID%2F54807%7EID%2F56912\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef74846 graphicRef70220 graphicRef54807 graphicRef56912 \">image 1A-D</a>).

Lobar or segmental infiltration may be visualized in other lung regions, with or without hilar adenopathy, lung mass (tuberculoma), small fibronodular lesions (termed &quot;miliary&quot; because they resemble scattered millet seeds), or pleural effusions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-of-pulmonary-tuberculosis-in-adults/abstract/38-40\" class=\"abstract_t\">38-40</a>].

The resolution provided by CT usually is not required for diagnosis or management of pulmonary TB; it may be reserved for circumstances in which more precise resolution of features observed in a chest radiograph is required or where an alternative diagnosis is suspected.</p><p>There is no role for routine use of positron emission tomography (PET) for evaluation of TB [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-of-pulmonary-tuberculosis-in-adults/abstract/43-45\" class=\"abstract_t\">43-45</a>]. PET uptake of F-fluoro-2-deoxyglucose (FDG) does not differentiate infection from tumor. The macrophages in active TB do not proliferate and do not need 11C-choline, resulting in low C-choline uptake, in contrast with the macrophages in malignancy. Therefore, the combination of a high FDG and low 11C-choline uptake on PET may be useful for distinguishing active inflammatory (eg, infectious) <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> neoplastic processes from inactive lesions (eg, fibrosis), although its sensitivity in the setting of clinical suspicion for tuberculosis has not been established [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-of-pulmonary-tuberculosis-in-adults/abstract/45\" class=\"abstract_t\">45</a>]. 68Ga-citrate PET accumulates in both pulmonary and extrapulmonary tuberculous lesions and may provide a way of distinguishing active from inactive lesions for treatment response evaluation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-of-pulmonary-tuberculosis-in-adults/abstract/46\" class=\"abstract_t\">46</a>].</p><p>Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) may demonstrate intrathoracic lymphadenopathy, pericardial thickening, and pericardial and pleural effusions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-of-pulmonary-tuberculosis-in-adults/abstract/47\" class=\"abstract_t\">47</a>].</p><p>Radiographic findings in the setting of pulmonary tuberculosis are discussed further separately.

There are two major types of molecular assays: probe-based (non-sequencing) tests and sequence-based assays.</p><p>The chief distinction between these types of assays is that, in general, probe-based tests can detect whether a gene mutation is present but cannot provide the sequence information for the specific mutation(s). This is important because not all gene mutations within a given region confer drug resistance; silent or missense mutations may be detected by probe-based assays and signal drug resistance even though they do not confer drug resistance in culture. In contrast, sequence-based assays can provide information regarding the nature of a specific mutation and therefore can predict drug resistance with greater accuracy. Therefore, results obtained from a probe-based assay suggestive of resistance should be confirmed with a sequence-based assay or by culture.</p><p>All molecular tests for drug resistance must be confirmed by culture (agar proportion method using solid media is the reference standard).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4154933816\"><span class=\"h4\">Probe-based (NAA) tests</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Probe-based tests, also known as nucleic acid amplification (NAA) tests, amplify a specific nucleic acid sequence that can be detected via a nucleic acid probe. Some NAA tests can detect genes encoding drug resistance; the information available regarding drug susceptibility depends on the assay used as discussed below.</p><p>Nucleic acid amplification testing should be used for rapid diagnosis (24 to 48 hours) of organisms belonging to the <em>M. tuberculosis</em> complex in patients with suspected TB [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-of-pulmonary-tuberculosis-in-adults/abstract/3,81\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,81</a>]. Two test platforms are approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for use in the United States: the Amplified <em>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</em> Direct (MTD) test and the Xpert <span class=\"nowrap\">MTB/RIF</span> test. NAA is more sensitive than smear but less sensitive than culture; as few as 1 to 10 <span class=\"nowrap\">organisms/mL</span> may give a positive result [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-of-pulmonary-tuberculosis-in-adults/abstract/82-86\" class=\"abstract_t\">82-86</a>]. NAA testing has excellent positive predictive value in the setting of AFB smear-positive specimens for distinguishing tuberculous from nontuberculous mycobacteria (&gt;95 percent), and it can rapidly establish the presence of tuberculosis in 50 to 80 percent of AFB smear-negative specimens (which would eventually be culture positive) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-of-pulmonary-tuberculosis-in-adults/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. However, NAA does not replace the roles of AFB smear and culture in the diagnostic algorithm for tuberculosis; culture is required for confirmation of identification and for drug susceptibility testing [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-of-pulmonary-tuberculosis-in-adults/abstract/82\" class=\"abstract_t\">82</a>].</p><p>NAA tests permit amplification of a specific target RNA or DNA sequence that can be detected via a nucleic acid probe [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-of-pulmonary-tuberculosis-in-adults/abstract/87,88\" class=\"abstract_t\">87,88</a>].

(See <a href=\"#H751697780\" class=\"local\">'General diagnostic approach'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The diagnosis of pulmonary TB is definitively established by isolation of <em>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</em> from a bodily secretion (eg, culture of sputum, bronchoalveolar lavage, or pleural fluid) or tissue (pleural biopsy or lung biopsy). Additional diagnostic tools include sputum acid-fast bacilli (AFB) smear and nucleic acid amplification (NAA) testing; positive NAA test (with or without AFB smear positivity) is considered sufficient for diagnosis of tuberculosis. (See <a href=\"#H751697780\" class=\"local\">'General diagnostic approach'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The approach to diagnosis of TB begins with a history and physical examination to assess the patient's risk for TB (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F80879\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef80879 \">table 1</a>). Patients meeting clinical criteria should undergo chest radiography; if imaging suggests TB of the lungs or airways, three sputum specimens (obtained via cough or induction at least eight hours apart and including at least one early-morning specimen) should be submitted for AFB smear, mycobacterial culture, and NAA testing (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F112251\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef112251 \">algorithm 1</a>). (See <a href=\"#H751697780\" class=\"local\">'General diagnostic approach'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In addition, a <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tuberculin-skin-test-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">tuberculin skin test</a> (TST) or interferon-gamma release assay (IGRA) should be performed. These are tools designed for diagnosis of latent TB infection; a positive result supports (but cannot be used to establish) a diagnosis of active TB disease, and a negative result does not rule out active TB disease. (See <a href=\"#H751697780\" class=\"local\">'General diagnostic approach'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Establishing a definitive laboratory diagnosis of TB may not be possible in some circumstances. In such cases, a presumptive clinical diagnosis may be based on epidemiologic exposure together with physical findings, radiographic findings, positive TST or IGRA, analysis of sputum or bronchoscopy specimens, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> histopathology. In the setting of high clinical suspicion for tuberculosis, initiation of empiric therapy based on these findings is appropriate. (See <a href=\"#H751697780\" class=\"local\">'General diagnostic approach'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Drug-resistant TB should be suspected in the setting of relevant risk factors; these include prior episode of TB treatment, progressive clinical <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> radiographic findings while on TB therapy, residence in or travel to a region with high prevalence of drug-resistant TB, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> exposure to an individual with known or suspected infectious drug-resistant TB. Definitive diagnosis of drug-resistant TB is established via laboratory identification of <em>M. tuberculosis</em> in sputum (or other clinical specimen), with drug susceptibility testing (DST) demonstrating resistance to one or more antituberculous agents. (See <a href=\"#H3966360228\" class=\"local\">'Suspected drug-resistant TB'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Sputum may be obtained spontaneously (by coughing) or it may be induced by inhalation of aerosolized hypertonic saline generated by a nebulizer. Bronchoscopy with bronchoalveolar lavage and brushings should be reserved for the circumstances described above. Tissue biopsy may establish a definitive diagnosis of tuberculosis when other diagnostic techniques are not diagnostic. (See <a href=\"#H496704006\" class=\"local\">'Obtaining clinical specimens'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Laboratory tools for drug susceptibility testing include culture-based testing (which provides phenotypic information) and molecular testing (which provides genotypic information). Culture-based testing is the gold standard for diagnosis of drug-resistant TB; it allows comparison of growth on drug-containing medium with growth on control medium to establish presence or absence of drug resistance, but it may take at least a month to perform. Molecular tests have faster turnaround time (results available within hours to days) and are useful for guiding initial decisions regarding therapy until definitive culture-based DST is available. (See <a href=\"#H251324285\" class=\"local\">'Microbiologic testing'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>There are two major types of molecular assays: probe-based (non-sequencing) tests and sequence-based assays. Probe-based tests, also known as nucleic acid amplification tests, amplify a specific nucleic acid sequence that can be detected via a nucleic acid probe; some NAA tests can detect genes encoding drug resistance. Sequence-based assays remain investigational and are not approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA). (See <a href=\"#H3035833290\" class=\"local\">'Molecular tests'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Two NAA test platforms are approved by the FDA for use in the United States: the Amplified <em>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</em> Direct (MTD) test and the Xpert <span class=\"nowrap\">MTB/RIF</span> test. The Amplified MTD test is approved for smear-positive or smear-negative respiratory specimens from patients with suspected pulmonary TB and fewer than seven days of treatment; it detects TB but does not detect drug resistance. The Xpert <span class=\"nowrap\">MTB/RIF</span> assay is approved for only induced or expectorated sputum from untreated patients or patients on fewer than three days' therapy; it detects TB and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=rifampin-rifampicin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">rifampin</a> resistance. (See <a href=\"#H4154933816\" class=\"local\">'Probe-based (NAA) tests'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Individuals with confirmed or suspected tuberculosis must be reported to a public health authority promptly.
