Overweight refers to a weight above the &quot;normal&quot; range. This is determined by calculating the body mass index (BMI, defined as the weight in kilograms divided by height in meters squared). Overweight is defined as a BMI of 25 to 29.9 <span class=\"nowrap\">kg/m<sup>2</sup>,</span> obesity as a BMI of &gt;30 <span class=\"nowrap\">kg/m<sup>2</sup></span>. Severe obesity is defined as a BMI &gt;40 <span class=\"nowrap\">kg/m<sup>2</sup></span> (or &ge;35 <span class=\"nowrap\">kg/m<sup>2</sup></span> in the presence of comorbidities).</p><p>Obesity in adulthood is associated with a striking reduction in life expectancy for both men and women. In fact, it has been suggested that the steady rise in life expectancy during the past two centuries may come to an end because of the increasing prevalence of obesity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overweight-and-obesity-in-adults-health-consequences/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Individuals who are both obese and smoke have a substantially greater reduction in life expectancy than nonobese smokers or obese nonsmokers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overweight-and-obesity-in-adults-health-consequences/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].</p><p>The health hazards associated with obesity are reviewed here.

For reasons that are unclear, the BMI range associated with the lowest mortality has been increasing.

Similar results were seen in a second study [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overweight-and-obesity-in-adults-health-consequences/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. The figure (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F73156\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef73156 \">figure 1</a>) shows that increasing BMI for men and women of European ancestry has a curvilinear relation to mortality.

Evidence suggests that obesity varies in its impact on health risk and often may require many years to render deleterious effects.</p><p>In a pooled analysis of four studies with 10-year follow-up, &quot;metabolically healthy obese&quot; individuals had a significantly increased risk of mortality compared with metabolically healthy normal-weight individuals [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overweight-and-obesity-in-adults-health-consequences/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. However, in metabolically healthy overweight individuals, the increased risk of mortality did not reach statistical significance, even when the analysis was restricted to studies with at least 10 years of follow-up (relative risk [RR] 1.21, 95% CI 0.91-1.61). Thus, some of the variability in mortality estimates among overweight people may be due to inadequate adjustment in the analyses for these metabolic factors; a follow-up that is too short to demonstrate a significantly increased mortality risk in overweight, metabolically healthy individuals; or from studies that are too small. However, the most likely explanation is that risks are proportional to excess fat mass, and overweight individuals represent a spectrum of risk that is generally lower than obese individuals.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3997424709\"><span class=\"h4\">Obesity paradox</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Some studies have concluded that elevated BMI may improve survival in individuals with CVD, primarily congestive heart failure, a phenomenon called the &quot;obesity paradox&quot; [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overweight-and-obesity-in-adults-health-consequences/abstract/27,28\" class=\"abstract_t\">27,28</a>]. However, these studies have not considered body fat distribution. Abdominal (versus gluteal) fat mass is strongly predictive of metabolic disease and mortality when measured by dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry (DXA) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overweight-and-obesity-in-adults-health-consequences/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>], waist-to-hip ratio [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overweight-and-obesity-in-adults-health-consequences/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>], or waist circumference [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overweight-and-obesity-in-adults-health-consequences/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. Thus, people with BMI &lt;25 <span class=\"nowrap\">kg/m<sup>2</sup></span> but with central obesity appear to have an increased mortality risk and should be targeted for lifestyle modification strategies.</p><p>In contrast to the many studies reporting that overweight is associated with higher mortality, there are data that suggest lower mortality for those with BMI in the 25 to 30 <span class=\"nowrap\">kg/m<sup>2</sup></span> range [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overweight-and-obesity-in-adults-health-consequences/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. Nevertheless, this was challenged by a large Australian study of 246,314 individuals, again showing the lowest mortality in those with a BMI of 22.5 to 24.99 <span class=\"nowrap\">kg/m<sup>2</sup>,</span> not BMI 25 to 29.99 <span class=\"nowrap\">kg/m<sup>2</sup></span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overweight-and-obesity-in-adults-health-consequences/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4026573491\"><span class=\"h4\">Mortality at low BMI ranges</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A separate question is related to outcomes in individuals with low BMI values.
