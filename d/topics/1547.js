(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-benign-breast-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of benign breast disease&quot;</a>.) </p><p>Proliferative lesions with atypia include atypical ductal hyperplasia (ADH), atypical lobular hyperplasia (ALH), and lobular carcinoma in situ (LCIS). These lesions are considered high risk because they are associated with an increase in the patient's future risk of developing breast cancer [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/atypia-and-lobular-carcinoma-in-situ-high-risk-lesions-of-the-breast/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. While there is evidence to suggest that at least some of these lesions may be nonobligate precursor lesions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/atypia-and-lobular-carcinoma-in-situ-high-risk-lesions-of-the-breast/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>], they are generally managed as risk indicators rather than precursor lesions, as the cancers that subsequently develop may occur in either breast and not necessarily at the site of the atypia. Therefore, when these high-risk lesions are discovered, the focus should be on careful surveillance and consideration of risk reduction strategies. Flat epithelial atypia (FEA) is also an atypical proliferation, but this lesion does not appear to convey an elevation in risk beyond that of any associated proliferative lesions present.</p><p>The diagnosis, pathology, and management of patients with ADH, ALH, LCIS, and FEA will be reviewed here.

The magnitude of increase is similar between ADH and ALH, both with a relative risk of approximately 4 compared with patients who do not have atypia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/atypia-and-lobular-carcinoma-in-situ-high-risk-lesions-of-the-breast/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Although some studies have shown that the risk of developing breast cancer is higher with ALH than ADH, the data are conflicting [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/atypia-and-lobular-carcinoma-in-situ-high-risk-lesions-of-the-breast/abstract/16,17,21,22\" class=\"abstract_t\">16,17,21,22</a>]. </p><p>AH is associated with a generalized, bilateral increase in breast cancer risk [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/atypia-and-lobular-carcinoma-in-situ-high-risk-lesions-of-the-breast/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>], although there is a slight preponderance of ipsilateral breast cancers. In a report from the Nurses' Health Study, 56 percent of cancers that developed in women with AH occurred in the ipsilateral breast [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/atypia-and-lobular-carcinoma-in-situ-high-risk-lesions-of-the-breast/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. The cumulative incidence of breast cancer over 30 years approached 35 percent. </p><p>Data on the effect of family history of breast cancer in women with AH are conflicting. Older studies showed that a family history of breast cancer substantially increased the breast cancer risk in women with AH [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/atypia-and-lobular-carcinoma-in-situ-high-risk-lesions-of-the-breast/abstract/21,23\" class=\"abstract_t\">21,23</a>]. However, several retrospective studies have now found that family history was a risk factor for breast cancer independent of type of benign breast disease found on a breast biopsy (nonproliferative, proliferative, or atypical hyperplasia) and that the presence of atypia did not further increase the breast cancer risk [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/atypia-and-lobular-carcinoma-in-situ-high-risk-lesions-of-the-breast/abstract/16,23\" class=\"abstract_t\">16,23</a>].

Although both lesions are associated with an increased risk of invasive breast cancer, the magnitude of risk associated with LCIS is much greater than with ALH [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/atypia-and-lobular-carcinoma-in-situ-high-risk-lesions-of-the-breast/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. Because of this difference and the implications for treatment, most experts continue to separate the two entities rather than using the all-encompassing term &quot;lobular neoplasia.&quot; ALH has been discussed above. (See <a href=\"#H3427292091\" class=\"local\">'Atypical lobular hyperplasia (ALH)'</a> above.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2986956512\"><span class=\"h2\">Epidemiology</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>LCIS is an uncommon finding, as suggested by autopsy studies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/atypia-and-lobular-carcinoma-in-situ-high-risk-lesions-of-the-breast/abstract/25-28\" class=\"abstract_t\">25-28</a>]. The true incidence in the general population is unknown, due to lack of clinical and mammographic signs. Differences in diagnostic criteria and patient populations undergoing biopsy have led to wide variations in reported incidence [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/atypia-and-lobular-carcinoma-in-situ-high-risk-lesions-of-the-breast/abstract/29-33\" class=\"abstract_t\">29-33</a>]. As an example, in one report that included 5000 women undergoing breast biopsies between 1930 and 1972, 3.6 percent of &quot;benign&quot; lesions were LCIS [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/atypia-and-lobular-carcinoma-in-situ-high-risk-lesions-of-the-breast/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. However, some of the lesions in this series would be classified as ALH by others [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/atypia-and-lobular-carcinoma-in-situ-high-risk-lesions-of-the-breast/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. In later reports that used stricter diagnostic criteria, LCIS was noted in 0.5 percent of otherwise benign breast biopsies performed for clinical abnormalities [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/atypia-and-lobular-carcinoma-in-situ-high-risk-lesions-of-the-breast/abstract/29,33\" class=\"abstract_t\">29,33</a>].</p><p>A higher prevalence of LCIS (2.3 percent) was noted in a review of 6287 breast biopsies performed because of a mammographic abnormality; LCIS accounted for 9.8 percent of mammographically detected lesions classified as malignancies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/atypia-and-lobular-carcinoma-in-situ-high-risk-lesions-of-the-breast/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>]. Because there are no specific mammographic findings associated with LCIS [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/atypia-and-lobular-carcinoma-in-situ-high-risk-lesions-of-the-breast/abstract/35,36\" class=\"abstract_t\">35,36</a>], the calcifications that prompted a biopsy may have been associated with benign proliferative processes (eg, adenosis) adjacent to the LCIS, rather than within the lobules involved by LCIS (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F67947\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef67947 \">picture 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/atypia-and-lobular-carcinoma-in-situ-high-risk-lesions-of-the-breast/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>].</p><p>The mean age at diagnosis is between 44 and 46 years of age, and 80 to 90 percent of cases occur in premenopausal women [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/atypia-and-lobular-carcinoma-in-situ-high-risk-lesions-of-the-breast/abstract/29-33,37,38\" class=\"abstract_t\">29-33,37,38</a>]. While this may be related to the increased number of benign breast abnormalities requiring biopsy in premenopausal women, it is also likely that LCIS is dependent upon hormonal influences; LCIS cells are strongly estrogen receptors (ER) positive [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/atypia-and-lobular-carcinoma-in-situ-high-risk-lesions-of-the-breast/abstract/39,40\" class=\"abstract_t\">39,40</a>]. Incidence rates in postmenopausal women have steadily increased over the last two decades [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/atypia-and-lobular-carcinoma-in-situ-high-risk-lesions-of-the-breast/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>], perhaps due to the widespread use of screening mammography. The incidence of LCIS is approximately 10-fold higher in white women than in African-American women in the United States [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/atypia-and-lobular-carcinoma-in-situ-high-risk-lesions-of-the-breast/abstract/42,43\" class=\"abstract_t\">42,43</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2512872377\"><span class=\"h2\">Diagnosis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>LCIS almost always represents an incidental finding that is diagnosed on a breast biopsy performed for some other reason, such as an area of fibrocystic change or a fibroadenoma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/atypia-and-lobular-carcinoma-in-situ-high-risk-lesions-of-the-breast/abstract/44\" class=\"abstract_t\">44</a>].

The histologic features further differ between classic and pleomorphic LCIS. This difference is an important one because it impacts management. (See <a href=\"#H4164861574\" class=\"local\">'Management'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2846966565\"><span class=\"h3\">Classic LCIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>LCIS is characterized by a solid proliferation of small cells, with small, uniform, round-to-oval nuclei and variably distinct cell borders (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F67947\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef67947 \">picture 1</a>). The cells typically show cytologic dyshesion. The cytoplasm is clear to lightly eosinophilic; occasionally, the cells contain intracytoplasmic vacuoles that may be large enough to produce signet ring cell forms. Rarely, cases are difficult to classify as either ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) or LCIS, as there is some cytologic overlap in the features of low nuclear grade DCIS with a solid growth pattern and LCIS.</p><p>The cells of LCIS are typically ER positive, rarely show overexpression of human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2), and have a very low proliferative rate.</p><p>LCIS is usually present in the terminal duct lobular units and distends and distorts the involved spaces; the extralobular ducts may also be involved. The growth within these ducts may be either solid or pagetoid (ie, the LCIS cells are insinuated between the duct basement membrane and the native ductal epithelial cells). </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1931775278\"><span class=\"h3\">Pleomorphic LCIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Pleomorphic LCIS, originally described in 1996, consists of larger cells that demonstrate marked nuclear pleomorphism [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/atypia-and-lobular-carcinoma-in-situ-high-risk-lesions-of-the-breast/abstract/45\" class=\"abstract_t\">45</a>] but otherwise demonstrate the same characteristics of cytologic dyshesion and intracytoplasmic vacuoles as classical LCIS. Pleomorphic LCIS often demonstrates central necrosis and calcifications, which are otherwise rarely seen with LCIS but are more commonly associated with DCIS [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/atypia-and-lobular-carcinoma-in-situ-high-risk-lesions-of-the-breast/abstract/46\" class=\"abstract_t\">46</a>]. </p><p>Recognition of the pleomorphic lobular phenotype is critical because the nuclear features, necrosis, and calcifications can make the differentiation from DCIS challenging. Furthermore, pleomorphic LCIS can be associated with an infiltrating pleomorphic lobular carcinoma, in which the infiltrating tumor cells have the same morphologic appearance as the in situ component [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/atypia-and-lobular-carcinoma-in-situ-high-risk-lesions-of-the-breast/abstract/47-49\" class=\"abstract_t\">47-49</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4164861574\"><span class=\"h2\">Management</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2035841422\"><span class=\"h3\">After core biopsy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Surgical excision is recommended for any nonclassical LCIS (eg, pleomorphic LCIS, LCIS with necrosis) diagnosed on core needle biopsy (CNB) or any LCIS with imaging-pathologic discordance. Incidental classic LCIS with imaging-pathologic concordance and without other high-risk lesions that require excision can be observed with clinical and imaging follow-up based on risk assessment and multidisciplinary input [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/atypia-and-lobular-carcinoma-in-situ-high-risk-lesions-of-the-breast/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. </p><p>Guidelines from the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) continue to suggest excision for all cases of LCIS diagnosed by CNB [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/atypia-and-lobular-carcinoma-in-situ-high-risk-lesions-of-the-breast/abstract/50\" class=\"abstract_t\">50</a>]. However, as discussed above, if LCIS is identified by a CNB and is demonstrated through radiologic-pathologic correlation to be incidental to a target lesion that does not require excision, the upgrade rate is very low (&lt;3 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/atypia-and-lobular-carcinoma-in-situ-high-risk-lesions-of-the-breast/abstract/11-13,51\" class=\"abstract_t\">11-13,51</a>]. Consequently, clinical and radiologic follow-up is an acceptable alternative to excisional biopsy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/atypia-and-lobular-carcinoma-in-situ-high-risk-lesions-of-the-breast/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2318997022\"><span class=\"h3\">After surgical excision</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>If classic LCIS is diagnosed on an excisional breast biopsy, no further surgery is required.

Re-excision to negative margins is recommended for pleomorphic LCIS. There are no data on the optimal width of negative margin or the benefit of radiation therapy for patients with pleomorphic LCIS. </p><p>If an invasive carcinoma is detected, appropriate management should be initiated. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-the-treatment-of-newly-diagnosed-non-metastatic-breast-cancer#H3101248\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of the treatment of newly diagnosed, non-metastatic breast cancer&quot;, section on 'Patient stratification'</a>.)</p><p>LCIS is detected in association with an invasive carcinoma in approximately 5 percent of malignant breast specimens [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/atypia-and-lobular-carcinoma-in-situ-high-risk-lesions-of-the-breast/abstract/54,55\" class=\"abstract_t\">54,55</a>]. At least some data suggest that women with an invasive cancer and LCIS in the specimen may have a greater risk of disease recurrence than those without LCIS [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/atypia-and-lobular-carcinoma-in-situ-high-risk-lesions-of-the-breast/abstract/54\" class=\"abstract_t\">54</a>]. However, others have failed to document an increased risk of local recurrence after breast conservation in women with invasive breast cancer and associated LCIS (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F72607\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef72607 \">table 1</a>). Thus, the presence of LCIS in association with an invasive cancer is not a contraindication to breast-conserving therapy, and there is no need to obtain negative margins around LCIS if the margins around the invasive component are negative. The only exception to this general rule is pleomorphic LCIS. </p><p>Historically, women with LCIS were once treated with prophylactic bilateral mastectomy. Most experts now consider prophylactic bilateral mastectomy too drastic for the moderate level of risk associated with LCIS in the absence of other contributory risk factors (eg, family history premenopausal breast cancer) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/atypia-and-lobular-carcinoma-in-situ-high-risk-lesions-of-the-breast/abstract/56,57\" class=\"abstract_t\">56,57</a>]. While women with LCIS have a significantly higher risk for developing invasive breast cancer compared with the general population, most will not develop invasive cancer. Because of the paucity of data on this topic and the enormous personal impact of bilateral mastectomy on an individual woman's life, the decision to pursue prophylactic surgery must be highly individualized [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/atypia-and-lobular-carcinoma-in-situ-high-risk-lesions-of-the-breast/abstract/56\" class=\"abstract_t\">56</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1266583560\"><span class=\"h2\">Future breast cancer risk and its reduction</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The relative risk of developing an invasive cancer in women with LCIS is approximately 7- to 11-fold higher than for women without LCIS [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/atypia-and-lobular-carcinoma-in-situ-high-risk-lesions-of-the-breast/abstract/1,29-32,38,58-61\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,29-32,38,58-61</a>]. The absolute risk is approximately 1 percent per year and appears to be lifelong.</p><p>The best available risk estimates are derived from a population-based study of close to 20,000 women diagnosed with LCIS from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) database between 1983 and 2014 in whom the cumulative incidences of subsequent breast malignancy were 11.3 percent (95% CI 10.7 to 11.9 percent) and 19.8 percent (95% CI 18.8 to 20.9 percent) at 10 and 20 years, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/atypia-and-lobular-carcinoma-in-situ-high-risk-lesions-of-the-breast/abstract/62\" class=\"abstract_t\">62</a>]. The cumulative incidence of a subsequent breast cancer diagnosis increased with increasing age, from 6.9 percent at 10 years in those under 40 to 13.9 percent in those over 70. At a median follow-up of 8.1 years (range 0 to 30.9 years), primary breast cancer was diagnosed in 9.4 percent of the cohort. The majority of the cancers were early stage, of low to intermediate histologic grade, and hormone receptor-positive. Among the 1837 of them, 42, 20, 13.5, and 21 percent were invasive ductal cancer (IDC), invasive lobular cancer (ILC), mixed ductal and lobular cancer, and ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS), respectively. IDC distributed equally across both breasts, whereas ILC was more likely to present in the ipsilateral breast (69.0 percent ILC versus 49.2 percent IDC). The 10- and 20-year breast cancer specific survival for women with LCIS was excellent at 98.9 and 96.3 percent, respectively. On multivariable analysis, type of surgical treatment for LCIS had no effect on long-term survival. </p><p>Efforts to identify features of LCIS that are associated with a higher likelihood of developing invasive breast cancer have been unsuccessful [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/atypia-and-lobular-carcinoma-in-situ-high-risk-lesions-of-the-breast/abstract/30,54\" class=\"abstract_t\">30,54</a>].
