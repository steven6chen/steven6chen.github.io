The biology of these viruses has been studied extensively and its link with malignancies is well established, specifically with cancers involving the anogenital (cervical, vaginal, vulvar, penile, anal) tract and those involving the head and neck. The virology of HPV and its association with malignancy will be reviewed here. The clinical manifestations, diagnosis, epidemiology, prevention, and treatment of HPV infection are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=human-papillomavirus-infections-epidemiology-and-disease-associations\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Human papillomavirus infections: Epidemiology and disease associations&quot;</a>.) </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">VIROLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Human papillomavirus (HPV) is a small deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) virus of approximately 7900 base pairs. DNA sequencing techniques have facilitated HPV typing and characterization, with each type formally defined as distinct by having less than 90 percent DNA base-pair homology with any another HPV type [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/virology-of-human-papillomavirus-infections-and-the-link-to-cancer/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. There are over 40 HPV types that infect the anogenital area. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">HPV GENOTYPES AND RISK OF CANCER</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>HPV genotypes&rsquo; association with cancer risk varies, and is reviewed below.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H458612261\"><span class=\"h2\">Cervical cancer</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There is a broad separation of HPV types based on their associated risk of cervical cancer:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>High-risk &ndash; This includes HPV 16, 18, 31, 33, 35, 39, 45, 51, 52, 56, 58, 59, and 68</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Low-risk &ndash; 6, 11, 40, 42, 43, 44, 53, 54, 61, 72, 73, and 81</p><p/><p>Types 16 and 18 are the most commonly isolated HPV types in cervical cancer, with type 16 found in approximately 50 percent of patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/virology-of-human-papillomavirus-infections-and-the-link-to-cancer/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. However, not all infections with HPV type 16 or 18 progress to cancer. Furthermore, within single oncogenic HPV types, variants exist that are associated with different oncogenic potential [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/virology-of-human-papillomavirus-infections-and-the-link-to-cancer/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. The epidemiology of these high-risk types is discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=human-papillomavirus-infections-epidemiology-and-disease-associations#H735670902\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Human papillomavirus infections: Epidemiology and disease associations&quot;, section on 'Cervical cancer'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H458612325\"><span class=\"h2\">Head and neck cancer</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>HPV infection is associated with some forms of oral squamous cell cancers, particularly those of the oropharynx. There is an approximately two to fourfold increased risk for cancers of the oral cavity and oropharynx in patients infected with high-risk (oncogenic) HPV types [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/virology-of-human-papillomavirus-infections-and-the-link-to-cancer/abstract/4,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,5</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=human-papillomavirus-associated-head-and-neck-cancer\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Human papillomavirus associated head and neck cancer&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Furthermore, the same sexual behaviors associated with risk for anogenital HPV-related cancers may increase the risk of HPV-related oropharyngeal squamous cell cancers, particularly in those patients coinfected with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/virology-of-human-papillomavirus-infections-and-the-link-to-cancer/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. This was shown in one study of HIV-positive and HIV-negative men and women, which reported that oral HPV infection was common (34 percent). In HIV-negative individuals, risk for HPV infection increased with number of recent orogenital or oroanal sex partners. In HIV-positive individuals, risk increased with lower CD4 T cell counts and increased number of lifetime sex partners [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/virology-of-human-papillomavirus-infections-and-the-link-to-cancer/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H458612267\"><span class=\"h2\">Anal cancer</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>HPV is also implicated in cancer of the anus [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/virology-of-human-papillomavirus-infections-and-the-link-to-cancer/abstract/1,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,8</a>], and the spectrum of HPV types in the anal canal is similar to that described in the cervix [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/virology-of-human-papillomavirus-infections-and-the-link-to-cancer/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. </p><p>HPV 16 is the most commonly detected HPV type associated with anal cancer [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/virology-of-human-papillomavirus-infections-and-the-link-to-cancer/abstract/9-11\" class=\"abstract_t\">9-11</a>]. However, the range of HPV genotypes associated with anal cancer seems to depend on whether or not it is occurring in the context of HIV co-infection. As examples:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>One study evaluated HPV genotypes in anal swab samples of men who have sex with men (MSM), with or without associated HIV infection and isolated 29 and 10 HPV genotypes, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/virology-of-human-papillomavirus-infections-and-the-link-to-cancer/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. Despite this, the range of HPV types was similar in both HIV-positive and HIV-negative men. <br/><br/>A few of the more commonly isolated HPV types in the anal samples have only rarely been reported in cervical samples (types 53, 58, 61, 70). HPV 32, characteristically an oral HPV type, was also isolated from anal samples and may indicate transmission by oral-anal intercourse [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/virology-of-human-papillomavirus-infections-and-the-link-to-cancer/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a cohort of 346 HIV-infected and 262 HIV-negative men, multiple anal HPV types were more common in the HIV-infected patients (73 versus 23 percent). The presence of multiple high-risk HPV types was associated with significant immunosuppression (CD4 T cell count below <span class=\"nowrap\">200/mm<sup>3</sup>)</span> in HIV-positive individuals. <br/><br/>This finding could reflect increased reporting of receptive anal intercourse in this population or increased HPV replication in patients with the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) that is probably related to failure of local mucosal immunity and reactivation of HPV to reach detectable levels [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/virology-of-human-papillomavirus-infections-and-the-link-to-cancer/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H458612286\"><span class=\"h2\">Penile cancer</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>HPV infection is also a risk factor for carcinoma of the penis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/virology-of-human-papillomavirus-infections-and-the-link-to-cancer/abstract/12,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,13</a>]. In one case-control study, 33 of 67 penile cancers were positive for HPV, of which 70 percent were HPV-16 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/virology-of-human-papillomavirus-infections-and-the-link-to-cancer/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. Further, the risk of penile cancer among men reporting a history of condyloma acuminata was 5.9 times greater than that of men reporting no such history.

Both E6 and E7 proteins are consistently expressed in HPV-carrying anogenital malignant tumors, and they act in a cooperative manner to immortalize epithelial cells [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/virology-of-human-papillomavirus-infections-and-the-link-to-cancer/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. At the molecular level, the ability of E6 and E7 proteins to transform cells relates in part to their interaction with two intracellular proteins, p53 and retinoblastoma (Rb), respectively. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=anal-squamous-intraepithelial-lesions-diagnosis-screening-prevention-and-treatment\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Anal squamous intraepithelial lesions: Diagnosis, screening, prevention, and treatment&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=vaginal-intraepithelial-neoplasia\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Vaginal intraepithelial neoplasia&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=preinvasive-and-invasive-cervical-neoplasia-in-hiv-infected-women\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Preinvasive and invasive cervical neoplasia in HIV-infected women&quot;</a>.) </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Role of p53 protein</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In the normal cell, the p53 protein is a negative regulator of cell growth, controlling cell cycle transit from <span class=\"nowrap\">G0/G1</span> to S phase, and also functions as a tumor suppressor protein by halting cell growth after chromosomal damage and allowing DNA repair enzymes to function [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/virology-of-human-papillomavirus-infections-and-the-link-to-cancer/abstract/18-21\" class=\"abstract_t\">18-21</a>]. Following E6 binding of p53, p53 is degraded in the presence of E6-associated protein [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/virology-of-human-papillomavirus-infections-and-the-link-to-cancer/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. This allows unchecked cellular cycling, and has an anti-apoptotic effect, permitting the accumulation of chromosomal mutations without DNA repair [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/virology-of-human-papillomavirus-infections-and-the-link-to-cancer/abstract/23,24\" class=\"abstract_t\">23,24</a>]. This leads to chromosomal instability in high-risk HPV-containing cells. The interaction of E6 with p53 may also affect regulation <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> degradation of the Src family of nonreceptor tyrosine kinases, potentially playing a role in the stimulation of mitotic activity in infected cells [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/virology-of-human-papillomavirus-infections-and-the-link-to-cancer/abstract/14,25\" class=\"abstract_t\">14,25</a>].</p><p>In contrast to the E6 protein, E7 protein sensitizes wild-type p53-containing cells to apoptosis, but exerts an anti-apoptotic effect in cells with mutated p53 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/virology-of-human-papillomavirus-infections-and-the-link-to-cancer/abstract/26,27\" class=\"abstract_t\">26,27</a>]. The possible significance of this finding is discussed in the next section.

One of the functions of Rb is to bind and render inactive the E2F transcription factor. E2F controls DNA synthesis and cyclin function and promotes the S phase of cell cycling. E7 interacts with Rb protein via an <span class=\"nowrap\">E2F/Rb</span> protein complex. When E7 binds to Rb protein, E2F is released and allows cyclin A to promote cell cycling [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/virology-of-human-papillomavirus-infections-and-the-link-to-cancer/abstract/29,30\" class=\"abstract_t\">29,30</a>]. The interaction of E7 with Rb may permit cells with damaged DNA to bypass the G1 growth arrest normally induced by wild-type p53 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/virology-of-human-papillomavirus-infections-and-the-link-to-cancer/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]. These processes allow unchecked cell growth in the presence of genomic instability that may lead to malignant change.</p><p>In support of the importance of E7 in cellular transformation, inhibition of E7 binding to Rb abolishes its transforming ability [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/virology-of-human-papillomavirus-infections-and-the-link-to-cancer/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>]. However, other mechanisms of E7-mediated cell transformation probably also play a role. As an example, several interactions of E7 with transcription factors have been described [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/virology-of-human-papillomavirus-infections-and-the-link-to-cancer/abstract/33,34\" class=\"abstract_t\">33,34</a>], and E7 protein inactivates the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors p21(CIP-1) and p27(KIP-1), which may lead to growth stimulation of HPV-infected cells [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/virology-of-human-papillomavirus-infections-and-the-link-to-cancer/abstract/35,36\" class=\"abstract_t\">35,36</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Other proteins</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Other HPV proteins that may be involved in malignant transformation of a cell are E1 (regulation of DNA replication and maintaining the virus in episomal form), E2 (cooperation with E1, viral DNA replication, down-regulation of E6 and E7 expression), and E5 (regulation of cell growth) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/virology-of-human-papillomavirus-infections-and-the-link-to-cancer/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. The HPV genome exists in two forms. Most commonly, it is found in a circular episomal form that replicates autonomously outside the host cell chromosome but within the host cell nucleus. Under certain conditions associated with the development and presence of high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions (HSIL) and cancer, the episome linearizes and becomes integrated into the host cell genome. The site of linearization in the episomal form is usually within the E2 viral gene and leads to an alteration of the E2 gene product, disrupting the repressor functions of E2 and leading to increased expression of the E6 and E7 oncoproteins [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/virology-of-human-papillomavirus-infections-and-the-link-to-cancer/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. In one study, E2 produced growth arrest in HeLa cells by repression of the E6 and E7 promoter; expression of E6 and E7 off a different promoter reversed the growth arrest [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/virology-of-human-papillomavirus-infections-and-the-link-to-cancer/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">HIV infection</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In addition to the effects of immunosuppression, which promotes the persistence of HPV infection, co-infection with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/virology-of-human-papillomavirus-infections-and-the-link-to-cancer/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>] may directly promote HPV-associated oncogenesis at the molecular level.

Although primary immunodeficiencies are rare, the possibility of an underlying immune disorder should be considered in patients with particularly severe or refractory HPV infections.

HPV testing is increasingly being used in clinical management of patients. HPV testing falls into three main categories [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/virology-of-human-papillomavirus-infections-and-the-link-to-cancer/abstract/49\" class=\"abstract_t\">49</a>]: </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>HPV DNA testing &ndash; HPV DNA testing was the first approach developed for routine clinical testing. Many studies showed that the addition of HPV DNA testing to cervical cytology improved the sensitivity for detection of cervical cancer precursors, such as cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) 2 and 3. However, the specificity also decreased, resulting in the potential unnecessary referral of women for colposcopy. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>HPV ribonucleic acid (RNA) testing &ndash; HPV RNA testing, looking for expression of E6 <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> E7 RNA, may be performed with the expectation that active HPV oncogene expression would provide equivalent sensitivity and better specificity than HPV DNA testing. RNA-based testing has received US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval for cervical HPV testing, as it significantly improves the specificity of detecting cervical intraepithelial neoplasia grade 2 and above (CIN2+), thereby decreasing the number of &quot;false-positive&quot; HPV tests compared with HPV DNA testing. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Detection of cellular markers &ndash; Cellular marker detection uses a different approach to diagnosing HPV-associated disease. The HPV E7 protein disrupts cell cycling, leading to an increase in cellular p16 protein expression. High-grade CIN lesions contain high levels of p16, and pathologists often immunostain cervical biopsies to help distinguish between high-grade CIN and immature squamous metaplasia, which is not associated with HPV and is not precancerous. A large study investigating the combination <span class=\"nowrap\">p16/Ki-67</span> dual-stained cytology has demonstrated superior sensitivity and noninferior specificity over Pap cytology to detect cervical high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions (HSIL) dysplasia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/virology-of-human-papillomavirus-infections-and-the-link-to-cancer/abstract/50\" class=\"abstract_t\">50</a>]. None of the p16-based tests are FDA-approved for screening at this time.</p><p/><p>There are several HPV DNA tests that are currently approved by the FDA for clinical use. These include Hybrid Capture 2 (HC2), Cervista, and the PCR-based Cobas 4800 test. HC2 detects a cocktail of 13 different high-risk (oncogenic) HPV types and reports the results as positive for one or more of these types, or negative for all. The Cervista and Cobas tests detect HPV 66 in addition to the 13 HPV types detected by HC2. The Cobas test identifies HPV types 16 and 18, while detecting the remaining 12 types in a probe mix. The Cervista test indicates positivity for one or more types in the 14-probe mix, but also offers the option of testing for HPV <span class=\"nowrap\">16/18</span> specifically. The Aptima HPV test is an FDA-approved RNA-based test. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H458612406\"><span class=\"h2\">Indications for testing</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The role of HPV testing is in evolution:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Cervical cancer screening &ndash; HPV testing as part of a screening program for cervical cancer in women is indicated either as a single, primary screening test among women aged 25 years or older, or as cotesting with a Pap test. The Cobas 4800 test is currently the only test that is FDA-approved for primary HPV testing.
