The pain lasts a few seconds to a few minutes, and usually happens on only one side of the face. The attacks can happen over and over again.</p><p>Often, certain movements or activities make the pain attacks happen. These can include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Touching the face</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Chewing</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Talking</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Brushing the teeth</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Smiling or frowning</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Cold air on the face</p><p/><p>TN can also cause muscle spasms in the face, along with pain.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10751182\"><span class=\"h1\">Will I need tests?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Maybe. Your doctor or nurse should be able to tell if you have TN by learning about your symptoms and doing an exam.</p><p>He or she might do tests to get more information about your TN or what's causing it. These tests can include an MRI or CT scan of your brain. These are imaging tests that can create pictures of your brain.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10751197\"><span class=\"h1\">How is trigeminal neuralgia treated?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>TN is usually treated with medicine. Doctors can use different types of medicines to treat TN. Most often doctors prescribe a type of medicine normally used to prevent seizures. The one used most often to treat TN is called <a href=\"topic.htm?path=carbamazepine-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">carbamazepine</a> (sample brand names: Carbatrol, Tegretol). There are several others, too. These medicines quiet the nerve signals that cause pain in TN.</p><p>For most people, the medicine helps reduce the number of TN attacks they have and makes their pain less severe. But if medicines don't help enough or cause too many side effects, your doctor might talk with you about other treatment options. These include different types of surgical procedures that quiet the nerve and make it less likely to fire. These surgical treatments might help with symptoms, but side effects sometimes happen, including numbness or pain in the face.</p></div><div id=\"reviewProcess\"><span>All topics are updated as new evidence becomes available and our <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/home/editorial-policy\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"policy policy_editorialpolicy\">peer review process</a> is complete.</span></div><div id=\"topicRetrievedDate\"><span class=\"emphasis\">This topic retrieved from UpToDate on: </span>Apr 02, 2018.</div><div id=\"disclaimer\">The content on the UpToDate website is not intended nor recommended as a substitute for medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.
