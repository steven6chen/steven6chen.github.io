The incidence of invasive cervical adenocarcinoma and its variants has increased dramatically over the past few decades; this cell type now accounts for about 25 percent of all invasive cervical cancers diagnosed in the United States (US) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/invasive-cervical-adenocarcinoma/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>]. Neuroendocrine (predominantly small cell poorly differentiated) carcinomas and other rare cell types together comprise 3 to 5 percent of all cases.

Very few of these studies report separate outcomes for adenocarcinoma, and no prospective study has focused on the treatment of adenocarcinoma as the sole histology. As a result, our understanding of the natural history and optimal management of adenocarcinoma of the cervix is limited.</p><p>There are many similarities between adenocarcinoma and SCC of the cervix, and they are treated the same at most institutions. However, there are also several differences in epidemiology, prognostic factors, patterns of failure after primary treatment, and possibly in response to specific treatments [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/invasive-cervical-adenocarcinoma/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Despite these differences, specific treatment strategies tailored to adenocarcinoma have not yet emerged.</p><p>This topic will focus on unique issues pertaining to invasive cervical adenocarcinoma. Clinical features, staging, and management issues that are common to SCC and adenocarcinoma, as well as adenocarcinoma in situ, are discussed in depth separately.

Several causative factors have been proposed to explain this trend, including increased prevalence of specific human papillomavirus (HPV)-16 and 18 variants that are associated more with adenocarcinoma than with SCC as well as exposure to endogenous (eg, obesity) as well as exogenous (eg, hormonal contraception, postmenopausal estrogen therapy) estrogens. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The mean age at diagnosis of invasive cervical adenocarcinoma is the early 50s [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/invasive-cervical-adenocarcinoma/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].

Although classified as mucinous adenocarcinomas, most are only focally mucinous [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/invasive-cervical-adenocarcinoma/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. They are characterized by an irregular haphazard arrangement of glands lined by cells resembling those that line normal endocervical glands.</p><p>Pure or almost pure mucinous adenocarcinomas do occur, including an intestinal type, signet ring cell variant, and an important subtype, minimal deviation adenocarcinoma (adenoma malignum), which has a bland cytologic appearance and may be mistaken for a benign lesion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/invasive-cervical-adenocarcinoma/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. The precursor lesion of most invasive cervical adenocarcinomas is believed to be adenocarcinoma in situ (AIS). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cervical-adenocarcinoma-in-situ\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Cervical adenocarcinoma in situ&quot;</a>.) </p><p>Adenosquamous carcinoma is a tumor composed of admixed malignant glandular and squamous elements. It does not appear to originate from AIS and demonstrates more aggressive features than other cervical adenocarcinomas, such as higher tumor grade and lymphovascular invasion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/invasive-cervical-adenocarcinoma/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. </p><p>Endometrioid-type adenocarcinomas with the characteristic histology of tubular glands are infrequently diagnosed, but they have a better prognosis than adenocarcinomas of the usual endocervical type [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/invasive-cervical-adenocarcinoma/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. </p><p>These tumors display histologic features that are identical to endometrial carcinomas, and the possibility of a primary endometrial adenocarcinoma with endocervical extension or drop metastasis must be excluded before the diagnosis of a primary endocervical endometrioid adenocarcinoma is established. </p><p>Despite the better prognosis, management for endometrioid histology is generally the same as for other cervical adenocarcinomas.

Many women are asymptomatic and, where cervical cancer screening is routinely performed, cervical adenocarcinoma is most commonly detected through cervical cytology. When symptoms occur, women are most likely to present with postcoital bleeding. In some women, a cervical mass is discovered upon pelvic examination that is performed for other indications. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=invasive-cervical-cancer-epidemiology-risk-factors-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis#H6\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Invasive cervical cancer: Epidemiology, risk factors, clinical manifestations, and diagnosis&quot;, section on 'Clinical manifestations'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=screening-for-cervical-cancer#H3216639\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Screening for cervical cancer&quot;, section on 'The Papanicolaou test'</a>.) </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H175763\"><span class=\"h1\">DIAGNOSIS AND STAGING</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>As with squamous cell carcinoma (SCC), cervical adenocarcinoma is diagnosed with a cervical biopsy. The depth of invasion, which correlates with the incidence of metastatic disease, is measured from the luminal surface of the tumor or overlying benign epithelium to the deepest invasive tumor nest [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/invasive-cervical-adenocarcinoma/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. &#160;</p><p>The vast majority of adenocarcinomas have an obvious invasive component. The exception to this is microinvasive disease. Microinvasive cervical adenocarcinoma (also termed early invasive adenocarcinoma, International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics <span class=\"nowrap\">[FIGO]/American</span> Joint Committee on Cancer [AJCC] stage IA1 or 1A2 disease (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F113542\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef113542 \">table 2</a>)) is most commonly detected postoperatively on a conization performed for presumed adenocarcinoma in situ (AIS). (See <a href=\"#H453094955\" class=\"local\">'Staging system'</a> below.)</p><p>Conization is required to define the microinvasive lesion, and a negative margin is required to confirm the absence of additional disease. This is particularly important for cervical adenocarcinoma since, in contrast to cervical SCC, noncontiguous lesions (&quot;skip lesions&quot;) are often found. In general, we do not recommend additional biopsies in the setting of a negative conization margin. </p><p>If the conization margin is positive for invasive tumor, a second conization is mandatory. If there is no residual disease on the second procedure, then a diagnosis of microinvasive (stage IA1 or IA2) disease can safely be made. If the second conization demonstrates additional invasive disease, then it should be classified as invasive disease and staged accordingly. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H453094955\"><span class=\"h2\">Staging system</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The staging schema for cervical adenocarcinoma and its variants is the same as for SCC. The joint FIGO and AJCC staging system is listed in the table (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F113542\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef113542 \">table 2</a>). Although not explicitly stated in the staging table, involvement of the upper two-thirds of the vagina is also considered stage IIA disease.

Optional testing modalities (eg, computed tomography [CT], positron emission tomography [PET]) are widely performed, where available, and the results of these tests are used for planning treatment, but not for staging.</p><p>The urinary tract should be imaged in all patients with more than microscopic disease; most clinicians use CT urography, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), or fused <span class=\"nowrap\">PET/CT</span> rather than IVP. This provides information about disease in the upper abdomen and retroperitoneum in addition to evaluating for hydronephrosis. Suspicion of lymphadenopathy in the region of the pelvic or paraaortic lymph nodes may alter the treatment plan. We usually recommend both a <span class=\"nowrap\">PET/CT</span> and an MRI scan in women with microscopically invasive or more advanced stage cervical adenocarcinoma to help guide treatment.

It is possible that RT as part of management is more effective in this histology for local control in stage IB tumors. However, even with adequate pelvic control in those treated with RT, distant relapse rates are higher, raising the question of whether distant relapse could be prevented (and outcomes improved) through the routine use of adjuvant systemic treatment. However, these results are from unplanned subset analyses of small groups of patients, and they should be considered hypothesis-generating, at best.

As an example, the risk of ovarian metastases is higher in women with cervical adenocarcinoma than among those with SCC (2 versus 0.5 percent in one Gynecologic Oncology Group [GOG] study of women with stage IB cervical cancer) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/invasive-cervical-adenocarcinoma/abstract/47\" class=\"abstract_t\">47</a>], and women with cervical adenocarcinoma who are appropriate for surgical treatment should undergo oophorectomy at the time of hysterectomy. </p><p>The general principles that guide therapy are to offer patients single-modality treatment if at all possible and to avoid radical surgery followed by chemoradiotherapy. Surgery is generally preferred over initial chemoradiotherapy if the patient is an appropriate candidate for surgery, given the lower rate of long-term treatment-related adverse effects [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/invasive-cervical-adenocarcinoma/abstract/46,48\" class=\"abstract_t\">46,48</a>]. However, if risk factors are identified pretreatment (eg, evidence of lymph node involvement on pretreatment imaging, tumor size &gt;4 cm, deep stromal invasion to the middle or deep one-third, or lymphovascular space invasion as seen in the initial biopsy) that indicate the need for adjuvant therapy after surgery, then we prefer upfront chemoradiotherapy.

At a median follow-up of 87 months, the five-year overall and disease-free survival rates were the same for both treatment groups (83 and 74 percent, respectively). However, multivariate analysis demonstrated a survival advantage for patients with adenocarcinoma who underwent primary surgery. It remains to be determined whether this result was due to an increased effectiveness of surgery or the absence of a benefit from radiotherapy (possibly due to the lack of concurrent chemotherapy) in women with adenocarcinoma.</p><p>As noted above, some data raise the possibility that adenocarcinomas have a poorer outcome with RT alone than do SCCs, but that relative radioresistance might be overcome through the use of concurrent chemotherapy. As a result, when RT is administered for adenocarcinoma, we usually give concurrent cisplatin-based chemotherapy.

One of the main arguments against a primary surgical approach in this setting is the high potential for multimodality therapy, given that the majority of women will have high-risk or intermediate-risk disease for which postoperative chemoradiotherapy is recommended.

Surgical staging is the most accurate method of determining lymph node involvement, which is one of the most important prognostic factors. In addition, there is a potential therapeutic survival benefit of resecting lymph nodes, particularly bulky nodes, prior to chemoradiotherapy, but this has not been proven.</p><p>For both cervical SCC and adenocarcinoma, some clinicians use the results of radiographic staging studies to select women for a therapeutic lymphadenectomy. Preirradiation staging lymphadenectomy (which can be accomplished laparoscopically or robotically) may be offered to medically fit patients if they have evidence of bulky nodes on computed tomography (CT) scan or if a pretreatment fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG)-positron emission tomography (PET) or <span class=\"nowrap\">PET/CT</span> shows FDG uptake in the region of the infrarenal paraaortic or pelvic lymph nodes. If both are negative, routine staging lymphadenectomy is not performed.

The use of neoadjuvant chemotherapy may be beneficial in selected women.
