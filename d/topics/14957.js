During steady-state hematopoiesis, approximately 10<sup>8</sup> to 10<sup>9</sup> of these cells are produced per hour in the bone marrow to maintain their circulating numbers within fairly narrow limits. Production can be rapidly increased in the setting of infection or inflammation. The terms leukocytes and granulocytes are often used interchangeably, although they are somewhat different. The term leukocyte comprises granulocytes, monocytes, and lymphocytes, while the term granulocyte includes polymorphonuclear neutrophils (PMNs), eosinophils, and basophils.</p><p>Myelopoiesis begins with the differentiation of a small pool of multipotent hematopoietic stem cells into the most primitive myeloid progenitors. These progenitors develop into recognizable myeloid precursors, which subsequently follow a specific differentiation program that culminates in the emergence of mature neutrophils, eosinophils, basophils, and monocytes (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F52024\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef52024 \">figure 1</a>). This process is most likely driven by expression of successive combinations of transcription factors that in turn dictate the expression of adhesion and hematopoietic growth factor receptors (HGFRs):</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Adhesion receptors play an important role in the localization and release of maturing cells from specific niches in the bone marrow.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Hematopoietic growth factors (HGFs), such as stem cell factor (SCF, also called Steel factor or c-kit ligand), interleukin (IL)-3, granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF), and granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) are important for the amplification of progenitor cells, and bind to their target cells through specific receptors.</p><p/><p>G-CSF is essential for the amplification and terminal differentiation of neutrophil progenitors and precursors, while macrophage colony-stimulating factor (M-CSF, CSF1) and IL-5 are lineage specific factors for the monocyte and eosinophil lineages, respectively.</p><p>This topic will review the elements that underlie granulopoiesis and monopoiesis. A general discussion of hematopoiesis and hematopoietic stem cell function is presented separately.

Analogous assays were then developed for the human system [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/regulation-of-myelopoiesis/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. These studies demonstrated that individual cells derived from mouse spleen or bone marrow could give rise to colonies of up to several thousand differentiated granulocytes <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> macrophages in a soft agar medium. A period of seven to eight days was required for full maturation of these colonies in the mouse compared with 12 to 14 days in humans.</p><p>Appropriate studies were performed to demonstrate the single cell origin of the colonies. These studies also demonstrated that a single progenitor cell, which was termed the colony-forming unit in culture, or CFU-C, was capable of differentiation into both granulocytes and macrophages, thus the designation CFU-GM. Unit gravity sedimentation and other separation methods have been used to demonstrate that CFU-GM represent a cell population distinguishable from the multipotent stem cell [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/regulation-of-myelopoiesis/abstract/4,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,5</a>]. A more restricted myeloid stem cell is referred to as CFU-GEMM because it is the precursor to lineage-specific stem cells for granulocytes, erythrocytes, monocytes, and megakaryocytes (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F52024\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef52024 \">figure 1</a>)&nbsp;[<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/regulation-of-myelopoiesis/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].</p><p>Human granulocyte erythroid monocyte macrophage progenitors (CFU-GEMM) can be identified by markers for CD34 and HLA-DR. Some human myeloid progenitor cells express an additional marker for CD64, the Fc-gamma receptor 1, which identifies a specific progenitor cell dedicated to granulocyte and monocyte development (CFU-GM). Micromanipulation of single progenitor cells or two cells separated after the first cell division show multiple combinations of mature myeloid cells can be derived from these progenitors, supporting a stochastic mechanism for the restriction of differentiation potential [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/regulation-of-myelopoiesis/abstract/7,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,8</a>]. The major growth factors required for maturing CFU-GEMM into CFU-GM are stem cell factor (SCF), interleukin (IL)-3, IL-6 (induced by IL-3), flt3 ligand, and granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F52024\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef52024 \">figure 1</a>). GM-CSF receptor expression begins in immature precursor cells and is progressively increased during differentiation into mature granulocytes and macrophages [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/regulation-of-myelopoiesis/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].</p><p>Long-term liquid bone marrow cultures have been particularly helpful in defining humoral and cell-cell interactions that induce myeloid differentiation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/regulation-of-myelopoiesis/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. CFU-GM give rise to the more mature granulocyte and macrophage colony-forming units, CFU-G and CFU-M, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/regulation-of-myelopoiesis/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>]. In addition, CFU-GM can be distinguished from the eosinophil and basophil progenitors, CFU-Eo and CFU-Baso, each arising independently from the common myeloid progenitor cell (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F52024\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef52024 \">figure 1</a>). It is now accepted that CFU-GM, under the influence of SF, IL-3, GM-CSF, G-CSF, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> M-CSF ultimately gives rise to mature phagocytes, the granulocytes and monocytes.</p><p>Although a clonogenic assay of granulocyte progenitors was developed almost a decade before the erythroid clonogenic assay, the various factors responsible for granulocyte and monocyte-macrophage development remain incompletely understood.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Neutrophil production and maturation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A model that describes the production and kinetics of human neutrophils suggests that it is highly compartmentalized. The bone marrow contains the most neutrophils (approximately 2.3 x 10<sup>9</sup> cells per kg of body weight) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/regulation-of-myelopoiesis/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. In contrast, the peripheral blood pool of neutrophils contains approximately 0.7 x 10<sup>9</sup> cells per kg. The relatively tiny peripheral blood pool is divided into two components in equilibrium: the circulating granulocyte pool and the marginating granulocyte pool. These pools provide entrance into the tissues (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F78149\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef78149 \">figure 2</a>).</p><p>The level of circulating cells is buffered by an immense marrow reserve of identifiable precursors. These granulocyte precursors in the bone marrow are also compartmentalized into &quot;mitotic&quot; and &quot;storage&quot; compartments. The mitotic cells are actively dividing (myeloblasts, promyelocytes, and myelocytes); while the storage cells are in a <span class=\"nowrap\">maturing/differentiating,</span> postmitotic state (metamyelocytes, band, and mature neutrophilic forms) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F75855\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef75855 \">figure 3</a>). The transit times within each compartment are relatively long, so that a huge reserve remains available.</p><p>Stages of neutrophil development are characterized by relatively distinct morphological features that are visible in Wright-Giemsa-stained bone marrow aspirates or biopsies viewed by light microscopy. Eosinophils and basophils undergo a similar differentiation program and are first distinguishable at the myelocyte stage when their specific granules are synthesized.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Myeloblast</strong> &ndash; Myeloblasts are the earliest myeloid precursors recognizable by light microscopy (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F74014\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef74014 \">picture 1</a>). Their size is 15 to 20 microns; their nuclei are large and round with finely granular chromatin and nucleoli; cytoplasm is scant; and cytoplasmic granules are usually absent. &#160;</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Promyelocyte</strong> &ndash; Promyelocytes are larger than myeloblasts (&gt;20 microns) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F73480\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef73480 \">picture 2</a>). Their cardinal feature is the presence of many violet-stained (azurophilic; primary) granules with a coarse pattern, often obscuring other structures. The granules are homogenous, dense, and round to ovoid in shape, with a diameter of approximately 0.8 microns. They contain a variety of bactericidal cationic proteins, proteolytic enzymes, and myeloperoxidase [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/regulation-of-myelopoiesis/abstract/12-14\" class=\"abstract_t\">12-14</a>]. Other cellular features (nuclei, nuclear chromatin, nucleoli) are similar to myeloblasts.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Myelocyte</strong> &ndash; Myelocytes are the last precursor capable of undergoing cell division (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F54089\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef54089 \">picture 3</a>). They undergo three divisions that result in progressively smaller cells with secondary (specific) granules in addition to the primary granules present at the promyelocyte stage. The specific granules are approximately 0.5 microns in diameter, less dense and more numerous than primary granules, and difficult to see by light microscopy. They contain adhesive proteins such as lactoferrin, integrins, binding protein for cobalamin, and other distinguishing markers as outlined in the table (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F57400\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef57400 \">table 1</a>). Their nuclei become progressively smaller and more irregularly shaped with each division; nuclear chromatin becomes more coarse and clumped, and nucleoli are sparse to absent. The nuclear to cytoplasmic ratio is reduced.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Metamyelocyte</strong> &ndash; Metamyelocytes are post-mitotic cells that are slightly smaller than myelocytes and have indented nuclei (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F59197\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef59197 \">picture 4</a>). Their cytoplasm is uniformly pink with finely dispersed granules, similar to that of bands and mature PMNs. Nuclear chromatin is coarse, clumped, and peripherally condensed; nucleoli are absent. Polyribosomes and endoplasmic reticulum (required for protein synthesis and maturation) are also absent.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Band</strong> &ndash; Bands (also called stabs; juvenile forms) are smaller cells with elongated, horseshoe-shaped nuclei (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F82140\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef82140 \">picture 5</a>). Their nuclear chromatin is aggregated into evenly arranged clumps. Their cytoplasm is like that of mature PMNs, with pink staining and fine <span class=\"nowrap\">azure/bluish</span> granules. Based on cytochemistry, the ratio of azurophilic primary granules to specific secondary granules is approximately 1:2 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/regulation-of-myelopoiesis/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. Tertiary (gelatinase) granules are also present. Bands are fully functional phagocytes and may account for 3 to 5 percent of the differential count. They are included in the absolute neutrophil count (ANC) (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=calculator-absolute-neutrophil-count\" class=\"calc calc_professional\">calculator 1</a>).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Polymorphonuclear cell (PMN)</strong> &ndash; PMNs (also called segmented neutrophils) are the fully mature stage of neutrophil development (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F60666\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef60666 \">picture 6</a>). These cells are of uniform size (13 microns in diameter). Nuclei are segmented into two to five lobes (average, three) connected by thin chromatin strands. Nuclear chromatin is coarse and clumped, and stains deep purple. Approximately 3 percent of PMNs from females have a visible Barr body (inactivated X chromosome, visible as a drumstick-shaped mass of dense chromatin 1.5 microns in size, attached to one nuclear lobe by a slender filament) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/regulation-of-myelopoiesis/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. The cytoplasm contains fine <span class=\"nowrap\">azure/bluish</span> granules and prominent secondary granules, which are finely dispersed and stain the cytoplasm faintly pink. Peroxidase staining reveals peroxidase-positive primary granules and peroxidase-negative secondary granules. Granule heterogeneity is obvious by electron microscopy (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F74658\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef74658 \">picture 7</a>). Mitochondria are scant, and abundant glycogen is present, as the cell depends on anaerobic glycolysis for generating ATP.</p><p/><p>Distinction among these stages is often helpful in evaluating and characterizing myeloid malignancies. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-of-bone-marrow-aspirate-smears#H9\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation of bone marrow aspirate smears&quot;, section on 'High power examination of the marrow'</a>.)</p><p>The kinetics of proliferation of recognizable cell precursors have been evaluated using labeled precursors of DNA. These studies indicate that the maturation time for neutrophils from the myeloblast stage is about eight days (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F75855\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef75855 \">figure 3</a>). The so-called labeling indices from which measurements of cell cycle times can be made have served as important approaches to the study of the pharmacology and toxicity of chemotherapy.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Release of neutrophils into the blood compartment</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The final stage of granulocyte production, their release from the marrow, is also multifaceted [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/regulation-of-myelopoiesis/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. At least four factors may influence granulocyte egress:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The organization and localization of the cells in relation to vascular channels</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The development of nuclear and cytoplasmic changes that increase cell deformability</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Factors such as chemokines, cytokines, microbial products, and other inflammatory mediators [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/regulation-of-myelopoiesis/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=approach-to-the-patient-with-neutrophilia#H2307589968\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Approach to the patient with neutrophilia&quot;, section on 'Inflammation'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=approach-to-the-patient-with-neutrophilia#H3147379931\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Approach to the patient with neutrophilia&quot;, section on 'Mechanisms'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The regulation of blood flow through vascular channels in the marrow</p><p/><p>Neutrophils appear to reside in the blood for a mean time of about 13 to 19 hours [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/regulation-of-myelopoiesis/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. They then leave the bloodstream and enter the tissues (eg, localize to sites of inflammation). They interact with the endothelial cells that line blood vessels through a family of integrin receptors that include LFA-1 (CD11a), Mo-1 or Mac-1 (CD11b), and <span class=\"nowrap\">gp150/95</span> (CD11c). All three receptors share a common beta subunit, CD18 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/regulation-of-myelopoiesis/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>], which is mutated in the autosomal recessive disease leukocyte adhesion deficiency (LAD). These patients have a total or partial absence of the dimeric complexes from the surface of neutrophils. As a result neutrophils cannot leave the circulation, and patients suffer from pyogenic infection but have a neutrophil and monocyte leukocytosis. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=primary-disorders-of-phagocytic-function-an-overview#H5\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Primary disorders of phagocytic function: An overview&quot;, section on 'Leukocyte adhesion deficiencies'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h3\">Regulation of neutrophil release</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The mechanisms controlling the release of PMNs from the bone marrow are only partially understood. A variety of compounds induce PMN movement into the circulation including endotoxin, glucocorticoids, a leukocyte-mobilizing factor derived from the third component of complement (C3e), chemoattractants such as C5a, cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha, and certain androgens [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/regulation-of-myelopoiesis/abstract/21-25\" class=\"abstract_t\">21-25</a>]. To successfully emerge into the circulation, PMNs must deform and migrate to the luminal side of the endothelial sinusoidal surface. Endotoxin affects the relationship between marrow sinus endothelial cells and the stromal macrophages covering nonluminal sinusoidal surfaces; it induces retraction of macrophages away from the endothelium which facilitates contact between PMNs and endothelial cells and allows PMN egress from the bone marrow [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/regulation-of-myelopoiesis/abstract/26,27\" class=\"abstract_t\">26,27</a>].</p><p>In vitro, PMNs and bands readily pass through millipore filters with pore sizes of 1 micron in response to chemoattractants. Metamyelocytes and late myelocytes are impaired in these responses, whereas early myelocytes, promyelocytes, and myeloblasts cannot move or deform [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/regulation-of-myelopoiesis/abstract/26,28\" class=\"abstract_t\">26,28</a>]. Blood viscosity at high flow rates is a function of cell deformability and volume. As a result, viscosity increases dramatically in patients with acute leukemia and markedly increased numbers of circulating blast forms, with leukocrits above 20 percent or total white cell counts above <span class=\"nowrap\">400,000/microL</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/regulation-of-myelopoiesis/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. This problem does not occur when similar total white cell counts are due to the presence of neutrophils rather than blasts.</p><p>In rabbits, infusion of C5a or TNF-alpha induces leukocytosis, which is not prevented when the principal adhesion proteins of PMNs, beta-2 integrin and L-selectin are blocked by specific antibodies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/regulation-of-myelopoiesis/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. This observation suggests that PMN egress from the bone marrow is mediated by interactions different from those governing chemotaxis and diapedesis as described below (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RHEUM%2F60528\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef60528 \">figure 4</a>).</p><p>G-CSF is the principal cytokine that stimulates not only the production of neutrophils but also their release from the bone marrow. While the mechanism of G-CSF-mediated release is not completely understood, SDF-1, a stromal cell derived factor, and its ligand CXCR4, expressed on many hematopoietic cells including neutrophils, may play a key role. The <span class=\"nowrap\">SDF-1/CXCR4</span> interaction appears to retain neutrophils within the bone marrow. G-CSF administration leads to a reduction in SDF-1 expression as well as CXCR4 cleavage [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/regulation-of-myelopoiesis/abstract/30,31\" class=\"abstract_t\">30,31</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H100891\"><span class=\"h2\">Neutrophil fate</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The turnover rate for PMNs is estimated at 0.3 to 1.3 x 10<sup>9</sup> cells per kg per day [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/regulation-of-myelopoiesis/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>]. Studies in healthy volunteers suggest a mean lifespan of approximately five to eight days [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/regulation-of-myelopoiesis/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>]. The disappearance of labeled PMNs follows a single exponential curve, implying that PMNs are destroyed or leave the blood randomly rather than according to their age (senescence), as is true for erythrocytes and platelets. </p><p>The fate of neutrophils includes apoptosis and macrophage engulfment. One candidate for a molecular trigger of apoptosis in PMNs is the product of the FAS (CD95) gene. Fas protein is expressed on the PMN surface, and PMNs constitutively release Fas ligand [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/regulation-of-myelopoiesis/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>]. Since Fas ligand induces apoptosis in PMNs, its release may provide a paracrine pathway that mediates PMN death [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/regulation-of-myelopoiesis/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>].</p><p>Fas-mediated PMN apoptosis is suppressed in vitro by biologic molecules and drugs (eg, G-CSF, GM-CSF, IL-3, IL-6, IL-15, glucocorticoids) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/regulation-of-myelopoiesis/abstract/35-37\" class=\"abstract_t\">35-37</a>]. Mediators of inflammation, such as endotoxin, human recombinant C5a, TNF-alpha, and interferon gamma, also inhibit PMN apoptosis in a concentration dependent fashion in vitro [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/regulation-of-myelopoiesis/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>]. </p><p>When PMNs become apoptotic in the circulation, CXCR4 is again expressed on their surface and they return to the bone marrow where they are phagocytosed by stromal macrophages. This in turn stimulates G-CSF production, increasing production of PMNs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/regulation-of-myelopoiesis/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>].</p><p>Under normal conditions, PMNs exit the circulation randomly, followed by their death at inflammatory sites over the following two to three days. Cell death is by a combination of apoptosis and macrophage engulfment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/regulation-of-myelopoiesis/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>].

Many of the factors that allow release of granulocytes from storage pools are distinct from CSFs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/regulation-of-myelopoiesis/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. In addition, GM-CSF can inhibit granulocyte motility [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/regulation-of-myelopoiesis/abstract/47\" class=\"abstract_t\">47</a>] and can activate granulocytes to increase superoxide anion generation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/regulation-of-myelopoiesis/abstract/48\" class=\"abstract_t\">48</a>].</p><p>This complexity in vivo has not permitted studies analogous to those in which erythropoiesis is influenced by hypertransfusion or hemorrhage and megakaryocytopoiesis is stimulated by induced thrombocytopenia; however, in vivo studies using antibodies to neutrophils, germ-free animals, and tissue specific knockouts of regulatory components have begun to provide novel insights into the process by which both emergency and steady-state myelopoiesis are regulated. (See <a href=\"#H411989\" class=\"local\">'Myelopoietic feedback loops'</a> below.)</p><p>In early work, investigators relied heavily upon in vitro progenitor assays to study the regulation of myelopoiesis. Both transcription factors and growth factors play an important role in this process and their individual effects have been determined in part by the generation of mice lacking genes for specific proteins (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F67668\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef67668 \">table 2</a>).

Whether the transcription factors themselves are regulated by environmental or intrinsic signals is still a major unanswered question. It appears that, once induced, their transcription can often be amplified by autoregulatory loops, and that the factors frequently act in subtle combinatorial mechanisms to induce different myeloid genes (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F71394\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef71394 \">figure 5</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/regulation-of-myelopoiesis/abstract/49\" class=\"abstract_t\">49</a>].</p><p>The occupancy of regulatory regions of lineage-specific genes also depends on chromatin configuration and methylation status.

Activated T cells also produce GM-CSF [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/regulation-of-myelopoiesis/abstract/137\" class=\"abstract_t\">137</a>], M-CSF [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/regulation-of-myelopoiesis/abstract/138\" class=\"abstract_t\">138</a>], and IL-6 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/regulation-of-myelopoiesis/abstract/139\" class=\"abstract_t\">139</a>], but these HGFs are produced by many other cells as well, including monocytes, macrophages, and the various mesodermally derived cells.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>G-CSF is expressed by <span class=\"nowrap\">monocytes/macrophages</span> and the various mesodermally derived cells [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/regulation-of-myelopoiesis/abstract/128\" class=\"abstract_t\">128</a>], while the expression of IL-11 is even further restricted, as it does not appear to be made by T cells nor by <span class=\"nowrap\">monocyte/macrophages</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/regulation-of-myelopoiesis/abstract/140-142\" class=\"abstract_t\">140-142</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>SF and flt3 ligand are broadly expressed in many mesodermal cell types [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/regulation-of-myelopoiesis/abstract/110,113,122\" class=\"abstract_t\">110,113,122</a>] but thus far, little is known about the regulation of their expression.</p><p/><p>The expression of the HGFs and other cytokines is often triggered in cells by exposure to other cytokines or growth factors, leading to the concept that there are complicated interacting networks of cytokines that serve to control and coordinate many physiologic responses [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/regulation-of-myelopoiesis/abstract/143,144\" class=\"abstract_t\">143,144</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H411989\"><span class=\"h1\">MYELOPOIETIC FEEDBACK LOOPS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Mouse models have demonstrated a G-CSF-dependent feedback loop that ensures neutrophil production, both in the emergency response to infection and in the steady state (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F97523\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef97523 \">figure 6</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/regulation-of-myelopoiesis/abstract/145\" class=\"abstract_t\">145</a>]. These responses involve G-CSF signals that increase stem and myeloid progenitor proliferation and lead to egress of mature neutrophils from the marrow, the latter achieved by disruption of ligand-receptor interactions through reductions in CXCR4 on the neutrophil surface and <span class=\"nowrap\">CXCL12/SDF-1</span> in the bone marrow stroma. However, the observations that combined G-CSF and GM-CSF null mice produce neutrophils in the steady state at 20 to 30 percent of normal levels and can increase production in emergencies, such as <em>Candida albicans</em> infection, indicate that non-G-CSF mechanisms are important for both responses [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/regulation-of-myelopoiesis/abstract/146\" class=\"abstract_t\">146</a>].</p><p>Studies from mouse models have provided new insights into the importance of the G-CSF response in both emergency and steady-state granulopoiesis. Infectious agents are presented to the immune and hematopoietic systems as pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) that are recognized by pathogen-recognition receptors, in particular the Toll-like receptors (TLRs). TLRs are expressed by cells of the innate immune system (NK-T cells, gamma-delta T cells, and Th17 T cells) and also by hematopoietic stem and myeloid progenitor cells [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/regulation-of-myelopoiesis/abstract/147-151\" class=\"abstract_t\">147-151</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=toll-like-receptors-roles-in-disease-and-therapy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Toll-like receptors: Roles in disease and therapy&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H412375\"><span class=\"h2\">Emergency myelopoiesis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The bacterial cell wall component lipopolysaccharide (LPS) is abundant during systemic infection. LPS binds to TLR4, which through a myeloid differentiation adaptor protein Myd88 causes responsive cells to produce G-CSF. Data from Myd88 conditional knockout mice crossed with a variety of tissue-specific Cre animals showed that endothelial cells, but not hematopoietic cells, hepatocytes, bone marrow stromal cells, or pericytes, are essential for the G-CSF response to LPS [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/regulation-of-myelopoiesis/abstract/152\" class=\"abstract_t\">152</a>]. Interestingly, the TLRs expressed on hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells, and TLR ligands such as bacterial LPS, can induce self-renewal in HSCs and bias commitment toward myeloid but not erythroid or megakaryocyte lineages [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/regulation-of-myelopoiesis/abstract/150\" class=\"abstract_t\">150</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H412381\"><span class=\"h2\">Basal myelopoiesis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Although the control of steady-state myelopoiesis is complex and still incompletely understood, evidence is emerging for several positive and negative regulatory loops [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/regulation-of-myelopoiesis/abstract/153\" class=\"abstract_t\">153</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Germ-free (GF) mice have neutrophil counts even lower than G-CSF receptor-null animals, and thus LPS or other stimulatory compounds may be supplied by intestinal commensal bacteria (the microbiome) in the steady state to stimulate granulopoiesis through a positive TLR4 mediated G-CSF production pathway [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/regulation-of-myelopoiesis/abstract/145\" class=\"abstract_t\">145</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Further reduction of neutrophils in GF mice by neutrophil antibody treatment leads to another positive feedback process involving TLR4 and an adaptor protein, TRIF, which results in increased G-CSF production [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/regulation-of-myelopoiesis/abstract/145\" class=\"abstract_t\">145</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a negative feedback loop, tissue macrophages and dendritic cells normally engulf apoptotic neutrophils, which inhibits their secretion of IL-23; this cytokine stimulates innate lymphoid cells to produce IL-17, a cytokine that can stimulate G-CSF expression. Adhesion molecule deficient mice, whose neutrophils cannot transmigrate, show a marked neutrophil leukocytosis and increased levels of G-CSF. The underlying mechanism was shown to involve dis-inhibition of tissue macrophage IL-23 production consequent to decreased neutrophil apoptosis, which thus increases Th17 T cell production of IL-17, leading to G-CSF induction. This led to the hypothesis of a neutrophil &quot;turnstile&quot; mediated by monocyte phagocytosis of transmigrating neutrophils; macrophages thus engaged in apoptosis are postulated to receive anti-inflammatory signals that decrease IL-23 secretion via the nuclear receptors peroxisome proliferator-activator gamma and liver X receptor [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/regulation-of-myelopoiesis/abstract/154,155\" class=\"abstract_t\">154,155</a>].</p><p/><p>These mechanisms are probably the tip of an iceberg that will likely involve numerous pathways in the neutrophil response, not only to different bacterial and fungal PAMPs, but also to exposure in different tissues such as the skin, lung, or gastrointestinal tract, and to other non-infectious signals such as inflammation that can result in altered myelopoiesis.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1305306\"><span class=\"h1\">SUMMARY</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Myelopoiesis begins with the differentiation of multipotent stem cells into the most primitive myeloid progenitors.
