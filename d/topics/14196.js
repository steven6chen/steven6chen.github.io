Doctors and midwives call premature rupture of membranes &quot;PROM&quot; for short. &quot;Preterm&quot; PROM is when this happens when a pregnancy is less than 37 weeks.</p><p>Preterm PROM is a problem because labor often begins soon after it happens. Babies who are born before 37 weeks of pregnancy can have serious health problems.</p><p>PROM can also lead to problems in the mother. For example, it can lead to an infection in the uterus.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2362934\"><span class=\"h1\">What causes preterm PROM?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Doctors aren't sure why preterm PROM happens in some women and not others. But preterm PROM is more likely to happen in women who:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Had preterm PROM before</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Had preterm labor and delivery before</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Have an infection in the vagina or uterus</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Have bleeding from the vagina</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Smoke</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2362949\"><span class=\"h1\">What are the symptoms of preterm PROM?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>When a woman's water breaks, it can feel like a sudden gush or a slow trickle of fluid from the vagina. The fluid is clear or pale yellow and sometimes looks like urine.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2362964\"><span class=\"h1\">Is there a test for preterm PROM?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Yes. Your doctor, nurse, or midwife will use a speculum to examine your cervix. He or she will look to see if amniotic fluid is leaking from your cervix. He or she will also take a sample of the fluid in your vagina, look at it under a microscope, and test it with special paper. This is to make sure the fluid is amniotic fluid.</p><p>Your doctor or midwife might also do an ultrasound exam to check the amount of amniotic fluid around your baby. An ultrasound is an imaging test that uses sound waves to create pictures of your baby in your uterus.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2362979\"><span class=\"h1\">How is preterm PROM treated?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Almost all women with preterm PROM need to stay in the hospital until their baby is born. That's so their doctor or midwife can follow their pregnancy closely.</p><p>In many cases, labor starts within 1 week of preterm PROM.</p><p>If your labor doesn't start on its own, your doctor or midwife might give you medicine to help start it. This is called inducing labor. Your doctor or midwife is more likely to induce labor if:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>You are 34 or more weeks pregnant.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>You are less than 34 weeks pregnant, but there is a problem with your pregnancy or your baby's health. The most common problem that might happen is an infection in the uterus.</p><p/><p>If your doctor or midwife doesn't deliver your baby right away, he or she might treat you with medicines, including:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Medicines called &quot;steroids&quot; to help your baby breathe better when he or she is born. (These are <strong>not</strong> the same as the steroids some athletes take illegally.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Antibiotics to prevent an infection</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2362994\"><span class=\"h1\">Will my baby be OK?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>That depends on many factors, such as how early your baby is born, how developed his or her lungs are, and whether he or she has an infection. Babies who are born very early are more likely to have health problems.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2363009\"><span class=\"h1\">More on this topic</span></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=preterm-labor-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Preterm labor (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=labor-and-delivery-childbirth-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Labor and delivery (childbirth) (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=how-to-tell-when-labor-starts-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: How to tell when labor starts (The Basics)</a></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=preterm-labor-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Preterm labor (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=when-a-baby-is-born-premature-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: When a baby is born premature (The Basics)</a></p></div><div id=\"reviewProcess\"><span>All topics are updated as new evidence becomes available and our <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/home/editorial-policy\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"policy policy_editorialpolicy\">peer review process</a> is complete.</span></div><div id=\"topicRetrievedDate\"><span class=\"emphasis\">This topic retrieved from UpToDate on: </span>Apr 02, 2018.</div><div id=\"disclaimer\">The content on the UpToDate website is not intended nor recommended as a substitute for medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.
