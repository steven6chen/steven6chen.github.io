In addition, pulmonary resection can be used as a means to diagnose pulmonary disease. </p><p>An overview of lung resection, including the types of resection, a comparison of open and minimally invasive techniques, and complications, is reviewed here. Specific management of pathologies that indicate a need for lung resection and disease-specific outcomes related to lung resection are discussed in links provided below. Additional detail regarding minimally invasive thoracoscopic surgery is provided separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-minimally-invasive-thoracic-surgery\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of minimally invasive thoracic surgery&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1038087089\"><span class=\"h1\">LUNG ANATOMY AND TYPES OF LUNG RESECTION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Below is a summary of the modes of lung resection. The various lung resections are broadly regarded as anatomic or non-anatomic resections. The extent of resection is based upon the size, location, and type of lesion found within the lung. In addition, the ability to obtain a negative margin is an important consideration in determining the choice of resection, which varies based on pulmonary pathology requiring resection. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1694262613\"><span class=\"h2\">Anatomy and bronchopulmonary segments</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The right and left lungs are contained<strong> </strong>within the thorax and separated by the mediastinum (containing the heart). Each lung is divided into lobes, each having its own bronchial, arterial, and venous supply. Lobes are further divided into bronchopulmonary segments (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F110287\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef110287 \">figure 1</a>), which also have their own segmental bronchial and vascular supply. The lobar and segmental anatomy are the basis for surgical resection of the lung. </p><p>The right lung has three lobes (upper, middle, and lower) and 10 segments. The left lung is slightly smaller than the right as it must accommodate the heart. The left lung has two lobes (upper and lower) and eight segments. The left upper lobe can be further divided into named divisions, each with its own vascular and bronchial supply, the superior division and the lingular division. The superior division is anatomically similar to the right-sided upper lobe while the lingular division is comparable to the right middle lobe. The oblique fissure on each side divides lower lobes from the remainder of the lung, namely the upper lobe on the left and both the upper and middle lobes on the right. The horizontal fissure is located in the right lung only and divides the upper and middle lobes. </p><p>The lung requires adequate ventilation and perfusion for gas exchange. Ventilation refers to the movement of air into and out of the lungs, and perfusion is the amount of pulmonary blood flow through the lung. The amount of ventilation and perfusion varies between the different lobes of the lung due to gravity and pressure variances between the alveolar, arterial, and venous systems. The right lung typically provides about 55 percent of total ventilation and perfusion, with the right upper lobe providing approximately 20 percent, right middle lobe approximately 10 percent, and right lower lobe approximately 25 percent. The left lung provides about 45 percent of total ventilation and perfusion, with the left upper and lower each providing 22.5 percent.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H953600675\"><span class=\"h2\">Anatomic resection</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>An anatomic resection requires ligation and division of the feeding vessels and airways to a segment or lobe of the lung (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F110287\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef110287 \">figure 1</a>). (See <a href=\"#H1694262613\" class=\"local\">'Anatomy and bronchopulmonary segments'</a> above.)</p><p>The pulmonary artery is a fragile vessel and thus requires careful dissection and handling. Undue tension or grasping of the artery may lead to intimal disruption or tearing of the vessel leading to significant hemorrhage. The pulmonary vein, although more robust, also requires delicate handling. </p><p>Ligation and division of the pulmonary vessels is achieved in a variety of ways, including triple ligation with silk ties, triple ligation with silk ties and clips, ties and suture ligature, or mechanical stapling. Ultrasonic energy devices have been shown to be effective for the ligation and division of vessels up to 6 mm [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-pulmonary-resection/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>]. The bronchus is most commonly ligated with a stapler; a linear cutting stapler allows for both ligation and division of the bronchus with a single firing of the device. Alternatively, the bronchus may be sharply divided and closed with suture. </p><p>Surgical linear cutting staplers are used to divide the lung parenchyma, providing fast and reliable hemostasis of the cut edge of remaining lung, thus minimizing air leak. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H623974743\"><span class=\"h3\">Pneumonectomy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Right pneumonectomy removes the entirety of the right lung (upper, middle, and lower lobes), whereas a left pneumonectomy removes the entirety of the left lung (upper and lower lobes). </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1609158966\"><span class=\"h3\">Lobectomy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Lobectomy<strong> </strong>(anatomic lobar resection)<strong> </strong>removes the individual lobe by ligating its contributing pulmonary arteries, egressing pulmonary veins and lobar bronchi. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1806044904\"><span class=\"h3\">Segmentectomy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A segmentectomy (anatomic sublobar resection) removes one or more segments by dividing their individual contributories. This procedure is often reserved for treating patients with tumors who cannot tolerate larger pulmonary resection (eg, lobectomy) due to marginal pulmonary function tests and other comorbidities, or to treat low-grade malignancies such as typical carcinoids, and metastases. Segmentectomy for primary treatment of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) has been described in patients with stage I disease. However, a landmark study in 1995 by the Lung Cancer Study Group suggested that sublobar resection was inferior to lobectomy (tumor size &lt;3 cm), reporting an increase in recurrence and trend toward decreased survival in patients undergoing sublobar resection.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H925542849\"><span class=\"h3\">Sleeve resection</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A sleeve resection is an alternative to a pneumonectomy. This procedure conserves lung tissue by removing a lobe containing a target lesion with a portion of the lobar bronchus to an uninvolved lobe. The remaining bronchus to the uninvolved lobe is anastomosed to the remaining proximal airway. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2752379802\"><span class=\"h2\">Non-anatomic wedge resection</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A wedge resection is the non-anatomic removal of portion of the lung, meaning the contributing vessels and minor airways are not individually dissected and ligated. Lung wedge resections are akin to removing a pie slice with the portion of excised lung encompassing a lesion or area of <span class=\"nowrap\">disease/abnormality</span> (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F110184\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef110184 \">figure 2</a>). Pulmonary wedge resection is often chosen for obtaining tissue for diagnostic purposes and to definitively resect peripheral lesions. </p><p>Wedge resections may be completed via open thoracotomy or minimally invasive techniques. If the lesion is small or not visible on the surface of the lung, digital palpation may be necessary to localize the lesion. Alternatively, when using minimally invasive techniques (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F110185\" class=\"graphic graphic_movie graphicRef110185 \">movie 1</a>), instruments or a finger may be inserted into the chest cavity to palpate the lung and localize the lesion. </p><p>Landmarks may also be used to estimate where the lesion is located, but some interpolation is necessary since radiologic imaging is usually performed with the lung fully inflated, while surgery is performed on the deflated lung. If it is anticipated that a nodule will be hard to find, it can be localized using a variety of methods, such as computed tomography (CT)-guided needle localization, dye marking, radionucleotide, and real-time on-table imaging [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-pulmonary-resection/abstract/3-5\" class=\"abstract_t\">3-5</a>]. </p><p>Surgical linear cutting staplers are used to divide the lung parenchyma, providing fast and reliable hemostasis of the cut edge of remaining lung, thus minimizing air leak. Alternatively, lung parenchymal tissue can be divided between parallel clamps and oversewn with a running absorbable suture; this technique, however, results in a slightly higher rate of air leak. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3482173287\"><span class=\"h1\">INDICATIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Indications for pulmonary resection include malignant and benign conditions. In addition, although pulmonary injuries can often be managed conservatively, these may also require resection for management.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1114240929\"><span class=\"h2\">Malignancy</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3607522800\"><span class=\"h3\">Primary lung disease</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Primary lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer-related death in both men and women [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-pulmonary-resection/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. Smoking remains the number one risk factor for the development of lung cancer [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-pulmonary-resection/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. Other known environmental risk factors include radon and asbestos. In addition, host factors include family history of lung malignancy and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). </p><p>Lung cancer is broadly categorized into two major groups: non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and small cell lung cancer (SCLC). This designation is determined by tumor histology, with adenocarcinoma, a type of NSCLC, being the most common [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-pulmonary-resection/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. Cancer staging is in accordance with the tumor, node, metastasis (TNM) system (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F109805\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef109805 \">table 1</a>). The lung cancer staging system is the cornerstone for the management of malignant lung disease. Resection is the primary treatment for stages I and II lung cancers in patients without contraindications to surgery. Stage III lung cancers, a heterogenous group with varying tumor size and nodal status, are more varied in their management; however, surgery may be an aspect of the treatment strategy. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-the-initial-evaluation-treatment-and-prognosis-of-lung-cancer#H4\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of the initial evaluation, treatment and prognosis of lung cancer&quot;, section on 'Treatment'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3659244097\"><span class=\"h3\">Metastatic disease</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The lung is the third most common site of extrapleural metastasis from other types of tumor, behind the lymph nodes and the liver [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-pulmonary-resection/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. The most common metastases to the lung are epithelial tumors (including colorectal, breast, urinary system), followed by sarcomas, germ cell tumors, and melanoma, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-pulmonary-resection/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. Of the epithelial tumors, colorectal cancers are the most frequent primary tumors to metastasize to the lung [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-pulmonary-resection/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>].

A longer disease-free interval, smaller number of metastatic nodules, and ability to achieve a complete resection portend a favorable outcome.

Large bullae can occupy up to one-half of the volume of the pleural cavity, leading to contralateral lung compression (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F110189\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef110189 \">picture 2</a>). A bleb is smaller than 1 cm in diameter and typically subpleural and located more cephalad. Blebs may occur from alveolar disruption in patients with otherwise relatively normal parenchyma. </p><p>When intervention is indicated, the margins of resection should be performed in the more normal (less emphysematous) lung parenchyma. Prolonged air leak can occur due to poor sealing of thin lung parenchyma at the staple line margin or from lung lacerations that may occur from taking down adhesions. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=bullectomy-for-giant-bullae\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Bullectomy for giant bullae&quot;</a>.) </p><p>To prevent prolonged air leaks from stapled margin lines, bovine pericardial and bovine collagen buttresses have been used [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-pulmonary-resection/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. In one randomized trial that included 80 participants, there was no significant difference in hospital stay or time to chest tube removal for patients randomly assigned to the buttress or standard stapled division; however, there was a trend toward shortened air leak time and chest tube duration [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-pulmonary-resection/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H40716452\"><span class=\"h3\">Benign masses and nodules</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Benign lung lesions are often diagnosed during the workup of an incidentally identified solitary pulmonary nodule or evaluation of concerning symptoms (eg, chronic cough, hemoptysis). Overall, the need to resect a benign lesion is rare. Most benign lesions such as pulmonary hamartoma, mucous gland adenoma, histiocytoma, and pulmonary lipoma do not require resection unless symptomatic. Others, such as mucinous cystadenoma and intrapulmonary fibrous tumors, require resection due to malignant potential or increased likelihood of becoming symptomatic in the future. Often these indeterminate lesions are identified following diagnostic resection.

Viral and bacterial infections are often the inciting event leading to initial airway damage, while fungal infections have also been responsible. Destruction of the bronchial wall leads to its collapse, and impaired sputum clearance leads to repeated respiratory infection or chronic sputum production. The sputum can be blood tinged, or the patient may present with hemoptysis. Surgical treatment may be indicated if medical therapies fail. The ideal candidate for surgical therapy has localized disease that is amenable to anatomic lung resection such as segmentectomy or lobectomy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-pulmonary-resection/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>].

Most infectious diseases of the lung are treated medically, which is successful in nearly 90 percent of patients. Indications for surgery include persistence of disease in spite of optimal medical therapy, empyema, hemoptysis, and development of bronchopleural fistula [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-pulmonary-resection/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>].

Resection is typically reserved for patients with severe and heterogeneous emphysema. The results of the National Emphysema Treatment Trial (NETT) identified a select group of patients who were the best candidates for lung volume reduction surgery (LVRS) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-pulmonary-resection/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. Patients typically have upper lobe emphysema and low exercise capacity. These patients were more likely to live longer and function better after LVRS than after medical treatment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-pulmonary-resection/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>].

Injury can occur to the airway, pulmonary parenchyma, or pulmonary vasculature, or a combination of injuries can occur. Minor injuries can often be managed conservatively, but for more severe injuries, pulmonary resection may become necessary. Pulmonary parenchymal lacerations can often be treated with tube thoracostomy alone. If extensive tissue loss is present, a nonanatomic (wedge) resection or lobectomy may be required. In the acute setting, a thoracotomy is often necessary to provide adequate exposure for expedient repair. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=initial-evaluation-and-management-of-blunt-thoracic-trauma-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Initial evaluation and management of blunt thoracic trauma in adults&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=initial-evaluation-and-management-of-penetrating-thoracic-trauma-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Initial evaluation and management of penetrating thoracic trauma in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Tracheobronchial injuries are rare and are usually the result of high-energy blunt impact. These injuries often occur in the presence of multiple trauma presenting with respiratory distress and persistent air leak. Flexible bronchoscopy is diagnostic, and primary surgical repair is often required. When the injury to the bronchial tree is severe, lobectomy or pneumonectomy may be required [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-pulmonary-resection/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>].</p><p>Pulmonary vascular injuries are typically due to penetrating trauma or from deceleration injury. The pulmonary vascular system is low pressure, such that with lung expansion, compression of smaller vessels will often stop the bleeding. If the bronchial arterial supply remains intact, lobar and segmental pulmonary arteries may be ligated. However, pulmonary venous injury that requires ligation will also require resection of the corresponding pulmonary parenchyma since pulmonary vein obstruction will result in pulmonary infarction.</p><p>Pulmonary contusion, which is the most common pulmonary injury and can occur with either blunt or penetrating trauma, rarely requires surgical intervention [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-pulmonary-resection/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3601660661\"><span class=\"h1\">PREOPERATIVE EVALUATION AND PREPARATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The operating surgeon should evaluate the patient anatomically and medically to assess the risks of morbidity and mortality following pulmonary resection.

A comparison is provided in the table (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F110165\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef110165 \">table 2</a>). (See <a href=\"#H3109838415\" class=\"local\">'Thoracotomy exposures and techniques'</a> below.)</p><p>Minimally invasive thoracic surgery (MITS) is increasingly being used to diagnose or treat conditions of the chest that were historically performed as an open thoracotomy. VATS quickly gained popularity after its introduction in the 1990s as thoracoscopic techniques and improved instrumentation for dissection, ligation, and division of major structures were developed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-pulmonary-resection/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. Contrary to VATS, the acceptance of RATS has progressed more slowly due to higher costs, loss of haptic feedback, and steep learning curve. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-minimally-invasive-thoracic-surgery#H3910400620\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of minimally invasive thoracic surgery&quot;, section on 'VATS versus RATS'</a>.)</p><p>Minimally invasive techniques have increasingly shown a benefit when compared with open thoracotomy. Several systematic reviews have reported faster recovery and shorter length of stay with MITS compared with patients who have had a thoracotomy with or without rib division [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-pulmonary-resection/abstract/25-32\" class=\"abstract_t\">25-32</a>]. Older patients are independent sooner with minimally invasive procedures compared with those with larger rib-spreading chest incisions, even though the extent of surgery internally is equivalent. </p><p>Individual postoperative metrics such as postoperative pain, pulmonary function, and costs studied in the realm of lung resection for management of malignancy are discussed below, although, as discussed above, lung resection may be required for several pulmonary diseases, and the data presented below offer indirect support for other indications. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3104593620\"><span class=\"h2\">Postoperative pain</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>It is well accepted that VATS offers the benefit of major pulmonary resection with decreased early postoperative pain [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-pulmonary-resection/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>]. Several studies have documented a decreased need for opioid analgesia, decreased hospital stay, and faster recovery and return to preoperative activities [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-pulmonary-resection/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>]. </p><p>Similarly, RATS provides decreased pain scores immediately postoperatively with decreased opioid usage upon discharge, and shorter length of stay compared with open lung resection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-pulmonary-resection/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>]. </p><p>Minimally invasive lung resection confers an improved short-term quality of life (QOL) and decreased chronic pain as documented in several studies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-pulmonary-resection/abstract/36-39\" class=\"abstract_t\">36-39</a>]. Few studies quantify long-term QOL, although one suggests the benefit may be present for up to one year following surgery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-pulmonary-resection/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2707204384\"><span class=\"h2\">Pulmonary function</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Pulmonary function may be better preserved following minimally invasive pulmonary resection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-pulmonary-resection/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>]. In a nonrandomized comparison, those who underwent minimally invasive lobectomy had improved recovery of forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1), forced vital capacity (FVC), and vital capacity (VC) compared with open thoracotomy. This improved recovery was superior up to two weeks postoperatively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-pulmonary-resection/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>]. In another small comparison study, early and late postoperative phase oxygen saturation, FEV1, and FVC were improved in the immediate postoperative period; however, there was no significant differences at approximately 12 months postoperatively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-pulmonary-resection/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3702883562\"><span class=\"h2\">Complications</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In general, complications related to minimally invasive thoracic procedures are similar to those of the open surgical approaches. Common complications following lung resection include atrial <span class=\"nowrap\">fibrillation/flutter,</span> postoperative atelectasis, respiratory failure, bleeding, surgical site infection, prolonged postoperative air leak, and bronchopleural fistula. </p><p>Postoperative arrhythmia occurs in 10 to 15 percent of lung resections and typically occurs within one to three days postoperatively with a similar incidence for open and minimally invasive approaches. The incidence of adult respiratory failure was low at 3.7 percent for both open and minimally invasive procedures in a secondary analysis of the American College of Surgeons Oncology Group (ACOSOG) Z0030 trial [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-pulmonary-resection/abstract/43\" class=\"abstract_t\">43</a>]. Adult respiratory distress syndrome occurred in 0.3 percent. Atelectasis requiring bronchoscopy was lower in the minimally invasive cohort. </p><p>There is an increased risk for vessel injury during minimally invasive surgery; however, this does not uniformly translate to requiring conversion to thoracotomy or any increase in postoperative sequelae. Hemorrhage may be more difficult to control quickly via minimally invasive methods since blood may obscure camera visualization, but despite this, the frequency of blood transfusions is generally lower following VATS lobectomy compared with open thoracotomy (2.4 versus 4.7 percent, in one study [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-pulmonary-resection/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]). </p><p>Prolonged postoperative air leak, defined as pulmonary leak of longer than seven days, occurs in 10 to 15 percent of patients following lobectomy. Management is often conservative with ongoing chest tube drainage. Bronchopleural fistula, which is a direct communication of the bronchus and the pleural space, is a major complication of lung resection and occurs in 1 to 2 percent of lobectomies. Its incidence is higher following pneumonectomy (6 to 10 percent). Management requires reoperation for bronchial closure, pleural space drainage, and sterilization. </p><p>Unintended ligation and division of a bronchus or vessel has been documented in minimally invasive thoracic surgery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-pulmonary-resection/abstract/44,45\" class=\"abstract_t\">44,45</a>]. Decreased &quot;overview&quot; and magnification used in minimally invasive techniques may contribute to this surgical mishap. Injury to the diaphragm, liver, or spleen may occur, particularly during port placement. Injuries to the liver or spleen can cause significant hemorrhage [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-pulmonary-resection/abstract/46,47\" class=\"abstract_t\">46,47</a>]. Some methods to avoid this complication include careful imaging review to identify anatomic variations, starting with cephalad ports or placement of a port that allows camera viewing at its tip, as commonly performed in laparoscopic surgery. Diaphragm injuries rarely cause severe morbidity, though they require repair. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1867245062\"><span class=\"h2\">Cost</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The costs associated with open and VATS pulmonary resection appear to be similar, with the initial increased equipment costs associated with minimally invasive surgery offset by its reduced length of stay and fewer complications [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-pulmonary-resection/abstract/48\" class=\"abstract_t\">48</a>]. </p><p>Despite the many benefits of robotic thoracic surgery, it has not achieved acceptance like VATS due to longer operative times and higher cost [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-pulmonary-resection/abstract/49\" class=\"abstract_t\">49</a>]. In one cohort study, there was a nearly $4600 increased incremental cost for RATS lobectomy compared with VATS. One author has suggested that the costs of robotic surgery are offset by decreased need for intraoperative monitoring devices and the ability to &quot;fast track&quot; patients with decreased hospital stay and procedural efficiency [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-pulmonary-resection/abstract/50\" class=\"abstract_t\">50</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3109838415\"><span class=\"h1\">THORACOTOMY EXPOSURES AND TECHNIQUES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A thoracotomy is an incision through the chest wall used to provide exposure of the intrathoracic contents. The number and lengths of the incision(s) vary, with open thoracotomy using a single long incision compared with minimally invasive surgery, which uses one or more smaller incisions. The chosen approach to lung resection depends on the exposure needed to accomplish the resection. Video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS) is often chosen for its perceived benefits, but even in the era of minimally invasive techniques, open thoracotomy is still chosen by many thoracic surgeons of specific reasons. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-minimally-invasive-thoracic-surgery#H614489535\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of minimally invasive thoracic surgery&quot;, section on 'Contraindications'</a>.)</p><p>The various thoracotomy incisions are described below. Regardless of which is used, the basic principles are similar. The initial incision is made overlying the superior aspect of the chosen rib to avoid the intercostal neurovascular bundle (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F59415\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef59415 \">figure 4</a>) and carried down through the subcutaneous tissue and intercostal muscles, typically using electrocautery or by using sharp dissection (eg, prior thoracotomy to enter the pleura safely). The pleura beneath the muscles is divided, taking care not to injure the underlying lung. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4118160239\"><span class=\"h2\">Open approaches</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3176442151\"><span class=\"h3\">Posterior lateral thoracotomy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The posterior lateral thoracotomy incision through the fifth interspace is the most commonly used incision for lung resection. This incision provides adequate exposure for the majority of pulmonary resections. </p><p>The traditional moderate sigmoid incision of a posterior lateral thoracotomy is located one fingerbreadth inferior to the tip of the scapula extending posterosuperiorly between the spine and posterior border of the scapula, and progressing anteriorly toward the inframammary fold. The length of the incision is variable depending on the need for exposure. The thoracotomy can be performed either sparing or dividing the latissimus dorsi muscle, but the serratus muscle is commonly spared and retracted for entry into the thorax. </p><p>Sparing both the serratus and latissimus can also be performed, particularly in small, less muscular patients; this technique is more challenging in larger, more muscular patients. Muscle sparing can also be used when the latissimus dorsi muscle or serratus muscle will be used as a muscle flap for bronchial stump reinforcement. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2936937202\"><span class=\"h3\">Axillary thoracotomy/limited lateral thoracotomy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Located medial to the latissimus dorsi muscle, the axillary thoracotomy incision through the fourth intercostal space is a serratus muscle-sparing incision used for anterior mediastinal, hilar, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> upper and middle lung resections. The axillary thoracotomy is typically reserved for upper lobe resection (right, left) and provides poor access to the posterior thorax. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H27610778\"><span class=\"h3\">Anterior thoracotomy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The anterior thoracotomy incision is performed by making an incision along the inframammary fold and dividing the pectoralis and anterior serratus muscles to reach the fifth intercostal space (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F86029\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef86029 \">figure 5</a>). The anterior thoracotomy incision provides exposure for the anterior, upper, and middle lobes. Much like the axillary thoracotomy, the lower lobe is not well accessed via the anterior thoracotomy due to limited access to the posterior thorax. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3373336779\"><span class=\"h3\">Hemi-clamshell</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The hemi-clamshell incision is a combination of an anterior thoracotomy and sternotomy with division of the sternum using an electric or hydraulic saw (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F90498\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef90498 \">figure 6</a>). This incision is used for the resection of large tumors involving the apex of the upper lobe <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> anterosuperior mediastinum. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2918352426\"><span class=\"h3\">Clamshell</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The clamshell incision provides bilateral thoracic and mediastinal access (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F90511\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef90511 \">figure 7</a>). The incision spans the bilateral inframammary folds, with horizontal transection of the sternum. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1278373086\"><span class=\"h2\">Minimally invasive port placement</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Minimally invasive lung surgery or VATS is typically defined as the use of thoracoscope (video) with thoracotomy but with no rib spreading. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-minimally-invasive-thoracic-surgery#H2961447177\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of minimally invasive thoracic surgery&quot;, section on 'Incisions'</a>.)</p><p>Minimally invasive lung resections are performed through one or more small incisions, which are variable in size (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F110181\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef110181 \">figure 8</a>). The surgeon performs the procedure while looking at the operative field on a monitor (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F110166\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef110166 \">figure 9</a>). The incisions used to place the ports for the camera and instruments are created in their chosen locations in a manner similar to the open thoracotomy incisions described above, ranging in length from 0.5 to 8 cm depending upon the approach (eg, totally thoracoscopic, hand assisted). Insufflation of carbon dioxide can be used to aid with initial deflation of lung, or with entry into the chest. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H211313391\"><span class=\"h1\">CHEST TUBE PLACEMENT AND MANAGEMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Following lung resection, one or more chest tubes are placed in the hemithorax. The number of chest tubes placed varies with surgeon preference and the nature of the surgical procedure. Chest tubes are connected to a chest drainage system consisting of three chambers: a fluid collection chamber for collection of postsurgical effluent, a &quot;water seal&quot; that collects air expelled from the thoracic space while preventing the entrainment of air into the thorax, and a vacuum chamber to which negative pressure or &quot;suction&quot; can be applied. The drainage system can be consolidated as a self-contained chest tube collection device (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F80960\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef80960 \">figure 10</a>), or a three bottle system. Newer drainage systems offer the ability to better quantify the magnitude of a pleural leak to help direct chest tube care [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-pulmonary-resection/abstract/51\" class=\"abstract_t\">51</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=placement-and-management-of-thoracostomy-tubes\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Placement and management of thoracostomy tubes&quot;</a>.) </p><p>Postoperative management of chest tubes is directed by postoperative imaging, presence or absence of air leak (identified by the presence of bubbles within the water seal chamber), and the volume <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> character of drainage. Following both open and minimally invasive techniques, we typically place the chest tube to suction in the immediate postoperative period for at least 12 hours (overnight), then disconnect the suction, typically the next day, leaving the chest tube to water seal. </p><p>The decision to place a chest tube to suction versus water seal if a postoperative pleural leak is present is controversial. Up to 44 percent of patients following lung resection have a postoperative air leak [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-pulmonary-resection/abstract/52\" class=\"abstract_t\">52</a>]. Retrospective studies have suggested that pleural leaks may seal more quickly if suction can be eliminated (water seal for wet drainage systems) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-pulmonary-resection/abstract/52-59\" class=\"abstract_t\">52-59</a>]. Some suggest a short period of postoperative suction, while others suggest water seal beginning immediately postprocedure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-pulmonary-resection/abstract/52,54\" class=\"abstract_t\">52,54</a>]. Randomized trials have compared outcomes for patients assigned to chest tubes placed to water seal or to suction following lung resection following a brief period of suction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-pulmonary-resection/abstract/52,53,56-58\" class=\"abstract_t\">52,53,56-58</a>]. A meta-analysis of seven trials that included 1139 patients found no difference in the incidence of prolonged&nbsp;air leak for patients who received ongoing suction compared&nbsp;with those who did not; however, there was substantial heterogeneity among trials [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-pulmonary-resection/abstract/60\" class=\"abstract_t\">60</a>]. Whether ongoing suction affects air leak or chest tube duration remains uncertain, as this meta-analysis and an earlier meta-analysis reached different conclusions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-pulmonary-resection/abstract/60,61\" class=\"abstract_t\">60,61</a>]. </p><p>Chest tubes must be evaluated several times daily to ensure patency of the tubes, checking for kinks or occlusions, and to assess for their ongoing need. We leave the chest tubes in position as long as any air leak from the lung remains, or the fluid effluent volume is &gt;300 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/day</span>. Upon resolution of pleural leakage and collection of minimal fluid drainage, the chest tube is removed at the bedside. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=placement-and-management-of-thoracostomy-tubes#H254981706\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Placement and management of thoracostomy tubes&quot;, section on 'Removal'</a>.) </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1056666345\"><span class=\"h2\">Persistent air leak</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>For patients who do not resolve their air leak, the patient can be discharged to home with a one-way flutter valve [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-pulmonary-resection/abstract/62,63\" class=\"abstract_t\">62,63</a>]. The authors' practice is to take the tube out at approximately three weeks on first follow-up visit. Until the tube is removed, antibiotics are given to the patient. </p><p>Risk factors for persistent air leak include severe emphysematous lungs, an incomplete fissure that may have required division, and cauterizing lung parenchyma. In a study of 669 postoperative patients, other factors included male sex, steroid therapy, and lobectomy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-pulmonary-resection/abstract/64\" class=\"abstract_t\">64</a>]. Most air leaks sealed within two weeks with conservative care (one-way valve). </p><p>Techniques that can be useful for minimizing air leak include gently handling of lung tissue with lung clamps or sponge gauze, minimizing cautery to divide fissures, and using a linear cutting stapler, when possible. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3231648310\"><span class=\"h1\">SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pulmonary (lung) resection is used for the treatment of a variety of diseases, including primary lung malignancies, metastatic disease to the lung, a variety of benign lung diseases when medical therapies are no longer effective, and more severe traumatic injuries.

Anatomic resections include segmentectomy, lobectomy, pneumonectomy, and sleeve resection. The extent of resection needed is based upon the size, location, and type of lesion found within the lung. For malignant disease, the ability to obtain a negative margin is an important consideration in determining the choice of resection.
