In the United States each year, there are approximately 22,000 new cases of ovarian cancer and 14,000 cancer-related deaths [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/screening-for-ovarian-cancer/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>]. Worldwide, the number of new cases of ovarian cancer each year is approaching 250,000 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/screening-for-ovarian-cancer/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. It is the seventh most common cancer in women, and incidence rates are highest in developed countries. The incidence of ovarian cancer increases with age. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epithelial-carcinoma-of-the-ovary-fallopian-tube-and-peritoneum-epidemiology-and-risk-factors\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Epithelial carcinoma of the ovary, fallopian tube, and peritoneum: Epidemiology and risk factors&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Interest in early detection as a method of reducing mortality developed with the discovery of serum tumor markers associated with ovarian malignancies (particularly CA 125) and with the improved diagnostic accuracy of pelvic ultrasonography. This topic will review the risks and benefits of screening for ovarian cancer in asymptomatic women. The issue of testing for ovarian cancer in women with nonspecific symptoms that may be associated with ovarian cancer is discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=early-detection-of-epithelial-ovarian-cancer-role-of-symptom-recognition\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Early detection of epithelial ovarian cancer: Role of symptom recognition&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Additionally, screening in women at high risk of ovarian cancer, the clinical manifestations of epithelial ovarian cancer, epidemiology and risk factors for ovarian cancer, and surveillance for patients who have been treated for ovarian cancer are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-patients-at-high-risk-for-breast-and-ovarian-cancer\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of patients at high risk for breast and ovarian cancer&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epithelial-carcinoma-of-the-ovary-fallopian-tube-and-peritoneum-clinical-features-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Epithelial carcinoma of the ovary, fallopian tube, and peritoneum: Clinical features and diagnosis&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epithelial-carcinoma-of-the-ovary-fallopian-tube-and-peritoneum-histopathology\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Epithelial carcinoma of the ovary, fallopian tube, and peritoneum: Histopathology&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epithelial-carcinoma-of-the-ovary-fallopian-tube-and-peritoneum-epidemiology-and-risk-factors\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Epithelial carcinoma of the ovary, fallopian tube, and peritoneum: Epidemiology and risk factors&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">BIOLOGICAL BASIS FOR SCREENING</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Survival from ovarian cancer is related to the stage at diagnosis; five-year survival is over 90 percent for the minority of women with stage I disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/screening-for-ovarian-cancer/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. This number drops to about 75 to 80 percent for regional disease and 25 percent for those with distant metastases.</p><p>Despite the good prognosis associated with early-stage disease, overall five-year survival in women with ovarian cancer is less than 45 percent. This poor survival rate in large part is due to the spread of cancer beyond the ovary at the time of clinical detection in 75 percent of patients. Mortality from ovarian cancer has decreased only slightly in the past 30 years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/screening-for-ovarian-cancer/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].</p><p>Little is known about the mechanism or timing of progression from localized to disseminated ovarian cancer. The model of unifocal disease progressing to diffuse disease is plausible. However, ovarian cancer also may develop from multiple foci within the abdomen, since carcinomatosis can develop even after the removal of normal ovaries [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/screening-for-ovarian-cancer/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. Additionally, it has been proposed that a substantial number of ovarian cancers may be multifocal and extra-ovarian at their earliest recognizable state so that early detection efforts focused only on the ovary may miss many tumors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/screening-for-ovarian-cancer/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].</p><p>The majority of ovarian malignancies are epithelial tumors (including serous, mucinous, endometrioid, and clear-cell tumors); the remainder arise from germ cell and other tissues. A subgroup of epithelial tumors, known as &quot;borderline tumors&quot; or &quot;cystadenomas of low malignant potential,&quot; have a more favorable prognosis. Benign cystadenomas, another subgroup of epithelial tumors, have a low rate of malignant transformation. The benefit of identifying asymptomatic benign cystadenomas is unknown. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epithelial-carcinoma-of-the-ovary-fallopian-tube-and-peritoneum-epidemiology-and-risk-factors#H6092134\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Epithelial carcinoma of the ovary, fallopian tube, and peritoneum: Epidemiology and risk factors&quot;, section on 'Epidemiology'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">FACTORS THAT AFFECT RISK</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Identification of women at high risk for ovarian cancer may help to identify a group that would most benefit from screening strategies. Known risk factors for ovarian cancer include age, genetic, endocrine and reproductive factors; certain environmental factors also seem to affect risk. These risk factors are discussed in detail separately (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F59585\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef59585 \">table 1</a>). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epithelial-carcinoma-of-the-ovary-fallopian-tube-and-peritoneum-epidemiology-and-risk-factors\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Epithelial carcinoma of the ovary, fallopian tube, and peritoneum: Epidemiology and risk factors&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The strongest known risk factor for ovarian cancer is a family history [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/screening-for-ovarian-cancer/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. The risk is increased when the family history indicates a sporadic case and is substantially greater when there is a hereditary cancer syndrome (eg, Lynch syndrome, breast-ovarian cancer syndrome usually associated with a <em>BRCA1</em><span class=\"nowrap\">/<em>BRCA2</em></span> mutation (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F68548\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef68548 \">table 2</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F57434\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef57434 \">table 3</a>), or other syndromes). In these hereditary cancer syndromes, ovarian cancer typically occurred in a first- or second-degree relative at age under 50 years, or relatives in two or more generations had ovarian or related cancers. However, small family size may mask the presence of a hereditable disorder [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/screening-for-ovarian-cancer/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].</p><p>Several reproductive factors appear to increase the risk of ovarian cancer, including a history of infertility, endometriosis, hormone replacement therapy, early menarche, late menopause, nulliparity and other obstetric factors, polycystic ovarian syndrome, endometriosis and intrauterine devices. However, studies have found that fertility treatment does not independently increase ovarian cancer risk.</p><p>Factors strongly associated with a reduced risk of ovarian cancer include pregnancy, use of oral contraceptive pills, breastfeeding, tubal ligation, hysterectomy, and salpingo-oophorectomy.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h1\">RISKS AND BENEFITS OF SCREENING</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The potential benefit of screening is its ability to identify ovarian cancer at a more localized and curable stage, leading to reduced mortality from the disease.</p><p>The potential risks associated with screening for ovarian cancer must also be considered. A positive screening result suggestive of ovarian cancer most often is followed by surgery (either laparoscopy or laparotomy). Invasive procedures are associated with physical and psychological morbidity, a small risk for serious complications, and substantial financial costs.</p><p>Although ovarian cancer is an important cause of cancer death, its incidence and prevalence in the general population are relatively low. The problem of false-positive screening tests becomes critically important in diseases with low prevalence. Unless the test or sequence of tests is extremely accurate, a large number of healthy women would be at risk for unnecessary surgery. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evidence-based-approach-to-prevention\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evidence-based approach to prevention&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h1\">SCREENING TESTS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Most experts feel that a screening protocol for ovarian cancer should have a positive predictive value of at least 10 percent (that is, no more than nine healthy women with false-positive screens would undergo unnecessary procedures for each case of ovarian cancer detected) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/screening-for-ovarian-cancer/abstract/9-11\" class=\"abstract_t\">9-11</a>]. A screening program that targets all women over age 50 would require a test with a specificity of at least 99.6 percent (assuming a sensitivity of 80 percent) to achieve a positive predictive value of 10 percent. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evidence-based-approach-to-prevention#H20178036\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evidence-based approach to prevention&quot;, section on 'Performance of screening tests'</a>.)</p><p>Tests that have been evaluated for screening in certain circumstances include measurement of the CA 125 tumor marker or other serologic markers, ultrasonography, and combinations of these modalities (multimodal screening [MMS]). Image-based screening by computed tomography (CT) scanning is unlikely to be effective in diagnosing presymptomatic early disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/screening-for-ovarian-cancer/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>].</p><p>Screening in women at high risk of ovarian cancer is discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-patients-at-high-risk-for-breast-and-ovarian-cancer\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of patients at high risk for breast and ovarian cancer&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h2\">Tumor markers</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Tumor markers have received considerable interest as possible screening tests because they are noninvasive, easily repeated over time, and relatively inexpensive compared with imaging studies.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h3\">CA 125</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Measurement of the serum concentration of the CA 125 glycoprotein antigen is the most widely studied biochemical method of screening for ovarian cancer. Serum CA 125 values are elevated in approximately 50 percent of women with early-stage disease and in over 80 percent of women with advanced ovarian cancer [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/screening-for-ovarian-cancer/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>].</p><p>However, the specificity of CA 125 is limited. CA 125 levels are elevated in approximately 1 percent of healthy women and fluctuate during the menstrual cycle [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/screening-for-ovarian-cancer/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. CA 125 is also increased in a variety of benign and malignant conditions, including:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Endometriosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/screening-for-ovarian-cancer/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Uterine leiomyoma</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Cirrhosis with or without ascites [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/screening-for-ovarian-cancer/abstract/16,17\" class=\"abstract_t\">16,17</a>]</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pelvic inflammatory disease</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Cancers of the endometrium, breast, lung, and pancreas [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/screening-for-ovarian-cancer/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pleural or peritoneal fluid due to any cause [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/screening-for-ovarian-cancer/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]</p><p/><p>Mean CA 125 levels further vary with ethnicity and smoking status (lower in non-white women and current smokers) and increase with age [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/screening-for-ovarian-cancer/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>].</p><p>Nonetheless, a prospective study of asymptomatic postmenopausal women found that an elevated CA 125 concentration (&ge;30 <span class=\"nowrap\">Units/mL)</span> was a powerful predictor of subsequent ovarian cancer risk (relative risk [RR] 35.9 at one year and 14.3 at five years) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/screening-for-ovarian-cancer/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>].</p><p>Studies of CA 125 in screening for ovarian cancer have focused upon postmenopausal women, since menstrual cycle variations and the prevalence of benign gynecologic conditions in premenopausal women would result in a substantially higher likelihood of false-positive tests. Accumulated evidence suggests that annual CA 125 measurements alone lack sufficient specificity for use in an average-risk population of postmenopausal women:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Three large screening studies in Sweden and England showed that the specificity of a single CA 125 level for detection of ovarian neoplasms in postmenopausal women ranged from 98.6 to 99.4 percent, resulting in an unacceptably low positive predictive value of 3 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/screening-for-ovarian-cancer/abstract/22-24\" class=\"abstract_t\">22-24</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A more definitive assessment of annual screening with CA 125 and its impact on cancer mortality in a randomized controlled trial was conducted as a component of the Prostate, Lung, Colorectal, and Ovarian (PLCO) Cancer Screening Trial [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/screening-for-ovarian-cancer/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. In the ovarian component of PLCO, 78,237 healthy women between 55 and 74 years of age were randomly assigned to screening and control groups; 39,115 women were assigned to screening with annual CA 125 and annual transvaginal ultrasound (TVUS). Data from the baseline prevalence screen in 28,816 women found an abnormal CA 125 in 436 women (1.5 percent); the positive predictive value for invasive cancer was 3.7 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/screening-for-ovarian-cancer/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. At four years of follow-up, the positivity rates of CA 125 remained essentially unchanged from baseline and the positive predictive value was 2.6 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/screening-for-ovarian-cancer/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>].</p><p/><p>The change in CA 125 levels over time is a more promising screening method. A large prospective study in 9233 postmenopausal women, with measurements of CA 125 at two or more times, used a modeling method to estimate risk of ovarian cancer [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/screening-for-ovarian-cancer/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. The model incorporates age-specific incidence of cancer, absolute CA 125 level, and rate of change over time. Compared with a specific cutoff value of CA 125, the model improved sensitivity for detection of ovarian cancer from 62 to 86 percent when specificity was fixed at 98 percent. An algorithm incorporating change in CA 125 measurements over time was used in the UK Collaborative Trial of Ovarian Cancer Screening (UKCTOCS) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/screening-for-ovarian-cancer/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>].

Studies are ongoing to evaluate combinations of bio-markers complementary to CA 125 that could offer greater sensitivity and specificity than CA 125 alone. Examples of these studies include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Human Epididymis Protein 4 (HE4) appears to have similar sensitivity to CA 125 when comparing serum from ovarian cancer cases with healthy controls, and a higher sensitivity when comparing ovarian cancer cases with benign gynecologic disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/screening-for-ovarian-cancer/abstract/30,31\" class=\"abstract_t\">30,31</a>]. In a study of 531 women with pelvic masses, an algorithm using HE4 and CA 125 correctly classified 93.8 percent of cases of epithelial ovarian cancer as high risk [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/screening-for-ovarian-cancer/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>]. A commercial assay for serum HE4 is available (the Architect HE4 Test, Abbott Laboratories). However, at least in the United States, this assay is approved for monitoring women with ovarian cancer for disease recurrence or progression but not for screening.

This test is not commercially available. Additional studies are needed to determine if this blood test may improve detection of ovarian cancer at an early stage.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>An earlier study evaluated serum biomarkers using multiplex immunoassays in 2031 healthy women and 1067 women with early- and late-stage ovarian cancers, benign pelvic tumors, or breast, colorectal, or lung cancer [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/screening-for-ovarian-cancer/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>]. A four-marker panel (CA 125, HE4, CEA, and VCAM-1) had the highest diagnostic power, with 86 percent sensitivity for early-stage ovarian cancer at 98 percent specificity. These results, while requiring validation, suggest that combinations of biomarkers may provide improved detection as the first step in an MMS protocol.</p><p/><p>To determine the potential benefit of biomarkers for screening, however, it is important that they be able to detect disease before it is clinically diagnosed. Two studies have evaluated newer biomarker panels in serum collected pre-diagnostically from women who participated in longitudinal cohorts and subsequently developed ovarian cancer [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/screening-for-ovarian-cancer/abstract/35,36\" class=\"abstract_t\">35,36</a>]. In a case-control study nested within a randomized lung cancer prevention trial in smokers, tumor markers in stored serum samples were compared between 70 case-matched controls and 34 women who developed ovarian cancer after the trial onset [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/screening-for-ovarian-cancer/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>]. Three tumor markers (CA 125, mesothelin, and HE4) began to increase three years before the diagnosis of ovarian cancer. CA 125 was most strongly predictive of ovarian cancer, with evidence for some incremental contribution of HE4 and mesothelin to risk prediction. A second study used samples of serum collected from women participating in the PLCO trial [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/screening-for-ovarian-cancer/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>]. Pre-diagnostic sera from 118 women who subsequently were diagnosed with ovarian cancer were compared with sera from 951 age-matched controls (one-fourth at increased risk due to family history). CA 125 levels were elevated in 61.5 percent of women who were diagnosed with ovarian cancer within the subsequent 12 months; testing with a panel of seven additional biomarkers did not improve the sensitivity of CA 125 alone for preclinical diagnosis.</p><p>Tumors markers may be helpful to identify women at higher risk for ovarian cancer. One study found that using a risk predictor that combined CA125 and HE4 with epidemiologic risk factors (for example, family history of breast or ovarian cancer) identified women who were at higher risk for ovarian cancer [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/screening-for-ovarian-cancer/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h2\">Ovarian cancer symptom index</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>An ovarian symptom index has been developed and proposed for screening purposes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/screening-for-ovarian-cancer/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>]. The index is considered to be positive in women who report pelvic or abdominal pain, bloating, increased abdominal size, difficulty eating, or early satiety occurring more than 12 times a month, with symptoms present for less than one year. Follow-up for a positive symptom index is discussed separately.

However, the symptom index was positive in 12 percent of high-risk women who did not have ovarian cancer, and thus specificity was low. A case-control study, comparing retrospective reports of symptoms in women with ovarian cancer and women in the general population, found a very low positive predictive value for the symptom index (&lt;0.5 percent for early-stage disease and &lt;1.1 percent overall), reflecting the low prevalence of ovarian cancer [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/screening-for-ovarian-cancer/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>].</p><p>Another study in 211 high-risk women found that the combination of the symptom index, CA 125, and HE4 serum markers as a first-line screen had a sensitivity of 83.8 percent and specificity of 98.5 percent when two of the three tests were positive [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/screening-for-ovarian-cancer/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15\"><span class=\"h2\">Pelvic ultrasonography</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Transabdominal and TVUS have been evaluated as potential first-line screening methods for ovarian cancer.

In addition to size, morphologic characteristics (presence of septae or cyst wall irregularity) are considered in the interpretation of an ultrasound study (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ultrasound-differentiation-of-benign-versus-malignant-adnexal-masses\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Ultrasound differentiation of benign versus malignant adnexal masses&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The sensitivity of ultrasonography is in part observer-dependent and has ranged from 80 to 100 percent in studies of women with clinically detected ovarian cancer and in several prospective screening studies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/screening-for-ovarian-cancer/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. The test's specificity has ranged from 94 to 99 percent in screening studies, including two studies of women with a family history of ovarian cancer [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/screening-for-ovarian-cancer/abstract/42,43\" class=\"abstract_t\">42,43</a>].</p><p>Ultrasonography has been evaluated for screening in both lower- and high-risk women:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Lower-risk women </strong>&ndash;<strong> </strong>Compared with studies in women at high risk of ovarian cancer, studies of screening with ultrasonography in women at lower risk have shown somewhat more favorable results.

Mean follow-up was 5.8 years. The protocol evolved such that what was defined as a normal ovarian cyst changed over time. The specificity and positive predictive value for primary invasive epithelial ovarian cancer were 98.5 and 8.9 percent respectively. The five-year survival rate for women with screen-detected invasive ovarian cancer was 84.6 percent compared with 53.7 percent for ovarian cancers in unscreened women; whether this difference reflects a true mortality difference or biases related to nonrandomized studies cannot be determined.

There was no difference in the stage of ovarian cancer, with advanced disease (stage III or IV) in 77 percent of the cancers in the intervention group and 78 percent in the usual care group. Both the incidence of ovarian cancer and the mortality rate were not significantly different for women allocated to the intervention (rate ratios 1.21, 95% CI 0.99-1.48 and 1.18, CI 0.91-1.54, respectively). Excluding deaths from ovarian, colorectal, and lung cancer, all-cause mortality was similar in both groups (2924 intervention deaths and 2914 control deaths).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Compliance with screening in the intervention group was 84 to 85 percent at baseline and declined modestly (78 to 79 percent at the fourth screening round, and 73 percent at the last round, which included only CA 125). Positive screening rates for CA 125 ranged from 1.4 to 1.8 percent during the six rounds and from 2.9 to 4.6 percent during the four ultrasound rounds.

The 50,640 patients in the MMS arm received annual screening with CA 125, followed by TVUS if the CA 125 was abnormal, using an algorithmic guideline [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/screening-for-ovarian-cancer/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Prevalence (initial) screening from this study found 42 primary ovarian and tubal cancers in the MMS group; 8 tumors were borderline and 16 of the 34 invasive cancers (47 percent) were stage I or II [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/screening-for-ovarian-cancer/abstract/45\" class=\"abstract_t\">45</a>]. The sensitivity, specificity, and positive predictive value were 89.4, 99.8, and 43.3 percent respectively for all primary ovarian and tubal cancers and 89.5, 99.8, and 35.1 percent for primary invasive cancer.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">After a median follow-up of 11 years, there were 338 cancers (0.7 percent) diagnosed in the MMS group, 314 (0.6 percent) in the TVUS group, and 630 (0.6 percent) in the no-screening group [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/screening-for-ovarian-cancer/abstract/46\" class=\"abstract_t\">46</a>]. Compared with no screening, MMS detected cancer at an earlier stage (I, II, and IIIa) (26 percent versus 39 percent). During the trial, 148 (0.29 percent) women in the MMS group, 154 (0.30 percent) in the TVUS group, and 347 (0.34 percent) of the unscreened women died of ovarian cancer. The primary analysis showed a nonsignificant trend toward a 15 percent (95% CI -3 to 30) reduction in mortality from ovarian cancer. However, in a prespecified analysis that excluded prevalent cases, the hazard ratio showed a significant reduction in mortality, although the average absolute reduction in mortality showed only a trend toward reduction (20 percent, 95% CI -2 to 40). The authors suggest that there was no reduction in mortality in the initial years of screening, with the survival curves separating later in the trial. Follow-up to confirm the magnitude of this effect is underway. It is estimated that 641 women would need to be screened annually for 14 years to prevent one death from ovarian cancer.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>The Shizuoka Cohort Study of Ovarian Cancer Screening </strong>&ndash;<strong> </strong>In a randomized controlled trial of 83,000 postmenopausal women in Japan, 42,000 women were invited to participate in annual screening with pelvic ultrasound and CA 125 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/screening-for-ovarian-cancer/abstract/53\" class=\"abstract_t\">53</a>]. The control group in the same prefecture received usual care. There was no significant difference in the detection of ovarian cancer, at an average follow-up of 9.2 years, between patients who received screening (27 cases) and control patients (32 cases). There was a non-significant trend toward earlier-stage disease in the screened group. Thirty-three surgeries were performed to detect each case of ovarian cancer. Mortality data are not yet available.</p><p/><p>The UKCTOCS&rsquo;s more favorable results may reflect differences in trial design. The UKCTOCS defined an abnormal CA 125 according to a sophisticated algorithm to estimate ovarian cancer risk. In addition, the UKCTOCS utilized a centrally monitored protocol for clinical evaluation of abnormal results, whereas in the PLCO evaluation of abnormal screening results was at the discretion of the community clinician. The chief limitation of the UKCTOCS was its failure to anticipate a late effect of screening on mortality, which has been noted in other large cancer screening trials. Although initial results of MMS in the UKCTOCS appear promising, definitive assessment awaits additional follow-up, and cost-effectiveness needs to be determined.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H17\"><span class=\"h3\">High-risk women</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Randomized trials of screening for women with a familial ovarian cancer syndrome are not likely to be performed, since women at high risk for ovarian cancer and their clinicians would not accept assignment to a no-screening arm. Therefore, prospective cohort studies provide the available data regarding the impact of screening for this population. Reports from surveillance programs using MMS in women at high risk due to a genetic predisposition or family history have been largely disappointing and include the following:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In the largest cohort study, the United Kingdom Familial Ovarian Cancer Screen Study (UK FOCSS), 3563 women with a familial ovarian cancer syndrome (estimated minimum lifetime risk of 10 percent) who had declined or deferred risk-reducing salpingo-oophorectomy (RRSO), participants were screened annually for a mean of 3.2 years with a combination of TVUS and CA-125 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/screening-for-ovarian-cancer/abstract/54\" class=\"abstract_t\">54</a>]. The reported sensitivity for the detection of incident ovarian <span class=\"nowrap\">cancer/fallopian</span> tube cancer was 81.0 to 87.5 percent, depending on whether occult cancers detected at the time of RRSO (in women who underwent the procedure prior to the end of the study period) were classified as false negative or true positive. The positive predictive value of incident screening was 25.5 percent, which exceeds the threshold of 10 percent considered necessary for ovarian cancer screening. Four women underwent surgery for each case of detected cancer. (See <a href=\"#H9\" class=\"local\">'Screening tests'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Among incident screen-detected cancers, 30.8 percent (4 of 13) were stage I or II. Women who had not been screened in the year before cancer diagnosis were more likely to have stage IIIc or higher cancer than women who had been screened in the preceding year (85.7 versus 26.1 percent), suggesting the importance of adherence to the screening schedule. The study was not designed to determine whether screening improves mortality. However, the detection of lower-stage disease in women who adhered to screening has led to a decision to decrease the screening interval to four months for the next phase of this study. Additionally, the Risk of Ovarian Cancer algorithm used in the UKCTOCS will be incorporated into the next phase of this study for determining and following up on abnormal results.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Although RRSO remains the only reliable method of decreasing mortality from ovarian cancer in this high-risk population, this study suggests that screening may have the potential to somewhat reduce risk for women who wish to maintain their childbearing potential until they are ready to undergo surgery.</p><p/><p>Other studies of screening in women at high risk have shown less favorable results, with most cases at late stage at the time of screen detection:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a cohort of 888 women carriers of <em>BRCA1</em> or <em>BRCA2</em> mutations who underwent screening with annual TVUS and CA 125, 5 of 10 incident cancers were interval cases diagnosed in women who had had normal screening results 3 to 10 months previously [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/screening-for-ovarian-cancer/abstract/55\" class=\"abstract_t\">55</a>].
