Management of individual patients requires careful consideration of a number of factors, including the patient's symptoms and signs, age, stage of disease, degree of functional disability, and level of physical activity and productivity. Treatment can be divided into pharmacologic, nonpharmacologic, and surgical therapy.</p><p>The pharmacologic treatment of PD can be further divided into neuroprotective and symptomatic therapy. In practice, nearly all of the available treatments are symptomatic in nature and do not appear to slow or reverse the natural course of the disease. However, several potential neuroprotective agents for PD have shown some promise in animals <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> humans and are undergoing further investigation. Neuroprotective therapy for PD is discussed in greater detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=potential-disease-modifying-therapies-for-parkinson-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Potential disease-modifying therapies for Parkinson disease&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The routine medical management of PD is reviewed here. The nonpharmacologic management of PD, including education, support, exercise, and nutrition, is discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nonpharmacologic-management-of-parkinson-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Nonpharmacologic management of Parkinson disease&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Treatment of advanced PD, particularly the complications associated with long-term levodopa therapy, and management of the comorbid problems including daytime sleepiness, hallucinations, and psychosis, are reviewed elsewhere.

The timing of this decision varies greatly among patients but is influenced by a number of factors, including [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pharmacologic-treatment-of-parkinson-disease/abstract/1-3\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-3</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The effect of disease on the dominant hand</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The degree to which the disease interferes with work, activities of daily living, or social and leisure function</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The presence of significant bradykinesia or gait disturbance</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patient values and preferences regarding the use of medications</p><p/><p>The major drugs available for the treatment of PD motor symptoms include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Levodopa</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Dopamine agonists</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Monoamine oxidase (MAO) B inhibitors</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Anticholinergic agents</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><a href=\"topic.htm?path=amantadine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Amantadine</a></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Catechol-O-methyl transferase (COMT) inhibitors</p><p/><p>The following general principles can be used to guide the choice of therapy in symptomatic PD:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Levodopa is the most effective drug for the symptomatic treatment of PD and is the drug of first choice if symptoms, particularly those related to bradykinesia, become intrusive or troublesome. In addition, levodopa should be introduced when akinetic symptoms become disabling for patients receiving other antiparkinsonian drugs. (See <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Levodopa'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The dopamine agonists may be employed either as monotherapy in early PD or in combination with other antiparkinsonian drugs for treatment of more advanced disease. They are ineffective in patients who show no response to levodopa. While dopamine agonists possibly delay the need to initiate levodopa therapy, their use is associated with an increased risk of impulse control disorders. (See <a href=\"#H14\" class=\"local\">'Dopamine agonists'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Either levodopa or a dopamine agonist can be used initially for patients who require symptomatic therapy for PD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pharmacologic-treatment-of-parkinson-disease/abstract/2,4\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,4</a>]. Given the potential that dopamine agonists may be associated with fewer motor fluctuations than levodopa, and the evidence that there is a higher incidence of levodopa-related dyskinesia in young-onset PD, it is reasonable to start therapy with a dopamine agonist in younger patients (age &lt;65 years), and with levodopa in older patients (age &ge;65 years). In practice, while symptoms can be controlled initially with dopamine agonists, few patients with progressive disease can be satisfactorily maintained on dopamine agonist monotherapy for more than a few years before levodopa is needed.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The MAO B inhibitors <a href=\"topic.htm?path=selegiline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">selegiline</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=rasagiline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">rasagiline</a> may be useful in patients with early PD but have only modest symptomatic benefit as monotherapy. (See <a href=\"#H204333\" class=\"local\">'MAO B inhibitors'</a> below.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Anticholinergic drugs are most useful as monotherapy in patients under 70 years of age with disturbing tremor who do not have significant bradykinesia or gait disturbance. They also may be useful in patients with more advanced disease who have persistent tremor despite treatment with levodopa or dopamine agonists. Their use in older or demented individuals and those without tremor is strongly discouraged. (See <a href=\"#H25\" class=\"local\">'Anticholinergics'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><a href=\"topic.htm?path=amantadine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Amantadine</a> is a relatively weak antiparkinsonian drug with low toxicity that is most useful in treating younger patients with early or mild PD and perhaps later when dyskinesia becomes problematic. However, toxic side effects are more likely in older patients. (See <a href=\"#H28\" class=\"local\">'Amantadine'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Low-dose estrogen may be helpful as adjunctive therapy in postmenopausal women (See <a href=\"#H31\" class=\"local\">'Estrogen'</a> below.).</p><p/><p>There are exceptions to these general rules, and all treatments for PD should be individualized. Practitioners should always try to find the lowest but still effective dose of dopaminergic medication, either singly or in combination, for patients with PD, each of whom must be evaluated and managed in a highly individual way.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Swallowing restrictions</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Most patients with PD can go without antiparkinson medications for a brief period (ie, &lt;24 hours) when oral intake is temporarily restricted (eg, when perioperative or periprocedural), or when seriously ill. In patients who are critically ill and bedbound, the parkinsonian symptoms are typically overshadowed by the burden of other medical problems, and antiparkinson medications may not provide any clear benefit. However, sudden withdrawal or dose reduction of antiparkinson medications can rarely precipitate the parkinsonism-hyperpyrexia syndrome. (See <a href=\"#H6332055\" class=\"local\">'Parkinsonism-hyperpyrexia syndrome'</a> below.)</p><p>When treatment is still desired for patients who are restricted to take nothing by mouth (nil per os; NPO), options include transdermal <a href=\"topic.htm?path=rotigotine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">rotigotine</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=apomorphine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">apomorphine</a> by injection or continuous infusion. The use of apomorphine requires a test dose prior to ongoing treatment (see <a href=\"#H14\" class=\"local\">'Dopamine agonists'</a> below). For patients with a nasogastric feeding tube, levodopa tablets can be crushed and given through the tube [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pharmacologic-treatment-of-parkinson-disease/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. For patients with dysphagia, orally disintegrating <a href=\"topic.htm?path=carbidopa-and-levodopa-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">carbidopa-levodopa</a> (Parcopa) is a potential treatment option. (See <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Formulations'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6332055\"><span class=\"h2\">Parkinsonism-hyperpyrexia syndrome</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There have been reports of patients with PD who developed neuroleptic malignant syndrome in the context of sudden withdrawal or dose reductions of levodopa or dopamine agonists, and rarely <a href=\"topic.htm?path=amantadine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">amantadine</a>, as well as with switching from one agent to another. In this context, the condition has been termed the parkinsonism-hyperpyrexia syndrome (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=neuroleptic-malignant-syndrome#H6\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Neuroleptic malignant syndrome&quot;, section on 'Antiparkinson medication withdrawal'</a>). Prompt recognition and treatment are important, as severe cases and even fatalities have been reported [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pharmacologic-treatment-of-parkinson-disease/abstract/6,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,7</a>].</p><p>Management of parkinsonism-hyperpyrexia syndrome involves replacing antiparkinson medications at the dose that was used prior to the onset of the syndrome [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pharmacologic-treatment-of-parkinson-disease/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. Levodopa and dopamine agonists can be given orally or via nasogastric tube. Levodopa can also be given intravenously (50 to 100 mg infused over three hours, repeated four times daily) if both oral and nasogastric feeding are contraindicated; options for dopamine agonists include transdermal <a href=\"topic.htm?path=rotigotine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">rotigotine</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=apomorphine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">apomorphine</a> by injection or continuous infusion. The use of apomorphine requires a test dose prior to ongoing treatment. (See <a href=\"#H14\" class=\"local\">'Dopamine agonists'</a> below.)</p><p>In addition to replacing antiparkinson medications, patients with significant hyperthermia and rigidity should be admitted to an intensive care unit setting and undergo aggressive supportive care as well as monitoring for potential dysautonomia and other complications (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=neuroleptic-malignant-syndrome#H25\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Neuroleptic malignant syndrome&quot;, section on 'Supportive care'</a>). For patients with severe symptoms who do not respond to restarting antiparkinson medications and supportive care within the first day or two, additional though unproven measures to consider include the use of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dantrolene-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">dantrolene</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=bromocriptine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">bromocriptine</a>, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> <a href=\"topic.htm?path=amantadine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">amantadine</a>.

It is particularly effective for the management of bradykinetic symptoms and should be introduced when these become intrusive or troublesome or are uncontrolled by other antiparkinsonian drugs. Tremor and rigidity can also respond to levodopa therapy, but postural instability is less likely to do so.</p><p>As noted previously (see <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Symptomatic therapy'</a> above), either levodopa or a dopamine agonist can be used initially for patients who require symptomatic therapy for PD. It is reasonable to initiate therapy with a dopamine agonist in younger patients (age &lt;65 years), and with levodopa in older patients (age &gt;65 years). However, there are exceptions to these general rules, and all treatments should be individualized. Levodopa is the drug of choice if symptoms, particularly those related to bradykinesia, seriously threaten the patient's lifestyle. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Formulations</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Levodopa is combined with a peripheral decarboxylase inhibitor to block its conversion to dopamine in the systemic circulation and liver (before it crosses the blood-brain barrier) in order to prevent nausea, vomiting, and orthostatic hypotension. In the United States, the decarboxylase inhibitor is <a href=\"topic.htm?path=carbidopa-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">carbidopa</a>. The combination drug <a href=\"topic.htm?path=carbidopa-and-levodopa-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">carbidopa-levodopa</a> (immediate-release Sinemet) is available in tablets of <span class=\"nowrap\">10/100,</span> <span class=\"nowrap\">25/100,</span> and <span class=\"nowrap\">25/250</span> mg, with the numerator referring to carbidopa and the denominator referring to the levodopa dose. An immediate-release formulation of carbidopa-levodopa (Parcopa) is available that dissolves on the tongue and can be taken without water [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pharmacologic-treatment-of-parkinson-disease/abstract/9,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,10</a>]; its time of onset of action is not different from Sinemet.</p><p>In some countries, benserazide is the peripheral decarboxylase inhibitor. The combination drug benserazide-levodopa (Madopar or Prolopa) is available in <span class=\"nowrap\">25/100</span> and <span class=\"nowrap\">50/200</span> mg tablets. In many countries, both <a href=\"topic.htm?path=carbidopa-and-levodopa-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">carbidopa-levodopa</a> (eg, Sinemet) and benserazide-levodopa (eg, Prolopa) are marketed.</p><p>Controlled-release formulations of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=carbidopa-and-levodopa-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">carbidopa-levodopa</a> and benserazide-levodopa are available as Sinemet CR and Madopar HBS, respectively. Compared with regular levodopa, the absorption of the controlled-release formulations is approximately 70 percent. An extended-release capsule formulation (Rytary in the US; Numient in Europe) contains microbeads of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=carbidopa-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">carbidopa</a> and levodopa in a 1:4 ratio that, after dissolving, are absorbed in the gastrointestinal tract at different rates [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pharmacologic-treatment-of-parkinson-disease/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Dosing</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Treatment should begin with small doses, such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=carbidopa-and-levodopa-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">carbidopa-levodopa</a> (Sinemet) <span class=\"nowrap\">25/100</span> mg, one-half tablet two to three times daily with meals. Tolerance for the appropriate starting dose must be assessed individually. Once initiated without side effects, the total daily dose of carbidopa-levodopa can be titrated carefully upward over several weeks to a full tablet of <span class=\"nowrap\">25/100</span> mg three times daily as tolerated. Older adults or those with dementia should begin with smaller doses and slower titration because of their increased susceptibility to psychiatric side effects.</p><p>The usual practice is to titrate to the lowest levodopa dose that produces a useful clinical response. This varies from patient to patient, but at the start it is typically in the vicinity of 300 to 600 mg of levodopa daily. The vast majority of patients with idiopathic PD will enjoy a significant therapeutic response to moderate doses of levodopa (300 to 600 mg daily). Complete absence of response to a levodopa dose of 1000 to 1500 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day</span> suggests that the original diagnosis of PD may be incorrect and that one of the other parkinsonian syndromes, such as multiple system atrophy, progressive supranuclear palsy, or vascular parkinsonism should be considered. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diagnosis-and-differential-diagnosis-of-parkinson-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Diagnosis and differential diagnosis of Parkinson disease&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Levodopa should <strong>not</strong> be stopped abruptly because sudden withdrawal has been associated (rarely) with a syndrome resembling neuroleptic malignant syndrome or akinetic crisis (see <a href=\"#H6332055\" class=\"local\">'Parkinsonism-hyperpyrexia syndrome'</a> above).</p><p>Controlled or sustained release levodopa preparations are less completely absorbed and require a dose up to 30 percent higher to achieve an equivalent clinical effect. The peak clinical effect of each tablet is typically less than for immediate release preparations, since controlled release formulations reach the brain more slowly over time. This presents a disadvantage in assessing the response of patients just initiating therapy. As a result, it is recommended that therapy be started with an immediate release preparation with a subsequent switch to controlled release if desired for convenience purposes. Both the immediate and the controlled release formulations appear to maintain a similar level of symptom control after several years of use [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pharmacologic-treatment-of-parkinson-disease/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>].</p><p>Patients taking levodopa for the first time should take each dose with a meal or snack to avoid nausea, a common early side effect. Patients with more advanced disease, especially those with motor fluctuations, often notice that a dose of levodopa is more effective if taken on an empty stomach 30 minutes before or one hour after meals due to reduced competition with other amino acids for gastrointestinal absorption.</p><p>Small starting doses of levodopa of less than <span class=\"nowrap\">25/100</span> mg three times daily combined with a decarboxylase inhibitor (eg, Sinemet, Madopar, or Prolopa) are more likely to cause nausea because of inadequate amounts of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=carbidopa-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">carbidopa</a>; this can be managed by administering supplemental doses of carbidopa or by use of antiemetics such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=trimethobenzamide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">trimethobenzamide</a> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=domperidone-united-states-available-via-fda-investigational-drug-ind-protocol-only-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">domperidone</a> (not available in the United States) taken prior to Sinemet. Phenothiazine antiemetics such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prochlorperazine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">prochlorperazine</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=metoclopramide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">metoclopramide</a> should be avoided because they are dopamine receptor blockers that can aggravate parkinsonian symptoms.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Adverse effects</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Nausea, somnolence, dizziness, and headache are among the more common early side effects that may accompany treatment with levodopa, but they are not likely to be serious in most patients. More serious adverse reactions to levodopa (mainly in older patients) may include confusion, hallucinations, delusions, agitation, psychosis, and orthostatic hypotension.</p><p>Levodopa may also induce a mild to moderate elevation in serum homocysteine levels [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pharmacologic-treatment-of-parkinson-disease/abstract/13-16\" class=\"abstract_t\">13-16</a>], which in turn may be associated with an increased risk of hip fractures in older adults. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=osteoporotic-fracture-risk-assessment#H27\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Osteoporotic fracture risk assessment&quot;, section on 'Possible risk factors'</a>.)</p><p>In addition, there is accumulating evidence suggesting that levodopa exposure in patients with idiopathic PD is associated with low serum levels of vitamin B12, elevated methylmalonic acid levels, and a higher than expected incidence of sensorimotor peripheral neuropathy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pharmacologic-treatment-of-parkinson-disease/abstract/17-20\" class=\"abstract_t\">17-20</a>].</p><p>Compulsive dopaminergic drug use has been reported in patients taking dopamine agonists, typically in conjunction with levodopa therapy. However, it is unclear that these behavioral issues arise with any frequency with levodopa monotherapy.

These include motor fluctuations (the wearing-off phenomenon), involuntary movements known as dyskinesia, abnormal cramps and postures of the extremities and trunk known as dystonia, and a variety of complex fluctuations in motor function [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pharmacologic-treatment-of-parkinson-disease/abstract/21,22\" class=\"abstract_t\">21,22</a>]. It is estimated that such motor complications occur in at least 50 percent of patients after 5 to 10 years of treatment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pharmacologic-treatment-of-parkinson-disease/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=motor-fluctuations-and-dyskinesia-in-parkinson-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Motor fluctuations and dyskinesia in Parkinson disease&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The risk of motor complications increases with a younger age at PD onset and with higher levodopa doses, as supported by the following reports:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In the large group of patients with early PD studied in the DATATOP study, motor complications occurred in 30 percent after only two years of treatment with levodopa [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pharmacologic-treatment-of-parkinson-disease/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. However, in a study of early PD, the prevalence of motor complications was only 20 percent after five years of treatment with levodopa given in relatively low doses [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pharmacologic-treatment-of-parkinson-disease/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Several observational studies have noted that motor complications are more common in patients with young-onset PD compared with older onset [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pharmacologic-treatment-of-parkinson-disease/abstract/25,26\" class=\"abstract_t\">25,26</a>]. As an example, in a population-based study that compared patients who were 40 to 59 years of age at PD onset with those who were older than 70 years of age at PD onset, the corresponding five-year incidence of dyskinesia was 50 versus 16 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pharmacologic-treatment-of-parkinson-disease/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In an analysis of data from the STRIDE-PD study, the strongest risk factors for the development of dyskinesia and wearing-off phenomenon were young age at onset and higher levodopa doses [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pharmacologic-treatment-of-parkinson-disease/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Retrospective data from a study of the effect of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pramipexole-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">pramipexole</a> and levodopa on early PD (the CALM-PD study) suggest that the earlier occurrence of motor fluctuations in the course of PD is associated with higher cumulative levodopa doses and higher cumulative levodopa-equivalent doses (ie, levodopa plus the dopamine agonist pramipexole) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pharmacologic-treatment-of-parkinson-disease/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. In contrast, prospective data from the same study suggest that a later onset of motor fluctuations in PD is associated with initial treatment with pramipexole rather than levodopa [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pharmacologic-treatment-of-parkinson-disease/abstract/29,30\" class=\"abstract_t\">29,30</a>]. The authors concluded that &quot;higher doses of dopaminergic medications than necessary to effectively control parkinsonian symptoms should be avoided,&quot; but noted that some patients with worse (ie, more rapidly progressive) disease may require high doses of dopaminergic medications to manage symptoms and therefore may be at greater risk for the development of motor complications [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pharmacologic-treatment-of-parkinson-disease/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. However, they noted that motor complications do not necessarily cause clinically significant functional impairment and can potentially be managed.</p><p/><p>Despite these reports, there is increasing evidence that the choice of initial therapy for PD, whether levodopa, dopamine agonist, or monoamine oxidase (MAO) B inhibitor, has little impact on the long-term outcome of PD in terms of motor fluctuations and dyskinesia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pharmacologic-treatment-of-parkinson-disease/abstract/31-33\" class=\"abstract_t\">31-33</a>].</p><p>The increase in motor fluctuations over time is most likely due to progressive degeneration of nigrostriatal dopamine terminals, which increasingly limits the normal physiologic uptake and release of dopamine, thereby leading to reduced buffering of the natural fluctuations in plasma levodopa levels that occur due to its 90-minute pharmacologic half-life [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pharmacologic-treatment-of-parkinson-disease/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Controlled release preparations can be useful for management of these fluctuations, though on occasion the less predictable onset of effect with controlled release levodopa makes motor fluctuations more difficult to control. In one report, the use of Sinemet CR three times daily (in an effort to provide more continuous stimulation of dopamine receptors) from the start of therapy was not associated with fewer motor complications compared with immediate release Sinemet [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pharmacologic-treatment-of-parkinson-disease/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>].</p><p>There has been longstanding concern among some clinicians that levodopa causes motor fluctuations and dyskinesia by its potential to promote oxidative stress and accelerated neurodegeneration, rather than by the change in levodopa pharmacodynamics that occurs with natural progression of the underlying disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pharmacologic-treatment-of-parkinson-disease/abstract/34,35\" class=\"abstract_t\">34,35</a>]. Therefore, it is commonly proposed that the initiation of levodopa be delayed until symptoms significantly interfere with function. Others contend, however, that there is no convincing evidence that levodopa is itself responsible for late motor complications, and that delay of treatment unnecessarily deprives patients of therapeutic benefit early in the disease, when the potential for sustained improvement is greatest [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pharmacologic-treatment-of-parkinson-disease/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>].</p><p>Given these data, practitioners should always try to find the lowest but still effective dose of dopaminergic medication, either singly or in combination, for patients with PD, each of whom must be evaluated and managed according to his or her individual needs.</p><p>Acute akinesia is a sudden exacerbation of PD characterized by an akinetic state that lasts for several days and does not respond to treatment with antiparkinson medication. This phenomenon is very different from the more common wearing &quot;off&quot; effects and is discussed separately.

Another more compelling reason for delaying the use of levodopa is to possibly postpone the appearance of motor complications such as dyskinesia and motor fluctuations.

However, the hypothetical concern that free radicals generated by the oxidative metabolism of dopamine contribute further to the degeneration of dopaminergic neurons has prompted some investigators, despite lack of conclusive evidence, to advocate the early use of DAs as an levodopa-sparing strategy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pharmacologic-treatment-of-parkinson-disease/abstract/50,51\" class=\"abstract_t\">50,51</a>].</p><p>With this approach, treatment with levodopa can be postponed and saved for a later time in the course of the disease, when disability worsens and the less effective agonists no longer provide adequate benefit.

Amantadine is of little benefit when added to levodopa, although the addition of levodopa to amantadine causes significant additive improvement [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pharmacologic-treatment-of-parkinson-disease/abstract/123\" class=\"abstract_t\">123</a>].</p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=amantadine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Amantadine</a> in divided doses of 200 to 400 mg a day may reduce the intensity of levodopa-related dyskinesia and motor fluctuations in patients with PD.

Furthermore, a randomized controlled trial of 56 patients with PD and levodopa-related dyskinesia found that withdrawal compared with continuation of amantadine led to significant worsening of dyskinesia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pharmacologic-treatment-of-parkinson-disease/abstract/125\" class=\"abstract_t\">125</a>].

It is reasonable to initiate therapy with a dopamine agonist in younger patients (age &lt;65 years), and with levodopa in older patients (age &gt;65 years). However, there are exceptions to these general rules, and all treatments should be individualized. Levodopa is the drug of choice if symptoms, particularly those related to bradykinesia, seriously threaten the patient's lifestyle. Practitioners should always try to find the lowest but still effective dose of dopaminergic medication, either singly or in combination, for patients with PD, each of whom must be evaluated and managed in a highly individual way. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Symptomatic therapy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Levodopa (combined with a peripheral decarboxylase inhibitor, ie, Sinemet, Madopar, or Prolopa) is the most effective symptomatic therapy for PD and should be introduced when the patient and physician jointly decide that quality of life, particularly related to job performance or self-care, is substantially compromised. However, levodopa is associated with a higher risk of dyskinesia than the dopamine agonists. There does not appear to be a benefit of initiating treatment with controlled release levodopa compared with the immediate release preparation, and the former may limit the ability to follow the initial response to therapy. As a result, it is recommended that therapy be initiated with an immediate release preparation with a subsequent switch to controlled release if indicated. (See <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Levodopa'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>With the exception of pergolide and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cabergoline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cabergoline</a>, the dopamine agonists are a useful group of drugs that may be employed either as monotherapy in early PD or in combination with other antiparkinsonian drugs for treatment of more advanced disease. They are ineffective in patients who show no response to levodopa. They possibly delay the need to initiate levodopa therapy and the subsequent appearance of levodopa dyskinesia and motor fluctuations, but at the risk of slightly less efficacy and increased adverse effects. (See <a href=\"#H14\" class=\"local\">'Dopamine agonists'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><a href=\"topic.htm?path=selegiline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Selegiline</a> has mild symptomatic benefit, and it may be used in patients with early PD. Its use should be limited to patients with early disease since the symptomatic benefits are unlikely to be significant in those with more advanced PD. Nevertheless, patients should understand that there may not be much symptomatic improvement if selegiline is the initial treatment for early PD, and early follow-up and consideration of additional symptomatic therapy should be arranged. The value of selegiline for neuroprotection is unclear. (See <a href=\"#H204333\" class=\"local\">'MAO B inhibitors'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><a href=\"topic.htm?path=rasagiline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Rasagiline</a> is a monoamine oxidase (MAO) B inhibitor that has been demonstrated in randomized trials to produce a statistically significant benefit as monotherapy in PD. However, it is uncertain whether it also produces a clinically meaningful benefit that is evident to the patient. (See <a href=\"#H204333\" class=\"local\">'MAO B inhibitors'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Anticholinergic drugs should be reserved for younger patients in whom tremor is the predominant problem. Their use in older or demented individuals and those without tremor is strongly discouraged. <a href=\"topic.htm?path=amantadine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Amantadine</a> is a relatively weak antiparkinsonian drug with low toxicity that is most useful in treating patients with early or mild PD and perhaps later when dyskinesia becomes problematic.
