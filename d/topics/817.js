Endometrial ablation has become an increasingly popular treatment, since it is minimally invasive and successful ablation avoids chronic use of medications. In a national study in England from 2003 to 2006, 60 percent of all surgical procedures performed for menorrhagia were endometrial ablations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/an-overview-of-endometrial-ablation/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p>Endometrial ablation is the surgical destruction of the uterine lining. This can be accomplished under hysteroscopic visualization, using resectoscopic instruments to ablate or resect the endometrium. It can also be performed with a non-resectoscopic ablation device, which is inserted into the uterine cavity and delivers energy to uniformly destroy the uterine lining. Non-resectoscopic endometrial ablation techniques are more widely practiced than resectoscopic ablation, since they require less specialized training and often have a shorter operative time [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/an-overview-of-endometrial-ablation/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Endometrial ablation is not appropriate for women with endometrial hyperplasia or cancer, or those who wish to preserve their fertility.</p><p>This topic review will provide an overview of endometrial ablation. Techniques for non-resectoscopic endometrial ablation and resectoscopic endometrial ablation or resection, as well as other management options for abnormal uterine bleeding, are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=endometrial-ablation-non-resectoscopic-techniques\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Endometrial ablation: Non-resectoscopic techniques&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=endometrial-ablation-or-resection-resectoscopic-techniques\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Endometrial ablation or resection: Resectoscopic techniques&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-abnormal-uterine-bleeding\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of abnormal uterine bleeding&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">TERMINOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Terminology used to describe endometrial ablation varies. In this topic review, the following terms will be used:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Endometrial ablation &ndash; Surgical destruction of the endometrium. The endometrium must be destroyed or resected to the level of the basalis (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F54487\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef54487 \">figure 1</a>), which is approximately 4 to 6 mm deep, depending upon the stage of the menstrual cycle. In this topic review, endometrial ablation will refer to either non-resectoscopic ablation or resectoscopic ablation, or resection of the endometrium.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Non-resectoscopic endometrial ablation &ndash; Endometrial ablation is performed with a disposable device which is inserted into the uterine cavity and delivers energy to uniformly destroy the uterine lining. Current non-resectoscopic technologies approved for use in the United States by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) are bipolar radiofrequency (NovaSure), hot liquid-filled balloon (ThermaChoice), cryotherapy (Her Option), circulating hot water (Hydro ThermAblator), microwave (Microwave Endometrial Ablation), and, in 2015, a combined thermal and bipolar radiofrequency (Minerva). These techniques are also referred to as global or second generation ablation.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Resectoscopic endometrial ablation &ndash; Endometrial ablation or resection performed under hysteroscopic visualization with resectoscopic electrosurgical instruments (eg, rollerball, wire loop, vaporizing electrode) or with laser. Endometrial resection is often referred to as transcervical resection of the endometrium. Resectoscopic ablation methods are also referred to as standard or first generation ablation. The term hysteroscopic ablation is also sometimes used for these methods; however, this designation would also include the circulating hot water non-resectoscopic technique, since it involves instilling water through a hysteroscope.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">PATIENT SELECTION</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Indications</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The primary indication for endometrial ablation is treatment of ovulatory menorrhagia in premenopausal women. Ablation in women with anovulatory bleeding or postmenopausal women is discussed below (see <a href=\"#H12\" class=\"local\">'Risk factors for endometrial cancer'</a> below).</p><p>Ablation is usually used to treat women with chronic menorrhagia. It may also be used for acute abnormal uterine bleeding in hemodynamically stable women in whom medical therapy is contraindicated or unsuccessful. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=managing-an-episode-of-severe-or-prolonged-uterine-bleeding#H28\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Managing an episode of severe or prolonged uterine bleeding&quot;, section on 'Endometrial ablation'</a>.)</p><p>Endometrial ablation is not indicated for women who wish to be amenorrheic for nonmedical reasons; in fact, many women do not develop amenorrhea after ablation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/an-overview-of-endometrial-ablation/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H41\" class=\"local\">'Improvement in bleeding symptoms'</a> below and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hormonal-contraception-for-suppression-of-menstruation\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Hormonal contraception for suppression of menstruation&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Contraindications</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Endometrial ablation is contraindicated in women with the following conditions or characteristics [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/an-overview-of-endometrial-ablation/abstract/3,4\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,4</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pregnancy</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Known or suspected endometrial hyperplasia or cancer</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Desire to preserve fertility</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Active pelvic infection</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Intrauterine device (IUD) in place</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Previous transmyometrial uterine surgery</p><p/><p>Endometrial ablation is also relatively contraindicated in women who are postmenopausal, have congenital uterine anomalies (eg, bicornuate uterus), have a uterine cavity length that is greater than 10 to 12 cm, or have severe myometrial thinning.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h3\">Endometrial hyperplasia or cancer</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Heavy menstrual bleeding is an indication for endometrial ablation, but may also signify the presence of endometrial hyperplasia or cancer. Therefore, endometrial sampling should be performed in all women prior to undergoing endometrial ablation. (See <a href=\"#H22\" class=\"local\">'Endometrial sampling'</a> below.)</p><p>Endometrial ablation is not a treatment for endometrial hyperplasia or cancer and may interfere with subsequent evaluation of the endometrium (see <a href=\"#H12\" class=\"local\">'Risk factors for endometrial cancer'</a> below). Thus, endometrial ablation is not appropriate in women with these conditions. This position is consistent with the recommendation of the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) that women with endometrial hyperplasia or uterine cancer should not undergo endometrial ablation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/an-overview-of-endometrial-ablation/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h3\">Desire to preserve fertility</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Pregnancy is contraindicated following endometrial ablation since the destruction of the endometrium may result in abnormal implantation or placentation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/an-overview-of-endometrial-ablation/abstract/5,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,6</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H56\" class=\"local\">'Pregnancy after ablation'</a> below.)</p><p>Endometrial ablation does not prevent pregnancy. Women must be counseled that contraception will be necessary following the procedure. Some women choose to undergo concomitant ablation and sterilization. (See <a href=\"#H448471\" class=\"local\">'Sterilization'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h3\">Uterine anomalies</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Endometrial ablation should generally be avoided in women with congenital anomalies of the uterus (eg, septum, unicornuate uterus). There are case reports of non-resectoscopic ablation in women with a bicornuate uterus, but this is not standard practice [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/an-overview-of-endometrial-ablation/abstract/7,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,8</a>]. Some surgeons with advanced hysteroscopic skills may be able to safely and successfully perform ablation in women with these abnormalities using resectoscopic techniques.</p><p>Acute retro- or anteflexion or retro- or anteversion of the uterus are not contraindications to endometrial ablation. In women with these uterine characteristics, incomplete ablation may result if the fundus cannot be reached with a non-resectoscopic ablation device. Thus, resectoscopic ablation may be preferable in this population.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h3\">Myometrial thinning following uterine surgery</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Endometrial ablation in women with thinning of the myometrium may result in injury to the adjacent viscera (bladder, bowel) if the energy used for ablation passes through the uterine tissue [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/an-overview-of-endometrial-ablation/abstract/4,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,9</a>]. There are no data to establish the minimum myometrial thickness required to prevent such complications.</p><p>Attenuation of the myometrium is usually due to a prior uterine surgery (eg, cesarean delivery, myomectomy). There is no evidence that prior cesarean delivery increases the risk of complications associated with endometrial ablation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/an-overview-of-endometrial-ablation/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. As an example, one retrospective cohort study found no difference in operative complication or efficacy in women who had one or more cesarean deliveries compared with other women [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/an-overview-of-endometrial-ablation/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. Myometrial thickness was not measured. </p><p>When microwave ablation was first introduced in Europe, there were reports of thermal injury to adjacent structures in women with no uterine perforation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/an-overview-of-endometrial-ablation/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. For this reason, instructions for use of the manufacturer of the Microwave Endometrial Ablation system advise a minimum myometrial thickness of 10 mm as documented by ultrasound. While measurement of myometrial thickness is not a requirement for the other four non-resectoscopic ablation devices, surgeons should use clinical judgment to assess the risk of thermal injury when offering non-resectoscopic endometrial ablation to a patient with a history of cesarean delivery or transmural myomectomy. Evaluation of myometrial thickness is discussed below (see <a href=\"#H21\" class=\"local\">'Uterine evaluation'</a> below).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h3\">Postmenopausal women</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>We suggest not performing endometrial ablation in postmenopausal women. Endometrial ablation has been described in this population, mostly in women with persistent bleeding while on postmenopausal hormone therapy. Prospective series have reported no cases of endometrial cancer in women who underwent endometrial ablation after menopause; however, these studies included fewer than 50 women and most patients were followed for less than five years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/an-overview-of-endometrial-ablation/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>].</p><p>Excluding malignancy is the primary objective in the diagnostic evaluation of women with postmenopausal bleeding. As discussed below, diagnosis of endometrial cancer may be more difficult following endometrial ablation (see <a href=\"#H12\" class=\"local\">'Risk factors for endometrial cancer'</a> below). Bleeding in postmenopausal women due to benign causes is often managed expectantly or the specific etiology is treated (eg, removal of an endometrial polyp, use of a continuous rather than a cyclic regimen for hormone therapy). Given these other options, it does not appear that the benefit of endometrial ablation outweighs the risk of a missed diagnosis of endometrial cancer in postmenopausal women. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=postmenopausal-uterine-bleeding\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Postmenopausal uterine bleeding&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=preparations-for-menopausal-hormone-therapy#H224187455\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Preparations for menopausal hormone therapy&quot;, section on 'Continuous combined regimens'</a>.)</p><p>United States professional organizations also do not support the use of endometrial ablation in postmenopausal women. The American Society for Reproductive Medicine advised that endometrial ablation is not indicated for postmenopausal women and ACOG states that it has not been rigorously studied in this population [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/an-overview-of-endometrial-ablation/abstract/4,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,14</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h2\">Special considerations</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In women with certain characteristics, endometrial ablation may not be as safe or effective as other therapeutic options. These include women with risk factors for endometrial cancer or with certain uterine characteristics or pathology (eg, submucosal leiomyomas, adenomyosis, large cavity size).</p><p>Current FDA labeling recommends that endometrial ablation NOT be performed concomitantly with hysteroscopic tubal sterilization (Essure or Adiana) due to concerns that uterine synechiae formed following endometrial ablation will interfere with the ability to perform a hysterosalpingogram to confirm tubal occlusion. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hysteroscopic-sterilization#H9272913\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Hysteroscopic sterilization&quot;, section on 'Endometrial ablation'</a>.) </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h3\">Risk factors for endometrial cancer</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The safety of endometrial ablation has not been well studied in women who do not currently have endometrial neoplasia, but are at an increased risk of developing endometrial cancer (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F62089\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef62089 \">table 1</a>). The concern is whether endometrial scarring caused by ablation would obscure symptoms and decrease the efficacy of endometrial sampling. Ablation itself does not appear to increase the risk of subsequent endometrial cancer [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/an-overview-of-endometrial-ablation/abstract/15,16\" class=\"abstract_t\">15,16</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=endometrial-carcinoma-epidemiology-and-risk-factors#H2\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Endometrial carcinoma: Epidemiology and risk factors&quot;, section on 'Risk factors'</a>.)</p><p>Endometrial ablation introduces obstacles to the detection and diagnosis of endometrial neoplasia. Ablation results in intrauterine adhesions that may prevent or delay the bleeding that is the cardinal symptom of endometrial cancer <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> interfere with endometrial sampling [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/an-overview-of-endometrial-ablation/abstract/16-30\" class=\"abstract_t\">16-30</a>]. In addition, histologic evaluation of endometrial samples from women who have undergone ablation may be difficult [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/an-overview-of-endometrial-ablation/abstract/28-32\" class=\"abstract_t\">28-32</a>]. There are no data regarding the sonographic appearance of the endometrium in postmenopausal women following endometrial ablation. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-of-the-endometrium-for-malignant-or-premalignant-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation of the endometrium for malignant or premalignant disease&quot;</a>.)</p><p>There is no evidence of an increased risk of endometrial cancer after ablation. There are few data to address this issue, and the best available data are from a population-based study of 1997 to 2014 nationwide data from Finland that compared 5484 women who underwent endometrial ablation with controls; mean follow-up was 7.3 years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/an-overview-of-endometrial-ablation/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>]. The age range was 30 to 49 years and mean age at ablation was 42.4&plusmn;4.4 years. In the ablation group, only three women developed endometrial cancer (0.05 percent) and the incidence was lower than among controls (standardized incidence ratio 0.56, 95% CI 0.12-1.64). Two of the cases were early stage and one was unknown stage. The overall rate of endometrial hyperplasia was not reported, but among the 1086 women who underwent hysterectomy after ablation, hyperplasia was the indication in 20 (1.8 percent). These women were likely selected according to usual indications and contraindications for the procedure, and thus this does not change the advice to avoid ablation in women with risk factors for endometrial cancer. It is somewhat reassuring that the endometrial cancers were detected at an early stage, but there were so few events that more study is needed regarding whether ablation results in a delay in diagnosis. </p><p>Many of the other reports of endometrial cancer after endometrial ablation have been in women with chronic anovulation <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> endometrial hyperplasia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/an-overview-of-endometrial-ablation/abstract/17,19,34\" class=\"abstract_t\">17,19,34</a>]. Women with these conditions are also often obese or have diabetes <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> hypertension and thus may have contraindications to some medical therapies (eg, steroid hormones, antifibrinolytics) and be at increased risk of complications if they undergo major surgery. We suggest that progestin supplementation be offered to prevent hyperplasia until ovulation is reestablished or menopause occurs in the presence of chronic anovulatory states.</p><p>Correction of anovulation is the optimal approach to treatment for these women. In women in whom this is not possible, other treatment options (eg, progestins) may be preferable to endometrial ablation. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-abnormal-uterine-bleeding\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of abnormal uterine bleeding&quot;</a>.) </p><p>There are few data regarding endometrial ablation in women taking <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tamoxifen-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">tamoxifen</a>, and there are no studies with long-term follow-up [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/an-overview-of-endometrial-ablation/abstract/35-37\" class=\"abstract_t\">35-37</a>]. We suggest <strong>not</strong> performing endometrial ablation in women who are taking tamoxifen. Such women are at an increased risk of endometrial cancer, and ablation may interfere with the later diagnosis of this disorder. In addition, endometrial ablation is not necessary for tamoxifen-induced bleeding, which will resolve after the cessation of tamoxifen therapy. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=abnormal-uterine-bleeding-and-uterine-pathology-in-women-on-tamoxifen-therapy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Abnormal uterine bleeding and uterine pathology in women on tamoxifen therapy&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Women with Lynch syndrome (hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer) are at a markedly increased risk of endometrial cancer and are advised to undergo hysterectomy after they have completed childbearing. Thus, abnormal uterine bleeding in this population should not be treated with endometrial ablation. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=endometrial-and-ovarian-cancer-screening-and-prevention-in-women-with-lynch-syndrome-hereditary-nonpolyposis-colorectal-cancer\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Endometrial and ovarian cancer screening and prevention in women with Lynch syndrome (hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer)&quot;</a>.)</p><p>In the absence of high-quality data, the decision to perform endometrial ablation in women with risk factors for endometrial cancer depends mainly upon three factors: the degree to which endometrial ablation may limit future diagnosis of malignancy, the magnitude of the risk of endometrial cancer, and the feasibility of other therapeutic options.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4181526251\"><span class=\"h3\">Obesity</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There are few data about endometrial ablation in obese women. In one study, 968 women underwent endometrial ablation for abnormal uterine bleeding (AUB) with an etiology that was endometrial (AUB-E) or ovulatory dysfunction (AUB-O) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F90483\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef90483 \">figure 2</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/an-overview-of-endometrial-ablation/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>]. There was no difference in treatment failure or the need for a subsequent gynecologic procedure between groups during three-year follow-up with the exception of obese patients, with higher failure rates in the AUB-E group (16.7 versus 9.8 percent).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h3\">Leiomyomas or polyps</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Endometrial ablation in women with intracavitary (submucosal or intramural myomas that protrude into the uterine cavity) fibroids is controversial. Fibroids are a common etiology of abnormal uterine bleeding. Non-resectoscopic ablation is a technically less challenging procedure than hysteroscopic myomectomy, and surgeons may desire to perform ablation for women with an isolated intracavitary fibroid. However, there is a concern that the presence of a lesion protruding into the uterine cavity may interfere with the function of some ablation devices. </p><p>Endometrial ablation does not treat the fibroid itself; ablation procedures do not remove or shrink fibroids. One study found no histologic effect on leiomyomas following bipolar radiofrequency endometrial ablation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/an-overview-of-endometrial-ablation/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>].</p><p>Non-resectoscopic techniques are not explicitly approved by the FDA for use with submucosal fibroids, although this patient population was included in the approval studies for some of the devices [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/an-overview-of-endometrial-ablation/abstract/40,41\" class=\"abstract_t\">40,41</a>]. Thus, when performing non-resectoscopic ablation in patients with intracavitary fibroids, the surgeon should obtain informed consent regarding off-label use of the device.</p><p>Comparative data show that non-resectoscopic devices are less effective in women with intracavitary fibroids than in those with a normal uterine cavity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/an-overview-of-endometrial-ablation/abstract/42-45\" class=\"abstract_t\">42-45</a>]. As an example, in a retrospective cohort study of women who underwent Hydro ThermAblator procedures, women with submucosal fibroids (1 to 4 cm) compared with controls had significantly higher rates of menorrhagia (12 versus 3 percent) and hysterectomy (12 versus 1 percent) at an average of 5.8 years postoperatively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/an-overview-of-endometrial-ablation/abstract/43\" class=\"abstract_t\">43</a>].</p><p>In contrast, a prospective series of women with fibroids up to 3 cm who underwent bipolar radiofrequency ablation reported that, at one-year follow-up, 95 percent had improvement in uterine bleeding [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/an-overview-of-endometrial-ablation/abstract/46\" class=\"abstract_t\">46</a>]. In addition, hot liquid filled balloon ablation was used successfully in 45 women with submucosal fibroids &le;3 cm in a randomized trial comparing balloon versus rollerball ablation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/an-overview-of-endometrial-ablation/abstract/4,47\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,47</a>].</p><p>Further study is needed to establish which of the non-resectoscopic devices can be used in women with intracavitary fibroids and appropriate criteria for such use.</p><p>Resectoscopic endometrial ablation can usually be performed in women with small intracavitary fibroids, or alternatively, a concomitant hysteroscopic myomectomy may be appropriate (see <a href=\"#H32\" class=\"local\">'Hysteroscopic myomectomy'</a> below).</p><p>Endometrial polyps are more removed prior to endometrial ablation. However, women with endometrial polyps were included in the FDA approval studies for the Microwave Endometrial Ablation device, NovaSure, and Thermachoice hot liquid filled balloon [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/an-overview-of-endometrial-ablation/abstract/41,48,49\" class=\"abstract_t\">41,48,49</a>].

Each non-resectoscopic endometrial ablation device can accommodate a different minimum (4 to 6 cm) and maximum (10 to 12 cm) uterine cavity size. The cavity sizes for each device are listed in the table. Ablation may be incomplete in women with a cavity larger than the maximum.</p><p>Cavity size is less important for resectoscopic ablation, but operative duration, irrigation fluid absorption, and potential blood loss make these methods impractical in women with a uterus larger than 12 weeks size. Successful improvement of uterine bleeding symptoms has been reported following partial ablation with resectoscopic ablation or resection, but not for non-resectoscopic techniques [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/an-overview-of-endometrial-ablation/abstract/50,51\" class=\"abstract_t\">50,51</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15\"><span class=\"h3\">Adenomyosis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Adenomyosis (uterine adenomyomatosis) is not a contraindication to endometrial ablation, although women with this condition may have a lower treatment success rate. A retrospective study of 816 women who were followed for five years after endometrial ablation reported that women with a preoperative ultrasound suggestive of adenomyosis had a 1.7-fold increased risk of subsequent hysterectomy or repeat endometrial ablation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/an-overview-of-endometrial-ablation/abstract/52\" class=\"abstract_t\">52</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H16\"><span class=\"h3\">Parity</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Nulliparity is not a contraindication to endometrial ablation. Grand multiparity appears to be a risk factor for treatment failure. In the retrospective study of 816 women described in the preceding paragraph, women with a parity of &ge;5 compared to &lt;5 had a sixfold increased risk of subsequent repeat endometrial ablation or hysterectomy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/an-overview-of-endometrial-ablation/abstract/52\" class=\"abstract_t\">52</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H17\"><span class=\"h3\">Bleeding disorders or anticoagulation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Coagulopathy due to bleeding disorders or anticoagulant medications is a potential etiology of heavy menstrual bleeding. Most methods of endometrial ablation are appropriate for use in such women. A retrospective cohort study compared 41 women with coagulopathy to 111 women with normal coagulation, all of whom underwent non-resectoscopic endometrial ablation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/an-overview-of-endometrial-ablation/abstract/53\" class=\"abstract_t\">53</a>]. Perioperative complications were infrequent in both groups; hematometra occurred in one woman with coagulopathy and in none of the controls. An average of two years after the procedure, rates of subsequent hysterectomy were similar for women with and without coagulopathy (5 and 7 percent).</p><p>Endometrial resection should be avoided in women who have a bleeding disorder or are taking anticoagulants.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H18\"><span class=\"h1\">PREOPERATIVE EVALUATION</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H19\"><span class=\"h2\">Informed consent</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Women who are considering endometrial ablation should be counseled about other medical, interventional radiologic, and surgical options for treatment. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-abnormal-uterine-bleeding\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of abnormal uterine bleeding&quot;</a>.) It is important to advise women that a successful result is most likely to be a reduction in the volume of uterine bleeding, and amenorrhea is not guaranteed. In addition, endometrial ablation does not regulate bleeding in women with irregular patterns. The risks of persistent or recurrent heavy uterine bleeding and of surgical complications should be reviewed. This discussion should be documented on the surgical consent form and in the medical record (see <a href=\"#H39\" class=\"local\">'Outcome'</a> below and <a href=\"#H33\" class=\"local\">'Complications'</a> below).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H20\"><span class=\"h2\">Evaluation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Preoperative evaluation, including perioperative risk assessment, is the same for endometrial ablation as for hysteroscopy.

Ideally, this should be performed with enough time to receive the results and cancel the procedure, if neoplasia is found. However, if sampling has not yet been performed by the day of the procedure, it should be done just prior to the ablation.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H23\"><span class=\"h3\">Assessment of the uterus</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The uterine cavity should be assessed for the presence of intracavitary myomas, endometrial polyps, or other abnormalities (eg, uterine septum) that may interfere with endometrial ablation (see <a href=\"#H13\" class=\"local\">'Leiomyomas or polyps'</a> above and <a href=\"#H8\" class=\"local\">'Uterine anomalies'</a> above). Some lesions can be removed hysteroscopically on the day of the procedure prior to performing the ablation. Women with a history of transmural uterine surgery (eg, cesarean delivery, myomectomy) should be evaluated for myometrial thinning (see <a href=\"#H9\" class=\"local\">'Myometrial thinning following uterine surgery'</a> above).</p><p>We use saline infusion sonography (SIS) or office hysteroscopy to assess the uterine cavity. TVUS alone can identify uterine lesions, but does not define the contour of the cavity. In women in whom myometrial thinning is suspected, we use SIS.

The goal of endometrial preparation is to thin the endometrium to facilitate tissue destruction. </p><p>Hormonal suppression with a gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) agonist (eg, intramuscular <a href=\"topic.htm?path=leuprolide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">leuprolide</a> 3.75 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/month)</span> is the most commonly used method of endometrial preparation prior to endometrial ablation. Hormonal pretreatment should be initiated 30 to 60 days prior to the procedure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/an-overview-of-endometrial-ablation/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. However, due to the expense, side effects, and delay of surgery, we choose to use ablation techniques that do not require GnRH agonist preoperative thinning (eg, radiofrequency ablation).</p><p>The effectiveness of other hormonal agents for endometrial preparation prior to endometrial ablation is uncertain. Use of progestins (eg, oral <a href=\"topic.htm?path=medroxyprogesterone-acetate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">medroxyprogesterone acetate</a> [MPA] 15 mg daily) instead of GnRH agonists offers the advantage of fewer adverse effects (eg, menopausal symptoms). Randomized trials comparing progestins or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=danazol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">danazol</a> to GnRH agonists have found no difference in postablation improvement in uterine bleeding; however, these trials lacked statistical power [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/an-overview-of-endometrial-ablation/abstract/55,56\" class=\"abstract_t\">55,56</a>]. We prefer not to use danazol, since it is poorly tolerated by most women.</p><p>There are few data regarding endometrial preparation with estrogen-progestin contraceptives or GnRH antagonists. Nonhormonal methods of preparation include: performing the procedure during the follicular phase of the menstrual cycle and uterine curettage [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/an-overview-of-endometrial-ablation/abstract/57\" class=\"abstract_t\">57</a>].</p><p>The benefits of hormonal suppression are well established for resectoscopic endometrial ablation, but not for non-resectoscopic ablation techniques. In a meta-analysis of 12 randomized trials of mostly resectoscopic ablation or resection (one trial used hot liquid filled balloon ablation), women in the GnRH agonist pretreatment group compared with placebo or no pretreatment had a shorter operative duration (an average of 4.8 minutes shorter) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/an-overview-of-endometrial-ablation/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. At one year after surgery, women in the GnRH agonist groups versus the no treatment groups had significantly lower rates of moderate or heavy menstrual bleeding (RR 0.7, 95% CI 0.6-0.9) and higher rates of amenorrhea (RR 1.6, 95% CI 1.2-2.0).</p><p>Prior to non-resectoscopic endometrial ablation, current practice regarding endometrial preparation is based upon the device manufacturers' instructions. Pretreatment with GnRH agonists is advised by the manufacturers for all devices, with three exceptions. For hot liquid filled balloon ablation with the ThermaChoice device, the endometrium can be prepared with either hormonal suppression or curettage [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/an-overview-of-endometrial-ablation/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. The other exception is bipolar radiofrequency ablation (NovaSure), which does not require pretreatment since the device adjusts to differing tissue depths [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/an-overview-of-endometrial-ablation/abstract/58\" class=\"abstract_t\">58</a>]. The combined thermal and bipolar radiofrequency device (Minerva) does not require that endometrium be thinned prior to the procedure, and the procedure may be performed during either the proliferative or secretory phase of the cycle. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=endometrial-ablation-non-resectoscopic-techniques\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Endometrial ablation: Non-resectoscopic techniques&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Methods that do not require hormonal suppression offer the advantages of avoiding the one- to two-month pretreatment time and drug-related adverse effects (eg, menopausal symptoms). Randomized trials and observational data suggest that hot liquid balloon and microwave ablation may be performed successfully using alternative methods (eg, curettage or timing during the follicular phase of the menstrual cycle) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/an-overview-of-endometrial-ablation/abstract/59-62\" class=\"abstract_t\">59-62</a>]. As an example, five-year follow-up from a randomized trial of microwave endometrial ablation showed that women in whom the procedure was scheduled after menses compared with those who had preprocedure hormonal suppression had no significant differences in rates of amenorrhea (84 and 87 percent) or hysterectomy (11 and 6 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/an-overview-of-endometrial-ablation/abstract/62\" class=\"abstract_t\">62</a>].

(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=procedural-sedation-in-adults-outside-the-operating-room\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Procedural sedation in adults outside the operating room&quot;</a>.) General principles of anesthesia for endometrial ablation are the same as for operative hysteroscopy procedures.

NSAIDs may be useful to inhibit uterine contractions; however, regarding pain control in women receiving local anesthesia, randomized trial data show that NSAIDs given prior to operative hysteroscopy reduce postoperative, but not intraoperative, pain.

Nine percent of procedures that started under local anesthesia were converted to general anesthesia due to patient discomfort. There were no significant differences between anesthetic groups regarding postoperative nausea, use of opiates, or recovery time. While tolerability was high overall, significantly fewer women who were assigned to local versus general anesthesia reported that the procedure was generally or totally acceptable (85 versus 97 percent).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H29\"><span class=\"h2\">Office versus operating room procedures</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Resectoscopic endometrial ablation is performed in the operating room, since it typically requires regional or general anesthesia and close monitoring of irrigation fluid absorption.

Endometrial ablation performed in the office offers the advantages of a familiar setting for the patient, easier scheduling, and lower procedural costs. The disadvantages of the office setting are the inability to switch to general anesthesia if the patient is not tolerating the procedure and the need to transfer the patient to an operating room if complications occur.</p><p>In order to be candidates for office surgery, women should be at low risk for surgical or anesthesia complications. Physicians who offer ablation in the office need to be trained in administering and responding to complications of conscious sedation; assisting personnel must also be trained appropriately [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/an-overview-of-endometrial-ablation/abstract/72\" class=\"abstract_t\">72</a>]. Emergency equipment must be available (eg, updated emergency cart, pulse oximeter, oxygen, wall suction) and protocols to handle rare complications such as excessive bleeding, uterine perforation, allergic reactions, or severe vagal reactions.

There are no safety data on the use of non-resectoscopic techniques in patients having a concurrent hysteroscopic myomectomy. In fact, prior uterine surgery is considered a contraindication for certain non-resectoscopic devices. If myomectomy is performed followed by ablation, we use only rollerball or endometrial resection techniques. Moreover, it is uncertain whether this procedure is more effective at improving uterine bleeding symptoms than myomectomy alone.</p><p>Based on the available data, it appears that a combined procedure neither increases nor decreases the rate of subsequent hysterectomy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/an-overview-of-endometrial-ablation/abstract/75,76\" class=\"abstract_t\">75,76</a>]. The only comparative study that evaluated myomectomy alone versus in combination with ablation was a retrospective cohort study of 177 women with submucosal fibroids and abnormal uterine bleeding; the combination of hysteroscopic myomectomy with endometrial ablation (rollerball or rollerbarrel method) or resection was associated with a significantly greater improvement in bleeding symptoms than myomectomy alone (96 versus 81 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/an-overview-of-endometrial-ablation/abstract/76\" class=\"abstract_t\">76</a>]. Further study is needed to establish whether a combined procedure impacts control of bleeding symptoms or operative complications.</p><p>If a combined procedure is performed, it is prudent to perform the myomectomy followed by ablation or resection. Available studies have used resectoscopic methods, such as rollerball ablation or endometrial resection, rather than the non-resectoscopic ablation methods that are more commonly used [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/an-overview-of-endometrial-ablation/abstract/77\" class=\"abstract_t\">77</a>]. However, resectoscopic methods may be preferable in this context. This is because they are performed under direct visualization, and the operator can avoid desiccating or resecting the endometrium or exposed myometrium that were attached to the myoma. This may avoid the spread of energy through areas of thin myometrium. In addition, non-resectoscopic devices have not been approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration for concomitant use with hysteroscopic myomectomy; the manufacturer of the microwave endometrial ablation system states that surgery that thins the myometrium should <strong>not</strong> be performed concurrently with ablation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/an-overview-of-endometrial-ablation/abstract/66\" class=\"abstract_t\">66</a>].

This was supported by a study that found an association between postablation pain and hematometra; hematometra was present in 5 of 19 women who underwent post-ablation hysterectomy with pain as the indication [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/an-overview-of-endometrial-ablation/abstract/86\" class=\"abstract_t\">86</a>]. Hematometra can be diagnosed with the visualization of pockets of echogenic fluid in the uterine cavity on transvaginal ultrasound.</p><p>Uterine cavity occlusion is likely to occur in the cervical canal or at the most narrow portion of the endometrial cavity, the lower uterine segment. Thus, ablation of the cervix or cervico-uterine junction should be avoided. Complete ablation of the uterine fundus, cornua, and tubal ostia will also help avoid accumulation of blood from active endometrium.</p><p>Cervical stenosis is treated with cervical dilation.

Prevention, diagnosis, and management of these symptoms are the same as for other presentations of hematometra. In addition, some surgeons assess women with these symptoms laparoscopically and excise the tubal stumps to prevent the distension of the proximal tubal segments during menses.</p><p>Postablation tubal sterilization syndrome (PATSS) was initially reported in 1993 as patients presenting with unilateral or bilateral pelvic pain and vaginal spotting who had previously undergone tubal sterilization and endometrial ablation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/an-overview-of-endometrial-ablation/abstract/88\" class=\"abstract_t\">88</a>].

Resectoscopic endometrial ablation is associated with more frequent use of general anesthesia, a longer operative duration, and an increased risk of some surgical complications (eg, irrigation fluid overload). Technical skill requirements are another potential barrier to the use of resectoscopic ablation, since, currently, many surgeons are less experienced with these techniques. Resectoscopic techniques are less costly per procedure than non-resectoscopic ablation. In 2010, the cost of disposable equipment for resectoscopic procedures is approximately US $125 to $150, while the range for non-resectoscopic techniques is US $850 to $1300.</p><p>In current practice, non-resectoscopic endometrial ablation is performed in most cases. Resectoscopic ablation is a reasonable option for surgeons with the required hysteroscopic skills. Resectoscopic ablation or therapy other than endometrial ablation may be optimal for women with acute flexion or version of the uterus that does not allow a non-resectoscopic ablation device to reach the uterine fundus or for women undergoing repeat endometrial ablation (see <a href=\"#H8\" class=\"local\">'Uterine anomalies'</a> above and <a href=\"#H55\" class=\"local\">'Repeat endometrial ablation'</a> below). In our practice, we perform resectoscopic ablation if the shape or size of the uterine cavity will not accommodate a non-resectoscopic device or if the patient has had multiple cesarean deliveries, to avoid ablating over the hysterotomy scar. &#160;</p><p>The differences between non-resectoscopic and resectoscopic ablation were best demonstrated in a meta-analysis of 21 randomized trials (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F71119\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef71119 \">table 2</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/an-overview-of-endometrial-ablation/abstract/81\" class=\"abstract_t\">81</a>].

Resectoscopic ablation is performed under hysteroscopic visualization, using resectoscopic instruments to ablate or resect the endometrium. Non-resectoscopic ablation is performed with a disposable device which is inserted into the uterine cavity and delivers energy to uniformly destroy the uterine lining.

Either hormonal suppression or uterine curettage can be used for endometrial preparation for hot liquid filled balloon ablation. (See <a href=\"#H10\" class=\"local\">'Postmenopausal women'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Some, but not all, of the non-resectoscopic ablation devices have been evaluated for use in women with small submucosal fibroids. It appears that endometrial ablation in these women is less effective than in women with a normal uterine cavity. Fibroids are typically removed prior to performing resectoscopic ablation or resection. (See <a href=\"#H13\" class=\"local\">'Leiomyomas or polyps'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For women undergoing endometrial ablation with most non-resectoscopic devices, we suggest endometrial preparation rather than no preparation (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). The exception is bipolar radiofrequency ablation, which does not require endometrial preparation. Either hormonal suppression or uterine curettage can be used for endometrial preparation for hot liquid filled balloon ablation. (See <a href=\"#H25\" class=\"local\">'Endometrial preparation'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For women undergoing most types of resectoscopic endometrial ablation, we recommend endometrial preparation over no endometrial preparation (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=1\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1A</a>). Endometrial preparation is not necessary prior to endometrial resection. (See <a href=\"#H25\" class=\"local\">'Endometrial preparation'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For endometrial preparation with hormonal suppression prior to endometrial ablation, we suggest gonadotropin-releasing agonists over other agents (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). Pretreatment with oral contraceptives is used by some surgeons. (See <a href=\"#H25\" class=\"local\">'Endometrial preparation'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The choice of resectoscopic or non-resectoscopic ablation must be individualized to the patient and the surgeon's familiarity with the procedure. Both approaches to endometrial ablation result in comparable rates of amenorrhea and patient satisfaction. Resectoscopic endometrial ablation is associated with more frequent use of general anesthesia, a longer operative duration, and an increased risk of some surgical complications (eg, irrigation fluid overload). Resectoscopic techniques are less costly per procedure and may be optimal for women with acute flexion or version of the uterus that does not allow a non-resectoscopic ablation device to reach the uterine fundus or for women undergoing repeat endometrial ablation. (See <a href=\"#H40\" class=\"local\">'Non-resectoscopic versus resectoscopic ablation'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Resectoscopic ablation is usually performed with regional or general anesthesia. Non-resectoscopic endometrial ablation can be performed using local, regional, or general anesthesia. (See <a href=\"#H28\" class=\"local\">'Anesthesia'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Women with chronic anovulation often find chronic medical therapy cumbersome due to daily or weekly dosing. In such women, we suggest the <a href=\"topic.htm?path=levonorgestrel-intrauterine-device-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">levonorgestrel intrauterine device</a> (IUD) rather than endometrial ablation (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=5\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2B</a>). Endometrial ablation is a reasonable choice in women who do not desire future pregnancy <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> wish to avoid using or changing an IUD. (See <a href=\"#H49\" class=\"local\">'Levonorgestrel-IUD'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For most women who desire surgical therapy for abnormal uterine bleeding and who do not desire future pregnancy, we suggest endometrial ablation or minimally invasive hysterectomy (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=5\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2B</a>). Hysterectomy is a reasonable option in women who desire definitive therapy and who are willing to accept the risk of perioperative complications. (See <a href=\"#H50\" class=\"local\">'Hysterectomy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Women who have had an endometrial ablation and later choose to use postmenopausal hormone therapy require endometrial protection with progestins.
