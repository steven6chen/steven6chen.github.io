Experience at a single center between 1995 and 1997 found that, while the incidence of diarrhea remained constant, infectious etiologies declined from 53 to 13 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-the-hiv-infected-patient-with-diarrhea/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. In another study that followed a cohort of approximately 600 patients in the Boston area after the introduction of potent ART, chronic diarrhea was reported in 28 percent and severe diarrhea (defined as more than six stools per day) in 3 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-the-hiv-infected-patient-with-diarrhea/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. In this study, stool pathogens were found in only 12 percent of the population. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Although the incidence of infectious diarrhea has decreased, antiretroviral-associated diarrhea may occur in up to 50 percent of patients, depending on the ART regimen (see <a href=\"#H10\" class=\"local\">'Exposures'</a> below). Medication-induced diarrhea is a leading diagnostic consideration when diarrhea is the sole complaint [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-the-hiv-infected-patient-with-diarrhea/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>], particularly when there is a temporal association. In addition, when an infectious etiology is not ascertained in advanced disease, then HIV-associated enteropathy needs to be considered. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Resource-limited settings</strong> &ndash; In resource-limited settings, where ART may be less available for a variety of reasons, diarrheal disease remains highly endemic, even for those without HIV [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-the-hiv-infected-patient-with-diarrhea/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].

Routine enteric pathogens with sufficient virulence to cause disease in healthy hosts will cause diarrheal disease in HIV-infected individuals with intact or compromised immunologic function. Less virulent pathogens, which appear to require some immune compromise to establish disease, are more common in patients with more advanced HIV or AIDS. As an example, the enteroaggregative <em>Escherichia coli</em> (EAEC) that are associated with persistent diarrheal disease in children in the developing world but have limited potential to cause diarrhea in volunteers, have been associated with persistent diarrhea in HIV-infected adults in the United States and Switzerland [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-the-hiv-infected-patient-with-diarrhea/abstract/13-15\" class=\"abstract_t\">13-15</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pathogenic-escherichia-coli\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pathogenic Escherichia coli&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Pathogens such as <em>Cryptosporidium parvum</em>, which can cause severe diarrheal disease in both immunocompetent and immunocompromised individuals, will become persistent in AIDS patients with CD4 counts &lt;180 <span class=\"nowrap\">cells/microL</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-the-hiv-infected-patient-with-diarrhea/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. By contrast, HIV-infected patients with a more preserved CD4 count usually have a self-limited illness with this organism.

HIV infection may play a role in the pathogenesis of diarrhea and gastrointestinal illness, although it is not clear if the mechanism is direct infection of the enterocyte or infection of the lymphoid tissue of the gastrointestinal tract with dysregulation of local cytokine production [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-the-hiv-infected-patient-with-diarrhea/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h1\">HISTORY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The duration of symptoms, frequency and characteristics of stool, amount and pace of weight loss, and other abdominal or constitutional symptoms should be sought and will assist in placing a patient in the category of having small or large bowel diarrhea.</p><p>Medication history and recent changes in medications, status of HIV disease, route of acquisition of HIV disease and other opportunistic illnesses or co-morbid illnesses should be ascertained. Since HIV is currently better suppressed by antiretroviral agents, more HIV-infected patients are presenting with non-HIV related co-morbid conditions. Thus, it is important to ask about a family history of inflammatory bowel disease that might lead to alternative diagnoses for diarrheal symptoms.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Regional involvement</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A careful history can assist in pinpointing the portion of the gastrointestinal tract most severely involved since certain infections have a propensity to involve particular regions.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h3\">Small bowel involvement</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The small bowel is an organ that has secretory and nutrient-absorbing functions. Disease that is predominantly located in the small bowel is likely to have a presentation that reflects the dysregulation of these two functions. Small bowel diarrhea is usually watery and of large volume; it may be associated with small bowel symptoms such as bloating, gas, cramping, and potentially profound weight loss. Some patients with involvement of the terminal ileum may present with malabsorption of D-xylose or vitamin B12 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-the-hiv-infected-patient-with-diarrhea/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. Patients with documented evidence of small bowel dysfunction are more likely to have a small bowel pathogen isolated from their stool [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-the-hiv-infected-patient-with-diarrhea/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h3\">Large bowel involvement</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The large bowel is a storage organ where some additional absorption of water occurs. Thus, large bowel diarrhea is characterized by frequent, small volume, often painful stools. The pain associated with these illnesses is not related to the region of the gut but to the type of pathogens that cause disease in the colon. Malabsorption of nutrients does not occur in a diarrhea that is limited to the large bowel. Nutritional compromise does not occur in patients who have infection confined to the large bowel, unless the pathogen is also capable of causing a disseminated infection, a &quot;typhoidal&quot; presentation. In HIV-infected patients, the typhoidal syndrome may be caused by <em>Salmonella</em> or by disseminated infection due to a range of organisms including cytomegalovirus (CMV), MAC, <em>M. tuberculosis</em>, or fungi, such as <em>Histoplasma</em> or <em>Cryptococcus</em>.

As noted above, patients with CD4 cell counts &lt;100 <span class=\"nowrap\">cells/microL</span> are at risk for opportunistic infections which are typically chronic, such as <em>Cryptosporidium</em>, MAC, CMV, <em>Isospora</em>, or <em>Microsporidium</em>.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Upper or mid-abdominal cramps, bloating, and nausea suggest gastric or small bowel involvement, or both, which would be more common in MAC, <em>Cryptosporidium</em>, <em>Giardia</em>, or <em>Isospora belli</em> infections.

A history of guaiac positive stools in the setting of weight loss may be a presenting symptom of Kaposi's sarcoma, which can be seen as vascular mucosal lesions on endoscopy. Skin lesions are usually present with disseminated Kaposi's sarcoma.</p><p>In the patient with suspected colitis, if a diagnosis is not made with careful stool analysis, we recommend sigmoidoscopy with biopsy as the next procedure. Biopsies should be preferentially taken of any abnormal appearing mucosa. While colonoscopy, rather than sigmoidoscopy, has been advocated for enhanced diagnosis of CMV confined to the right colon [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-the-hiv-infected-patient-with-diarrhea/abstract/34,35\" class=\"abstract_t\">34,35</a>], we reserve this procedure for patients in whom the sigmoidoscopy is negative as a more cost-effective approach.</p><p>This approach is supported by a prospective study of 79 patients with HIV-related diarrhea who underwent evaluation with stool studies, upper endoscopy, and colonoscopy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-the-hiv-infected-patient-with-diarrhea/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>]. Of these patients, endoscopic evaluation provided a new diagnosis in 22 patients (28 percent). Biopsies of the sigmoid colon alone were sufficient to establish the diagnosis of CMV in all 15 patients. The majority of patients with a positive terminal ileal biopsy had microsporidiosis, which could have also been diagnosed by a modified trichrome stain of stool [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-the-hiv-infected-patient-with-diarrhea/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>]. Another study from Taiwan confirmed the value of endoscopy after two weeks of failed symptomatic therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-the-hiv-infected-patient-with-diarrhea/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>].</p><p>If lower tract evaluation is negative, upper endoscopy can occasionally uncover proximal small bowel infection by <em>Cryptosporidium</em>, <em>Microsporidium</em>, histoplasmosis or MAC [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-the-hiv-infected-patient-with-diarrhea/abstract/34,39\" class=\"abstract_t\">34,39</a>].</p><p>The decision to perform upper or lower endoscopy first is suggested by the symptom complex. Classic features of colitis (cramps, fecal leukocytes, bloody stool <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> fever) suggests lower endoscopy will have the highest yield. Symptoms suggesting enteritis (watery high volume diarrhea without fever or fecal leukocytes) would suggest proceeding with upper endoscopy as the initial test. (See <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Regional involvement'</a> above.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H17\"><span class=\"h2\">Imaging</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Abdominal computed tomography (CT) using oral and intravenous contrast may be useful for patients with diarrhea and concomitant significant abdominal pain since imaging may show evidence of:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Colitis (CMV, Herpes simplex virus [HSV], <em>Clostridium difficile</em>)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Abdominal adenopathy or hepatosplenomegaly (MAC, tuberculosis, histoplasmosis, lymphoma)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Biliary tract disease</p><p/><p>Other contrast studies (eg, barium studies) are generally not useful in evaluating diarrhea in these patients since most disorders require mucosal biopsy. In addition, barium may interfere with CT imaging and examination of stool samples. (See <a href=\"#H14\" class=\"local\">'Stool examination'</a> above.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H18\"><span class=\"h1\">COMPLICATIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Malnutrition can be a serious complication of diarrheal disease in HIV-infected patients, since malabsorption of nutrients may accompany diarrhea and people with diarrhea may minimize intake because of intestinal symptoms or to control the frequency of stooling. Malnutrition remains a strong predictor of morbidity and mortality in those infected with HIV.</p><p>Significant electrolyte disturbances can also occur, particularly in the setting of severe cryptosporidiosis.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H19\"><span class=\"h1\">EMPIRIC THERAPY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>If stool evaluation and flexible sigmoidoscopy are nondiagnostic, some clinicians prefer empiric antibiotic therapy with a quinolone and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=metronidazole-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">metronidazole</a> for treatment of potential undiagnosed pathogen, culture-negative <em>Campylobacter</em>, or <em>Giardia</em>. However, small bowel overgrowth as a cause of diarrhea is very rare. In addition, antibiotics may lead to additional adverse events. We generally do not recommend this strategy unless the patient has a clinical history strongly suggestive of a possible diagnosis (ie, the sexual partner was recently diagnosed with <em>Giardia</em>). Empiric therapy directed towards amebic colitis is also <strong>not</strong> recommended in developed countries.</p><p>If a particular antiretroviral medication is the culprit (ie, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ritonavir-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ritonavir</a>), alternative medications should be substituted, whenever possible. If chronic diarrhea continues unabated without a diagnosis, symptomatic therapy with an antimotility drug (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=loperamide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">loperamide</a> or diphenoxylate with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=atropine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">atropine</a> [Lomotil]) can be initiated. An alternative to an antimotility agent is <a href=\"topic.htm?path=crofelemer-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">crofelemer</a>, a botanical agent that blocks chloride secretion and accompanying high-volume water loss in diarrhea [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-the-hiv-infected-patient-with-diarrhea/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>]. Crofelemer was approved by the US Food and Drug Administration in 2012 for noninfectious diarrhea in HIV-infected patients receiving antiretroviral therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-the-hiv-infected-patient-with-diarrhea/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>]. The safety and efficacy of crofelemer were evaluated in a trial of 374 HIV-infected patients with noninfectious diarrhea; 17.6 percent of patients receiving crofelemer experienced clinical response compared with 8 percent of patients receiving placebo. The dosage of crofelemer is 125 mg orally twice daily. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=approach-to-the-adult-with-acute-diarrhea-in-resource-rich-settings#H2368017643\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Approach to the adult with acute diarrhea in resource-rich settings&quot;, section on 'Symptomatic therapy'</a>.) </p><p>Attention should also be given to nutritional evaluation, counseling, and support if the body mass index (BMI) is low or if otherwise unexplained weight loss is present. There are few data on the use of antimotility agents for chronic diarrhea in patients with AIDS [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-the-hiv-infected-patient-with-diarrhea/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>].</p><p>Zinc deficiency, which is commonly found in HIV-infected patients, has been associated with pathogen negative diarrhea [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-the-hiv-infected-patient-with-diarrhea/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. However, a randomized controlled trial of dietary zinc supplementation had no significant effect on the duration or remission of diarrhea in HIV-infected adults [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-the-hiv-infected-patient-with-diarrhea/abstract/43\" class=\"abstract_t\">43</a>].</p><p>Expectant observation and maintenance of hydration are probably appropriate in the patient with acute small bowel, watery diarrhea and a CD4 count that approaches normal, since these syndromes are likely to be self-limited and relatively benign. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=approach-to-the-adult-with-acute-diarrhea-in-resource-rich-settings\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Approach to the adult with acute diarrhea in resource-rich settings&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12120099\"><span class=\"h1\">SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Diarrhea can cause significant morbidity in HIV-infected patients and may be due to a multitude of etiologies, including infection, malignancy, or medications. Diarrhea is also an independent predictor of reduced quality of life. (See <a href=\"#H1\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Prior to the use of potent antiretroviral therapy in the United States, chronic diarrhea was responsible for a significant proportion of AIDS-defining conditions. However, the incidence of infectious causes of diarrhea in HIV-infected patients with low CD4 counts (&lt;200 <span class=\"nowrap\">cells/microL)</span> has declined. Chronic diarrhea remains an important source of morbidity in resource-limited settings where antiretroviral therapy may be less available. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Incidence'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Diarrheal disease in HIV-infected individuals is frequently caused by infectious agents but may also be due to infiltrative diseases, such as lymphoma or Kaposi's sarcoma. (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Pathogenesis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A detailed history should include the duration of symptoms, frequency and characteristics of stool, amount and pace of weight loss, and other abdominal or constitutional symptoms. Current medications should be reviewed. (See <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'History'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In patients who are taking antiretroviral therapy, medication-induced diarrhea should be strongly considered, particularly when diarrhea is the sole presenting symptom. (See <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'History'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A careful physical examination is necessary to help determine the degree of wasting or any particular findings that may point to specific diseases. For example, fever and wasting may suggest an underlying opportunistic infection. (See <a href=\"#H11\" class=\"local\">'Physical examination'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Helpful diagnostic studies include stool and blood cultures. Endoscopy and CT imaging may be required if the initial noninvasive workup is nondiagnostic. (See <a href=\"#H13\" class=\"local\">'Diagnostic studies'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Complications of severe diarrhea include weight loss, malnutrition, and electrolyte disturbance. (See <a href=\"#H18\" class=\"local\">'Complications'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>If chronic diarrhea continues unabated without a diagnosis, symptomatic therapy with an antimotility drug can be initiated.
