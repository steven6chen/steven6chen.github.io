In the United States, the highest rates of infection are among residents from rural areas of the southeastern states.

In patients who do not respond within two to four weeks, imatinib should be discontinued and other therapies considered.

The goals of therapy are reduction of the absolute eosinophil count (AEC), amelioration of signs and symptoms, and prevention of disease progression. (See <a href=\"#H8\" class=\"local\">'Overview'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For the rare patient who presents with very high eosinophil levels, symptoms of leukostasis, or potentially life-threatening complications of hypereosinophilia (HE) (eg, acute heart failure, thromboembolic events), immediate therapy should be initiated to rapidly reduce counts. We suggest high-dose intravenous glucocorticoids as an initial intervention (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F103933\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef103933 \">algorithm 1</a>) (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>).

Important tests to exclude other disorders in the differential diagnosis and to differentiate disease variants should be performed prior to glucocorticoid administration. Patients at risk for infection with <em>Strongyloides</em> should be treated with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ivermectin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ivermectin</a>, concomitantly with glucocorticoids. (See <a href=\"#H351937905\" class=\"local\">'Immediate treatment for severe disease'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>All patients require baseline testing, some of which should be done before initiating therapy, as glucocorticoids, in particular, can alter the results. Once treatment has been initiated, all patients require periodic monitoring for organ involvement, which is not correlated with the degree of blood eosinophilia and may develop insidiously. Patients with aggressive disease should undergo human leukocyte antigen (HLA) typing in preparation for possible allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT). (See <a href=\"#H2156099950\" class=\"local\">'Studies to obtain urgently'</a> above and <a href=\"#H3015630788\" class=\"local\">'Monitoring'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For all patients with the <em>FIP1L1-PDGFRA</em> mutation (even if asymptomatic), we recommend <a href=\"topic.htm?path=imatinib-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">imatinib</a> mesylate for initial therapy, in preference to other available agents (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=2\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1B</a>). We also suggest the use of imatinib for patients with HES with myeloproliferative features in the absence of the <em>FIP1L1-PDGFRA</em> mutation who have failed initial treatment with glucocorticoids <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> as glucocorticoid-sparing treatment (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>).

Patients with cardiac involvement should receive glucocorticoids (1 to 2 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> daily for one to four weeks) at the same time that imatinib is initiated to prevent acute cardiac injury. Typically, symptoms improve, and eosinophil counts normalize within one to two weeks in patients with the <em>FIP1L1-PDGFRA</em> mutation. In others, this may take longer <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> require a higher dose of imatinib.
