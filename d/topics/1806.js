A nucleotide is a nucleoside, or a combination of a sugar (ribose or deoxyribose) and a base, that is linked to a phosphate group. RNA differs from DNA in that the hydrogen at the 2' position in DNA is replaced by a less stable hydroxyl group in RNA. There are four DNA bases: adenine (A), cytosine (C), guanine (G), and thymidine (T). In RNA, thymidine is replaced by uracil (U). DNA or RNA polymers are formed by the linking of the 5' phosphate of one nucleotide to the 3' hydroxyl group of another.</p><p>Proteins are composed of one (or more) linear peptide sequences. Like nucleic acids, this sequence is also modular, consisting of linked amino acids. Amino acids consist of an amino and carboxyl group linked to one another by a central carbon (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F78753\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef78753 \">figure 4</a>). In humans, there are 20 different types of amino acids, distinguishable from one another by specific side chains also linked to the central carbon. The linear polypeptide chain is formed by fusion of the amino-group of one amino acid to another's carboxyl-group.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1497103\"><span class=\"h2\">Organization of the human genome</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The human genome&mdash;the complete DNA sequence&mdash;consists of approximately 3 billion (3x10<sup>9</sup>) base pairs of DNA organized as 23 chromosomes (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F55530\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef55530 \">figure 5</a>). Humans are diploid (2n), meaning that somatic cells normally contain two sets of 23 chromosomes (46 chromosomes total), each set derived from one parent. Germ cells (egg and sperm) are haploid (n) (ie, contain 23 chromosomes). Each haploid genome consists of 22 autosomes (numbered 1 to 22) and one sex chromosome (either an X or Y). The Y chromosome contains the <em>SRY</em> gene that initiates the development of male genitalia and the production of anti-M&uuml;llerian hormone to suppress the formation of female gonads. As such, individuals who have an XY chromosome complement and an intact <em>SRY</em> gene are phenotypically male, and those who are XX are phenotypically female.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H101353333\"><span class=\"h3\">Alleles, genotypes, and haplotypes</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Different DNA sequences at a gene or locus are called alleles. An individual's genotype refers to the combination of allele(s) or nucleotide(s) at a locus in an individual. If a person has two copies of the same allele at a particular locus, that person is said to be homozygous. If the two alleles differ, the person is said to be heterozygous. The term haplotype refers to the combination of alleles in a region of DNA sequence, usually across multiple loci (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F60253\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef60253 \">figure 6</a>).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6183956\"><span class=\"h3\">Identifying loci on chromosomes</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There are several ways to describe the physical position of a gene on a chromosome. Prior to the availability of the complete human genome sequence, the location of a gene (a locus) was described with reference to cytogenetic bands. With the exception of chromosome 22 and the X and Y chromosome, chromosomes are numbered in order of decreasing length (ie, chromosome 1 is the longest chromosome, followed by chromosome 2, etc.). Chromosome 21 is the smallest, approximately 3 million bases shorter than chromosome 22.</p><p>Within a chromosome, physical position is specified by the chromosome arm and in relation to specific banding patterns observed on the chromosome with Giemsa staining (also known as G-banding). The centromere, visualized as a constriction between the short and long arms of a chromosome, is a distinct structural element necessary for chromosomal alignment and segregation during cell division. The centromere divides the chromosome into two arms: the short arm, &quot;p&quot; (from the French &quot;petite&quot;&mdash;small), and the long arm &quot;q&quot; (the letter following &quot;p&quot;). Giemsa staining results in distinct banding patterns for each chromosome arm, enabling division and subdivision of each chromosome arm into numbered segments. As such, gene positions can be described with reference to the chromosome number, arm, region, band, sub-band, and secondary sub-bands. For example, the beta-globin gene (<em>HBB</em>) resides on a chromosome 11q15.4 (read &quot;eleven &ndash; Q &ndash; one five point four,&quot; not &quot;15 point four&quot;).</p><p>With high-resolution karyotyping, chromosomes can be subdivided into hundreds of sub-bands, with an average length of approximately 3.5 million base pairs. This level of resolution is sufficient only for characterizing large structural chromosomal abnormalities, such as chromosome translocations and inversions or large copy number variants. High-resolution karyotyping is still used routinely in cytogenetic investigation. (See <a href=\"#H1031916\" class=\"local\">'Copy number variation'</a> below.)</p><p>Greater precision is needed for smaller genetic variants, including small copy number variants and single base pair changes. With the availability of data from completely sequenced genomes, researchers now refer to chromosomal position at the resolution of a single base pair. For example, the specific location of the beta-globin gene is chromosome 11, base pairs 5,246,696 to 5,248,301 (based on the most recently updated Genome Reference Consortium sequence build from February 2009&mdash;GRCh37) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/basic-principles-of-genetic-disease/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. It is important to note that, although the relative position of most DNA sequences is stable, due to ongoing additions and editing of the genome, absolute base pair numbering is not static, and varies from one sequence build to the next. It is therefore critical to note the build number when using absolute base numbering.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6183970\"><span class=\"h3\">Mitochondrial genes</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Mitochondria harbor a distinct genome consisting of 16,589 base pairs. The mitochondrial genome encodes 37 genes, including 13 proteins. Mitochondria are transmitted only in the egg, and as such, all mitochondrial DNA is maternally inherited. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=mitochondrial-structure-function-and-genetics\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Mitochondrial structure, function, and genetics&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6183977\"><span class=\"h3\">Coding and noncoding genes</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Approximately 3 percent of human DNA sequence encodes for genes and thereby serves as functional DNA sequences that can be expressed through the process of transcription and translation. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=principles-of-molecular-genetics\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Principles of molecular genetics&quot;</a>.)</p><p>There are two types of genes:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Coding genes: DNA sequences that encode messenger RNA (mRNA) that is subsequently translated into protein.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Noncoding genes: DNA sequences that code for RNA with intrinsic functional properties that do not require translation to protein. Examples include small nucleolar RNAs (snRNAs) and microRNAs (miRNAs).</p><p/><p>There are approximately 27,000 genes that encode proteins. The DNA sequence of these genes consists of exons and introns (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F67310\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef67310 \">figure 7</a>). The exons represent the portion of the gene that codes for amino acids, and the introns represent the intervening sequence between the exons. The intronic sequence does not contribute to protein specification and is spliced out during transcription.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1497110\"><span class=\"h2\">Gene transcription</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The process of gene activation (expression) is initiated by the binding of specific initiating factors (proteins) called transcription factors and enhancers to specific DNA sequences flanking the target gene of interest.</p><p>Typically, the most important of these DNA binding sites (promoter region) are situated a few hundred base pairs upstream of the gene. Once the transcription factors bind, they recruit an RNA polymerase, the enzyme that synthesizes the protein-coding messenger RNA.</p><p>DNA is double stranded, formed by the pairing of complementary bases across strands. The base pairing is strict: adenine pairs with thymidine, guanine with cytosine. For a given gene, only one of the two strands (called the sense strand) has the correct DNA code for protein synthesis. The other strand, called the anti-sense strand, serves as the template for making the desired RNA sequence. RNA polymerase &quot;reads&quot; the anti-sense DNA sequence in a 3' to 5' orientation, synthesizing its complementary RNA sequence in a 5' to 3' direction with the same base sequence as the desired sense strand, except that uracil (U) is substituted for thymidine (T) in RNA.</p><p>Transcription, the process of synthesizing RNA from a DNA template, results in the synthesis of a linear pre-messenger RNA chain (pre-mRNA) consisting of both exons and introns (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F67310\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef67310 \">figure 7</a>). Following strand synthesis, introns are excised from the primary RNA transcript and the ends of the exons are fused together through a process called splicing. Additional modifications to the RNA strand include the addition of a Gm-cap at the 5' end and a chain of adenines (polyadenylation) at the 3' end. These modifications provide stability to the messenger RNA (mRNA) and facilitate transport of this mature mRNA from the nucleus to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) for protein synthesis. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=principles-of-molecular-genetics#H8\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Principles of molecular genetics&quot;, section on 'Post-transcription modification of mRNA'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1497117\"><span class=\"h2\">Protein synthesis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Once transported to the endoplasmic reticulum, the mature mRNA transcript serves as the template for protein synthesis (ie, translation) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F59052\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef59052 \">figure 8</a>). Every amino acid is coded for by three consecutive bases, termed a codon. With four RNA bases (A, G, C, or U) and three base-positions in each codon, there are 64 possible codons (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F57764\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef57764 \">figure 9</a>). There are 20 amino acids, so there is more than one codon for most of the amino acids. In addition, there are three stop codons: UAA, UGA, and UAG.</p><p>Translation is initiated by the binding of ribosomal proteins to the 5' end of mRNA. The ribosomal protein structure contains two pockets, each containing a three-nucleotide sequence. Upon binding, the leading pocket exposes an initiation codon (AUG), to which binds a methionine-specific transfer RNA. The ribosomal unit advances three bases, exposing the next 3-base pair codon. A corresponding transfer RNA (complementary to the exposed codon) binds, approximating the corresponding amino acid to the leading methionine and catalyzing their fusion. This process of elongation continues the length of the mRNA reading frame. Translation is terminated once a stop codon (UAA, UGA, and UAG) is encountered, resulting in chain termination. The synthesized polypeptide then undergoes modification (for example, cleavage, glycosylation, or phosphorylation) and transport to its needed cellular or extracellular location.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1497124\"><span class=\"h1\">GENETIC VARIATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The human genome encodes all of the organelles necessary for normal cellular function. Variation of the DNA sequence can therefore impact the normal functioning of cells and organs and contributes to the inter-individual variability for a wide range of physical characteristics.</p><p>There are three broad categories of genetic variation:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>DNA sequence variation</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Structural (chromosomal) variation</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Epigenetic variation</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1497131\"><span class=\"h2\">DNA sequence variation</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1497140\"><span class=\"h3\">Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs)</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The most common form of DNA variation is a single base substitution, or the replacement of one base (ie, A, C, G, or T) for another base in the DNA sequence. A single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) is the term used to describe such substitutions when they occur relatively frequently in the population and are not associated with a Mendelian disorder. On average, SNPs are observed every 200 to 300 base pairs. Single nucleotide substitutions that are seen less frequently and that are associated with disease are called missense mutations.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1497147\"><span class=\"h4\">Nonsense mutation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A substitution that changes a codon for an amino acid to a stop codon, leading to premature termination of translation of the mRNA transcript and a truncated protein.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1497154\"><span class=\"h4\">Missense mutation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A substitution that changes the codon for one amino acid to the codon for another amino acid. The size of the mRNA and protein are not changed, but the composition and possibly the function of the protein does change.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1497161\"><span class=\"h4\">Splice site mutation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A substitution in one of the base pairs inside or flanking the intron-exon boundaries that alters normal pre-mRNA splicing. Such mutations can result in intron retention (either partial or complete) or exon skipping.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1497168\"><span class=\"h4\">Silent mutation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A change in one base that results in no change in the amino acid sequence of the protein, due to the redundancy of the genetic code (there is more than one codon for most amino acids) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F57764\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef57764 \">figure 9</a>).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1497175\"><span class=\"h4\">Regulatory polymorphism</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A substitution that alters binding affinities of transcript-related proteins, such as transcription factors, enhancers, silencers, or insulators. Such changes result in altered rates of transcription. Though protein structure is not altered by such noncoding variants, the level of transcript production can result in altered protein production, and in turn confer phenotypic variation.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>As an example, a common SNP residing on chromosome 17q21 within intronic sequence of the gene <em>ZPBP2</em> (MIM# 608499), results in altered binding of a CCCTC-binding factor (CTCF) insulator protein that regulates the transcription of four genes: <em>IKZF3</em> (MIM# 606221), <em>ZPBP2</em>, <em>GSDMB</em> (MIM# 611221), and <em>ORMDL3</em> (MIM# 610075). These four genes demonstrate different levels of gene expression that correlate with SNP genotype [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/basic-principles-of-genetic-disease/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. This SNP, and others residing on a shared haplotype have been strongly associated with asthma susceptibility in numerous populations of diverse ancestry [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/basic-principles-of-genetic-disease/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1497182\"><span class=\"h2\">Indels: Insertions and deletions</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Insertions or deletions of one or more nucleotides represent the second most abundant form of sequence variation. When situated within the coding sequence of a gene, these variants can result in significant alterations in protein sequence. They commonly result in a shift in the open reading frame (so-called frameshift mutations) and subsequent synthesis of an incorrect protein sequence.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>As an example, a single base pair insertion of a cytosine (C) at nucleotide position 3020 of the <em>NOD2</em> gene (MIM# 605956) results in a frameshift and subsequent protein truncation immediately downstream of the insertion site. This variant, with a frequency of 4 percent of Caucasians, confers increased susceptibility to inflammatory bowel disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/basic-principles-of-genetic-disease/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].</p><p/><p>Though the vast majority of indels consist of 1 to 2 bases, larger indels have been described, including a 32-base pair deletion of the chemokine receptor 5 (<em>CCR5</em>) gene.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Individuals carrying two copies of this 32-base pair deletion in the <em>CCR5</em> gene (ie, homozygotes) are relatively protected from the development of persistent HIV infection. Heterozygotes, although not protected from HIV infection, exhibit delayed immunodeficiency and disease progression due to a reduced rate of intracellular viral spread [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/basic-principles-of-genetic-disease/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].</p><p/><p>Insertions (or deletions) of multiples of three bases result in insertions (or deletions) of additional amino acids but do not shift the reading frame, and therefore downstream sequences remain intact.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The best known example of a deletion with an intact reading frame is the delta F508 <span class=\"nowrap\">(&Delta;F508)</span> mutation of the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (<em>CFTR</em>) gene. This mutation results in a 3-base pair deletion of amino acid 508, in this case a phenylalanine (symbolized with an &lsquo;F') residue, of the CTFR protein. This deletion is the commonest mutation among patients with cystic fibrosis and does not alter the function of the residual protein, but interferes with intracellular transport of the CFTR protein to the epithelial cell surface.

The expansion occurs due to an error in DNA replication called slip-mispairing. When the repeated sequence is three base pairs in length, these disorders are often given the name of &quot;triplet&quot; or &quot;trinucleotide&quot; repeat diseases. Myotonic dystrophy and Huntington disease are disorders caused by expansion of such triplet repeat sequences. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=myotonic-dystrophy-etiology-clinical-features-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Myotonic dystrophy: Etiology, clinical features, and diagnosis&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=huntington-disease-genetics-and-pathogenesis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Huntington disease: Genetics and pathogenesis&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Triplet repeat diseases are notorious for showing anticipation, defined as (1) earlier onset of disease manifestations in successive generations of affected individuals <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> (2) more severe disease phenotypes in successive generations of affected individuals.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1497196\"><span class=\"h2\">Structural genetic variation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Structural genetic variants are those that affect large segments of DNA (ie, &gt;1000 bases) or whole chromosomes, commonly affecting the function of multiple genes and having pronounced phenotypic effects. This class includes copy number variation; and chromosomal translocations, inversions, and rearrangements.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1031916\"><span class=\"h3\">Copy number variation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Copy number variants (CNVs), the most prevalent type of structural variation, are DNA segments spanning thousands to millions of bases whose copy number varies between different individuals in comparison to the reference genome, with the result being that individuals may have one, two, or three copies of a particular chromosome region. CNVs are quite common. Many CNVs do not produce pathologic or disease phenotypes but facilitate normal population variation. However, larger CNVs are often de novo and are increasingly associated with human disease. Specific pathogenic CNVs have been implicated in the cause of intellectual disability, autism, and schizophrenia, although these same CNVs can also be present in healthy individuals [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/basic-principles-of-genetic-disease/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].</p><p>An extensive discussion of CNVs is presented elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=genomic-disorders-an-overview#H16722199\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Genomic disorders: An overview&quot;, section on 'Copy number variations'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1497203\"><span class=\"h3\">Chromosome translocations and inversions</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A chromosome translocation occurs when there is an exchange of genetic material between two non-homologous chromosomes. A chromosome inversion occurs when a chromosome breaks in two places, inverts itself, and then reinserts itself.<strong> </strong>Inversions can be either pericentric (the breaks occur on different chromosome arms that are separated by a centromere) or paracentric (the breaks occur on the same chromosome arm). If a chromosome break occurs in the middle of a gene, the gene may be disrupted or a new fusion gene may result. Often these fusion genes are oncogenes. Alternatively, structural chromosome rearrangements can affect gene regulation. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=chromosomal-translocations-deletions-and-inversions\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Chromosomal translocations, deletions, and inversions&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1497210\"><span class=\"h2\">Epigenetic variation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Epigenetic variation refers to modifications of DNA or chromatin (the DNA-packaging proteins) that do not directly alter the DNA sequence. These forms of variation can have dramatic effects on protein expression.</p><p>Examples of epigenetic variation include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>CpG methylation, where methyl groups are added to the cytosines in CG-rich DNA sequences surrounding genes (so-called &quot;CpG islands&quot;). Methylation of CpG islands in promoter regions of genes can result in silencing of gene expression. In female carriers of an <em>FMR1</em> (Fragile X mental retardation) gene expansion, methylation of the normal gene can lead to manifestations of Fragile X syndrome [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/basic-principles-of-genetic-disease/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].

This process is distinguished from mitosis, the process of somatic cell division that aims to produce two diploid daughter cells with identical genomes to that of the parental cell. In contrast, the goal of meiosis is to generate four haploid cells of distinct and varied genetic content. These haploid cells can then participate in fertilization.

Broadly, inheritance patterns are described as either Mendelian or non-Mendelian. For the most part, single gene (monogenic) genetic disorders exhibit Mendelian patterns of inheritance, where there is a very tight correlation (often 1:1) between the presence of the disease genotype and the trait or disease of interest. In these situations, knowledge of an individual's genotype status can predict the development of disease. Thus, the clinical utility of such information is usually very high, and many molecular genetic diagnostic tests, in which different disease genes are sequenced for mutations, have been developed accordingly for clinical use. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=inheritance-patterns-of-monogenic-disorders-mendelian-and-non-mendelian\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Inheritance patterns of monogenic disorders (Mendelian and non-Mendelian)&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The tight correlation between genotype and phenotype in monogenic disease occurs because the types of mutations causing such disease usually confer significant functional consequences to the target gene, resulting in overt cellular or organ dysfunction. Because these types of mutations are severe, they are often infrequent, and the diseases that they cause are correspondingly rare.</p><p>In contrast, many &quot;common&quot; diseases, such as hypertension or diabetes, are typically caused by the cumulative and interactive effects of genetic variation in more than one gene (often dozens). Moreover, the risk of developing more common disease is influenced not only by genetics, but by developmental, environmental, and social factors. In these disorders, a 1:1 correlation between risk genotype and disease is never observed, and each risk variant contributes only a fraction of the total genetic risk for disease. As a result, the clinical utility of such information is much lower than for monogenic disease. Though several clinical applications have been developed for common genetic variants (largely in the field of pharmacogenetics), validated predictive panels are currently not available for most common diseases. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=principles-of-complex-trait-genetics\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Principles of complex trait genetics&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H101353539\"><span class=\"h2\">Mendelian inheritance</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Monogenic or Mendelian disorders (genetic disorders caused by mutations in only one gene) are relatively rare and are often first recognized clinically by their predictable patterns of inheritance in families. These patterns were first observed in plants by the Augustinian monk and botanist Gregor Mendel. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=inheritance-patterns-of-monogenic-disorders-mendelian-and-non-mendelian\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Inheritance patterns of monogenic disorders (Mendelian and non-Mendelian)&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1497239\"><span class=\"h3\">Autosomal dominant</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In autosomal dominant disorders, a single mutation in one copy of a gene on an autosomal chromosome (chromosomes 1 to 22, not X or Y) causes disease. Affected individuals are therefore usually heterozygous for a disease mutation. Males and females are both affected in an equal ratio in large pedigrees or population studies of autosomal dominant disorders. In each pregnancy, there is a 50 percent risk that an affected parent will pass a mutated allele to the child. Thus, if one parent is affected (the usual situation), on average 50 percent of the parent's offspring will be heterozygous (and affected) for the mutation and 50 percent will be normal (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F63306\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef63306 \">figure 13</a>).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1497246\"><span class=\"h3\">Autosomal recessive</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Autosomal recessive disorders require the presence of a mutation on both alleles of a gene on an autosome, either as two compound heterozygous mutations (two different mutations affecting the same gene) or one homozygous mutation (the same mutation on both alleles of a gene). Both males and females are equally likely to be affected. Carriers of autosomal recessive mutations have one allele with a mutation and one normal allele, and are usually unaffected.</p><p>If parents of an affected individual are heterozygous carriers of a mutation, there is a 25 percent chance that an offspring of each pregnancy will inherit both mutations, and therefore be affected; a 50 percent chance that the offspring will inherit one mutation and one normal allele, and be a carrier; and a 25 percent chance that an offspring will have two normal alleles. Thus, on average, 25 percent of the couple's children will be affected, and 75 percent will be unaffected. Two-thirds of unaffected offspring will be heterozygous carriers and one-third homozygous noncarriers (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F50124\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef50124 \">figure 14</a>).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1497253\"><span class=\"h3\">Sex-linked</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Sex-linked inheritance describes traits that are passed on either the X or Y chromosome. X-linked recessive inheritance is most common, and there are traits with both X-linked dominant and X-linked recessive inheritance.</p><p>X-linked recessive disorders are recognized by being more prevalent in males, since males carry only one X chromosome and are reliant on normal functioning of the genes carried on that chromosome. Inherited mutations will thus manifest in males. Females, however, would only manifest the phenotype if they were homozygous for the gene (which would only occur in the rare event that both the father and mother are carriers) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F55180\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef55180 \">figure 15</a>) or through skewed X-inactivation. Two examples of X-linked recessive diseases are Hemophilia VIII and IX.</p><p>X-linked dominant traits occur in both sexes, but are typically more severe among males due to the absence of a normal X chromosome (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F75137\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef75137 \">figure 16</a>). There are few examples of Y-linked inheritance. Although male sexual dysfunction has been linked to mutations on the Y chromosome, there are no confirmed examples of other types of Y-linked diseases.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1497260\"><span class=\"h2\">Phenomena affecting Mendelian inheritance</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There are several reasons why Mendelian disorders may not appear to follow Mendelian inheritance patterns, even if an individual has a known pathogenic variant in a specific gene. Examples include the following:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Incomplete or variable penetrance</strong> &ndash; Penetrance refers to the probability that a disease will be present for a given genotype. Penetrance may be related to the age of the individual <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> influenced by the sex of the individual.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Variable expressivity</strong> &ndash; Expressivity refers to the clinical or phenotypic differences when a disease is present (eg, degree of severity, organ systems affected).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Pleiotropy</strong> &ndash; Pleiotropy refers to the ability of mutations in a single gene to produce more than one effect, often in different tissues or organs.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Anticipation</strong> &ndash; Anticipation refers to the phenomenon in which successive generations display earlier age of onset or more severe disease manifestations.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Mosaicism</strong> &ndash; Mosaicism refers to heterogeneous expression of a disease at the cellular or tissue level that result from cell-specific differences in the expression of the genetic variant. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Imprinting</strong> &ndash; Imprinting refers to differences in the expression of a genetic variant depending on whether the variant was inherited from the mother or father, due to epigenetic changes that are sex-specific.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Mitochondrial inheritance</strong> &ndash; Mitochondrial inheritance refers to traits determined by the mitochondrial genome. The human mitochondrial genome is inherited exclusively through the maternal line (from the egg); thus, these disorders exhibit exclusive maternal inheritance, although some individuals may be phenotypically unaffected.</p><p/><p>These factors and their effects on inheritance patterns are discussed in detail separately.

PGD requires in-vitro fertilization (IVF) and the availability of an appropriate testing laboratory. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=preimplantation-genetic-testing\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Preimplantation genetic testing&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Prenatal testing &mdash; Testing of fetal cells for chromosome aberrations and fetal DNA obtained from the fetal cells for chromosome aberrations and mutations. Prenatal testing is typically offered to women at high risk (eg, advanced maternal age, abnormal fetal ultrasound examination or screening serological tests, family history of a genetic condition in which the chromosome aberration or mutation has previously been determined). The most common prenatal diagnostic test procedures are amniocentesis and chorionic villus sampling. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prenatal-care-initial-assessment\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Prenatal care: Initial assessment&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=carrier-screening-for-genetic-disease-in-the-ashkenazi-jewish-population\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Carrier screening for genetic disease in the Ashkenazi Jewish population&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diagnostic-amniocentesis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Diagnostic amniocentesis&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=chorionic-villus-sampling\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Chorionic villus sampling&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Newborn screening &mdash; Routine testing for panels of common monogenic disorders in all newborns, depending on the frequency of the disorder and the availability of an appropriate intervention. Newborn screening enables early identification of affected children and thus facilitates early intervention and treatment. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=newborn-screening\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Newborn screening&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Fetal DNA can also be present in the maternal bloodstream during a pregnancy and can be tested for chromosome disorders, such as trisomy 21 or disease-causing mutations, generally of paternally-derived alleles. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prenatal-screening-for-common-aneuploidies-using-cell-free-dna\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Prenatal screening for common aneuploidies using cell-free DNA&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1497323\"><span class=\"h2\">Carrier testing</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Carrier testing is used to identify asymptomatic individuals who are heterozygous (ie, carry one copy of an altered gene) for a mutation that can cause a genetic disorder in homozygotes (individuals who carry two copies of a mutated or altered gene). Carrier testing is also used to screen at-risk subjects who are relatives of individuals affected by autosomal recessive conditions. Presymptomatic genetic testing is similar to carrier screening, but involves testing an at-risk individual before the onset of symptoms or signs of a disease. Presymptomatic testing can involve screening for autosomal dominant conditions, such as <em>BRCA1</em> testing in the children of confirmed a <em>BRCA1</em>-affected parent. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=genetic-counseling-and-testing-for-hereditary-breast-and-ovarian-cancer\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Genetic counseling and testing for hereditary breast and ovarian cancer&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Testing for disease alleles can be performed in families with a family history for a specific genetic condition (for example, mutation screening of the <em>APC</em> gene in families with Familial Adenomatous Polyposis). Alternatively, carrier testing or screening can target a particular ethnic group or population in which mutations are present at a relatively high frequency (eg, Tay Sachs screening among Ashkenazi Jews). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=carrier-screening-for-genetic-disease-in-the-ashkenazi-jewish-population\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Carrier screening for genetic disease in the Ashkenazi Jewish population&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=molecular-genetics-of-colorectal-cancer\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Molecular genetics of colorectal cancer&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-familial-adenomatous-polyposis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of familial adenomatous polyposis&quot;</a>.)</p><p>For many highly-penetrant genes, carrier testing of asymptomatic relatives of affected individuals can have important benefits, not only for identified carriers, but also for noncarriers. For example, Familial Adenomatous Polyposis is an autosomal dominant syndrome caused by mutations in the <em>APC</em> gene and is characterized by the development of hundreds of adenomatous polyps in the large intestine. A proportion of these polyps undergo malignant transformation. Detection and removal of polyps at their earliest stages, prior to malignant transformation, requires regular endoscopic surveillance beginning in adolescence. Mutation screening may indicate the need for early and more frequent colonoscopy in those individuals found to carry the disease-causing mutation, while those who are found to be noncarriers can be reassured that their risk for polyp development is not higher than the general population.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1497330\"><span class=\"h2\">Diagnostic testing</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Diagnostic gene testing is used to confirm a specific diagnosis in symptomatic patients. The diagnostic utility of genetic testing (for example, the sensitivity of testing) varies based on the mutational spectrum of the disease and the type of testing performed.</p><p>As an example, current diagnostic panels for cystic fibrosis mutations include only a fraction of the more than 1600 confirmed CFTR mutations. Therefore, although these panels typically include the most commonly-observed mutations (ie, those found in ~95 percent of individuals), the inability to confirm two pathogenic mutations does not necessarily exclude the diagnosis, which should be based primarily on the combination of clinical presentation and a positive sweat chloride test. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cystic-fibrosis-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis#H22\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Cystic fibrosis: Clinical manifestations and diagnosis&quot;, section on 'Molecular diagnosis'</a>.)</p><p>The role for diagnostic testing in the management of monogenic disease is well established for many conditions.

Application of pharmacogenetics can detect genetic variants that may help guide therapeutic decisions, including drug dosing, the likelihood of response to chemotherapy (eg, <em>RAS </em>testing and treatment of colorectal cancer), or the identification of patients at high risk of &quot;idiosyncratic&quot; reactions (eg, HLA-class I alleles and development of carbamazepine-induced Stevens Johnson Syndrome) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/basic-principles-of-genetic-disease/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].

Most clinical assays test for one or several, individual risk variants, and clinicians order specific diagnostic panels to evaluate risk for distinct genetic disorders.</p><p>The advent of single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) microarray technologies enables simultaneous genotyping of more than one million SNPs; similarly, array comparative genomic hybridization (array CGH) simultaneously screens the whole genome for copy number variants and chromosome aberrations.</p><p>Next-generation sequencing (NGS) technologies provide complete exome or whole genome sequencing data [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/basic-principles-of-genetic-disease/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].

Because an individual's genomic sequence remains largely invariant over one's lifetime, it is possible that such genome-wide data will be routinely generated in early childhood, providing data that can be used across clinical disciplines, at different stages of life.</p><p>NGS technologies are starting to be integrated into clinical medicine, and exome sequencing is currently available in several clinical laboratories in the USA. However, there are questions related to data interpretation (particularly for complex, multi-genic traits), ethical concerns regarding which results should be released to patients, and issues regarding data storage, transmission, and retrieval. As an example, if a complete DNA sequence is generated during childhood, should that data reside with that individual's pediatrician (who would be most concerned with conditions of early onset, but not those of later onset for which childhood interventions are not effective or needed), with the patient, or some independent body? Although some aspects of NGS are currently controversial, exome sequencing is likely to prove diagnostically powerful for disease identification.</p><p>Direct-To-Consumer (DTC) marketing of genetic testing, offered currently by several private companies, has prompted an accelerated discussion of bioethical issues and has raised a range of questions regarding the oversight of genetic testing.
