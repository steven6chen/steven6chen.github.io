Patients should also receive prophylactic antibiotics, such as a fluoroquinolone or third-generation cephalosporin. These issues are discussed in detail elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=general-principles-of-the-management-of-variceal-hemorrhage\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;General principles of the management of variceal hemorrhage&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The first step in stopping variceal bleeding is the initiation of pharmacologic therapy (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F59327\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef59327 \">algorithm 1</a>). Pharmacologic therapy should be started in all patients with upper gastrointestinal bleeding who have varices or who are at risk for having varices (eg, patients with cirrhosis). Pharmacologic therapy should <strong>not</strong> be delayed pending confirmation that the source of bleeding is indeed from varices. In the United States, pharmacologic therapy typically consists of an <a href=\"topic.htm?path=octreotide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">octreotide</a> bolus (50 mcg intravenous [IV]) followed by a continuous infusion (50 mcg IV per hour). Where available, terlipressin is often used. Terlipressin is administered at an initial dose of 2 mg IV every four hours and can be titrated down to 1 mg IV every four hours once hemorrhage is controlled. Pharmacologic therapy is typically continued for three to five days following cessation of bleeding. (See <a href=\"#H62477588\" class=\"local\">'Pharmacologic therapy'</a> below.)</p><p>For patients with esophageal varices, acute bleeding is typically managed with endoscopic variceal ligation, though occasionally endoscopic sclerotherapy is used. The goal should be to perform an upper endoscopy after fluid resuscitation and within 12 hours of presentation. If the bleeding cannot be controlled endoscopically, treatment options include transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPS) placement or surgical shunting. For bleeding gastric varices, treatment is with cyanoacrylate injection where available. However, this agent is not approved for the treatment of bleeding gastric varices and its use reflects off-label use of the agent in the United States. If cyanoacrylate injection is not an option, TIPS placement is typically used. Balloon tamponade is an option for temporarily stopping bleeding from esophageal or gastric varices while definitive treatment is being arranged, but it is associated with serious complications, including esophageal rupture. Bleeding ectopic varices may be managed with TIPS placement or surgery. (See <a href=\"#H61879176\" class=\"local\">'Management of esophageal varices'</a> below and <a href=\"#H27\" class=\"local\">'Management of gastric varices'</a> below and <a href=\"#H21562738\" class=\"local\">'Management of ectopic varices'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H62477588\"><span class=\"h1\">PHARMACOLOGIC THERAPY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Vasoactive medications decrease portal blood flow and are used for the treatment of acute variceal hemorrhage. They include <a href=\"topic.htm?path=vasopressin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">vasopressin</a>, somatostatin, and their analogs (terlipressin and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=octreotide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">octreotide</a>, respectively). As a group, vasoactive medications have been shown to decrease mortality and improve hemostasis in patients with acute variceal bleeding [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/methods-to-achieve-hemostasis-in-patients-with-acute-variceal-hemorrhage/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. However, terlipressin is the only agent individually shown to reduce mortality [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/methods-to-achieve-hemostasis-in-patients-with-acute-variceal-hemorrhage/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. Pharmacologic therapy should be started at the time of presentation in a patient who has known varices or is at risk for varices [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/methods-to-achieve-hemostasis-in-patients-with-acute-variceal-hemorrhage/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. It should <strong>not</strong> be held pending confirmation of the diagnosis. Terlipressin is the preferred agent in many countries outside of the United States. It is initially given as 2 mg intravenous (IV) bolus every four hours. Octreotide is the agent available in the United States and is given as a 50 mcg IV bolus, followed by a continuous infusion at a rate of 50 mcg per hour. Pharmacologic therapy should be continued for three to five days [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/methods-to-achieve-hemostasis-in-patients-with-acute-variceal-hemorrhage/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. </p><p>In a meta-analysis of 30 randomized trials with 3111 patients with acute variceal bleeding, compared with placebo, the use of vasoactive medications was associated with improved hemostasis (relative risk [RR] 1.2, 95% CI 1.1-1.3) and decreases in seven-day mortality (RR 0.74, 95% CI 0.57-0.95), transfusion requirement (pooled mean difference -0.70 units, 95% CI -1.0 to -0.38), and duration of hospitalization (pooled mean difference -0.71 days, 95% CI -1.2 to -0.19) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/methods-to-achieve-hemostasis-in-patients-with-acute-variceal-hemorrhage/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H62477609\"><span class=\"h2\">Vasopressin</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span><a href=\"topic.htm?path=vasopressin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Vasopressin</a> directly constricts mesenteric arterioles and decreases portal venous inflow [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/methods-to-achieve-hemostasis-in-patients-with-acute-variceal-hemorrhage/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>].

Terlipressin is not available in the United States but is used in several other countries. Terlipressin is administered at an initial dose of 2 mg IV every four hours and can be titrated down to 1 mg IV every four hours once hemorrhage is controlled. At least 20 randomized trials have evaluated its efficacy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/methods-to-achieve-hemostasis-in-patients-with-acute-variceal-hemorrhage/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>].

Because terlipressin has been associated with hyponatremia, sodium levels should be monitored daily when it is being used [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/methods-to-achieve-hemostasis-in-patients-with-acute-variceal-hemorrhage/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. </p><p>Only a few studies directly compared terlipressin with somatostatin, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=octreotide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">octreotide</a>, or endoscopic treatment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/methods-to-achieve-hemostasis-in-patients-with-acute-variceal-hemorrhage/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. Those studies suggest that terlipressin has similar efficacy for the control of acute bleeding. Compared with octreotide, terlipressin may have more sustained hemodynamic effects in patients with bleeding varices. A study comparing the acute hemodynamic effects of terlipressin to octreotide in stable patients with cirrhosis found a sustained effect of terlipressin on portal pressure and blood flow compared with only a transient effect from octreotide [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/methods-to-achieve-hemostasis-in-patients-with-acute-variceal-hemorrhage/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>].

The variability in success rates is probably due to patient selection, the concomitant use of other types of therapy, and experience of the staff in using these tubes. Balloon tamponade appears to be less successful in patients who have failed pharmacologic therapy and in patients with early rebleeding.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H61879013\"><span class=\"h2\">Balloon placement</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Before balloon tamponade is attempted, the patient should be intubated to prevent aspiration. Since this is a temporizing measure in most cases, arrangements for definitive treatment (endoscopic therapy, transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt [TIPS] placement, or surgery) should be made. (See <a href=\"#H61879176\" class=\"local\">'Management of esophageal varices'</a> below.)</p><p>Equipment that is required includes:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A tamponade tube kit (with the tube and clamps)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A manometer (not needed for Linton tubes)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Large-volume syringes</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A <span class=\"nowrap\">traction/pulley</span> system to maintain constant tension on the tube</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Adequate suction</p><p/><p>Before tube placement, all equipment should be readily at hand. The balloon(s) should be inflated with air and held underwater to assess for leakage and then deflated. With the patient in the supine or left-lateral position, the tube is lubricated and carefully inserted through the mouth (preferred) or nostril until at least 50 cm of the tube has been introduced.</p><p>Once the tube is placed, the ports are suctioned to remove all air. The gastric balloon is then inflated with 450 to 500 mL of air. Once inflated, the air inlet for the gastric balloon should be clamped. To confirm that the tube is in the stomach, air can be injected through the stomach port (<strong>not</strong> the balloon port) while auscultation is performed over the stomach. Alternatively, a radiograph can be obtained.</p><p>After the gastric balloon is inflated, the tube is pulled until resistance is felt, at which point the balloon is tamponading the gastroesophageal junction. The tube is then securely fastened to either a pulley device or taped to a football helmet to maintain tension on the tube (and thus continued tamponade at the gastroesophageal junction). A one to two pound weight (eg, a 500 mL intravenous fluid bag) can be used to maintain tension on the tube. This is often sufficient to stop the variceal hemorrhage.</p><p>If bleeding continues despite inflation of the gastric balloon, the esophageal balloon (if present) should be inflated to 30 to 45 mmHg. While the esophageal balloon is inflated, the pressure should be checked periodically (at least once per hour). It is important not to overinflate the esophageal balloon as it puts the patient at risk for esophageal necrosis or rupture. Once the bleeding is controlled, the pressure in the esophageal balloon should be reduced by 5 mmHg to a goal pressure of 25 mmHg. If bleeding resumes, the pressure is increased by 5 mmHg.</p><p>The tube can be left in place for 24 to 48 hours. The gastric balloon (along with the esophageal balloon if used) should be deflated every 12 hours to check for rebleeding. If the bleeding has ceased, the tube can be left in place with the balloons deflated. The balloons can then be reinflated if bleeding resumes. If the bleeding resumes upon deflation of the balloon(s), the balloon(s) should immediately be reinflated. As mentioned above, balloon tamponade is a temporizing measure and definitive treatment should be arranged for ongoing or recurrent bleeding.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H61879019\"><span class=\"h2\">Rebleeding and complications</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>One of the main problems with balloon tamponade is the high risk of rebleeding following deflation of the balloon.

Endoscopic therapy can be performed at the same time as diagnostic endoscopy by virtually all trained gastroenterologists. Two forms of endoscopic treatment are commonly used: endoscopic variceal ligation (EVL) and endoscopic sclerotherapy (ES).

It is not commonly used because TIPS has lower complication rates. </p><p>Many patients die of liver failure and complications of surgery, despite achievement of hemostasis. Those with severe hemorrhage, tense ascites, deep coma, aspiration pneumonia, renal failure, or sepsis are at particular risk from surgery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/methods-to-achieve-hemostasis-in-patients-with-acute-variceal-hemorrhage/abstract/72\" class=\"abstract_t\">72</a>]. The ideal patient for surgical therapy is one with well-preserved liver function who fails emergent endoscopic treatment and has no complications from the bleeding or endoscopy. Surgery may also be required for patients who are not good surgical candidates but have a contraindication to TIPS placement, such as heart failure.</p><p>The choice of surgery depends on the training and expertise of the surgeon. There are two basic types of operations: shunt operations and nonshunt operations.

The powder becomes cohesive and adhesive when it comes into contact with moisture, forming a stable mechanical barrier at the site of bleeding. The powder is delivered through a catheter and sprayed onto the bleeding site under endoscopic guidance without the need for direct tissue contact. The use of hemostatic powder was examined in a study of nine patients with acute variceal hemorrhage [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/methods-to-achieve-hemostasis-in-patients-with-acute-variceal-hemorrhage/abstract/73\" class=\"abstract_t\">73</a>].

In the most recent meta-analysis, technical success was achieved in 97 percent of cases and bleeding was controlled in 96 percent. However, all studies have reported adverse events related to the SEMS placement, such as ulceration and stent migration. Until more data are available, the use of SEMS for treating refractory variceal bleeding should be restricted to clinical trials or centers with substantial expertise in the use of these stents for refractory variceal hemorrhage. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H27\"><span class=\"h1\">MANAGEMENT OF GASTRIC VARICES</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H79936003\"><span class=\"h2\">General approach</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Bleeding intragastric varices should be treated with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=octreotide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">octreotide</a> (or somatostatin or terlipressin) and balloon tamponade followed by cyanoacrylate injection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/methods-to-achieve-hemostasis-in-patients-with-acute-variceal-hemorrhage/abstract/78-83\" class=\"abstract_t\">78-83</a>], transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPS) placement, or surgery.

However, TIPS may be less effective than surgery in patients with bleeding gastric varices who have spontaneous splenorenal collaterals. Early TIPS is an alternative to endoscopic therapy in patients at high risk of failing endoscopic therapy (eg, patients with Child-Pugh class C) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/methods-to-achieve-hemostasis-in-patients-with-acute-variceal-hemorrhage/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].

When introduced into an aqueous medium (such as the lumen of a varix), cyanoacrylate glue immediately polymerizes into a firm clot. In the United States, it is used in only a few centers under research protocols and its use is not approved by the US Food and Drug Administration. However, it can provide a valuable alternative for patients with life-threatening bleeding in whom TIPS is not an option. </p><p>In two small randomized trials, cyanoacrylate injection appeared to be more effective and safer than band ligation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/methods-to-achieve-hemostasis-in-patients-with-acute-variceal-hemorrhage/abstract/81\" class=\"abstract_t\">81</a>] or alcohol injection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/methods-to-achieve-hemostasis-in-patients-with-acute-variceal-hemorrhage/abstract/44\" class=\"abstract_t\">44</a>]. In a retrospective study that included 19 patients who underwent endoscopic ultrasound-guided cyanoacrylate injection, obliteration of the gastric varices was achieved in 18 patients (95 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/methods-to-achieve-hemostasis-in-patients-with-acute-variceal-hemorrhage/abstract/82\" class=\"abstract_t\">82</a>].</p><p>In addition, cyanoacrylate may prevent rebleeding. In one trial, 77 patients who had bled from gastric varices were assigned to receive either cyanoacrylate or a beta-blocker for secondary prophylaxis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/methods-to-achieve-hemostasis-in-patients-with-acute-variceal-hemorrhage/abstract/83\" class=\"abstract_t\">83</a>]. After a median follow-up of 26 months, cyanoacrylate was associated with a lower rebleeding rate compared with beta-blockers (15 versus 55 percent) and was also associated with a lower mortality rate (3 versus 25 percent). </p><p>The addition of beta-blockers to treatment with cyanoacrylate does not appear to decrease the risk of rebleeding. In a randomized trial, 95 patients with bleeding gastric varices that were successfully treated with cyanoacrylate were assigned to receive treatment with beta-blockers plus repeated cyanoacrylate injections (every three to four weeks until the varices were obliterated) or repeated cyanoacrylate injections alone [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/methods-to-achieve-hemostasis-in-patients-with-acute-variceal-hemorrhage/abstract/93\" class=\"abstract_t\">93</a>]. Rebleeding rates were similar between those who received combination therapy and those treated with cyanoacrylate alone at six months (89 versus 94 percent), one year (77 versus 77 percent), two years (62 versus 58 percent), and three years (52 versus 47 percent). Mortality rates were also similar between the groups.</p><p>Complications from cyanoacrylate injection were reported in a series of 753 patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/methods-to-achieve-hemostasis-in-patients-with-acute-variceal-hemorrhage/abstract/94\" class=\"abstract_t\">94</a>]. The complications included rebleeding due to extrusion of the glue cast (4.4 percent), sepsis (1.3 percent), distant emboli (pulmonary, cerebral, splenic; 0.7 percent), gastric ulcer formation (0.1 percent), major gastric variceal bleeding (0.1 percent), and mesenteric hematoma associated with hemoperitoneum and bacterial peritonitis (0.1 percent). The complication-related mortality rate was 0.5 percent.</p><p>To decrease the risk of glue embolization, some have proposed combining cyanoacrylate injection with endoscopic-ultrasound guided coil placement. The idea is to place the coil immediately prior to injection of the cyanoacrylate so that the coil (which has synthetic fibers attached to it) may act as a scaffold for the glue, preventing embolization. This was shown to be feasible in a study of 30 patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/methods-to-achieve-hemostasis-in-patients-with-acute-variceal-hemorrhage/abstract/95\" class=\"abstract_t\">95</a>].

Band ligation was successful in stopping acute bleeding in 16 of 18 patients (88 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/methods-to-achieve-hemostasis-in-patients-with-acute-variceal-hemorrhage/abstract/96\" class=\"abstract_t\">96</a>]. However, 6 of the 27 patients (22 percent) died, and bleeding recurred in 5 patients (19 percent). Many of these patients had noncirrhotic portal hypertension due to schistosomiasis. Thus, it is uncertain if similar results would be obtained in patients with cirrhosis. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=endoscopic-variceal-ligation\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Endoscopic variceal ligation&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Early TIPS is an alternative to endoscopic therapy in patients at high risk of failing endoscopic therapy (eg, patients with Child-Pugh class C) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/methods-to-achieve-hemostasis-in-patients-with-acute-variceal-hemorrhage/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. TIPS is also an option for patients who fail endoscopic therapy.</p><p>A promising approach is the intravariceal injection of thrombin [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/methods-to-achieve-hemostasis-in-patients-with-acute-variceal-hemorrhage/abstract/97-99\" class=\"abstract_t\">97-99</a>]. One of the largest series looking at the use of thrombin included 52 patients with bleeding gastric varices treated with intravariceal injections of bovine thrombin (average of 1070 int. unit administered during two treatment sessions) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/methods-to-achieve-hemostasis-in-patients-with-acute-variceal-hemorrhage/abstract/98\" class=\"abstract_t\">98</a>]. Initial hemostasis was achieved in 94 percent. Bleeding related mortality within 72 hours of the index bleed was 6 percent. After six weeks of follow-up, 9 of 49 surviving patients (18 percent) rebled, and an additional patient died.</p><p>Another report described the successful use of elastic bands and detachable snares in controlling acute rebleeding and achieving gastric variceal eradication [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/methods-to-achieve-hemostasis-in-patients-with-acute-variceal-hemorrhage/abstract/100\" class=\"abstract_t\">100</a>].</p><p>Balloon-occluded retrograde transvenous obliteration (BRTO) is a procedure that has been used for bleeding gastric varices as well as ectopic varices (eg, small bowel varices). BRTO is an interventional radiologic technique that involves occluding blood flow by inflation of a balloon catheter within a draining vessel, followed by instillation of a sclerosant proximal to the site of balloon occlusion. BRTO requires the presence of a spontaneous shunt into which a balloon catheter is retrogradely introduced. In the case of gastric varices, there frequently is a spontaneous gastrorenal shunt. Small bowel varices usually drain into dilated collateral vessels that connect to the portal vein through systemic shunts.</p><p>Observational studies suggest that patients with gastric varices treated with BRTO have good long-term bleeding control (90 percent in one study [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/methods-to-achieve-hemostasis-in-patients-with-acute-variceal-hemorrhage/abstract/101\" class=\"abstract_t\">101</a>]), but technical failure occurs in approximately 10 percent of cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/methods-to-achieve-hemostasis-in-patients-with-acute-variceal-hemorrhage/abstract/101,102\" class=\"abstract_t\">101,102</a>]. BRTO may increase portal pressure and lead to the development or worsening of esophageal varices and ascites. In addition, systemic vein thrombosis has been described [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/methods-to-achieve-hemostasis-in-patients-with-acute-variceal-hemorrhage/abstract/103\" class=\"abstract_t\">103</a>]. Combining BRTO with TIPS may improve outcomes. In a series of 39 patients, BRTO combined with TIPS was compared with BRTO alone. The combination of BRTO and TIPS was associated with higher rates of being <span class=\"nowrap\">ascites/hydrothorax</span> free (100 versus 29 percent at two years) and lower rates of recurrent hemorrhage (0 versus 21 percent at two years) though no difference in survival was seen [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/methods-to-achieve-hemostasis-in-patients-with-acute-variceal-hemorrhage/abstract/104\" class=\"abstract_t\">104</a>]. While commonly performed in Japan, this procedure is not widely practiced in the United States.</p><p>Another interventional radiologic technique that has been described to treat gastric varices is vascular plug and gelatin sponge-assisted retrograde transvenous obliteration. A vascular plug is placed in the left adrenal vein or gastrorenal shunt. Embolization of the gastrorenal shunt and gastric varices with a gelatin sponge is then performed. In a series of 20 patients, vascular plug placement and gelatin sponge embolization were technically successful in all patients, with no procedure-related complications [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/methods-to-achieve-hemostasis-in-patients-with-acute-variceal-hemorrhage/abstract/105\" class=\"abstract_t\">105</a>]. One week later, computed tomographic (CT) scanning revealed that all patients had complete thrombosis of the gastrorenal shunts and gastric varices. In addition, clinical symptoms of hepatic encephalopathy resolved in the seven patients who had hepatic encephalopathy prior to the procedure. There were no cases of variceal bleeding during follow-up (mean 422 days); however, worsening of esophageal varices was noted in 4 of 18 patients (22 percent) who underwent follow-up endoscopy at a mean follow-up of 9.4 months.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H21562738\"><span class=\"h1\">MANAGEMENT OF ECTOPIC VARICES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Varices occasionally develop at sites other than the stomach and esophagus and come to clinical attention when they bleed. Examples are duodenal, rectal, and peristomal varices (which develop around the stoma in patients who have a colostomy). The optimal treatment for patients with bleeding ectopic varices is unclear. Endoscopic treatment is often unsuccessful and traditional treatment has been surgery. Our approach is to start with transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPS) placement, reserving surgery for patients who fail TIPS or who have a contraindication to TIPS placement. A guideline issued by the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases recommends TIPS as the preferred approach for prevention of rebleeding in patients with ectopic varices [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/methods-to-achieve-hemostasis-in-patients-with-acute-variceal-hemorrhage/abstract/106\" class=\"abstract_t\">106</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H79935194\" class=\"local\">'Transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt'</a> above.)</p><p>Case reports have noted that the bleeding can also be controlled by TIPS [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/methods-to-achieve-hemostasis-in-patients-with-acute-variceal-hemorrhage/abstract/107-110\" class=\"abstract_t\">107-110</a>]. It is unlikely that enough cases will be seen by any center to generate &quot;hard data&quot; upon which to base therapy. One disadvantage with TIPS is that it requires close follow-up for several years. </p><p>As with gastric varices, small bowel varices can be treated with balloon-occluded retrograde transvenous obliteration.

Pharmacologic therapy should be started at the time of presentation and should <strong>not</strong> be held pending confirmation of the diagnosis. Vasoactive medications (eg, terlipressin, somatostatin, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=octreotide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">octreotide</a>) decrease portal blood flow and, as a group, have been shown to decrease mortality and improve hemostasis in patients with acute variceal bleeding. However, terlipressin is the only agent individually shown to reduce mortality. Terlipressin may also have more sustained hemodynamic effects than octreotide. Pharmacologic therapy should be continued for three to five days.

It is initially given as 2 mg intravenous (IV) bolus every four hours. Once the bleeding is controlled, it can be titrated down to a dose of 1 mg IV every four hours. Octreotide is available in the United States and is given as a 50 mcg IV bolus, followed by a continuous infusion at a rate of 50 mcg per hour. Octreotide is probably only effective when used in conjunction with endoscopic therapy.

Small trials suggest cyanoacrylate injection is effective and it is less invasive than TIPS placement. TIPS placement is an alternative in areas where cyanoacrylate is not available (it is not widely available in the United States). (See <a href=\"#H27\" class=\"local\">'Management of gastric varices'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients with bleeding ectopic varices, we suggest initial treatment with TIPS placement rather than endoscopic therapy or surgery, provided there are no contraindications to TIPS placement (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). The optimal treatment for patients with bleeding ectopic varices is unclear. Endoscopic treatment is often unsuccessful, and traditional treatment has been surgical. However, case reports have noted that the bleeding can also be controlled by TIPS placement and TIPS placement is less invasive than surgery.
