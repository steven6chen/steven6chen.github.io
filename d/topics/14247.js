HIV-infected patients are at high risk for acquiring HBV due to shared routes of transmission (eg, sexual transmission, injection drug use) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-hepatitis-b-virus-infection-in-the-hiv-infected-adult/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. In addition, if acquired, HIV-infected individuals are less likely to develop a protective immune response with production of hepatitis B surface antibody during acute infection. Thus, such patients are at increased risk of developing chronic infection, cirrhosis, and end-stage liver disease compared with HIV-uninfected patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-hepatitis-b-virus-infection-in-the-hiv-infected-adult/abstract/2-4\" class=\"abstract_t\">2-4</a>]. </p><p>This topic will address how to prevent HBV in HIV-infected individuals. The epidemiology, clinical manifestations, evaluation, and treatment of HBV in HIV-infected patients are discussed elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-chronic-hepatitis-b-in-the-hiv-infected-patient\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of chronic hepatitis B in the HIV-infected patient&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-hepatitis-b-in-the-hiv-infected-patient\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Epidemiology, clinical manifestations, and diagnosis of hepatitis B in the HIV-infected patient&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pretreatment-evaluation-of-chronic-hepatitis-b-virus-infection-in-the-hiv-infected-patient\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pretreatment evaluation of chronic hepatitis B virus infection in the HIV-infected patient&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=monitoring-the-hiv-infected-patient-with-chronic-hepatitis-b-virus-infection\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Monitoring the HIV-infected patient with chronic hepatitis B virus infection&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9249266\"><span class=\"h1\">APPROACH</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>HIV-infected patients should be vaccinated against HBV if they do not have evidence of protective immunity. Individuals are most likely to develop a protective serologic response if their CD4 count is &gt;350 <span class=\"nowrap\">cells/microL</span> and their HIV viral load is undetectable [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-hepatitis-b-virus-infection-in-the-hiv-infected-adult/abstract/5-8\" class=\"abstract_t\">5-8</a>].

Repeat vaccination may be needed for some individuals. (See <a href=\"#H889861000\" class=\"local\">'Assessing vaccine response'</a> below and <a href=\"#H1081647609\" class=\"local\">'Anti-HBs &le;10 milli-international units/mL after initial series'</a> below.)</p><p>Although vaccination is the best way to prevent HBV infection, additional prevention interventions may be needed, especially during the course of vaccination and for those who do not respond to the vaccine. These include behavioral interventions to decrease high-risk behaviors and possibly <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hepatitis-b-immune-globulin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">hepatitis B immune globulin</a> if an exposure occurs. Antiretroviral agents used to treat HIV (eg, tenofovir, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lamivudine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">lamivudine</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=emtricitabine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">emtricitabine</a>) may also provide some protection against HBV infection, but they are not the preferred strategy to prevent HBV infection. (See <a href=\"#H2121527\" class=\"local\">'Avoiding HBV exposure'</a> below and <a href=\"#H1330204058\" class=\"local\">'Post-exposure prophylaxis'</a> below and <a href=\"#H137335\" class=\"local\">'The role of antiretroviral therapy'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2121445\"><span class=\"h1\">SEROLOGIC SCREENING</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>HIV-infected patients should be evaluated for evidence of hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-hepatitis-b-virus-infection-in-the-hiv-infected-adult/abstract/9-11\" class=\"abstract_t\">9-11</a>]. Individuals should be tested for hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg), hepatitis B surface antibody (anti-HBs), and antibody to hepatitis B core antigen (anti-HBc). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=initial-evaluation-of-the-hiv-infected-adult#H955927281\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Initial evaluation of the HIV-infected adult&quot;, section on 'Screening for co-infections'</a>.)</p><p>The results of serologic testing are used to determine the need for vaccination and additional preventive interventions.

Some providers administer a higher dose of the vaccine to increase the likelihood of achieving an adequate serologic response. (See <a href=\"#H1081647588\" class=\"local\">'Dose and schedule of vaccination'</a> below and <a href=\"#H168646187\" class=\"local\">'Response to vaccination'</a> below.)</p><p>After receiving their initial series, some patients will <strong>not</strong> develop protective immunity (ie, hepatitis B surface antibody [anti-HBs] &le;10 milli-international <span class=\"nowrap\">units/mL),</span> and will require additional doses to achieve an adequate serologic response. In addition, some patients may require a booster dose of the vaccine since the immune response can decline over time. (See <a href=\"#H1081647609\" class=\"local\">'Anti-HBs &le;10 milli-international units/mL after initial series'</a> below and <a href=\"#H1139269589\" class=\"local\">'Waning immunity'</a> below.) </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1072434190\"><span class=\"h2\">Whom to vaccinate</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>We recommend hepatitis B vaccination for patients without evidence of prior hepatitis B virus (HBV) exposure (eg, negative for hepatitis B surface antigen [HBsAg], anti-HBs, and hepatitis B core antibody [anti-HBc]) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-hepatitis-b-virus-infection-in-the-hiv-infected-adult/abstract/11,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,12</a>]. We also vaccinate certain patients who are only positive for anti-HBc (ie, negative for HBsAg and anti-HBs). (See <a href=\"#H1240057994\" class=\"local\">'Patients with isolated anti-HB core antibody'</a> below.) </p><p>We administer the HBV vaccine to such patients, regardless of CD4 count. Although individuals are most likely to develop a protective serologic response if their CD4 count is &gt;350 <span class=\"nowrap\">cells/microL,</span> some immunosuppressed individuals will still respond. It is particularly important that vaccination not be deferred in HBV-uninfected patients who are engaging in high-risk behaviors (eg, unprotected sex with a partner with chronic HBV infection, active injection drug use) or who have household members with chronic HBV. Repeat vaccination can be performed for individuals who do not develop protective immunity. (See <a href=\"#H168646187\" class=\"local\">'Response to vaccination'</a> below and <a href=\"#H889861000\" class=\"local\">'Assessing vaccine response'</a> below and <a href=\"#H1081647609\" class=\"local\">'Anti-HBs &le;10 milli-international units/mL after initial series'</a> below.)</p><p>Some patients will have anti-HBs levels &le;10 milli-international <span class=\"nowrap\">units/mL</span> after receiving their initial hepatitis B vaccine series. Such individuals should be revaccinated. The management of patients who do not respond to their initial vaccine series is discussed below. (See <a href=\"#H1081647609\" class=\"local\">'Anti-HBs &le;10 milli-international units/mL after initial series'</a> below.) </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1139268896\"><span class=\"h2\">Vaccine formulations</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Hepatitis B vaccines are recombinant vaccines. Yeast-derived vaccines (eg, Recombivax HB and Engerix-B) are used mainly in the United States, whereas mammalian cell-derived vaccines (eg, GenHevac B) are used primarily in Europe. The standard adult dose of the vaccine depends upon the formulation: the Recombivax HB dosage is 10 <span class=\"nowrap\">mcg/mL;</span> the Engerix-B vaccine dosage is 20 <span class=\"nowrap\">mcg/mL;</span> and the GenHevac B vaccine is 20 <span class=\"nowrap\">mcg/mL</span>. A more detailed discussion on the different vaccine formulations is found elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hepatitis-b-virus-vaccination#H11\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Hepatitis B virus vaccination&quot;, section on 'Dose regimens'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hepatitis-b-virus-vaccination#H2\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Hepatitis B virus vaccination&quot;, section on 'Types of vaccines'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1081647588\"><span class=\"h2\">Dose and schedule of vaccination</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1330205610\"><span class=\"h3\">Initial series</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The standard dosing schedules for the three recombinant vaccines are the same, with doses being administered intramuscularly at zero, one, and six months (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F82634\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef82634 \">figure 1</a>). However, the immune response to the hepatitis B vaccine can be lower in HIV-infected individuals compared with those who are HIV-uninfected (see <a href=\"#H320336899\" class=\"local\">'Likelihood of response'</a> below). Other vaccine strategies have therefore been tested, including a strategy using a double-dose vaccine at zero, one, and six months, with or without an additional dose at two months. Using an accelerated schedule that finishes before six months is <strong>not</strong> recommended, except in patients who are unlikely to complete their initial series. (See <a href=\"#H1604800084\" class=\"local\">'Accelerated dosing schedule'</a> below.)</p><p>Different authorities have varying approaches to vaccination:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>One approach, endorsed by guideline recommendations, is to administer the standard three-dose regimen [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-hepatitis-b-virus-infection-in-the-hiv-infected-adult/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A second approach is to start with a double dose of vaccine (eg, Engerix-B vaccine at 40 rather than 20 <span class=\"nowrap\">mcg/mL),</span> which is administered on a standard schedule or with the addition of a dose at month two. </p><p/><p>Regardless of the strategy that is used, the vaccine should ideally be administered <strong>before</strong> the CD4 count declines to &lt;350 <span class=\"nowrap\">cells/microL</span> to improve immunogenicity. In addition, patients should be tested for anti-HBs one month after they complete the vaccine series to make sure they develop a protective immune response. (See <a href=\"#H168646187\" class=\"local\">'Response to vaccination'</a> below.) </p><p>The available data do not suggest that one strategy is superior to the other [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-hepatitis-b-virus-infection-in-the-hiv-infected-adult/abstract/6,13-17\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,13-17</a>]. As examples:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A meta-analysis compared the vaccine response in 438 HIV-infected individuals who received a double dose with 445 HIV-infected patients who received a standard dose [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-hepatitis-b-virus-infection-in-the-hiv-infected-adult/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. There was a significant increase in response (defined as anti-HBs &gt;10 milli-international <span class=\"nowrap\">units/mL)</span> among those who received the double dose (odds ratio 1.82, 95% CI 1.35-2.47). There was no increase in serious adverse events among those who received the high versus standard dose of the vaccine. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>However, a subsequent randomized trial of 132 HIV-infected adults with an undetectable plasma HIV-1 RNA found no significant difference in the percentage of individuals who achieved an anti-HBs &ge;10 milli-international <span class=\"nowrap\">units/mL</span> among those who received the standard three-dose series, a four-dose series using the standard dose, and a four-dose series using the double dose [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-hepatitis-b-virus-infection-in-the-hiv-infected-adult/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. </p><p/><p>The choice of which vaccine strategy to start with depends upon the preferences of the patient and the provider. As an example, the standard dose regimen may be well suited for patients who do not have risk factors for HBV infection. In contrast, starting with a double-dose regimen may be preferable for those with potential ongoing HBV exposures (eg, injection drug users, individuals whose sexual partner has chronic HBV infection, persons with household members who have chronic HBV) and those who are unlikely to follow-up with long-term medical care. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1604800084\"><span class=\"h3\">Accelerated dosing schedule</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>An accelerated dosing schedule may be useful for patients who are unlikely to complete their initial series. Several studies have described low overall immunization rates against HBV infection among HIV-infected patients and low completion rates among those who do initiate the vaccine series [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-hepatitis-b-virus-infection-in-the-hiv-infected-adult/abstract/1,18\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,18</a>]. If an accelerated schedule is administered, data support the use of a dosing schedule at zero, one, and three weeks [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-hepatitis-b-virus-infection-in-the-hiv-infected-adult/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. </p><p>However, this schedule may not be as effective, especially for patients with CD4 count counts &lt;500 <span class=\"nowrap\">cells/microL</span>. As an example, one study evaluated this accelerated HBV immunization schedule in 761 HIV-infected infected patients with a range of CD4 counts (&lt;200 <span class=\"nowrap\">cells/microL,</span> 200 to 500 <span class=\"nowrap\">cells/microL,</span> and &gt;500 <span class=\"nowrap\">cells/microL)</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-hepatitis-b-virus-infection-in-the-hiv-infected-adult/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. Although adherence was better in the accelerated vaccination arm, overall seroconversion rates were lower in the group that received the accelerated series compared with those who received the standard dosing regimen (39 versus 50 percent). However, the response varied significantly by CD4 count, and the accelerated schedule was not inferior to the standard schedule in patients with a CD4 count &gt;500 <span class=\"nowrap\">cells/microL</span> (n = 364). In this study, anti-HBs titers were only assessed at week 28; thus, no long-term data are available on decay of antibody titers.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1139270080\"><span class=\"h3\">Missed doses</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients who miss doses of their primary series can resume the series at any time. Hepatitis B surface antibody titers should be checked approximately four weeks after the last vaccine dose has been administered. (See <a href=\"#H889861000\" class=\"local\">'Assessing vaccine response'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1240057994\"><span class=\"h2\">Patients with isolated anti-HB core antibody</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Some patients have evidence of prior HBV infection (anti-HBc) but do <strong>not</strong> have detectable HBsAg (evidence of chronic infection) or anti-HBs (evidence of immunity). These patients may have lost their anti-HBs over time or have occult HBV infection (as evidenced by presence of HBV DNA in serum). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hepatitis-b-virus-screening-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Hepatitis B virus: Screening and diagnosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Guidelines recommend such patients be vaccinated with a complete series followed by anti-HBs testing [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-hepatitis-b-virus-infection-in-the-hiv-infected-adult/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. While some UpToDate authors agree with these guidelines, other experts check HBV DNA in patients with isolated anti-HBc and only vaccinate individuals if the HBV DNA is not detected. Patients with a detectable HBV DNA will not respond, regardless of dose; thus, these individuals should receive antiretroviral therapy that is active against both HIV and HBV instead of vaccination. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-chronic-hepatitis-b-in-the-hiv-infected-patient\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of chronic hepatitis B in the HIV-infected patient&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Once the decision to immunize is made, the available evidence suggests that most HIV-infected patients with isolated anti-HBc should undergo a three-dose primary immunization series [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-hepatitis-b-virus-infection-in-the-hiv-infected-adult/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. However, some providers check the anti-HBs levels after the first dose of the vaccine to see if an antibody response is elicited. Developing a protective antibody response after a single dose would be consistent with an anamnestic response from prior infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-hepatitis-b-virus-infection-in-the-hiv-infected-adult/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. </p><p>The utility of hepatitis B vaccination in patients with isolated core antibody was evaluated in a study of 54 HIV-infected patients with isolated anti-HBc and an undetectable HIV RNA [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-hepatitis-b-virus-infection-in-the-hiv-infected-adult/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. Individuals received one 20 mcg dose of recombinant HBV vaccine, and those with anti-HBs &lt;10 milli-international <span class=\"nowrap\">units/mL</span> four weeks after the vaccine received three additional 40 mcg doses at weeks 5, 9, and 24. At week 4, 25 patients (46 percent) had anti-HBs &ge;10 milli-international <span class=\"nowrap\">units/mL</span>. By month 18, 50 percent of these responders maintained anti-HBs &ge;10 milli-international <span class=\"nowrap\">units/mL</span>.

HIV-infected individuals are at increased risk of developing chronic infection, cirrhosis, and end-stage liver disease compared with HIV-uninfected patients who acquire HBV. (See <a href=\"#H2121100\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>All HIV-infected patients should be evaluated for hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection. Patients should be tested for hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg), hepatitis B surface antibody (anti-HBs), and hepatitis B core antibody (anti-HBc) upon HIV diagnosis. (See <a href=\"#H2121445\" class=\"local\">'Serologic screening'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients without evidence of prior hepatitis B virus (HBV) exposure (negative for HBsAg, anti-HBs, and anti-HBc), we recommend hepatitis B vaccination (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=1\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1A</a>). For patients who are only positive for anti-HBc (ie, negative for HBsAg and anti-HBs), there are low quality data to guide a specific approach to vaccination. Some UpToDate experts vaccinate all individuals who have isolated anti-HBc, whereas others check HBV DNA and only vaccinate such individuals if the HBV DNA is negative. (See <a href=\"#H1072434190\" class=\"local\">'Whom to vaccinate'</a> above and <a href=\"#H1240057994\" class=\"local\">'Patients with isolated anti-HB core antibody'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The serologic response to HBV vaccine is lower in HIV-infected compared with HIV-uninfected individuals.

To improve immunogenicity, the vaccine should ideally be administered <strong>before</strong> the CD4 count declines to &lt;350 <span class=\"nowrap\">cells/microL</span>. However, we vaccinate HIV-infected individuals, regardless of their CD4 count since some immunosuppressed individuals will still respond.
