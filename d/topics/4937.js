Even in institutions with a policy of routine cesarean delivery for breech presentation, vaginal breech deliveries occur because of situations such as precipitous delivery, out of hospital delivery, lethal fetal anomaly or fetal death, and mother's preference for vaginal birth. Therefore, it is essential for clinicians to maintain the skills of vaginal breech delivery. </p><p>This topic will review techniques for breech birth. Choosing the best route of delivery of the fetus in breech presentation is reviewed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-issues-related-to-breech-presentation\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of issues related to breech presentation&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">VAGINAL BREECH DELIVERY</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Criteria for an optimal patient selection</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Various criteria have been developed to minimize the risk of vaginal breech delivery. These criteria for patient selection are largely based upon clinical experience, and typically include the following characteristics [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/delivery-of-the-fetus-in-breech-presentation/abstract/1-4\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-4</a>]. In a prospective series of over 8000 women with breech presentation at term, only about 30 percent of women met these criteria [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/delivery-of-the-fetus-in-breech-presentation/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>No contraindication to vaginal birth (eg, placenta previa, contracted pelvis, cord presentation) &ndash; There is no convincing evidence that information from pelvimetry (clinical, radiograph, magnetic resonance imaging, computed tomography) for managing women with breech presentation leads to improved neonatal outcome [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/delivery-of-the-fetus-in-breech-presentation/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].

If this large presenting part passes easily through the <span class=\"nowrap\">cervix/pelvis,</span> then subsequent head entrapment is unlikely. In footling presentations, however, the legs and trunk deliver sequentially. The presenting part is smaller than the combination of thigh and trunk and can pass through an incompletely dilated cervix or small pelvis. In this setting, the aftercoming head may become entrapped. Therefore, footling breech <span class=\"nowrap\">delivery/extraction</span> is usually limited to delivery of a second twin.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Estimated fetal weight &ge;2000 g and &le;4000 g -- Dystocia related to large fetal size is a major concern in breech presentation since, in contrast to the cephalic presentation, the largest diameters of the fetus deliver last rather than first. Fetal growth restriction is also a concern because about half of the perinatal deaths in the Term Breech Trial were in growth-restricted fetuses [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/delivery-of-the-fetus-in-breech-presentation/abstract/4,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,7</a>]. This may have been due to an increased risk of fetal acidosis related to chronic placental insufficiency compounded by the unavoidable cord compression that occurs during the second stage of labor [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/delivery-of-the-fetus-in-breech-presentation/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Absence of a fetal anomaly that may cause dystocia.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>No hyperextension of the fetal head (ie, an extension angle of greater than 90 degrees) -- Hyperextension should be excluded by ultrasound, or radiograph if ultrasound is unavailable.

Perform a vaginal examination immediately following spontaneous rupture of membranes to exclude cord prolapse [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/delivery-of-the-fetus-in-breech-presentation/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. The risk is about 1 percent with a frank breech, but &ge;10 percent with a footling breech [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/delivery-of-the-fetus-in-breech-presentation/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Most experts recommend continuous electronic fetal heart rate monitoring, given the increased risk of cord compression [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/delivery-of-the-fetus-in-breech-presentation/abstract/1,4,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,4,11</a>]. After membranes have ruptured, a scalp electrode may be attached to the buttocks if external monitoring is inadequate [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/delivery-of-the-fetus-in-breech-presentation/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Monitor and record labor progress, as with a cephalic presentation. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Epidural analgesia is useful because it relieves pain, prevents the mother from pushing involuntarily before full cervical dilatation, and provides anesthesia if obstetrical maneuvers are needed to facilitate delivery. However, the mother should be able to push effectively when the breech descends to the pelvic floor [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/delivery-of-the-fetus-in-breech-presentation/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In the latent phase or after initiation of epidural anesthesia, we administer <a href=\"topic.htm?path=oxytocin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">oxytocin</a> to treat hypocontractile uterine activity. However, poor progress in the active phase may be an indicator of fetopelvic disproportion; therefore, we do not administer oxytocin once active labor has begun [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/delivery-of-the-fetus-in-breech-presentation/abstract/4,17,18\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,17,18</a>]. If labor progress is inadequate in the active phase, we perform a cesarean delivery.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">The normal progress of labor in the breech presentation has not been evaluated as extensively as cephalic presentation. Descent is regarded as adequate if the breech reaches the level of the ischial spines when the cervix is 6 cm dilated and reaches the pelvic floor at full dilation. A passive second stage (ie, delayed pushing) for up to 90 minutes is acceptable [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/delivery-of-the-fetus-in-breech-presentation/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. However, once the woman starts bearing down, failure of the breech to descend and deliver within 30 to 60 minutes is managed by cesarean delivery rather than breech extraction.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">The rationale for this approach is based largely on good outcomes in observational studies of vaginal breech birth using strict selection criteria, adherence to an intrapartum protocol with a low threshold for intervention, and with an experienced obstetrician in attendance. In one large retrospective study from the National Maternity Hospital in Dublin, up to one hour was allowed for descent of the breech to the pelvic floor in the second stage [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/delivery-of-the-fetus-in-breech-presentation/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. Delivery was expected within one hour of active pushing in nulliparas and 30 minutes in multiparas, and resulted in neonatal outcomes comparable to cesarean delivery. The largest prospective series of planned vaginal breech birth included 2526 women who had 1796 vaginal breech deliveries [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/delivery-of-the-fetus-in-breech-presentation/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. Perinatal mortality and morbidity were very low (0.08 and 1.6 percent, respectively), and the duration of the active second stage was less than one hour in 99.8 percent of patients. In the Term Breech Trial, neonatal morbidity appeared to be increased in infants delivered after an active second stage longer than one hour [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/delivery-of-the-fetus-in-breech-presentation/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. In an observational study in Finland, morbidity was increased when the active second stage of labor exceeded 40 minutes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/delivery-of-the-fetus-in-breech-presentation/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. These data suggest that cesarean delivery is preferable if birth is not imminent after 30 to 60 minutes of active maternal pushing or the second stage of labor exceeds 2.5 hours.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Delivery of the term fetus</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4057709747\"><span class=\"h3\">Graphic aids</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Approaches to delivery of the term breech fetus are described below and illustrated by the figures (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F70941%7EOBGYN%2F51966%7EOBGYN%2F59678%7EOBGYN%2F73540%7EOBGYN%2F52537\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef70941 graphicRef51966 graphicRef59678 graphicRef73540 graphicRef52537 \">figure 1A-E</a>) and in videos.

The following simulation video illustrates one clinician's approach to vaginal breech delivery using Piper forceps to extract the aftercoming head (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F73745\" class=\"graphic graphic_movie graphicRef73745 \">movie 1</a>).</p><p>A free video demonstrating vaginal breech delivery is also available online at the <a href=\"http://apps.who.int/rhl/videos/en/&amp;token=yqChGO0eHAjuA8dyAICLapqxj4IKhCcwNeqs4yA7zYkXAIsLrwHu9K1Hwh19NQ/Y&amp;TOPIC_ID=5384\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">World Health Organization&rsquo;s (WHO) Reproductive Health Library (RHL)</a> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/delivery-of-the-fetus-in-breech-presentation/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. </p><p>In addition, a cognitive task list of the key factors in a vaginal breech delivery has been developed based on the practice of a panel of obstetricians experienced in breech delivery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/delivery-of-the-fetus-in-breech-presentation/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h3\">Maternal preparation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>We place the mother in the lithotomy position with a wedge under one side of her buttocks. A retrospective study reported better outcomes (fewer interventions, shorter second stage and fewer neonatal injuries) when the mother was upright than recumbent for breech delivery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/delivery-of-the-fetus-in-breech-presentation/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. Upright postures included kneeling and leaning on the head of the bed, on all fours, or occasionally standing. Given the limitations of retrospective comparisons, we have not adopted this approach and await more and better data, preferably from randomized trials.</p><p>If epidural analgesia is not in place, a pudendal block may be performed once the breech has descended onto the perineum to facilitate episiotomy or forceps delivery, although this not the author&rsquo;s usual practice. Episiotomy is performed if required to facilitate delivery, and only after the fetal anus is visible at the vulva. Many clinicians perform routine episiotomy in breech delivery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/delivery-of-the-fetus-in-breech-presentation/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. There are no data from randomized trials to guide practice.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1031920199\"><span class=\"h3\">General principles</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There is a general consensus that spontaneous or assisted breech delivery is acceptable, whereas breech extraction should be avoided in singleton pregnancies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/delivery-of-the-fetus-in-breech-presentation/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. A key point is to avoid assisting the delivery until maternal efforts have resulted in expulsion of the fetus to the umbilicus or more, and then to apply suprapubic pressure to promote flexion and descent of the head. Rotation of the trunk and extraction of limbs, when needed to assist this process, is acceptable, but traction on the trunk should be avoided as it is thought to cause extension of the arms and head and nuchal arms, which make delivery more difficult [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/delivery-of-the-fetus-in-breech-presentation/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h3\">Trunk and legs</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Maternal expulsive efforts alone should be adequate to deliver the fetus' buttocks and lower limbs if not extended. The mother is encouraged to bear down until the feet, legs, and trunk to the scapulae are visible. The body is supported in a plane at or below the horizontal plane of the birth canal.</p><p>If the legs are extended after the umbilicus has delivered, the operator may use <span class=\"nowrap\">his/her</span> fingers to exert pressure on the back of the knee (Pinard maneuver) and guide the thigh away from the trunk as the trunk is rotated in the opposite direction. This causes the knee to flex and allows extraction of the foot and the leg (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F51966\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef51966 \">figure 1B</a>). The same procedure can be repeated, if needed, to deliver the other leg and foot.</p><p>Cord pulsation is checked and a small loop pulled down to prevent traction on the cord. Meconium passage is common.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h3\">Arms</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>After delivery of the trunk and legs, the mother is asked to push again and the shoulders should present in the anterior-posterior plane and deliver spontaneously, one at a time, along with the arms, which are usually crossed in front of the chest.</p><p>Shoulder dystocia with breech presentation is usually due to extension of the arms or nuchal arms. This is typically caused by traction on the fetus early in the delivery. If the trunk is pulled down, the arms can drag behind, whereas uterine contractions and maternal expulsive efforts tend to push the entire fetus in its normal flexed attitude into the birth canal.</p><p>If the arms do not deliver spontaneously, intervention is required. The fetus is held by the hips or bony pelvis, never by the abdomen, as injury to the <span class=\"nowrap\">kidneys/adrenals</span> is possible. We wrap the <span class=\"nowrap\">legs/pelvis</span> in a towel to provide a good grip and keep the back upwards. The fetus is rotated through 180 degrees to deliver the first shoulder and arm, then in the opposite direction so the other shoulder and arm deliver under the symphysis pubis (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F78129%7EOBGYN%2F50980\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef78129 graphicRef50980 \">figure 2A-B</a>). The second rotation may be assisted by gentle traction on the delivered arm in the direction of the rotation.</p><p>Failure of the shoulders and arms to deliver with simple rotation of the trunk is managed by sliding an index finger along the fetal scapula, over the shoulder, and into the antecubital fossa. The elbow is then swept in front of the face and downward to the chest, at which point the arm can be delivered (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F59678\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef59678 \">figure 1C</a>). This procedure is repeated for the other side. Gentle rotation of the fetal trunk at the same time, keeping the back anterior (ie, toward the ceiling), will assist this maneuver.</p><p>If the arms remain trapped behind the neck, the fetus can be rotated so the chest is facing the symphysis pubis. This helps to dislodge the nuchal arm(s) and allows the elbow to be swept down and extracted, as described above. Arm extraction can cause shoulder dislocation or broken bones, but these complications are less morbid than prolonged dystocia resulting in asphyxia.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h3\">Head</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>At this stage, the fetal head may appear without any further effort on the operator's part. If the hairline is not visible after the shoulders have delivered, the body is turned to face the floor and suprapubic pressure is applied by an assistant to flex the head and push it down into the pelvis (Bracht maneuver) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F62701\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef62701 \">figure 3</a>). The combination of encouraging maternal expulsive effort, avoiding traction on the fetus by the clinician, and applying suprapubic pressure to prevent a prolonged expulsion phase allowed Bracht to reduce perinatal mortality from a baseline of 3.2 percent to 0 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/delivery-of-the-fetus-in-breech-presentation/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].</p><p>Once the hairline is visible, the head is delivered. We prefer to use forceps for delivery of the aftercoming head. If forceps delivery is not possible or desired, the fetus's legs are swung upwards, keeping the vulva completely covered with the operator's other hand to keep the head from &quot;popping.&quot; This hand is then opened slowly to allow first the face and then the remainder of the head to deliver with maternal expulsive efforts.</p><p>The Mauriceau-Smellie-Veit maneuver is favored by some obstetricians for routine delivery of the head. The fetal trunk lies along the operator&rsquo;s right forearm, with legs straddling the forearm. The middle finger of the right hand is placed on the maxilla, and the second and fourth fingers on the malar eminences to promote flexion and descent while counter-pressure is applied to the occiput with the middle finger of the left hand. Traction on the jaw should be avoided because of the possibility of temporomandibular joint injury [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/delivery-of-the-fetus-in-breech-presentation/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. </p><p>With either forceps or spontaneous delivery, it is essential that the fetal legs are supported, but the trunk should be no more than 45 degrees above horizontal; this avoids traction on the cervical spine during delivery of the head. If the body is bent backwards too far (eg, over the mother's abdomen), hyperextension of the neck can occlude the vertebral arteries and can lead to necrosis of the cervical cord. Excess weight on the cervical spine from downward traction can have the same effect or dislocate the fetus&rsquo;s neck.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h3\">Use of forceps</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>As mentioned above, we prefer to use forceps for delivery of the aftercoming head. The feet are grasped and, using as much traction as required to keep the body straight and take weight off neck, the legs are swung upwards to no more than 45 degrees above horizontal, where they are held by an assistant using a towel to make certain they do not slip. The operator then applies Piper's forceps (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F78716%7EOBGYN%2F56439\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef78716 graphicRef56439 \">picture 1A-B</a>) and (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F73745\" class=\"graphic graphic_movie graphicRef73745 \">movie 1</a>). The assistant moves the fetal body to the mother's right so the operator, in a kneeling position, can apply the left blade. Initially the handle of the forceps is held below the mother's thigh, almost at right angles to her body and to her right. Using two fingers of the right hand as a guide, the toe of the blade is eased into the vagina and directed upward at an angle about 45 degrees below the horizontal plane and over the infant&rsquo;s right ear. The left hand gradually moves the handle along a curve, downward and toward midline, while the fingers of the right hand guide the toe and protect the vaginal wall and side of the fetal head.</p><p>Unlike a cephalic delivery, a breech delivery means that the smallest part of the fetal skull appears at the vulva first with the large parietal area at the back of the pelvis. Thus, if the forceps handle is brought to midline too soon after insertion of the blade, the distal part of the blade will dig into the side of the head and it will not be possible to lock the handles. The tip must be kept directed at the maternal sacrum for as long as possible, which means that the guiding hand has to be inserted well into the vagina until the tip has passed around the occiput.</p><p>The assistant then moves the fetus to the left and a similar procedure is performed for insertion of the right blade. The handles are locked when both handles reach midline, and the fetal body straddles the shank.</p><p>Elevating the handles of the forceps and mild traction result in flexion and extraction of the head (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F57167%7EOBGYN%2F68911\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef57167 graphicRef68911 \">figure 4A-B</a>). The mouth can be cleared as soon as it is seen.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h3\">Head entrapment</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Head entrapment is a potentially serious complication of breech delivery. The preterm fetus is at high risk because its fetal head-to-abdominal circumference ratio is larger than that of a mature fetus; therefore, the premature breech head may be caught in a partially dilated cervix, resulting in acute asphyxia from compression of the umbilical cord. This can also happen with a larger fetus, especially if the mother begins to push before full cervical dilatation occurs. In both premature and mature fetuses in breech presentation, the skull may not have sufficient time to mold when passing through the bony pelvis. This may also play a role in head entrapment and can result in damage to the occipital bone during delivery.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Administer a uterine relaxant</strong> &ndash; If the head is entrapped, our preference is to administer a uterine relaxant, either a beta adrenergic agonist (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=terbutaline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">terbutaline</a> 0.25 mg subcutaneously or 2.5 to 10 <span class=\"nowrap\">mcg/minute</span> intravenously) or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nitroglycerin-glyceryl-trinitrate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">nitroglycerin</a> (50 to 200 mcg intravenously). Uterine relaxation may allow the head to be delivered.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">If uterine relaxation alone is unsuccessful, all other options pose significant risk to the fetus and mother.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Symphysiotomy</strong> &ndash; Successful delivery of the obstructed aftercoming-head by symphysiotomy has been reported in observational studies, primarily in Sub-Saharan Africa, where facilities for safe cesarean delivery may not be available and some clinicians have experience with this procedure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/delivery-of-the-fetus-in-breech-presentation/abstract/27-32\" class=\"abstract_t\">27-32</a>]. No randomized trials have been performed.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">The Society of Obstetricians and Gynecologists of Canada recommend the use of symphysiotomy when needed to deliver an obstructed aftercoming head of the breech fetus [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/delivery-of-the-fetus-in-breech-presentation/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. In this very rare situation, the symphysis pubis and overlying skin are infiltrated with local anesthetic, and a firm plastic catheter is inserted into the urethra and used to displace the urethra laterally. Two assistants support the mother's legs at no more than 90 degrees abduction. Using a scalpel, a small incision is made over the symphysis and the anterior fibers of the pubic symphysis are divided. This allows the symphysis to separate just enough to allow delivery of the head. The small skin incision may be left unsutured, or closed with a suture if needed for hemostasis. The mother rests in bed for about two days, and then is mobilized on crutches until free weightbearing is comfortable.

Delay in rupturing the membranes until the fetus has passed through the vagina reduces the risk of entrapment of the aftercoming head by an insufficiently dilated cervix, helps protect the fetus from trauma, and impedes cord prolapse [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/delivery-of-the-fetus-in-breech-presentation/abstract/37,38\" class=\"abstract_t\">37,38</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H696193946\"><span class=\"h3\">D&uuml;hrssen incisions</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>If the head of the (usually preterm) fetus is entrapped and the cervix is effaced, but incompletely dilated, the cervical os can be enlarged surgically. One or two fingers are placed between the cervix and the presenting part to protect the fetus and allow the surgeon to palpate the cervicovaginal junction. Bandage scissors are used to make one to three incisions (D&uuml;hrssen incisions) extending the full length of the remaining undilated cervix, typically at 2, 10, and 6 o'clock. A major disadvantage of this technique, which is rarely performed, is that the incisions may extend into the lower uterine segment and broad ligament, with potential injury to uterine vessels, ureter, and bladder, and severe hemorrhage.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h1\">CESAREAN BREECH DELIVERY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The abdominal and uterine incisions should be sufficiently large to allow easy, atraumatic fetal extraction.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14\"><span class=\"h2\">Mature breech</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>We suggest planned cesarean delivery for breech presentation between 39 and 41 weeks of gestation or in early labor to allow maximum time for spontaneous cephalic version and minimize the risk of respiratory problems in the neonate.

The technique of fetal extraction through the hysterotomy incision is similar to that described above for vaginal breech delivery and, likewise, forceps should be available for controlling delivery of the aftercoming head.</p><p>Care should be taken not to hyperextend or place too much traction on the cervical spine.

Since this was an observational series and the patients delivered by low transverse incisions had different characteristics than those delivered by low vertical incisions, we cannot conclude that the two incisions were similarly safe and effective. Case by case clinical judgment should guide this decision.</p><p>Whichever incision is used, the fetus must be delivered gently and atraumatically. Forceps, if the appropriate size is available, are useful for the aftercoming head.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4183678388\"><span class=\"h1\">SPECIAL SITUATIONS</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2364925933\"><span class=\"h2\">Delivery of the hydrocephalic fetus in breech presentation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Breech presentation is more common when there are fetal anomalies, particularly hydrocephaly. For this reason, it is important to exclude fetal anomalies before choosing the route of birth.</p><p>For a viable breech fetus with significant hydrocephaly, delivery should be by cesarean to avoid head entrapment. Both the uterine and the abdominal incisions should be large enough to accommodate easy extraction of the head. A transverse incision in the lower segment may be too small so it is preferable to use a vertical lower segment incision, which may have to be extended into the upper segment.</p><p>For a nonviable fetus with hydrocephaly, vaginal breech birth is preferable since vaginal birth is generally safer for the mother and perinatal asphyxia is not a concern when congenital anomalies are lethal. If head entrapment occurs during spontaneous labor, the calvarium can be decompressed and collapsed by cephalocentesis. The author uses a wide-bore spinal needle, but use of other similar instruments has been described in case reports. The procedure is easier to perform when the head is fixed at the pelvic brim than when it is mobile in the upper segment. It may be done transvaginally, but is usually more easily performed transabdominally. In the United States, a deliberate intentional act that results in the death of a partially delivered fetus with a heart rate during an abortion may be unlawful (partial birth abortion). It is prudent to consult a hospital attorney and review state and federal regulations before performing cephalocentesis.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H369031839\"><span class=\"h2\">Delivery in the absence of skilled assistance and appropriate facilities</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The following synopsis describes management of women during imminent delivery of a fetus in breech presentation not occurring on the Labor and Delivery Unit. It is intended for health care providers who do not perform obstetrical deliveries as part of their usual practice.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Call for help. There are two patients in an obstetrical delivery, the mother and the infant; each needs at least one health care provider. An obstetrician and pediatrician or family practitioners should be summoned, if available.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>If no part of the fetus has emerged from the vagina, encourage the mother not to bear down; &ldquo;panting&rdquo; may help her to avoid pushing. This provides some time to get her to the labor and delivery unit <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> for the arrival of a skilled birth assistant.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A beta sympathomimetic drug (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=terbutaline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">terbutaline</a> by injection) may help to reduce the strength and frequency of uterine contractions; however, once the fetus is partially born (the buttocks or a leg or legs are visible at or beyond the introitus), it is better to assist with completing the birth. The umbilical cord will usually be compressed during delivery so the fetus should be delivered ideally within 10 minutes.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The most important principle is to avoid any traction on the fetus unless there is absolutely no progress over several minutes of maternal bearing-down efforts. Pulling on the fetus tends to cause the head to extend, which makes birth of the head more difficult.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>When the fetal buttocks present at the introitus, support the mother in a semi-upright, crouching, or kneeling position (whichever feels best to her) with her thighs flexed and apart, and encourage her to bear down as strongly as she is able during contractions. In most cases, the entire fetus will deliver spontaneously, and only gentle support of the body is needed as the head is born.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>If there is delayed progress of the birth, try turning the mother to a kneeling position and have her bear down in this position. Alternatively, apply gentle, steady pressure on the top of her uterus, towards her pelvis, during contractions. Avoid sharp pressure.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>If there is no further progress, attempt the maneuvers described in this topic.
