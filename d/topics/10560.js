The management of patients who are difficult-to-wean in the ICU is reviewed here. Details regarding readiness testing, methods of weaning, and the management of patients who require prolonged mechanical ventilation in long-term care facilities are provided separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-and-prognosis-of-patients-requiring-prolonged-mechanical-ventilation\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management and prognosis of patients requiring prolonged mechanical ventilation&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H950210004\"><span class=\"h1\">DEFINITION AND INCIDENCE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Weaning can be classified as simple, difficult, or prolonged.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Simple wean &ndash; Patients are considered to have undergone a simple wean when they pass their first spontaneous breathing trial (SBT). Approximately half to two-thirds of patients in intensive care units (ICUs) undergo simple weaning, many of which will proceed with extubation. Details regarding what constitutes an SBT and extubation management are discussed separately [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-the-difficult-to-wean-adult-patient-in-the-intensive-care-unit/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>].

The incidence ranges from 26 to 39 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-the-difficult-to-wean-adult-patient-in-the-intensive-care-unit/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>]. This population mostly includes patients intubated in the first few weeks of acute ICU admission. This population is discussed in this topic review. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Prolonged weaning &ndash; Patients are considered to have undergone prolonged weaning if they fail at least three SBTs or require more than seven days to pass an SBT. The incidence ranges from 6 to 14 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-the-difficult-to-wean-adult-patient-in-the-intensive-care-unit/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>]. Patients who require more than seven days to wean are at increased risk for death [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-the-difficult-to-wean-adult-patient-in-the-intensive-care-unit/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>] and are also more likely to fail extubation compared with those who undergo simple weaning [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-the-difficult-to-wean-adult-patient-in-the-intensive-care-unit/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. While in the ICU, many of these patients are managed similarly to patients who are difficult to wean, many will require tracheostomy and be managed accordingly. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-tracheostomy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of tracheostomy&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-and-prognosis-of-patients-requiring-prolonged-mechanical-ventilation\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management and prognosis of patients requiring prolonged mechanical ventilation&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">IDENTIFY AND CORRECT THE CAUSE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Repeat unsuccessful attempts at weaning usually signify incomplete resolution of the illness that precipitated mechanical ventilation <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> the development of one or more new problems that prevent weaning. The clinician should identify and treat these issues before resuming further weaning trials.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Identify the cause(s) &ndash; Numerous factors contribute to failure to wean (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F115677\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef115677 \">table 1</a>) by causing an imbalance between respiratory muscle strength and the work of breathing. Respiratory and cardiac issues are common while psychological, ventilator, or nutrition-related issues are less common. Most of the etiologies are apparent on routine clinical examination, laboratory testing, arterial blood gas analysis, electrocardiography, and chest radiography, as well as an assessment of sedative medications and the ventilator circuit. Additional investigations may be indicated depending upon the suspicion for select etiologies. (See <a href=\"#H1369577013\" class=\"local\">'Respiratory or ventilatory causes'</a> below and <a href=\"#H695502268\" class=\"local\">'Cardiac causes'</a> below and <a href=\"#H2184162837\" class=\"local\">'Psychological causes'</a> below and <a href=\"#H213328902\" class=\"local\">'Ventilator circuit issues'</a> below and <a href=\"#H186027662\" class=\"local\">'Nutritional issues'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Treat the cause &ndash; When feasible, identified etiologies that contribute to difficult weaning should be treated to improve the probability of successful weaning. As an example, in a series of 12 difficult-to-wean patients who failed weaning due to the development of hypertension during their spontaneous breathing trial (SBT), antihypertensive therapy during the SBT was associated with successful weaning in the majority (92 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-the-difficult-to-wean-adult-patient-in-the-intensive-care-unit/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. In another study of 42 patients who failed weaning, nine of whom were assessed as having heart failure succeeded on a later occasion after diuretic therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-the-difficult-to-wean-adult-patient-in-the-intensive-care-unit/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Resume weaning &ndash; Once it is felt that the likely cause of ventilator dependency has been corrected, readiness testing (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F62377\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef62377 \">table 2</a>) should be performed to determine whether weaning can be resumed. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=weaning-from-mechanical-ventilation-readiness-testing\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Weaning from mechanical ventilation: Readiness testing&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1369577013\"><span class=\"h2\">Respiratory or ventilatory causes</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span><span class=\"nowrap\">Respiratory/ventilatory</span> causes of failure to wean, their detection and treatment are listed in the table (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F115677\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef115677 \">table 1</a>). </p><p>Manifestations are often nonspecific and include tachycardia, tachypnea, respiratory distress, or oxygen desaturation during a breathing trial.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Routine testing including chest, cardiac, and neurological examination (including an assessment for delirium), complete blood count and chemistries (including calcium, magnesium, and phosphate), chest radiography, arterial blood gas analysis, and nutrition assessment will narrow the differential considerably. Additional testing is individualized and targeted at specific suspected etiologies (eg, computed tomography [CT] of the chest <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> abdomen, CT pulmonary angiography, nerve conduction studies, bronchoscopy [to look for airway pathology]).</p><p/><p>Frequently overlooked causes include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Auto-positive end-expiratory pressure (auto-PEEP) &ndash; The detection and treatment of auto-PEEP are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=positive-end-expiratory-pressure-peep#H9\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP)&quot;, section on 'Auto (intrinsic) PEEP'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Overventilation &ndash; A common mistake made is to ventilate patients who have chronic hypercapnia with a minute ventilation that normalizes the arterial carbon dioxide tension (PaCO<sub>2</sub>). This causes the pH to rise and prompts renal excretion of bicarbonate over three to five days until the pH normalizes. When the patient resumes spontaneous ventilation, such as that during an SBT, an acute respiratory acidosis will result because there is insufficient bicarbonate for buffering (thereby constituting a failed SBT). Thus, patients with chronic hypercapnia should be mechanically ventilated in between SBTs with a minute ventilation that maintains the patient's usual PaCO<sub>2</sub>.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Imposed work of breathing by endotracheal tubes &ndash; Small-sized endotracheal tubes (ETTs) or ETTs narrowed by secretions can significantly increase the work of breathing and produce a pattern of rapid shallow breathing observed in patients with weaning failure (akin to breathing through a straw) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-the-difficult-to-wean-adult-patient-in-the-intensive-care-unit/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. Use of a pressure support SBT may overcome the imposed work of breathing by the ETT, and facilitate successful weaning [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-the-difficult-to-wean-adult-patient-in-the-intensive-care-unit/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].</p><p/><p>Large pleural effusions, which are common in ventilated patients are sometimes thought to contribute to failure to wean. However, while drainage may improve oxygenation and lung volumes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-the-difficult-to-wean-adult-patient-in-the-intensive-care-unit/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>], it has not been conclusively shown to reduce mechanical ventilation days. Thus, we typically avoid large volume thoracentesis in this setting unless indicated for another reason. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H695502268\"><span class=\"h2\">Cardiac causes</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Weaning-induced myocardial ischemia or cardiac dysfunction (ie, heart failure) may contribute to difficult weaning in 20 to 60 percent of patients and when identified, should be treated accordingly (eg, optimize beta-blockade, diuresis) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F115677\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef115677 \">table 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-the-difficult-to-wean-adult-patient-in-the-intensive-care-unit/abstract/10,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,11</a>]. Because of the increased work involved in spontaneous breathing, myocardial demand increases, thereby resulting in ischemia in susceptible individuals, and pulmonary edema in those with underlying cardiac dysfunction. Ischemia <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> pulmonary edema, in turn, further increase the work of breathing, creating a vicious cycle. </p><p>Because PEEP is a treatment for heart failure, weaning-induced cardiac dysfunction may be hard to detect when SBT strategies that include PEEP, rather than a t-tube or non-PEEP strategies, are used [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-the-difficult-to-wean-adult-patient-in-the-intensive-care-unit/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. Thus, cardiac dysfunction should be suspected in patients who pass an SBT that included PEEP but who fail extubation and require re-intubation because of acute heart failure.</p><p>Manifestations include tachycardia, tachypnea, oxygen desaturation, hypertension or even hypotension during a breathing trial. Patients rarely complain of chest pain, and ST depressions are only occasionally appreciated on a bedside monitor. Risk factors identified in one retrospective study included chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, previous cardiomyopathy, and obesity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-the-difficult-to-wean-adult-patient-in-the-intensive-care-unit/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>].</p><p>When ischemia is suspected, most experts use continuous multi-lead electrocardiography (EKG) during the SBT, or record an EKG pre- and post-the trial. Rarely, patients require cardiac catheterization for diagnosis. If ischemia is identified, it should be treated. The treatment of myocardial ischemia and cardiac dysfunction are described separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-the-acute-management-of-non-st-elevation-acute-coronary-syndromes\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of the acute management of non-ST elevation acute coronary syndromes&quot;</a>.)</p><p>When cardiac dysfunction is suspected, transthoracic echocardiography is used in conjunction with clinical examination and brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) to justify optimizing cardiac medications and altering fluid management. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-the-therapy-of-heart-failure-with-reduced-ejection-fraction\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of the therapy of heart failure with reduced ejection fraction&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-and-prognosis-of-heart-failure-with-preserved-ejection-fraction\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment and prognosis of heart failure with preserved ejection fraction&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>BNP levels &ndash; The possibility that weaning is limited by cardiac dysfunction is suggested by an elevated BNP or N-terminal pro-BNP prior to the weaning trial, an elevated N-terminal pro-BNP at the end of the trial, or a &gt;20 percent increase in BNP during the SBT [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-the-difficult-to-wean-adult-patient-in-the-intensive-care-unit/abstract/6,13-15\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,13-15</a>]. Interventions based upon BNP levels alone are not typically routine. However, one randomized trial reported that BNP-guided fluid management, particularly in patients with left ventricular systolic dysfunction, and reduced time to extubation (59 versus 42 hours) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-the-difficult-to-wean-adult-patient-in-the-intensive-care-unit/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Echocardiography &ndash; The identification of systolic or diastolic dysfunction by transthoracic echocardiography (TEE) may favor cardiac dysfunction as cause of failure to wean. However, TEE is nonspecific and only identifies patients who are at risk of failure to wean [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-the-difficult-to-wean-adult-patient-in-the-intensive-care-unit/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>], rather than proving that failure to wean in an individual is due to cardiac dysfunction. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=transthoracic-echocardiography-normal-cardiac-anatomy-and-tomographic-views\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Transthoracic echocardiography: Normal cardiac anatomy and tomographic views&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">While not routine, some echocardiographic parameters and stress echocardiography have been described as potentially useful in identifying weaning-induced cardiac dysfunction. One retrospective study reported that an elevated ratio of early ventricular filling velocity (E) to late ventricular filling velocity (A) measured by echocardiography during weaning was associated with an elevated pulmonary artery occlusion pressure during weaning; whether this increased the likelihood of failure to wean was not determined [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-the-difficult-to-wean-adult-patient-in-the-intensive-care-unit/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. In another study of 161 patients mechanically ventilated for cardiogenic shock who were stable and had an ejection fraction of 45 percent, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dobutamine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">dobutamine</a> stress echocardiography was useful in identifying silent systolic and diastolic dysfunction in patients with weaning failure compared with those who successfully passed an SBT [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-the-difficult-to-wean-adult-patient-in-the-intensive-care-unit/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Other reported methods that require further validation include:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Passive leg raising (PLR) &ndash; One study reported that patients who fail to increase cardiac output by &gt;10 percent during PLR (negative PLR test) are significantly more likely to fail an SBT with a pulmonary artery occlusion pressure (PAOP) &gt;18 mmHg at the end of the trial [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-the-difficult-to-wean-adult-patient-in-the-intensive-care-unit/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. In another trial, a positive PLR was associated with a successful weaning trial while a negative one was associated with failure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-the-difficult-to-wean-adult-patient-in-the-intensive-care-unit/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>].

When suspected as contributors to difficult weaning, sedative medications should be adjusted and the psychological issue treated, if feasible (eg, anti-psychotic, anxiolytic, analgesic).</p><p>Depression, anxiety, and delirium are common in ventilated individuals. Depressive disorders are present in approximately 40 percent of patients undergoing weaning from prolonged mechanical ventilation and their presence adversely affects weaning success [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-the-difficult-to-wean-adult-patient-in-the-intensive-care-unit/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. In another study, patients with delirium were twice as likely to be difficult-to-wean compared with those without delirium [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-the-difficult-to-wean-adult-patient-in-the-intensive-care-unit/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>].</p><p>Such disorders may be hard to assess and may simply manifest as agitation, grimacing, disorientation, tachycardia, and hypertension during the trial. </p><p>Interventions that may minimize these factors include explaining the weaning plan to the patient, family, and other caretakers; arranging for a trusted caretaker to provide reassurance and explanation during weaning trials; biofeedback (if feasible or available) that displays the breathing pattern [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-the-difficult-to-wean-adult-patient-in-the-intensive-care-unit/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]; ensuring adequate sleep; and environmental stimulation during the trial, such as television, radio, or books. Efforts to optimize medications for treating delirium, anxiety (eg, switching anxiolytic to <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dexmedetomidine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">dexmedetomidine</a>), and pain should also be performed. Oversedation should be avoided.

Potential problems include equipment dead space, poor circuit compliance, low gas compression volume, exhalation valve function, and increased resistance caused by the ETT, inspiratory circuit, or expiratory circuit [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-the-difficult-to-wean-adult-patient-in-the-intensive-care-unit/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. Consulting respiratory therapy and examining the pressure and flow tracings on the ventilator screen can help identify and eliminate potential ventilator-related problems. As examples: </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>An elevated peak inspiratory airway pressure (Ppeak) with a sizeable difference between the Ppeak and plateau pressure (Pplat) may suggest an obstructed ETT or abnormally increased resistance in ventilator circuit tubing (assuming that the patient is on volume cycled ventilation). Examining the ETT and circuit for obstructions or secretions may reveal an obvious source that needs to be treated accordingly (eg, replace ETT or tubing, frequent suctioning, remove the obstruction).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>An increase in both Ppeak and Pplat may suggest a malfunction of the exhalation valve, which should be checked if this waveform abnormality is found. However, such changes may also result from issues not related to the ventilator circuit (ie, processes that decrease respiratory system compliance such as pulmonary edema, pneumothorax, pleural effusion).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Ventilator asynchrony may be evident on waveforms. This manifests as minimal or no inspiratory flow, despite patient inspiratory effort due to continued neural inspiration (contraction of inspiratory muscles) after the ventilator has cycled to the expiratory phase (ie, premature opening of the exhalation valve). This may lead to a transient but prominent decrease in peak expiratory flow, followed by increase and then a slow decrease again as neural expiration ends [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-the-difficult-to-wean-adult-patient-in-the-intensive-care-unit/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. Such inspiratory effort increases the work of breathing and may injure the inspiratory muscles as they contract eccentrically (eg, the muscle contracts while lengthening).&nbsp;If suspected, the cause of ventilator asynchrony should be sought and treated (eg, auto-PEEP).</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H186027662\"><span class=\"h2\">Nutritional issues</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Protein catabolism induced by critical illness leads to decreased respiratory muscle mass, strength, and endurance, which may lead to difficulty weaning from mechanical ventilation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-the-difficult-to-wean-adult-patient-in-the-intensive-care-unit/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. Although it is rare for malnutrition to be the sole cause, it can contribute to difficulty weaning such that this population should be evaluated by a nutrition expert and their nutrition support optimized. This approach is based upon studies that report a possible decrease the number of ventilator-free days when adequate nutrition is provided, the details of which are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nutrition-support-in-critically-ill-patients-an-overview\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Nutrition support in critically ill patients: An overview&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Overfeeding with excessive carbohydrates can impair weaning success [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-the-difficult-to-wean-adult-patient-in-the-intensive-care-unit/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>], presumably by leading to excess carbon dioxide production and an increased ventilatory load on the respiratory muscles. While in the past overfeeding was common, it is now a rare phenomenon.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2562666064\"><span class=\"h1\">RESUMING WEANING TRIALS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Once the potential causes have been identified and treated, weaning trials may resume. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1022818273\"><span class=\"h2\">General strategies</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4052091712\"><span class=\"h3\">Posture</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients should be placed in the posture that they prefer during a weaning trial. For example, patients with diaphragmatic paralysis generally prefer and perform better in an upright position because their vital capacity decreases when they are horizontal. In contrast, patients with intercostal muscle weakness (eg, due to a low cervical cord lesion) may prefer being supine because their lung volumes tend to increase when they move from an upright to a supine position. In patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, the optimal posture varies.
