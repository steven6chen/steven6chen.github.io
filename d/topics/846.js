It can happen very quickly and can cause death. Anaphylaxis can happen after a person:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Eats a food he or she is allergic to</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Takes a medicine he or she is allergic to</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Is stung by an insect he or she is allergic to</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Touches something made out of latex if he or she is allergic to latex</p><p/><p>Other triggers can also cause anaphylaxis.</p><p>You might know if you are allergic to something. But you can also have anaphylaxis even if you don't know you have an allergy.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H40065105\"><span class=\"h1\">What are the symptoms of anaphylaxis?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Anaphylaxis can involve one or more parts of the body. The most common symptoms are: </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Hives &ndash; Raised, red patches of skin that are very itchy (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F79242\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef79242 \">picture 1</a>)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Angioedema &ndash; A condition that causes puffiness, usually of the face, eyelids, ears, mouth, hands, or feet</p><p/><p>Other symptoms can include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Redness or itching of the skin (without hives)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Swelling or itching of the eyes</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Runny nose or swelling of the tongue</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Trouble breathing, wheezing, or a change in your voice</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Throwing up or having diarrhea</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Feeling dizzy or passing out</p><p/><p>With anaphylaxis, you can get very sick, very quickly. Your symptoms can also change. You might first get hives on your skin. Soon after that, you might throw up or have trouble breathing. Each time you have anaphylaxis, you can have different symptoms. Symptoms also differ from person to person.</p><p>The symptoms you have with anaphylaxis can be worse if you:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Have asthma</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Have other health problems such as lung or heart disease</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H40065119\"><span class=\"h1\">How is anaphylaxis treated?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There are treatments that can help reduce anaphylaxis symptoms quickly. The best treatment is a medicine called &quot;<a href=\"topic.htm?path=epinephrine-adrenaline-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">epinephrine</a>.&quot; Epinephrine comes in a shot. Ambulance crews and doctors can give it.</p><p>People who have had anaphylaxis before often get a prescription for a device called an &quot;autoinjector&quot; (for example, the EpiPen). This device has a shot of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epinephrine-adrenaline-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">epinephrine</a> that you can give yourself. If you have an autoinjector, you should keep it with you at all times. Use it right away any time you think you are having anaphylaxis. After you use the autoinjector, <strong>call for an</strong> <strong>ambulance (in the US and Canada, dial 9-1-1)</strong>. That's because the symptoms might come back and you might need more treatment in the hospital. A doctor or nurse will also watch you to make sure your symptoms do not come back.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1478764669\"><span class=\"h1\">Should I see a doctor or nurse?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Yes. If you think you have anaphylaxis, act fast! If you have an <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epinephrine-adrenaline-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">epinephrine</a> auto-injector, use it right away. Then <strong>call for an ambulance (in the US and Canada, dial 9-1-1)</strong>. Do not try to get yourself to the hospital because you might pass out or stop breathing on the way there. Also, calling an ambulance is usually the fastest way to get help.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H40065126\"><span class=\"h1\">Is there anything I can do to prevent anaphylaxis again?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Yes. If you have had anaphylaxis, you should talk with your doctor or nurse. If needed, your doctor can do tests to find out what you are allergic to.</p><p>Your doctor can help you make a plan to prevent future anaphylaxis. As part of your plan, you can:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Learn about the symptoms of anaphylaxis so you will know when to get help</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Have an <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epinephrine-adrenaline-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">epinephrine</a> auto-injector with you at all times </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Avoid foods, medicines, or insects you are allergic to</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Wear a medical bracelet to let others know about your allergy</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H40065133\"><span class=\"h1\">What will my life be like?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Many people who have had anaphylaxis are able to live normal lives. But you might need to make some changes in your life. You will need to avoid the things that can cause you to have anaphylaxis. You might need to carry medicine with you in case you have an allergic reaction.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H40065147\"><span class=\"h1\">More on this topic</span></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=food-allergy-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Food allergy (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=insect-bites-and-stings-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Insect bites and stings (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=peanut-allergy-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Peanut allergy (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=drug-allergy-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Drug allergy (The Basics)</a></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=anaphylaxis-symptoms-and-diagnosis-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Anaphylaxis symptoms and diagnosis (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=anaphylaxis-treatment-and-prevention-of-recurrences-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Anaphylaxis treatment and prevention of recurrences (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=allergy-to-penicillin-and-related-antibiotics-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Allergy to penicillin and related antibiotics (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=use-of-an-epinephrine-autoinjector-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Use of an epinephrine autoinjector (Beyond the Basics)</a></p></div><div id=\"reviewProcess\"><span>All topics are updated as new evidence becomes available and our <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/home/editorial-policy\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"policy policy_editorialpolicy\">peer review process</a> is complete.</span></div><div id=\"topicRetrievedDate\"><span class=\"emphasis\">This topic retrieved from UpToDate on: </span>Apr 02, 2018.</div><div id=\"disclaimer\">The content on the UpToDate website is not intended nor recommended as a substitute for medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.
