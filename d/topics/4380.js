A technique that facilitates catheter placement into lumens and body cavities was subsequently introduced by Sven-Ivar Seldinger in 1953 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complications-of-central-venous-catheters-and-their-prevention/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Insertion of a central venous catheter using the Seldinger technique has revolutionized medicine by allowing the central venous system to be accessed safely and easily [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complications-of-central-venous-catheters-and-their-prevention/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p>Central venous catheters are now common among critically ill patients. In the United States, over 15 million <span class=\"nowrap\">catheter-days/year</span> are recorded in the intensive care unit alone [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complications-of-central-venous-catheters-and-their-prevention/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Multilumen central venous catheters have become ubiquitous in the intensive care unit. New catheter designs, standardization of insertion techniques, use of ultrasound guidance, and subsequent central line management have reduced complication rates.</p><p>Mechanical complications associated with central venous catheter placement and removal and strategies to prevent these complications are discussed here. The placement of central venous catheters and infectious and thrombotic complications are discussed separately.

The most common are listed in the table (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F77376\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef77376 \">table 1</a>).</p><p>Published rates of cannulation success and complications vary according to the anatomic site, the use of ultrasound guidance, and operator experience. As an example, one review described an overall complication rate of 15 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complications-of-central-venous-catheters-and-their-prevention/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>], while an observational cohort study of 385 consecutive central venous catheter attempts over a six-month period found that mechanical complications occurred in 33 percent of attempts [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complications-of-central-venous-catheters-and-their-prevention/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. Complications included failure to place the catheter (22 percent), arterial puncture (5 percent), catheter malposition (4 percent), pneumothorax (1 percent), subcutaneous hematoma (1 percent), hemothorax (less than 1 percent), and asystolic cardiac arrest (less than 1 percent). In the past decade, the mechanical complication rate and failure rate have significantly decreased with the use of ultrasound-guided cannulation, especially for catheter insertion using the internal jugular site. The advantage of using ultrasound guidance is less well established when using the femoral or subclavian vein approach [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complications-of-central-venous-catheters-and-their-prevention/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=principles-of-ultrasound-guided-venous-access\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Principles of ultrasound-guided venous access&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Most mechanical complications (eg, pneumothorax) are detected at the time of catheter insertion. Mechanical complications at the time of catheter insertion are more common after attempted insertion in the subclavian vein compared with the internal jugular approach and least common for the femoral vein [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complications-of-central-venous-catheters-and-their-prevention/abstract/5,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,7</a>]. Despite this, subclavian insertion may be preferred in experienced hands since the rate of mechanical complications is largely operator dependent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complications-of-central-venous-catheters-and-their-prevention/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>], and the subclavian approach is associated with fewer bloodstream infections and symptomatic thrombosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complications-of-central-venous-catheters-and-their-prevention/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. Infectious and thrombotic complications usually occur later than mechanical complications.

The true incidence of subclavian vein stenosis remains unclear, but a 50 percent vein stenosis rate has been cited for subclavian vein dialysis catheters. The risk for central vein stenosis appears increased with placement in the left internal jugular or subclavian vein versus the right internal jugular or femoral vein, longer catheter dwell time, and the use of dialysis catheters versus smaller, more flexible catheters [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complications-of-central-venous-catheters-and-their-prevention/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=central-vein-stenosis-associated-with-hemodialysis-access\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Central vein stenosis associated with hemodialysis access&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h2\">Arrhythmia</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Ventricular dysrhythmias and bundle branch block are well-recognized complications during central venous access procedures. Periprocedural arrhythmias are universally the result of guidewire or catheter placement into the right heart. Limiting the depth of guidewire insertion to fewer than 16 cm avoids this complication [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complications-of-central-venous-catheters-and-their-prevention/abstract/9-11\" class=\"abstract_t\">9-11</a>]. Catheter migration up to 3 cm is common with patient movement, and repositioning may cause delayed symptoms. Nontunneled central venous catheters positioned deep into the right atrium or catheters placed in the right ventricle increase the risk for dysrhythmias and cardiac perforation, although cardiac perforation appears to be a rare event [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complications-of-central-venous-catheters-and-their-prevention/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h2\">Vascular injury</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Arterial puncture is noted in 3 to 15 percent of central venous access procedures [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complications-of-central-venous-catheters-and-their-prevention/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. The use of ultrasound during central catheter placement can help decrease inadvertent arterial puncture. (See <a href=\"#H1498481372\" class=\"local\">'Ultrasound guidance'</a> below and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=principles-of-ultrasound-guided-venous-access\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Principles of ultrasound-guided venous access&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Immediate recognition and management of arterial puncture usually prevents subsequent complications. Once an arterial stick is suspected, the needle is immediately withdrawn and direct but nonocclusive pressure applied to the site continuously for 15 minutes to prevent hematoma formation. Unrecognized arterial cannulation with subsequent dilation and catheter placement is associated with life-threatening hemorrhage and neurologic complications [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complications-of-central-venous-catheters-and-their-prevention/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. Late recognition of arterial cannulation increases the risk of hemorrhagic complications that may require surgical intervention. </p><p>If location of the catheter in the vein versus the artery is unclear, measuring intraluminal pressure with a transducer prior to dilation aids in recognizing arterial puncture [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complications-of-central-venous-catheters-and-their-prevention/abstract/4,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,14</a>]. Simple catheter removal, also known as the &quot;pull-and-pressure&quot; approach, may be considered for inadvertent femoral artery cannulation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complications-of-central-venous-catheters-and-their-prevention/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. Accidental cannulations of the carotid or subclavian artery by a large-bore catheter (&gt;7 F) can cause hemorrhage, stroke, pseudoaneurysm, or death. When the carotid or subclavian artery is cannulated by a large-bore catheter, before catheter removal, clinicians should consult immediately with a vascular surgeon for possible emergent vascular repair of the damaged artery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complications-of-central-venous-catheters-and-their-prevention/abstract/15,16\" class=\"abstract_t\">15,16</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14\"><span class=\"h2\">Pulmonary complications</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Free aspiration of air into the syringe may occur with pleural puncture but is often the result of incomplete seal of the syringe and needle. Suspected pleural puncture should prompt close attention for signs or symptoms of cardiopulmonary distress due to pneumothorax. Pleural puncture can quickly evolve into tension pneumothorax with hemodynamic collapse, especially in patients receiving positive pressure ventilation. The need for emergency intravenous access may require continued attempts at the same or alternative locations. Avoid contralateral supradiaphragmatic access attempts in close succession due to the potential for bilateral pneumothoraces. Hemothorax, hydrothorax, and chylothorax occur in a small fraction of torso cannulations.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15\"><span class=\"h2\">Venous air embolism</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Central venous access procedures create a risk for venous air embolism [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complications-of-central-venous-catheters-and-their-prevention/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. Venous air embolism is a serious and poorly recognized complication that can occur at the time of central venous catheter insertion, while the catheter is in place, or at the time of catheter removal [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complications-of-central-venous-catheters-and-their-prevention/abstract/18-20\" class=\"abstract_t\">18-20</a>]. Air is easily entrained into the vascular space when a needle or catheter is left open to the atmosphere. The effect of venous air embolization depends upon the rate and volume of air introduced into the venous circulation. Although the minimum volume of air that is lethal to humans has not been established, fatal doses of air measuring as little as 200 mL have been reported [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complications-of-central-venous-catheters-and-their-prevention/abstract/21,22\" class=\"abstract_t\">21,22</a>]. The lethal dose for humans has been theorized to be 3 to 5 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/kg</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complications-of-central-venous-catheters-and-their-prevention/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. Upright positioning, hypovolemia, spontaneous inhalation during instrumentation, and inattention to catheter seals increase the risk for entraining air. Affected patients can suffer cardiovascular and pulmonary symptoms including tachyarrhythmias, chest pain, cardiovascular collapse, dyspnea, coughing, hypoxemia, and respiratory distress. Symptoms such as these in association with central line insertion or manipulation are highly suspicious for venous air embolism. Left lateral decubitus and Trendelenburg positioning to trap the air in the right ventricular apex are often recommended but have not been rigorously studied. Supportive measures including fluid resuscitation and adrenergic agents should be used as needed. One hundred percent inspired oxygen may speed air resorption. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=air-embolism\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Air embolism&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8484243\"><span class=\"h2\">Bleeding</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Serious blood loss associated with central venous catheter placement is uncommon. Hematomas that form in the neck after inadvertent cannulation of the carotid artery may obstruct the airway and be life-threatening [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complications-of-central-venous-catheters-and-their-prevention/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. It remains uncertain when and if coagulation defects should be corrected prior to nonemergent central venous catheter placement [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complications-of-central-venous-catheters-and-their-prevention/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>].

However, this finding has not been universal [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complications-of-central-venous-catheters-and-their-prevention/abstract/30,31\" class=\"abstract_t\">30,31</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Nursing supervision &ndash; In a prospective cohort study, the patient's nurse used a checklist defining best practice to monitor the procedure and was empowered to stop the procedure if best practice was violated [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complications-of-central-venous-catheters-and-their-prevention/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>].

There were 323 breaches in catheter care and four catheter-related bloodstream infections (5.5 infections per 1000 catheter-days). The major breaches included dressings that were not intact (158 breaches per 1000 catheter-days) and incorrectly placed caps (156 breaches per 1000 catheter-days). This study suggests that there is substantial opportunity to better standardize and improve the maintenance of central venous catheters. Such care should also target earlier recognition of potentially infected catheter sites.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1498481333\"><span class=\"h2\">Mechanical problems</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Factors associated with fewer mechanical complications (eg, bleeding, blood vessel injury, pneumothorax, failure to cannulate the vein) include increased operator experience, site of insertion, fewer insertion attempts, patient body habitus, and ultrasound guidance.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1498481358\"><span class=\"h3\">Appropriate operator experience</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>It is unknown how many central venous catheters should be inserted by an operator each year to maintain his or her skills. However, experience is clearly important. In one prospective cohort study, operators who had previously inserted more than 50 central venous catheters were more likely to be successful at inserting subsequent central venous catheters with fewer complications.</p><p>Recognition of the importance of operator experience has prompted many hospitals to require that a certain number of successful central venous catheter insertions be performed before an operator can place central venous catheters without supervision. In addition, some centers use simulation labs with mannequins or have rotations through their cardiac catheterization lab to allow operators to receive highly supervised practice inserting central venous catheters [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complications-of-central-venous-catheters-and-their-prevention/abstract/34,35\" class=\"abstract_t\">34,35</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1498481365\"><span class=\"h3\">Limiting attempts</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The number of attempts is also related to the likelihood of a mechanical complication. In a prospective cohort study, the incidence of mechanical complications was sixfold higher when insertion was attempted more than three times, compared with successful insertion on the first attempt. It is, therefore, reasonable for an operator to seek assistance if a central venous catheter cannot be successfully inserted after three attempts to cannulate the vein or to insert the catheter [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complications-of-central-venous-catheters-and-their-prevention/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>].

The use of real-time ultrasound to guide cannulation of either the subclavian vein or femoral vein is less well studied.

The central venous catheter should be removed during exhalation, when intrathoracic pressure is greater than atmospheric pressure. Firm pressure should be applied for at least one minute following removal. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-central-venous-access#H1232389424\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of central venous access&quot;, section on 'Positioning'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H17\"><span class=\"h1\">SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We recommend that a protocol be used in all patients who require a central venous catheter (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=2\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1B</a>). One protocol proven to reduce central venous catheter-associated blood stream infections includes hand hygiene, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=chlorhexidine-gluconate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">chlorhexidine</a> skin antisepsis, maximal barrier precautions, avoiding femoral vein insertion, and prompt removal of unnecessary catheters. (See <a href=\"#H1498481307\" class=\"local\">'Infection'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Increased operator experience, fewer insertion attempts, and ultrasound guidance are associated with fewer mechanical complications. (See <a href=\"#H1498481333\" class=\"local\">'Mechanical problems'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Central venous catheters can be inserted into the internal jugular, external jugular, subclavian, femoral, or brachial vein (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F71716\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef71716 \">table 2</a>). The optimal site is determined by operator preference, operator experience, patient anatomy, and clinical circumstances. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-central-venous-access#H3103787\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of central venous access&quot;, section on 'Site selection'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Numerous complications are associated with central venous catheter placement (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F77376\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef77376 \">table 1</a>). Mechanical complications (eg, pneumothorax) tend to be detected at the time of catheter insertion, whereas infectious and thrombotic complications usually occur later. Venous air embolism and bleeding are the complications most likely to occur when the central venous catheter is removed.
