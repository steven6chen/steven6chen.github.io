Other aspects of ADEM are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acute-disseminated-encephalomyelitis-in-children-pathogenesis-clinical-features-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Acute disseminated encephalomyelitis in children: Pathogenesis, clinical features, and diagnosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">TREATMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Children with ADEM typically present with fever, meningeal signs, acute encephalopathy, and evidence of inflammation in blood and cerebrospinal fluid. Thus, consideration should be given to treatment with broad-spectrum antibiotics and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acyclovir-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">acyclovir</a> until an infectious etiology is excluded. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=bacterial-meningitis-in-children-older-than-one-month-treatment-and-prognosis#H13\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Bacterial meningitis in children older than one month: Treatment and prognosis&quot;, section on 'Empiric therapy'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=bacterial-meningitis-in-the-neonate-treatment-and-outcome#H3\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Bacterial meningitis in the neonate: Treatment and outcome&quot;, section on 'Antimicrobial therapy'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=viral-meningitis-management-prognosis-and-prevention-in-children#H8\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Viral meningitis: Management, prognosis, and prevention in children&quot;, section on 'Empiric therapy'</a>.)</p><p>The mainstay of treatment for ADEM is high-dose intravenous glucocorticoids [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-disseminated-encephalomyelitis-in-children-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>]. Glucocorticoids may be started at the time of the patient's presentation and can be used concurrently with antibiotics and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acyclovir-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">acyclovir</a>. Additional options include intravenous <a href=\"topic.htm?path=immune-globulin-intravenous-subcutaneous-and-intramsucular-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">immune globulin</a> and plasma exchange [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-disseminated-encephalomyelitis-in-children-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. However, the effectiveness of these treatments (glucocorticoids, intravenous immune globulin, and plasma exchange) for ADEM has not been definitively confirmed, as there are no prospective clinical trial data to determine optimal treatment, including dose or duration.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Glucocorticoids</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In several small observational studies, treatment of ADEM with intravenous <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methylprednisolone-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">methylprednisolone</a> (10 to 30 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> per day, maximum 1000 mg daily) or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dexamethasone-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">dexamethasone</a> (1 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> per day) for three to five days, followed by oral glucocorticoid taper over four to six weeks, was associated with full recovery in approximately 60 to 90 percent of patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-disseminated-encephalomyelitis-in-children-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/4-6\" class=\"abstract_t\">4-6</a>].</p><p>In the only study that compared these two treatments for ADEM, intravenous <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methylprednisolone-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">methylprednisolone</a> (n=21) was associated with a modestly better outcome, as measured by the median Expanded Disability Status Scale, than intravenous <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dexamethasone-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">dexamethasone</a> (n=25), and the difference was statistically significant [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-disseminated-encephalomyelitis-in-children-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. The strength of this result is limited by small patient numbers, lack of randomization, and lack of blinded treatment or assessment.</p><p>There is no convincing evidence that the use or duration of a tapering oral glucocorticoid regimen after intravenous glucocorticoid therapy influences outcome. Two small observational studies reported higher relapse rates in children with ADEM who were treated with shorter (three weeks or less) compared with longer glucocorticoid tapers, but this finding was not statistically significant [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-disseminated-encephalomyelitis-in-children-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/4,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,7</a>]. In addition, the results from one of these studies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-disseminated-encephalomyelitis-in-children-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>] were confounded by the inclusion of patients who had clinically isolated syndromes. Such patients might have a higher relapse risk compared with those who meet all criteria for the diagnosis of ADEM.</p><p>We recommend immunosuppressive treatment for ADEM in children, and suggest high-dose intravenous glucocorticoids as initial therapy. Although there is no consensus regarding glucocorticoid regimens, we use <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methylprednisolone-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">methylprednisolone</a> (30 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> per day, up to a maximum dose of 1000 mg per day) for five days. We use an oral <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prednisone-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">prednisone</a> taper only in children who continue to show clinical symptoms after completion of the high dose intravenous glucocorticoid treatment. The prednisone taper is typically started at a lower initial dose compared with the intravenous regimen. We begin the taper with oral prednisone 1 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> per day up to a maximum of 60 mg per day and then reduce the dose by 10 mg every five days to allow for a total tapering duration of four to six weeks.</p><p>For patients with relapse of disease, we suggest intravenous glucocorticoids for acute management, followed by a prolonged glucocorticoid taper. Some patients may benefit from prophylactic maintenance therapy with low-dose oral <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prednisone-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">prednisone</a> or monthly intravenous <a href=\"topic.htm?path=immune-globulin-intravenous-subcutaneous-and-intramsucular-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">immune globulin</a> (IVIG).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Intravenous immune globulin</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Data from small case series and case reports suggest that intravenous <a href=\"topic.htm?path=immune-globulin-intravenous-subcutaneous-and-intramsucular-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">immune globulin</a> (IVIG) is beneficial as rescue therapy in patients with ADEM who fail to respond to <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methylprednisolone-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">methylprednisolone</a> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-disseminated-encephalomyelitis-in-children-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/8-10\" class=\"abstract_t\">8-10</a>] or as initial therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-disseminated-encephalomyelitis-in-children-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. Dosing of IVIG in these studies ranged from 1 to 2 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/kg,</span> given either as a single dose, or divided over three to five days [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-disseminated-encephalomyelitis-in-children-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/8-11\" class=\"abstract_t\">8-11</a>].</p><p>No studies have compared IVIG treatment with glucocorticoids or plasma exchange [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-disseminated-encephalomyelitis-in-children-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].</p><p>We suggest IVIG for patients with ADEM who have an insufficient response to intravenous glucocorticoid treatment. Our preferred regimen is a total of 2 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/kg</span> given in divided doses over three days.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Plasma exchange</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Limited data suggest that plasma exchange is beneficial in children with ADEM who fail treatment with intravenous immunoglobulin <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methylprednisolone-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">methylprednisolone</a> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-disseminated-encephalomyelitis-in-children-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/12-15\" class=\"abstract_t\">12-15</a>]. The largest series was retrospective and reported improvement following plasma exchange in six children with ADEM who did not respond to initial treatment with glucocorticoids followed by IVIG [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-disseminated-encephalomyelitis-in-children-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. In another retrospective study, plasma exchange demonstrated some benefit for patients with idiopathic transverse myelitis when used in combination with intravenous glucocorticoids. Therefore, it may be of particular benefit for patients with ADEM associated with myelopathy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-disseminated-encephalomyelitis-in-children-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>].</p><p>We suggest treatment with plasma exchange for children with ADEM who have longitudinally extensive transverse myelitis and who fail treatment with glucocorticoids. Plasma exchange also should be considered for other patients with ADEM who fail to respond to treatment with glucocorticoids and IVIG. Our preferred regimen is a total of six exchanges, one every other day, with each exchange consisting of 1 to 1.5 plasma volumes.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Acute hemorrhagic leukoencephalitis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>As noted above, the prognosis for survival and recovery of neurologic function is worse for the hyperacute hemorrhage variants of ADEM, such as acute hemorrhagic leukoencephalitis (AHL), than for typical ADEM. (See <a href=\"#H55051393\" class=\"local\">'Prognosis'</a> below.)</p><p>A few case reports suggest that early high-dose glucocorticoid treatment may be associated with good recovery in children [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-disseminated-encephalomyelitis-in-children-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/6,17\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,17</a>] and adults [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-disseminated-encephalomyelitis-in-children-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>] who have hyperacute hemorrhagic variants of ADEM, including AHL. Another case report of an adult with AHL noted that prolonged immunosuppressive therapy with multiple agents (plasmapheresis, steroids, and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cyclophosphamide-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">cyclophosphamide</a>) was associated with a good recovery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-disseminated-encephalomyelitis-in-children-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>].</p><p>Given these data, we recommend immunosuppressive treatment for children with AHL and other hemorrhagic variants of ADEM. We suggest high-dose glucocorticoids as initial therapy, using intravenous <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methylprednisolone-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">methylprednisolone</a> (30 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> per day, up to a maximum dose of 1000 mg per day) for five days, followed by oral <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prednisone-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">prednisone</a> 1 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> per day, tapered by 5 mg every three days.</p><p>For children who do not have clinically significant improvement after five days of intravenous <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methylprednisolone-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">methylprednisolone</a>, we suggest IVIG (2 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/kg</span> given in divided doses over three days); plasma exchange (a total of six exchanges, one every other day) is an alternative. In addition, we suggest plasma exchange for children with clinical deterioration or lack of clinically significant improvement one week after receiving IVIG therapy.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h1\">EXTENDED FOLLOW-UP</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Follow-up MRI shows complete or partial resolution of abnormalities in the majority of ADEM cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-disseminated-encephalomyelitis-in-children-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/4,20,21\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,20,21</a>]. However, residual gliosis and demyelination persist in some.</p><p>Long-term clinical follow-up and sequential imaging by MRI are usually required to confirm the diagnosis of ADEM [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-disseminated-encephalomyelitis-in-children-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. The development of relapses with new lesions on MRI is not compatible with a diagnosis of monophasic ADEM, and suggests that the correct diagnosis is either multiphasic ADEM or multiple sclerosis, depending on the clinical and imaging features. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acute-disseminated-encephalomyelitis-in-children-pathogenesis-clinical-features-and-diagnosis#H19\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Acute disseminated encephalomyelitis in children: Pathogenesis, clinical features, and diagnosis&quot;, section on 'Multiphasic ADEM'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=differential-diagnosis-of-acute-central-nervous-system-demyelination-in-children\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Differential diagnosis of acute central nervous system demyelination in children&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pathogenesis-clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-pediatric-multiple-sclerosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pathogenesis, clinical features, and diagnosis of pediatric multiple sclerosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Although no consensus exists, some experts suggest obtaining at least two additional MRIs after the first normal MRI, over a period of at least five years from the initial episode of ADEM, to confirm the absence of new inflammatory demyelinating lesions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-disseminated-encephalomyelitis-in-children-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H55051393\"><span class=\"h1\">PROGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Most children with ADEM make a full recovery, usually slowly over four to six weeks. At follow-up, approximately 60 to 90 percent have minimal or no neurologic deficits [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-disseminated-encephalomyelitis-in-children-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/4-6,22-24\" class=\"abstract_t\">4-6,22-24</a>]. Although modern studies of ADEM in children report little or no mortality, earlier studies suggested that the mortality of postinfectious ADEM was as high as 5 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-disseminated-encephalomyelitis-in-children-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. The extent and site of lesions on the initial MRI do not predict the clinical outcome [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-disseminated-encephalomyelitis-in-children-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/6,26\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,26</a>].</p><p>The following case series illustrate the range of outcomes for children with ADEM:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The largest study included 84 children from Argentina with ADEM [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-disseminated-encephalomyelitis-in-children-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. At a mean follow-up of 6.6 years, the neurologic examination was either normal or detected minor abnormalities but no associated disability in 75 children (89 percent). Residual deficits in the remaining children included mild to severe hemiparesis, mild paraparesis, partial epilepsy, reduced visual acuity, and mental handicap.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a retrospective report of 33 children from the United States diagnosed with ADEM according to International Pediatric Multiple Sclerosis Study Group criteria, one child with monophasic ADEM had acute hemorrhagic leukoencephalitis and died, and another died eight years later from lymphoma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-disseminated-encephalomyelitis-in-children-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. Nine children (27 percent) developed relapses: four with recurrent ADEM, three with multiphasic ADEM, and two (6 percent) with multiple sclerosis. In follow-up (mean 9.2 years), mainly by telephone, complete recovery or only minor neurologic impairment was reported for 30 children (91 percent).<br/><br/>Diagnostic criteria for monophasic, recurrent and relapsing ADEM are described separately.
