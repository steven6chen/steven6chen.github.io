Blastomycosis of the lung can be asymptomatic or manifest as acute or chronic pneumonia. Hematogenous dissemination occurs frequently; extrapulmonary disease of the skin, bones, and genitourinary system is common, but almost any organ can be involved.</p><p>Unlike acute histoplasmosis, for which treatment often is not necessary, most patients with blastomycosis require therapy. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diagnosis-and-treatment-of-pulmonary-histoplasmosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Diagnosis and treatment of pulmonary histoplasmosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The antifungal agents proven to be useful in the treatment of blastomycosis will be reviewed here.

Lipid formulations of amphotericin B are effective in animal models of blastomycosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-blastomycosis/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>] but have not been studied in clinical trials [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-blastomycosis/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Despite this limitation, a lipid formulation is generally recommended for the treatment of blastomycosis when amphotericin B is indicated, since lipid formulations have been used extensively and are thought to be as effective as amphotericin B deoxycholate [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-blastomycosis/abstract/5-8\" class=\"abstract_t\">5-8</a>] while being less nephrotoxic and having fewer infusional toxicities [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-blastomycosis/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p>When administered in cumulative doses greater than 1 g, intravenous <a href=\"topic.htm?path=amphotericin-b-deoxycholate-conventional-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">amphotericin B deoxycholate</a> has been reported to result in cure without relapse in 77 to 91 percent of patients with blastomycosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-blastomycosis/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. A review of 326 blastomycosis cases over a 10-year period noted a cure rate of 86 percent and a relapse rate of only 4 percent for amphotericin B deoxycholate-treated patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-blastomycosis/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. Relapse rates appear to be dose dependent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-blastomycosis/abstract/3,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,11</a>]. In one series, for example, relapse occurred in 1 of 28 patients who received more than 1.5 g of amphotericin B deoxycholate compared with 6 of 21 patients who received less than 1.5 g [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-blastomycosis/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].</p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=amphotericin-b-deoxycholate-conventional-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Amphotericin B deoxycholate</a> therapy is frequently complicated by significant toxicity. A decline in kidney function is the most common serious complication and the most common reason for interruption or premature termination of therapy. Because of reduced nephrotoxicity and better central nervous system (CNS) penetration of one of the lipid formulations in an animal model, lipid preparations of amphotericin B are generally preferred. These are <a href=\"topic.htm?path=liposomal-amphotericin-b-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">liposomal amphotericin B</a> (AmBisome) and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=amphotericin-b-lipid-complex-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">amphotericin B lipid complex</a> (Abelcet). Of the lipid formulations, liposomal amphotericin B had the best CNS penetration in a study in rabbits, but it is unknown whether this is associated with greater clinical efficacy in humans [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-blastomycosis/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>].

In a randomized trial conducted by the Mycoses Study Group that compared 400 mg with 800 mg of ketoconazole per day, documented cure rates were 79 and 100 percent in 65 patients treated with ketoconazole at the lower and higher dose, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-blastomycosis/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. The higher dose was associated with an increased incidence of adverse effects. In other uncontrolled series, ketoconazole, at a dose of 400 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day</span> or more, produced a cure rate of 76 to 82 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-blastomycosis/abstract/10,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,14</a>]. However, relapse of blastomycosis is common after ketoconazole (10 to 14 percent), and toxicity occurs frequently [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-blastomycosis/abstract/10,13,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,13,14</a>]. <a href=\"topic.htm?path=itraconazole-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Itraconazole</a> has replaced ketoconazole as the oral azole of choice, as discussed below.</p><p>Due to the risk of severe liver injury and adrenal insufficiency associated with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ketoconazole-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ketoconazole</a>, in 2013, the US Food and Drug Administration revised the box warning, stating that oral ketoconazole should <strong>not</strong> be used as first-line treatment for any fungal infection and that it should be used for the treatment of endemic mycoses, such as blastomycosis, only when alternative antifungal therapies are not available or tolerated [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-blastomycosis/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. Additional information about monitoring patients receiving ketoconazole is presented separately.

Thus, itraconazole has replaced ketoconazole as the oral azole of choice for the treatment of non-life-threatening, non-CNS blastomycosis. Itraconazole has poor cerebrospinal fluid penetration. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pharmacology-of-azoles\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pharmacology of azoles&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The efficacy of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=itraconazole-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">itraconazole</a> was illustrated in a Mycoses Study Group nonrandomized open-label study in which it was effective in 90 percent of 48 patients with blastomycosis treated with daily doses of 200 to 400 mg [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-blastomycosis/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. In a separate study, only 1 of 42 patients failed the initial course of therapy with 200 mg itraconazole [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-blastomycosis/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. Four patients later relapsed; two were cured with a second course of itraconazole, and two required treatment with amphotericin B. Thus, 39 of 42 patients (93 percent) were eventually cured with itraconazole therapy.</p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=itraconazole-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Itraconazole</a> is generally well tolerated. In the Mycoses Study Group report cited above, treatment was discontinued in only 1 of 48 treated patients because of drug toxicity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-blastomycosis/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. Side effects include hepatotoxicity, hypokalemia, pedal edema, and, rarely, heart failure. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pharmacology-of-azoles#H11\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pharmacology of azoles&quot;, section on 'Adverse effects'</a>.)</p><p>There are important pharmacokinetic differences between the capsule and liquid preparations of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=itraconazole-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">itraconazole</a>. Absorption of the capsule formulation is highly variable, requires gastric acidity, and is enhanced when the agent is taken with food. Thus, in patients who receive concomitant medications that decrease gastric acidity, blood levels are reduced. In contrast, the liquid formulation has better bioavailability, does not require an acidic environment, and is taken on an empty stomach. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pharmacology-of-azoles#H5\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pharmacology of azoles&quot;, section on 'Pharmacokinetics'</a>.)</p><p>Whether the capsule or the liquid formulation is given, monitoring serum levels of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=itraconazole-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">itraconazole</a> in patients after two weeks of treatment is recommended [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-blastomycosis/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Serum concentrations predictive of failure or success of treatment have not been defined, but serum concentrations of itraconazole greater than 1 <span class=\"nowrap\">mcg/mL</span> are recommended.
