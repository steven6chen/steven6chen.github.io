GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors are ligand-gated chloride ion channels. When GABA binds to these receptors, it increases the amount of chloride current generated by the receptor. Benzodiazepines augment GABA&rsquo;s inhibitory effect by increasing the frequency of channel openings [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/benzodiazepine-use-disorder-epidemiology-pathogenesis-clinical-manifestations-course-and-diagnosis/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. This inhibitory effect leads to the anxiolytic, hypnotic, anticonvulsive, and muscle-relaxing properties of benzodiazepines. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3426975380\"><span class=\"h2\">Pharmacokinetics</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Benzodiazepines can be categorized into short (15 to 30 minutes), intermediate (30 to 60 minutes), and long-acting agents (one hour or longer). There are at least three determinants of the speed of action of benzodiazepines: half-life, rate of absorption, and lipophilicity. Half-life is determined by how the drug is metabolized and whether it has any active metabolites. A table (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F65653\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef65653 \">table 2</a>) provides data on the dosing and pharmacology of individual benzodiazepines, including their comparative potency, time to onset, metabolism type, and elimination half-life.</p><p>As an example, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diazepam-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">diazepam</a> has a long half-life because it is oxidized by the liver (a relatively slower process) and is metabolized into <a href=\"topic.htm?path=oxazepam-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">oxazepam</a>, which is an active anxiolytic. </p><p>Most benzodiazepines are absorbed completely but have differing rates of absorption. <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clorazepate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Clorazepate</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diazepam-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">diazepam</a> are both rapidly absorbed, which leads to more rapid increases in plasma levels of these drugs. The greater the lipophilicity of a benzodiazepine, the quicker it enters the brain and therefore a more rapid anxiolytic effect. Lipophilicity varies by &gt;50-fold among benzodiazepines [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/benzodiazepine-use-disorder-epidemiology-pathogenesis-clinical-manifestations-course-and-diagnosis/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. Diazepam is an example of a highly lipophilic benzodiazepine and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lorazepam-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">lorazepam</a> of a less lipophilic drug. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H457315067\"><span class=\"h2\">Physical dependence</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Chronic benzodiazepine use can cause physical dependence, as evidenced by the benzodiazepine withdrawal syndrome observed in many long-term benzodiazepine users upon cessation of the drug. The exact molecular mechanism for physical dependence from benzodiazepine use is not clear [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/benzodiazepine-use-disorder-epidemiology-pathogenesis-clinical-manifestations-course-and-diagnosis/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. </p><p>Chronic exposure to benzodiazepines causes reduced GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor response, and there are changes to GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor subtype expression with chronic benzodiazepine exposure, which leads to a reduced inhibitory response. There is an increased expression of excitatory glutamatergic receptors upon benzodiazepine withdrawal after chronic exposure, which could underlie the symptoms observed in the benzodiazepine withdrawal syndrome.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3473001662\"><span class=\"h2\">Addiction liability</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A review of animal and human studies that incorporated both human laboratory self-administration and epidemiological data, the liability to misuse benzodiazepines varied by type [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/benzodiazepine-use-disorder-epidemiology-pathogenesis-clinical-manifestations-course-and-diagnosis/abstract/19,20\" class=\"abstract_t\">19,20</a>]. Speed of onset appears to play a major role in the addiction liability of different benzodiazepine types. <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diazepam-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Diazepam</a> and flunitrazepam (widely available in Europe, Mexico, and Colombia, but not in the United States), two benzodiazepines with rapid onset, and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lorazepam-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">lorazepam</a> appear to have the greatest likelihood for misuse, although several commonly prescribed benzodiazepines, such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=alprazolam-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">alprazolam</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clonazepam-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">clonazepam</a>, were not included in these studies. </p><p>In a study that used doctor shopping as a proxy for benzodiazepine misuse, flunitrazepam had the highest potential for misuse, followed by <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diazepam-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">diazepam</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=alprazolam-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">alprazolam</a>, and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clonazepam-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">clonazepam</a> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/benzodiazepine-use-disorder-epidemiology-pathogenesis-clinical-manifestations-course-and-diagnosis/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. Flunitrazepam and diazepam are highly lipophilic and are rapidly absorbed. This causes a more rapid onset of action and may lead to a higher liability for misuse. &#160;</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4104817786\"><span class=\"h1\">PATHOGENESIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The pathogenesis of addiction is not fully understood; however, use of all addictive drugs, including benzodiazepines, involves increases in dopamine levels in the mesolimbic dopamine system, the reward system of the brain. The ventral tegmental area, located at the origin of the mesolimbic dopamine system, consists of GABA interneurons, and dopamine and glutamate neurons. When benzodiazepines bind GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors on GABA interneurons, they decrease the release of GABA onto dopamine neurons. This lowers the inhibitory effect of GABA interneurons on dopamine neurons, leading to increased dopamine transmission, a process called disinhibition. Benzodiazepines bind a pocket between the alpha and gamma subunits on GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors, and the alpha-1 subunit isoform is believed to be responsible for addictive behavior [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/benzodiazepine-use-disorder-epidemiology-pathogenesis-clinical-manifestations-course-and-diagnosis/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors with the alpha-1 subunit are abundant in GABA interneurons in the ventral tegmental area of mice [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/benzodiazepine-use-disorder-epidemiology-pathogenesis-clinical-manifestations-course-and-diagnosis/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>].</p><p>Synaptic plasticity, or changes in synaptic strength determined by prior synaptic activity, is thought to underlie learning and memory processes. Addictive drugs can cause long-lasting changes to the reward system. Early in this process, alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazole propionic acid (AMPA) receptors move from the interior to the surface of dopamine neurons, which leads to greater susceptibility to be stimulated by the excitatory neurotransmitter glutamate [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/benzodiazepine-use-disorder-epidemiology-pathogenesis-clinical-manifestations-course-and-diagnosis/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. Because of the AMPA receptor migration, future use of addictive drugs can lead to even greater dopamine transmission. Similar to other addictive drugs, benzodiazepine use in mice also leads to the same AMPA receptor migration and the synaptic plasticity found in other addictive drugs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/benzodiazepine-use-disorder-epidemiology-pathogenesis-clinical-manifestations-course-and-diagnosis/abstract/23,25\" class=\"abstract_t\">23,25</a>]. &#160; &#160; &#160;</p><p>The majority of genetic risk factors for benzodiazepine misuse or use disorder is believed to be non-substance specific and thus shared among different substances. In two twin studies, genetic influences were shared across multiple substances including sedatives, cannabis, and stimulants and not specific to substance [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/benzodiazepine-use-disorder-epidemiology-pathogenesis-clinical-manifestations-course-and-diagnosis/abstract/26,27\" class=\"abstract_t\">26,27</a>].
