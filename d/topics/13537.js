PTSD is characterized by intrusive thoughts, nightmares and flashbacks of past traumatic events, avoidance of reminders of trauma, hypervigilance, and sleep disturbance, all of which lead to considerable social, occupational, and interpersonal dysfunction.</p><p>Effective treatments for PTSD include medications and psychotherapies. However, a substantial proportion of patients have symptoms resistant to treatment. It is often necessary to switch or combine treatments to achieve a satisfactory therapeutic response.</p><p>The pharmacological treatment of PTSD is addressed in this topic. The epidemiology, pathophysiology, clinical manifestations, and diagnosis of PTSD are discussed separately, as is psychotherapy for PTSD. The epidemiology, pathophysiology, clinical manifestations, and diagnosis are also discussed separately. The treatment of acute stress disorder and prevention of the development of PTSD are also reviewed separately.

The diagnosis of PTSD is made after persistence of symptoms for at least four weeks following the trauma, but most patients present for treatment many months, or sometimes years, later. In theory, early treatment of PTSD may prevent chronicity, but this not been shown empirically, particularly for pharmacotherapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pharmacotherapy-for-posttraumatic-stress-disorder-in-adults/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p>The therapeutic goals of pharmacologic therapy are to decrease intrusive thoughts and images, phobic avoidance, pathological hyperarousal, hypervigilance, irritability and anger, and depression. Drug therapies have generally been most effective in decreasing hyperarousal and mood (irritability, anger, depression) symptoms, and somewhat less effective for the symptoms of re-experiencing, emotional numbing, and behavioral avoidance, but individual differences in response generally outweigh treatment-specific differences. There is a great deal of variation in response to pharmacologic treatment, with few robust individual predictors of response available [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pharmacotherapy-for-posttraumatic-stress-disorder-in-adults/abstract/2,3\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,3</a>]. Some ancillary symptoms of PTSD, such as sleep disturbance, can be particularly difficult to treat, and are among the symptoms that result in the use of polypharmacy that is so common in the treatment of PTSD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pharmacotherapy-for-posttraumatic-stress-disorder-in-adults/abstract/4,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,5</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5614705\"><span class=\"h2\">Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) are first-line medications for the treatment of PTSD. In a meta-analysis of seven randomized trials, patients treated with SSRIs were more likely to experience improvement in symptoms (on the Clinician Administered PTSD Scale or CAPS) and functioning than the group receiving placebo (RR 1.59, 95% CI 1.39-1.82) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pharmacotherapy-for-posttraumatic-stress-disorder-in-adults/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. An Institute of Medicine panel on the treatment of PTSD observed that these studies were not consistently positive and varied in quality [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pharmacotherapy-for-posttraumatic-stress-disorder-in-adults/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H689775\"><span class=\"h3\">Administration</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>SSRIs are typically started at the low end of their therapeutic range and titrated up gradually until response is achieved. Usual starting doses, low starting doses, and therapeutic dose ranges for commonly used SSRIs are shown in a table (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PSYCH%2F55682\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef55682 \">table 1</a>). Although there is not clear evidence of a dose-response relationship for SSRIs in PTSD, it is common practice to push the dose to the very high end of the therapeutic range (to the extent that this is tolerated by the patient) before concluding that a therapeutic trial has failed. Duration of a therapeutic trial of an SSRI should be a minimum of six to eight weeks before concluding that the medication has failed.</p><p>As an example, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=paroxetine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">paroxetine</a> can be started at 20 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day</span> orally. If minimal or no clinical response is seen after three to four weeks, increased doses in 10 to 20 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day</span> increments can be tried (with two to four weeks between dosage increases), up to 60 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day</span>. As another example, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sertraline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">sertraline</a> can be started at 25 or 50 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day</span> orally. If minimal or no clinical response is seen after three to four weeks, increased doses in 25 to 50 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day</span> increments can be tried (with two to four weeks between dosage increases), up to 250 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day</span>.</p><p>Side effects of SSRIs are discussed separately.

As an example, 329 adults with PTSD were randomly assigned to receive venlafaxine ER or placebo for 24 weeks. Patients receiving venlafaxine ER were more likely to experience remission of PTSD symptoms compared to patients receiving placebo (50.9 versus 37.5 percent) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PSYCH%2F55682\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef55682 \">table 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pharmacotherapy-for-posttraumatic-stress-disorder-in-adults/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].
