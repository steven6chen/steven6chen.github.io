The clinical manifestations of this group of diseases, called autoimmune hemolytic anemia (AIHA), depend greatly upon the type of antibody that is produced by the abnormal immune reaction.</p><p>This topic will review the mechanisms underlying AIHA due to cold agglutinins [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-autoimmune-hemolytic-anemia-cold-agglutinin-disease/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. The clinical features and treatment of this disorder and issues related to another form of cold-related hemolysis, paroxysmal cold hemoglobinuria, are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cold-agglutinin-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Cold agglutinin disease&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=paroxysmal-cold-hemoglobinuria\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Paroxysmal cold hemoglobinuria&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">NATURE OF THE AUTOANTIBODIES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In general, antibodies of two major types, each with specific characteristics, are produced in AIHA:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>IgM antibodies that generally react with polysaccharide antigens on the RBC surface only at temperatures below that of the core temperature of the body. They are therefore called &quot;<strong>cold</strong> agglutinins.&quot; Rarely, IgG antibodies have these reaction characteristics, occurring either alone or with IgM antibodies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-autoimmune-hemolytic-anemia-cold-agglutinin-disease/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>IgG antibodies that generally react with protein antigens on the RBC surface at body temperature. For this reason, they are called &quot;<strong>warm</strong> agglutinins&quot; even though they seldom directly agglutinate the RBCs. Rarely, IgM antibodies have these reaction characteristics and readily agglutinate red cells. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pathogenesis-of-autoimmune-hemolytic-anemia-warm-agglutinins-and-drugs\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pathogenesis of autoimmune hemolytic anemia: Warm agglutinins and drugs&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Antibodies of the IgA isotype are much less common and often of unknown significance. They can produce AIHA with either of the above reaction characteristics [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-autoimmune-hemolytic-anemia-cold-agglutinin-disease/abstract/3-5\" class=\"abstract_t\">3-5</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Antibody detection: the direct Coombs test</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The autoimmune hemolytic anemias are usually diagnosed by demonstrating an abnormality in a single clinical laboratory test, the direct antiglobulin test first described by RRA Coombs and therefore sometimes called the direct Coombs test. In this test, the RBCs of the patient are washed free of adherent proteins and reacted with antiserum or monoclonal antibodies prepared against the various immunoglobulins, particularly IgG and a fragment of the third component of complement, C3d. If either or both of these are present on the red cell surface, agglutination or some other endpoint will be detected (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F69817\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef69817 \">table 1</a>).</p><p>The IgM antibody of cold agglutinin disease and the IgG Donath-Landsteiner antibody in paroxysmal cold hemoglobinuria both show better fixation to the RBC surface at lower temperature. However, when these samples are warmed, the IgM antibody, which was only loosely bound, elutes from the surface, leaving only the attached complement sequences. A more complete discussion of the direct Coombs test can be found elsewhere (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pathogenesis-of-autoimmune-hemolytic-anemia-warm-agglutinins-and-drugs\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pathogenesis of autoimmune hemolytic anemia: Warm agglutinins and drugs&quot;</a>).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h1\">COLD AGGLUTININ DISEASE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>It was recognized very early that some red cell antigen-antibody interactions resulting in immune hemolysis occurred more readily or more strongly when the temperature was reduced. As an example, the agglutination induced by the major blood group antibodies (ie, naturally occurring anti-A and anti-B) is greater at 4&ordm;C than at room temperature. Antibodies were subsequently found in the serum of patients with hemolytic anemia that did not appear to interact with red cells at body temperature but reacted strongly at lower temperatures; these antibodies were called &quot;cold agglutinins&quot; [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-autoimmune-hemolytic-anemia-cold-agglutinin-disease/abstract/6,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,7</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">The antibodies</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>As mentioned above, cold agglutinins are nearly always IgM antibodies (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F103370\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef103370 \">table 2</a>). IgM antibodies have two antigen-binding sites sufficiently far apart to bridge the distance imposed upon red cells in suspension by physical forces (eg, charge, zeta potential) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-autoimmune-hemolytic-anemia-cold-agglutinin-disease/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. Thus, a single IgM molecule can bind two red cells together; if this occurs in a lattice-like network, agglutination results. Thus, very small concentrations of these antibodies, perhaps as few as 25 molecules per cell [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-autoimmune-hemolytic-anemia-cold-agglutinin-disease/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>], can be readily detected in vitro.</p><p>The specificity of the cold agglutinins is designated by their reactivity with adult and fetal red cells, both untreated and treated with specific enzymes. These antigens are present on all blood cells in varying concentrations, in contrast to many blood group antigens. The most common cold agglutinins are designated anti-I; they react best with untreated adult red cells (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F61974\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef61974 \">table 3</a>). Others, which react best with fetal or cord red cells, are called anti-i. Much less common are antibodies reacting with cells treated with proteases (anti-Pr) or with sialidase; the details of these specificities are given below. (See <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'The antigens'</a> below.)</p><p>Cold agglutinins are very restricted in their structure. Anti-I antibodies are more likely to be composed of kappa than lambda light chains. The components of the heavy chain are derived from a restricted set of variable domains. Out of about 100 possible V(H) genes available, nearly all antibodies of I, i, or j (I and i) specificity use a single V(H) gene, V(H)4-34 (formerly called V(H)4-21) in the primary assembly of the heavy chain [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-autoimmune-hemolytic-anemia-cold-agglutinin-disease/abstract/10-13\" class=\"abstract_t\">10-13</a>]. This produces a cross-reactive idiotype in all of these antibodies which can be detected by the monoclonal antibody, 9G4 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-autoimmune-hemolytic-anemia-cold-agglutinin-disease/abstract/11,13,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,13,14</a>].</p><p>The importance of 9G4 in cold anti-I and anti-i activity can be illustrated by the following observation. Many IgM antibodies specific for Rh antigens (59 percent in one series) are 9G4 positive [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-autoimmune-hemolytic-anemia-cold-agglutinin-disease/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. At 4&ordm;C, 16 and 44 percent of the 9G4-positive antibodies agglutinated I and i cells, respectively, compared with none of 9G4-negative antibodies. The epitope for the monoclonal antibody 9G4 is expressed on the heavy chain FR1 whereas the specificity for Rh epitopes (D) is generated by the light chains and CDRH3.</p><p>A hydrophobic patch in FR-1 is required for the antibody to bind the I antigen [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-autoimmune-hemolytic-anemia-cold-agglutinin-disease/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. Three-dimensional structure of the Fab of a human monoclonal IgM cold agglutinin with anti-I activity was determined and shows an extended cavity with an adjacent pocket, consistent with one that binds a polysaccharide [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-autoimmune-hemolytic-anemia-cold-agglutinin-disease/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. Since these parts of the molecule take part in forming the antigen binding site, this explains how both specificities may be expressed. Whether they work together for greater interaction with the red cell is not clear.</p><p>The V(H)4-34 variable region is also used in other IgM antibodies, including other autoantibodies, [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-autoimmune-hemolytic-anemia-cold-agglutinin-disease/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>], anti-DNA antibodies in systemic lupus erythematosus [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-autoimmune-hemolytic-anemia-cold-agglutinin-disease/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>], and antibodies against endotoxin [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-autoimmune-hemolytic-anemia-cold-agglutinin-disease/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>].</p><p>Cold agglutinins are relatively ineffective in bringing about hemolysis of the normal red cell. Since phagocytic or other cytotoxic cells of the immune system do not have receptors for IgM, all of the destruction that occurs is due to the fixation of complement. Normal red cells have surface proteins that protect them from the effects of complement (CD55 and CD59); thus, large numbers of complement-activation units must be fixed onto the RBC surface for lysis of the cell to occur. These units can only be generated when the blood circulates to the colder parts of the body (eg digits, ears, nose). The temperature at these sites must be low enough to allow the interaction between cell and antibody to occur.</p><p>The amount of hemolysis depends upon several factors, which explain the variability in the degree of hemolysis among patients with cold agglutinin disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-autoimmune-hemolytic-anemia-cold-agglutinin-disease/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The amount of antibody in the plasma. This is usually measured as the highest dilution of serum that will still agglutinate red cells in a 1 percent suspension. The titer varies greatly from patient to patient, ranging as high as 1:50,000 or more. All other things being equal, the higher the titer, the more hemolysis that occurs. Up to 95 percent of healthy blood donors have cold agglutinin titers &le;4 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-autoimmune-hemolytic-anemia-cold-agglutinin-disease/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The highest temperature at which the antibody reacts with antigen, which is also called the thermal amplitude. Most cold agglutinin antibodies react optimally at refrigerator temperature, very poorly at room temperature, and not at all at body temperature. If, however, their thermal amplitude is greater than 28 to 30&deg;C, the likelihood that these temperatures will be achieved in the peripheral parts of the body is increased and hemolysis will be more likely.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The degree to which antibody fixation is inhibited by the presence of C3d on the red cell surface. Since this fragment of complement is present on circulating cells, it inhibits the ability of some antibodies to generate further complement-initiating complexes, thereby reducing hemolysis. Those antibodies that are not so inhibited are more effective in lysing the circulating cells.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Some cold agglutinins affix to the red cells but do not readily fix complement. These antibodies are frequently cryoprecipitable. Thus, patients with such an antibody may have severe clinical agglutination (acrocyanosis, pain on swallowing cold fluids) but little or no hemolysis or anemia.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The specificity of the antibody may determine its ability to lyse red cells. Adult red cells have a reduced concentration of the unbranched (i) antigen (see below) and hence are less susceptible to lysis by antibodies with anti-i specificity.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>IgM normally consists of five IgG-like units (pentameric). In some examples of cold agglutinin, molecules containing six units occur (hexameric). These appear to be more hemolytic than normal molecules.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">The antigens</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The antigenic epitopes with which cold agglutinins react are invariably polysaccharide in structure. The reaction between the protein antibody and the sugars is largely through weaker bonds (eg, hydrogen bonding, van der Waals forces) rather than through more stable interactions (eg, ionic). This weak reaction may be due to the nature of both the antigen and the antigen binding site on the antibody, both of which are very restricted in their chemistry. These weak forces are made more effective by reduction in ambient temperature, which has the effect of reducing spontaneous Brownian movement, accounting for the cold-reactivity.</p><p>The antigens reacting with cold agglutinins are present on <strong>all</strong> red cells so that the specificity cannot be denoted from binary results (present or not present) as is done for many other blood group antigens. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=red-blood-cell-antigens-and-antibodies\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Red blood cell antigens and antibodies&quot;</a>.) Initially, two specificities were identified [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-autoimmune-hemolytic-anemia-cold-agglutinin-disease/abstract/23,24\" class=\"abstract_t\">23,24</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Anti-I antibodies react more strongly with red blood cells from almost all adults than with red cells from the fetus (usually obtained from the umbilical cord).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Anti-i antibodies react more strongly with cord blood red cells or the cells of rare adults who are designated &quot;genetic-i.&quot;</p><p/><p>The chemical structures with which these antibodies react are related complex polysaccharides, which may be attached to ceramide or to protein structures. The i antigen consists of a straight-chain polymer of aminyllactose disaccharides. It is the predominant structure on the red cells during fetal life. At birth, an enzyme is activated that is able to add aminyllactose disaccharides to the sixth carbon of galactose, resulting in branched molecules; this branched structure is the I antigen.</p><p>These complex polysaccharides serve as precursor substances for the formation of the ABH and Lewis blood group antigens. Sometimes, the epitope of particular anti-I or anti-i antibodies may include parts of those antigens. The specificity of such antibodies is designated anti-IA, anti-IB, etc. Rare antibodies react equally well with the I and the i structure; these antibodies are designated &quot;anti-j.&quot;</p><p>The vast majority of cold agglutinins are either anti-I or anti-i. However, other specificities have been identified by determining whether the expression of the antigen is altered by treatment of the test red blood cells with proteolytic enzymes <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> sialidase. Those antigens that are removed by proteolytic enzymes are generically called &quot;Pr&quot; antigens [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-autoimmune-hemolytic-anemia-cold-agglutinin-disease/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]; fine distinctions are made among them on other bases. The epitopes with which they react are polysaccharide moieties on glycoproteins, such as the glycophorins. Those that are dependent upon sialic acid (which may be added to the end of the complex polysaccharide structures) are designated &quot;Sia&quot; followed by an &quot;l&quot; if on the linear (i-like structure), a &quot;b&quot; if on the branched (I-like structure), or both if on both structures. As an example, Sia-l would designate a sialic acid-dependent structure on the linear polysaccharide. These sialic-acid dependent antibodies are rare.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Genesis of antibody production</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Pathologic cold agglutinins are produced either in response to infection or by paraneoplastic or neoplastic growth of a single immunocyte clone. In either case, they generally share the same immunochemical characteristics and polysaccharide specificities (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F61974\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef61974 \">table 3</a>).</p><p>Cold agglutinins regularly occur in the course of two infections, Mycoplasma pneumoniae (primary atypical pneumonia) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-autoimmune-hemolytic-anemia-cold-agglutinin-disease/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>] and infectious mononucleosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-autoimmune-hemolytic-anemia-cold-agglutinin-disease/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. In the former, they are usually specific for the I antigen and in the latter, the i antigen. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=mycoplasma-pneumoniae-infection-in-adults#H17\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Mycoplasma pneumoniae infection in adults&quot;, section on 'Cold agglutinins'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=infectious-mononucleosis-in-adults-and-adolescents#H15\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Infectious mononucleosis in adults and adolescents&quot;, section on 'Hematologic abnormalities'</a>.)</p><p>Less commonly, cold agglutinins are associated with other viral diseases. One bacterial infection, a particular strain of Listeria monocytogenes, may also cause the production of anti-I antibodies because of shared epitopes on its surface.</p><p>In most cases of postinfectious cold agglutinin production, the titer of antibody is quite low and little hemolysis is seen. The peak titer usually occurs two to three weeks after the onset of the infection and the last traces of antibody usually disappear in two to three months. If hemolysis occurs, it is unlikely to last more than two to four weeks. The antibody that is produced is oligoclonal; the light chain is primarily but not exclusively kappa and the heavy chain almost always uses the V(H)4 gene so that the antibodies exhibit the epitope reacting with 9G4. (See <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'The antibodies'</a> above.)</p><p>The cold agglutinins of clinical significance are more commonly monoclonal in origin, being produced by a clone that is usually paraneoplastic rather than frankly malignant. These antibodies are nearly always anti-I and have kappa light chains. Their titer is usually stable over long periods of time, resulting in chronic cold agglutinin disease.</p><p>As an example, in one study of 15 patients with chronic cold agglutinin disease, a clonal expansion of kappa-positive B-cells was found in six of nine patients in whom this was studied [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-autoimmune-hemolytic-anemia-cold-agglutinin-disease/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. Serum C3 was decreased in nine and C4 decreased in 11. Six sera showed increased hemolysis after addition of active complement, and five patients had experienced increased hemolysis during infection. These observations suggest the following:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients with cold agglutinin disease experience a continuous low-grade complement consumption.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Some patients with cold agglutinin disease have a relative deficit of complement in their serum.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>An increase of complement production occurs during an acute phase reaction, enhancing hemolysis.

There are exceptions to this rule but the finding of an anti-i antibody in the absence of viral disease is usually a clear indication that the patient is harboring a lymphoma.</p><p>In 5 to 10 percent of patients who present with chronic cold agglutinin syndrome, a malignant clone arises that expresses the cold agglutinin. This may be heralded by an increasing titer of the antibody, even before the other manifestations of the disease (eg, enlarged lymph nodes, circulating malignant lymphocytes) may be manifest. The presence of trisomy 3 on chromosomal analysis of the lymphocytes may predict for this transformation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-autoimmune-hemolytic-anemia-cold-agglutinin-disease/abstract/38,39\" class=\"abstract_t\">38,39</a>].

The age of the patients with such tumors usually corresponds to the time of highest natural incidence of cold agglutinins (over age 60); as a result, it is not certain whether the two conditions occur randomly or are related.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h2\">Pathophysiology of RBC destruction</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The phagocytic and other destructive cells of the immune system do not have receptors for IgM as they do for IgG and IgA. Thus, since cold agglutinins are usually IgM, destruction of RBCs is primarily complement-mediated, occurring either by direct destruction of the membrane (direct lysis) or immunoadherence mediated by target-bound components (indirect lysis) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-autoimmune-hemolytic-anemia-cold-agglutinin-disease/abstract/42,43\" class=\"abstract_t\">42,43</a>]. Both of these processes are relatively inefficient in the absence of exposure to cold.</p><p>The activation of complement is mediated by the fixation of antibody to the antigen [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-autoimmune-hemolytic-anemia-cold-agglutinin-disease/abstract/44\" class=\"abstract_t\">44</a>]. In the case of most cold agglutinins, this can occur only when the blood circulates to the peripheral areas where the temperature of the blood is sufficiently low to bind antibody. When the blood returns to the central core of the body, the antibody may leave the antigen without complement being fixed. The higher the &quot;thermal amplitude&quot; of the antibody, the greater likelihood that the requisite temperature (for both antibody and complement fixation) will be reached [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-autoimmune-hemolytic-anemia-cold-agglutinin-disease/abstract/45\" class=\"abstract_t\">45</a>].</p><p>The activation of complement is initiated by C1 and results in the covalent binding of C4 and C3 to the red cell membrane. Both of these components are necessary for the further activation of complement but also are targets of receptors mediating immunoadherence, thus leading to phagocytosis. Phagocytes tend to engulf the entire cell rather than the membrane alone as with IgG-mediated phagocytosis. Hence, spherocytes are not formed. This process is limited by enzymes in the plasma; molecules on the cell and in the plasma inhibit and inactivate bound C3 and C4 very rapidly, reducing it to a covalently-bound nubbin (C3d). C3-b coated erythrocytes are removed from the circulation by reticuloendothelial cells, with Kupfer cells in the liver playing a major role in this process. Thus, in stable disease, the major mechanism of erythrocyte destruction is <strong>extravascular</strong>, and involves C3-b coated erythrocytes. Targeting the serine protease C1s with a specific monoclonal antibody has produced in vitro a reduction of complement deposition and activation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-autoimmune-hemolytic-anemia-cold-agglutinin-disease/abstract/46\" class=\"abstract_t\">46</a>].</p><p>The direct lytic action of complement is brought about by assembling polymers of the last component, C9 (called the membrane attack complex), in the membrane. If sufficient polymers are produced, the membrane becomes leaky and the cell is doomed. In this situation the patient may have signs of <strong>intravascular</strong> hemolysis, with the presence of hemoglobinemia, hemoglobinuria, and hemosiderinuria (15 percent of patients with cold agglutinins exhibit hemoglobinuria). This process is inefficient in normal red cells because of the presence of inhibitory molecules, such as CD55 and CD59. Complement must be enormously activated in order for such lysis to occur, since many of the initiated or amplified sequences will be unsuccessful.</p><p>It is not clear how much each of these inefficient processes plays in the hemolysis of cold agglutinin disease. If the patient is exposed to a cold environment, the role of direct lysis can be readily demonstrated [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-autoimmune-hemolytic-anemia-cold-agglutinin-disease/abstract/43\" class=\"abstract_t\">43</a>]. With rare exceptions, the degree of lysis is not great, so long as cold is avoided [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-autoimmune-hemolytic-anemia-cold-agglutinin-disease/abstract/45\" class=\"abstract_t\">45</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H23025308\"><span class=\"h1\">SUMMARY</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Antibodies that do not interact with red cells at body temperature but react strongly at lower temperatures are called &quot;cold agglutinins.&quot; They are nearly always IgM antibodies reacting with polysaccharide antigens on the RBC surface only at temperatures below that of the core temperature of the body (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F103370\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef103370 \">table 2</a>).
