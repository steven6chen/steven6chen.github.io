Transabdominal surgery can be performed with either sphincter-sparing techniques (ie, anterior resection) or an abdominal perineal resection. Historically, abdominal perineal resection was the gold standard for treating low-lying rectal cancers. With the advent of better surgical techniques and equipment (eg, staplers) as well as neoadjuvant therapy, abdominal perineal resection has been gradually replaced by sphincter-sparing procedures. For patients in whom a negative distal margin can be achieved, sphincter-sparing procedures are preferred because they maintain bowel continence and avoid a permanent colostomy. In contemporary practices, sphincter-sparing procedures are feasible in up to 80 percent of patients requiring surgery for rectal cancer.</p><p>However, functional disturbances constitute a major problem for many surviving rectal cancer patients following a sphincter-sparing procedure, with symptoms ranging from daily episodes of incontinence to obstructed defecation and constipation. Although such symptoms have an immense impact on the patients' quality of life, there is presently no specific treatment. Instead, management is empirical and symptom based, using existing therapies for fecal incontinence, fecal urgency, and rectal evacuatory disorders.</p><p>In this topic, we discuss the clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and treatment of bowel symptoms that develop following sphincter-sparing resections of the rectum. Such symptoms have been collectively referred to as low anterior resection syndrome (LARS). The techniques of sphincter-sparing resection and the treatment of fecal incontinence, urgency, or other rectal evacuatory disorders of the gastrointestinal tract not necessarily related to surgery are discussed separately.

The others have been implicated in some but not all studies. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2340883225\"><span class=\"h1\">PATHOPHYSIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Symptoms of LARS are usually caused by a combination of colonic dysmotility, neorectal reservoir dysfunction, and anal sphincter dysfunction.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1667982169\"><span class=\"h2\">Colonic dysmotility</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>LARS can be caused by increased proximal colonic motility coupled with a lack of distal inhibition in patients who undergo sphincter-sparing resections. </p><p>There is evidence that denervation of the remnant sigmoid colon [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/low-anterior-resection-syndrome-lars/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>] or left colon [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/low-anterior-resection-syndrome-lars/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>] by operative maneuvers (eg, ligation of a vascular pedicle) can result in a significant increase in motility. As a result, patients with LARS have a shorter colonic transit time [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/low-anterior-resection-syndrome-lars/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>] and a greater increase in neorectal pressure after a meal compared with patients who do not have LARS [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/low-anterior-resection-syndrome-lars/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. </p><p>Removal of the rectum and in particular the rectosigmoid junction eliminates the physiologic distal control center for the regulation of bowel transit, leaving the bowel activities without a &quot;brake.&quot; This lack of distal negative feedback signals to oppose increased proximal colonic motility further exacerbates the symptoms of LARS.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1206996228\"><span class=\"h2\">Neorectal reservoir dysfunction</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Two aspects of neorectal reservoir dysfunction, denervation and reduction in functional capacity, both contribute to LARS symptoms.</p><p>The remnant rectum or neorectum may be denervated by surgical dissection or pelvic radiotherapy. A denervated neorectum is hyposensitive to mechanical and thermal stimuli due to impaired afferent nerve function [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/low-anterior-resection-syndrome-lars/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>] and is thus susceptible to causing LARS symptoms. There is evidence that the risk of LARS is greater after total as opposed to partial mesorectal excision and after neoadjuvant therapy. </p><p>Besides denervation, the neorectal function may also be compromised by a reduction in its capacity and compliance. After rectal surgery, smaller volumes of fecal material may be sufficient to induce contraction or spasm of the neorectum, which can cause symptoms such as urgency, soiling, or multiple evacuations. Although such symptoms may be obviated in part by the construction of a neorectal reservoir (eg, colonic J-pouch), the benefit lasts for fewer than 18 months [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/low-anterior-resection-syndrome-lars/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>], suggesting that reconstructive techniques plays only a transient role in determining functional outcomes after sphincter-sparing surgery. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=rectal-cancer-surgical-techniques#H2792368\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Rectal cancer: Surgical techniques&quot;, section on 'Anastomosis'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H956453257\"><span class=\"h2\">Anal sphincter dysfunction</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Anal sphincter dysfunction can be a complication of rectal surgery or pelvic radiotherapy. In one study, up to 18 percent of patients who underwent stapled low anterior resection had evidence of long-term internal anal sphincter injury [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/low-anterior-resection-syndrome-lars/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. Intersphincteric resections performed to ensure an adequate distal margin can further alter sphincter functions. Anal sphincter dysfunction can contribute to LARS symptoms such as fecal incontinence or urgency.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1122726640\"><span class=\"h1\">PREVENTION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Since all patients who undergo a sphincter-sparing rectal resection are at risk of developing LARS, postoperative efforts should be made to prevent LARS. Upon hospital discharge, all patients should be instructed to perform home Kegel exercises as a form of pelvic floor muscle training. </p><p>Additionally, patients who receive a protective stoma as a part of their low anterior resection may be at increased risk of developing LARS. In a follow-up study 12 years after a randomized trial, patients who underwent low anterior resection with a protective stoma reported increased incontinence for flatus and liquid stools and worse overall LARS score compared with patients who underwent low anterior resection without a protective stoma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/low-anterior-resection-syndrome-lars/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. Thus, patients who have a protective stoma that is not expected to close within one to two months should also receive daily or two- to three-times-per-week enemas or anterograde colonic irrigation via the stoma.

Patient questionnaires, such as the Low Anterior Resection Syndrome Score or the Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center Bowel Function Instrument, should be used to stratify patients based upon the severity of their symptoms and to guide therapy. Although they are not diagnostic, adjunctive tests, such as manometry, imaging, or endoscopy, may be required to elucidate etiology, exclude alternative diagnosis, or guide treatment. (See <a href=\"#H2571065779\" class=\"local\">'Diagnosis and differential diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3439156381\"><span class=\"h2\">Patient questionnaires</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Two patient questionnaires have been validated and widely used for assessing patients with LARS. Scores generated by such instruments are not used to diagnose LARS but to quantify the severity of the illness and to monitor the effectiveness of therapy.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The<strong> Low Anterior Resection Syndrome Score</strong> (LARS score; 2012) is a validated questionnaire for assessing bowel function after sphincter-sparing surgery for rectal cancer [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/low-anterior-resection-syndrome-lars/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. Only five questions are asked by this questionnaire: incontinence for flatus, incontinence for liquid stool, fecal frequency (number of bowel movements per day), clustering of (less than an hour between) bowel movements, and urgency (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=calculator-low-anterior-resection-syndrome-lars-score-in-adults\" class=\"calc calc_professional\">calculator 1</a>). Based upon their scores, patients are stratified into minor or major LARS. Major LARS, defined by a LARS score of &ge;30, is typically associated with seriously compromised quality of life and therefore requires intensive or invasive treatment. Minor LARS (score &lt;30) can be treated medically for individual symptoms. (See <a href=\"#H2031757806\" class=\"local\">'Treatment'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">The LARS score is widely used in clinical practice owing to its conciseness and ease of scoring. Its severity categories are also clinically meaningful and correlate with patients' quality of life. The LARS score has been translated from Danish into many other languages (English, Dutch, Swedish, Spanish, Chinese, German, and Lithuanian) and has been validated in those respective countries.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The<strong> Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center Bowel Function Instrument</strong> (MSKCC BFI; 2005) was the first questionnaire specifically validated for evaluating bowel function after sphincter-sparing surgery for rectal cancer [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/low-anterior-resection-syndrome-lars/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. It consists of 18 questions on a variety of LARS-related issues. However, its complexity in scoring (which involves recoding, three subscale scores, a global score, and a total score) limit its use in clinical practice. </p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3562653893\"><span class=\"h2\">Anorectal/colonic manometry</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span><span class=\"nowrap\">Anorectal/colonic</span> manometry is not required to diagnose LARS but can be helpful in monitoring patient response to treatment, especially for major LARS. (See <a href=\"#H3635968101\" class=\"local\">'Neurostimulation'</a> below.)</p><p>Resting and squeeze sphincter pressures in LARS are typically normal or reduced. In some patients, however, the sphincter pressure may be increased as an involuntary response to fecal incontinence or abnormal straining maneuvers in a dyssynergic pattern. </p><p>In LARS, both the capacity and compliance of the neorectum are typically reduced compared with the presurgical baseline. The neorectal sensibility can be normal, reduced, or increased depending upon the anastomotic height, any inflammation or anastomotic complication in the neorectum, or previous pelvic radiotherapy. </p><p>Colonic manometry in LARS often reveals a reduction in segmental contractile activities and an increase in high-amplitude propagated contractions. The latter is correlated with massive colonic movements.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2031757806\"><span class=\"h1\">TREATMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>At one month after the initial surgery or after the protective stoma is closed, patients who have persistent bowel symptoms are diagnosed with LARS and evaluated with one of the patient questionnaires, such as the LARS score. Further treatment options are dependent upon the LARS score.</p><p>LARS can be treated with medications, transanal irrigation, pelvic floor rehabilitation, neurostimulation, or surgery.

Symptoms related to excessive intestinal gas production, including flatulence and abdominal bloating, can be caused by small intestinal bacterial overgrowth (SIBO).

The following medications or supplements have been tried and found ineffective against LARS symptoms:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Probiotics have a limited role in the prevention or treatment of LARS. In one study, the use of a probiotic preparation, VSL#3, did not alter the postoperative bowel function of patients undergoing loop ileostomy reversal after a sphincter-sparing resection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/low-anterior-resection-syndrome-lars/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Fiber intake can improve stool consistency by absorbing water but not any other bowel symptoms.

Major LARS has a significant negative impact on patients' quality of life. Thus, patients with major LARS typically require multimodal therapy rather than medical treatment for individual symptoms as described above (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F110090\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef110090 \">algorithm 1</a>).</p><p>Multimodal therapy for LARS consists of transanal irrigation daily or three-to-four times per week plus pelvic floor rehabilitation (including biofeedback, pelvic floor muscle training, balloon training, and electrostimulation). Patients who have major LARS should receive such treatment for six months to one year before they are reevaluated with the LARS score. Patients who no longer have major LARS on repeat evaluation can be treated medically for any symptoms that persist. (See <a href=\"#H2212458905\" class=\"local\">'Minor LARS'</a> above.)</p><p>Patients who continue to have major LARS after one year of multimodal therapy should be treated with neurostimulation (eg, sacral nerve stimulation). Patients who do not respond to neurostimulation and continue to have major LARS and severely compromised quality of life should be offered a diverting stoma in another year (ie, after a total of two years from the start of multimodal therapy).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H280615174\"><span class=\"h3\">Transanal irrigation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Transanal irrigation (TAI) is a simple, safe, effective, and inexpensive treatment for LARS patients who primarily have symptoms of fecal incontinence or frequency [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/low-anterior-resection-syndrome-lars/abstract/21,22\" class=\"abstract_t\">21,22</a>]. TAI is typically used in conjunction with pelvic floor rehabilitation in those with major LARS.</p><p>In one study of 14 patients with LARS, the number of bowel movements during the day and at night both decreased (8 to 1 and 3 to 0, respectively), and quality of life improved after regular TAI for an average of 29 months [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/low-anterior-resection-syndrome-lars/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. </p><p>Low-volume TAI simply achieves the effect of a mechanical washout. High-volume (&gt;250 mL) irrigation generates functional colonic responses, such as colonic mass movements, which improves colonic transit time and fecal continence when administered regularly. Patients who have low rectal volume, low maximal rectal capacity, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> low anal squeeze pressure respond most favorably to TAI. </p><p>TAI for LARS is typically performed transanally in a retrograde fashion. Patients are trained by a stoma nurse to perform TAI with one of the commercially available systems (eg, the Peristeen anal irrigation system) daily or three-to-four times per week. During each treatment, 500 to 1500 mL of water was instilled into the colon [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/low-anterior-resection-syndrome-lars/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. Although TAI could theoretically cause perforation in LARS patients, no major complications have been reported with its use.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3587941507\"><span class=\"h3\">Pelvic floor rehabilitation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>LARS patients who present with fecal incontinence or frequency can also benefit from pelvic floor rehabilitation (PFR). PFR is typically used in conjunction with TAI in those with major LARS.</p><p>PFR refers to a collection of rehabilitative techniques that includes biofeedback, pelvic floor muscle training, electrostimulation, and <span class=\"nowrap\">volumetric/rectal</span> balloon training. Specific techniques are selected according to the individual needs of each patient, although a combination of techniques has been shown to significantly improve outcomes compared with individual techniques alone [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/low-anterior-resection-syndrome-lars/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. </p><p>In small retrospective studies, both pelvic floor muscle training [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/low-anterior-resection-syndrome-lars/abstract/24-26\" class=\"abstract_t\">24-26</a>] and biofeedback [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/low-anterior-resection-syndrome-lars/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>] have been associated with improvements in bowel function and health-related quality of life in patients with LARS: </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In one study, patients who performed Kegel exercises regularly after sphincter-sparing resection reported higher quality of life scores than patients who did not [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/low-anterior-resection-syndrome-lars/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In another study of patients after sphincter-sparing surgery, significant improvements were observed after biofeedback therapy in fecal incontinence score, number of bowel movements, and anorectal manometry data (maximum resting pressure, maximum squeeze pressure, and rectal capacity) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/low-anterior-resection-syndrome-lars/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a third study, patients with LARS benefited equally from PFR regardless of whether they received adjuvant pelvic radiotherapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/low-anterior-resection-syndrome-lars/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. </p><p/><p>However, the available studies on PFR in LARS are generally of low quality due to the heterogeneity in the PFR protocols and fecal incontinence scoring systems used. A 2015 systematic review concluded that the majority of studies reported significant improvements in stool frequency, incontinence episodes, severity of fecal incontinence, and quality of life after pelvic floor muscle training, but a meta-analysis was not possible due to the heterogeneity in study designs. High-quality data are required to validate the efficacy of PFR used for LARS.</p><p>The same PFR techniques are used to treat patients with pelvic organ prolapse, urinary incontinence, or pelvic pain syndrome and are further discussed in other topics.

SNS has been shown to improve fecal incontinence and the ability to defer defecation in patients with normal or impaired sphincters [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/low-anterior-resection-syndrome-lars/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. </p><p>SNS was initially thought to directly act upon anal sphincter muscles through peripheral motor stimulation to increase resting and squeeze pressures but is now believed to exert more influence on anorectal functions at a pelvic afferent or central level. Additionally, SNS has also been shown to decrease anterograde while increasing retrograde colonic motor activities [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/low-anterior-resection-syndrome-lars/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>] and to impair postprandial changes in rectal motility [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/low-anterior-resection-syndrome-lars/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]. The latter two mechanisms are most relevant for LARS patients. </p><p>SNS involves placement of an electrode into the sacral foramen to provide low-grade electrical stimulation to the sacral nerve. Patients who respond to a two-week trial with a temporary electrode then undergo placement of a permanent electrode connected to a generator embedded subcutaneously.</p><p>SNS has been studied in patients with LARS [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/low-anterior-resection-syndrome-lars/abstract/32-39\" class=\"abstract_t\">32-39</a>]; approximately 72 percent of patients who underwent temporary stimulation went on to receive a permanent stimulator (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F109246\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef109246 \">table 1</a>). After a follow-up of 12 to 32 months, most patients achieved good functional results with improvements in incontinence episodes, the ability to defer bowel movement, fragmentation or urgency in defecation, and quality of life. Manometric results varied and did not always correlate with functional outcomes. </p><p>Similar conclusions were reached by a 2015 systematic review, which included 43 patients with a median follow-up of 15 months [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/low-anterior-resection-syndrome-lars/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>]. In that study, 79 percent of patients who underwent temporary stimulation received a permanent stimulator, 94 percent of whom experienced improvement of symptoms. However, all the studies that have been conducted to date are small, retrospective, and heterogenous; high-quality evidence is required to validate SNS as a standard treatment for LARS.</p><p>Other techniques of neurostimulation (eg, posterior tibial nerve stimulation [PTNS] and electroacupuncture) are being investigated as potential treatments for LARS but are not yet available for widespread clinical use.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1023135334\"><span class=\"h3\">Surgery</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients with intractable LARS despite all other treatments may require surgery. Surgical options include anal sphincter substitution and fecal diversion. </p><p>Anal sphincter substitution by electrostimulated graciloplasty or an artificial sphincter has been performed to treat intractable fecal incontinence, but not in LARS patients. The procedure is associated with a high complication rate and significant costs.

An estimated 25 to 80 percent of patients develop LARS following a sphincter-sparing rectal surgery. (See <a href=\"#H3233639179\" class=\"local\">'Definition'</a> above and <a href=\"#H315148059\" class=\"local\">'Epidemiology and risk factors'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>After a sphincter-sparing rectal resection, we suggest pelvic floor muscle training with home Kegel exercises for all patients (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). Additionally, those who have a protective stoma that is not expected to close within one to two months should also receive daily or two- to three-times-per-week enemas or anterograde colonic irrigation via the stoma.
