Doctors often call it &quot;exercise-induced bronchoconstriction&quot; instead. That's because exercise does not actually cause asthma. But it can trigger symptoms in some people who already have asthma.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3752146463\"><span class=\"h1\">What are the symptoms of exercise-induced asthma?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Symptoms can include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Coughing</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A tight feeling in the chest</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Shortness of breath</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Wheezing (hearing a whistling sound when you breathe)</p><p/><p>Symptoms happen when the airways in the lungs become narrow and inflamed (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F65956\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef65956 \">figure 1</a>). In people with exercise-induced asthma, this usually happens about 10 to 15 minutes after starting to exercise. In most cases, the symptoms go away after about 1 hour.</p><p>These symptoms are different from shortness of breath that happens during an asthma &quot;attack&quot; or flare-up. A person having an asthma flare-up might have more trouble breathing if he or she tries to exercise. That's because the airways are already narrowed.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2263251372\"><span class=\"h1\">Is there a test for exercise-induced asthma?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Yes. But if you already know you have asthma, you might not need testing. Your doctor might be able to tell that you have exercise-induced asthma based on your symptoms. Or, your doctor might have you do a breathing test, such as:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>An &quot;exercise challenge test&quot; &ndash; This involves using a treadmill or exercise bike for several minutes, then doing a breathing test. The test shows your doctor how your lungs are working. A similar test involves inhaling a special mixture of dry air while breathing fast, like you would if you were exercising.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A test that involves breathing in a special medicine &ndash; For this, you do a breathing test before and after inhaling the medicine. If you have asthma, the medicine will cause your airways to narrow.</p><p/><p>Your doctor might also check for other problems that can cause similar symptoms. For example, people with vocal cord narrowing, lung disease, and some heart problems can have trouble breathing after exercising.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1114485885\"><span class=\"h1\">How is exercise-induced asthma treated?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>If you get exercise-induced asthma, you can treat it with a &quot;quick-relief&quot; medicine. It comes in an inhaler and treats asthma attacks or flare-ups (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F61575\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef61575 \">picture 1</a>). The medicines used for this are short-acting beta agonists (called &quot;SABAs&quot; or &quot;short-acting bronchodilators&quot;). Examples of SABAs are <a href=\"topic.htm?path=albuterol-salbutamol-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">albuterol</a> (sample brand names: ProAir HFA, ProAir RespiClick, Proventil HFA, Ventolin HFA) and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=levalbuterol-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">levalbuterol</a> (brand name: Xopenex HFA).</p><p>Your doctor or nurse will tell you how and when to use your inhaler. Most people need 2 puffs to relieve symptoms. If you keep having symptoms, you can take 2 puffs again after 20 minutes. If you get exercise-induced asthma, make sure you have your &quot;quick-relief&quot; inhaler with you anytime you plan to exercise.</p><p>If you are having symptoms but don't have your inhaler, or if you still have trouble breathing after using it, <strong>call for an ambulance (in the US and Canada, dial 9-1-1)</strong>.</p><p>Some people feel shaky after taking a SABA. If this happens, talk to your doctor or nurse. He or she might switch you to a different medicine or lower your dose.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H920604869\"><span class=\"h1\">Can exercise-induced asthma be prevented?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Yes. First, it's important to take all your asthma medicines the way your doctor or nurse tells you to. Keeping your asthma controlled can lower the chances of having symptoms when you exercise.</p><p>You can also:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Take medicine before you exercise &ndash; This usually involves using your &quot;quick-relief&quot; inhaler 5 to 15 minutes before exercising, to help prevent symptoms. SABAs are the medicines most often used to prevent exercise-induced asthma. But some people, such as children who are physically active many times a day, get another type of asthma medicine instead.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">If you exercise most days of the week and need your &quot;quick-relief&quot; medicine each time, your doctor might suggest an asthma controller medicine if you don't already take one. This is a medicine you take every day, even when you are not having symptoms. This way you won't need the &quot;quick-relief&quot; medicine as often.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Avoid exercising in certain conditions &ndash; Very cold, dry air can make symptoms worse. If you do exercise outside on a very cold day, it might help to wear a loose scarf or mask over your nose and mouth. It can also help to avoid exercising in polluted air, or around pollen or mold if you are allergic.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Warm up before you exercise &ndash; Some people find that a warm-up period helps prevent exercise-induced asthma. But this isn't true for everyone.</p><p/><p>You should <strong>not</strong> avoid exercise completely in order to prevent exercise-induced asthma. Exercise is important for staying healthy. Plus, regular exercise and better fitness can actually help reduce asthma symptoms. Your doctor and nurse can help you figure out what kind of exercise is best for you, and how to prevent and treat symptoms.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4108519754\"><span class=\"h1\">More on this topic</span></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=asthma-in-adults-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Asthma in adults (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=asthma-in-children-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Asthma in children (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=medicines-for-asthma-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Medicines for asthma (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=avoiding-asthma-triggers-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Avoiding asthma triggers (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=how-to-use-your-metered-dose-inhaler-adults-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: How to use your metered dose inhaler (adults) (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=how-to-use-your-childs-metered-dose-inhaler-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: How to use your child's metered dose inhaler (The Basics)</a></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=exercise-induced-asthma-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Exercise-induced asthma (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=asthma-treatment-in-adolescents-and-adults-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Asthma treatment in adolescents and adults (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=asthma-treatment-in-children-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Asthma treatment in children (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=trigger-avoidance-in-asthma-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Trigger avoidance in asthma (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=asthma-inhaler-techniques-in-adults-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Asthma inhaler techniques in adults (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=asthma-inhaler-techniques-in-children-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Asthma inhaler techniques in children (Beyond the Basics)</a></p></div><div id=\"reviewProcess\"><span>All topics are updated as new evidence becomes available and our <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/home/editorial-policy\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"policy policy_editorialpolicy\">peer review process</a> is complete.</span></div><div id=\"topicRetrievedDate\"><span class=\"emphasis\">This topic retrieved from UpToDate on: </span>Apr 02, 2018.</div><div id=\"disclaimer\">The content on the UpToDate website is not intended nor recommended as a substitute for medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.
