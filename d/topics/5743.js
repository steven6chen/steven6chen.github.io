Dystonia is type of &quot;involuntary contraction&quot; or &quot;spasm&quot; of your muscles. This means your muscles move when you are not trying to move them. In dystonia, the spasms last for a long time. This can cause part of your body to twist and stay in an unusual position. For example, your foot might stay turned out, so it drags when you walk.</p><p>There are various types of dystonia that affect specific parts of the body, such as the neck, face, or arms. Dystonia can also affect several different parts of the body at the same time.</p><p>Some types of dystonia start in childhood, others start in adulthood. Some types run in families. There are also types of dystonia that happen with other diseases, such as Parkinson disease.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H89087132\"><span class=\"h1\">What are the symptoms of dystonia?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Each type of dystonia causes different symptoms (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F83212\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef83212 \">table 1</a>). But, in general, all types cause muscle spasms that last a long time. Some people also have &quot;tremor,&quot; which is the medical term for trembling or shaking that a person cannot control. </p><p>The symptoms of dystonia affect only the body's movements. People with dystonia usually do not have problems with their ability to think or understand.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H89087147\"><span class=\"h1\">Is there a test for dystonia?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>No, there is no test. But doctors can usually tell if a person has dystonia based on his or her symptoms. Sometimes doctors use tests to make sure that the symptoms are not caused by something else.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H89087162\"><span class=\"h1\">How is dystonia treated?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There are treatments that can help the symptoms of dystonia. But there is no cure for the problem. Treatment for you will depend on the type of dystonia you have. Treatments can include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Medicines &ndash; There are many medicines that can help with the symptoms of dystonia. These medicines come in pill form. Your doctor or nurse will decide which medicine is best for you or your child.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Botulinum toxin (often called &quot;BoTox&quot;) &ndash; BoTox injections (shots) help muscles relax. BoTox can be used in the parts of your body where the symptoms are the worst.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Deep brain stimulation (also called &quot;DBS&quot;) &ndash; DBS might be an option for people with severe symptoms who do not get better with medicines or BoTox. People who get DBS must first have surgery to place wires into a part of the brain that helps control muscle movement. The wires are attached to a device that gets implanted under the skin, usually near the collarbone. It sends electrical signals to the brain to reduce muscle spasms.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H89087177\"><span class=\"h1\">What will my life be like?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Most people with dystonia live fairly long lives. But they can have problems doing certain activities. If you or your child has some type of dystonia, ask the doctor about what to expect.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H89087194\"><span class=\"h1\">More on this topic</span></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=tremor-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Tremor (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=spasmodic-dysphonia-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Spasmodic dysphonia (The Basics)</a></p></div><div id=\"reviewProcess\"><span>All topics are updated as new evidence becomes available and our <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/home/editorial-policy\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"policy policy_editorialpolicy\">peer review process</a> is complete.</span></div><div id=\"topicRetrievedDate\"><span class=\"emphasis\">This topic retrieved from UpToDate on: </span>Apr 02, 2018.</div><div id=\"disclaimer\">The content on the UpToDate website is not intended nor recommended as a substitute for medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.
