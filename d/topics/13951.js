The evidence consists of observational studies that can yield associations confounded by measured and residual (unmeasured) factors. These studies include retrospective case-control studies that carry the risk of recall bias, as well as population based registry studies that may misclassify exposure. Other methodologic problems include incomplete assessment of maternal mental health, identifying depressed patients with screening questionnaires rather than structured clinical interviews, not assessing depression severity, not precisely defining outcomes, and grouping together different types of outcomes across a range of severity from mild to severe. Many studies use the mother&rsquo;s report for both the independent variable (postnatal depression) and dependent variable (child outcome), and depressed mothers may perceive their children in a more negative light than other informants (reporting bias). In addition, some studies fail to use appropriate control (comparison) groups, and some observed associations between exposure and outcome are based upon a small number of exposed and affected infants. </p><p>Associations between <span class=\"nowrap\">infant/child</span> exposure to postnatal depression and adverse outcomes that are found in observational studies may be confounded by many maternal factors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/postpartum-depression-risks-of-abnormal-child-development/abstract/2,4-7\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,4-7</a>]: </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Duration of depressive syndrome (eg, the postnatal depressive episode may have started prior to delivery).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Poor adherence with postnatal care.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Comorbid general medical illnesses.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Comorbid psychopathology (eg, anxiety disorders, personality disorders, and substance use disorders).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Prescribed medications (eg, antidepressants, antipsychotics, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> benzodiazepines) in mothers who are breastfeeding.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Demographic and environmental factors such as age, poor education, suboptimal parenting, financial difficulties, social isolation, marital conflict, and intimate partner violence.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Factors (eg, depressive episodes) that arise after the postpartum period.</p><p/><p>Other confounding factors include chronic health problems and stressful life events experienced by the child. In addition, shared genetic factors may underlie maternal depression and abnormal child development, including behavioral and emotional problems [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/postpartum-depression-risks-of-abnormal-child-development/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. Paternal depression, either during the postpartum period or afterwards, may also increase the risk of adverse child outcomes. </p><p>The lack of knowledge about the effects of depression upon infant outcomes limits our ability to understand the effects of infant exposure to antidepressants through breast milk. As an example, an association between selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) use and an adverse outcome may be observed because depression is associated with the outcome, and lactating patients using SSRIs may be more depressed than other patients. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1289778992\"><span class=\"h1\">OUTCOMES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Postpartum depression is associated with developmental disturbances in infants and children [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/postpartum-depression-risks-of-abnormal-child-development/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]; most of the effects appear to be small to moderate [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/postpartum-depression-risks-of-abnormal-child-development/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].
