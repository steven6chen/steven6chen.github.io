This replaces the term parenteral nutrition-associated liver disease (PNALD), which recognized the important role of parenteral nutrition (PN) in the pathogenesis of the disease. However, the broader term IFALD is now preferred in recognition that there are multiple other patient-dependent and treatment-related contributors and risk factors to the pathogenesis of IFALD, as discussed below [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intestinal-failure-associated-liver-disease-in-infants/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=causes-of-cholestasis-in-neonates-and-young-infants\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Causes of cholestasis in neonates and young infants&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The diagnosis of IFALD is usually made on clinical grounds in children with intestinal failure, long-term dependence on PN, and cholestasis, if other specific causes of liver injury have been excluded. Cholestasis is usually defined as an elevated serum conjugated bilirubin &ge;2 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> (34.2 <span class=\"nowrap\">micromol/L)</span>. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">EPIDEMIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>IFALD is seen in 40 to 60 percent of children who receive long-term PN and 15 to 40 percent of adults on home parenteral nutrition (PN) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intestinal-failure-associated-liver-disease-in-infants/abstract/1,3,4\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,3,4</a>].</p><p>Severe and progressive IFALD is most common in infants and neonates, particularly those with short bowel syndrome [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intestinal-failure-associated-liver-disease-in-infants/abstract/4,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,5</a>]. In one review, IFALD was seen in 14 percent of infants receiving PN for two to four weeks, 43 percent of those receiving PN for four to eight weeks, 72 percent of those receiving PN for 8 to 14 weeks, and 85 percent of those receiving PN for more than 14 weeks [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intestinal-failure-associated-liver-disease-in-infants/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=chronic-complications-of-short-bowel-syndrome-in-children#H5\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Chronic complications of short bowel syndrome in children&quot;, section on 'Liver disease'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h1\">PATHOGENESIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The mechanism of IFALD is uncertain but is probably multifactorial. Components of the parenteral nutrition (PN) probably act as toxins, but bacterial endotoxins and lack of enteral feeding are also thought to play significant roles [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intestinal-failure-associated-liver-disease-in-infants/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. The risk factors described below are closely correlated. For example, premature infants are also more likely to have complications, such as necrotizing enterocolitis, that result in short bowel syndrome.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Immature liver function</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Risk factors for IFALD include prematurity, low birth weight, and intrauterine growth restriction, suggesting that immaturity of the liver is a predisposing factor [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intestinal-failure-associated-liver-disease-in-infants/abstract/2,6-11\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,6-11</a>]. As examples:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In one report, birth weight &lt;500 g was associated with a 30-fold increase in risk for IFALD as compared with birth weight &gt;750 g [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intestinal-failure-associated-liver-disease-in-infants/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a group of 62 premature infants with birthweight &lt;2000 g, cholestasis developed in 50 percent of those with birthweight &lt;1000 g but only in 7 percent of those with birthweight &gt;1500 to 2000 g [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intestinal-failure-associated-liver-disease-in-infants/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. The incidence of cholestasis approached 90 percent for infants on PN more than 90 days, combining both birthweight categories.</p><p/><p>The immature liver appears to be more sensitive to the other pathogenic factors discussed in the following sections [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intestinal-failure-associated-liver-disease-in-infants/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Inflammatory mediators</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Episodes of sepsis, including catheter-related sepsis, are associated with the severity of liver disease in IFALD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intestinal-failure-associated-liver-disease-in-infants/abstract/13,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,14</a>]. Bacterial translocation from overgrowth in the small intestine also may contribute [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intestinal-failure-associated-liver-disease-in-infants/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Short bowel syndrome</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Cholestatic liver disease is more common in patients with short bowel syndrome (SBS) than in patients who require PN for other reasons, suggesting a role for factors unique to SBS in the pathogenesis of cholestatic liver disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intestinal-failure-associated-liver-disease-in-infants/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>].

Infants with extensive small bowel resections (eg, residual length &le;10 percent of expected) are more likely to develop cholestasis as compared with those with less extensive bowel resections or intestinal dysmotility [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intestinal-failure-associated-liver-disease-in-infants/abstract/20,21\" class=\"abstract_t\">20,21</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Parenteral nutrition components</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Mounting evidence suggests that specific components of PN solutions, and especially lipid emulsions, are involved in the pathogenesis of IFALD: </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h3\">Lipid source</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Soybean lipid emulsions (eg, Intralipid) are the most common form of lipid used for PN in the United States and most other countries, and have been implicated in the pathogenesis of IFALD. These emulsions are rich in omega-6 fatty acids. </p><p>However, accumulating evidence suggests that soy-based lipid emulsions may be an important contributor to the pathogenesis of IFALD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intestinal-failure-associated-liver-disease-in-infants/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Studies in animal models showed that a soy-based lipid emulsion is associated with liver injury as compared with a fish oil-based emulsion, which is rich in omega-3 fatty acids [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intestinal-failure-associated-liver-disease-in-infants/abstract/22,23\" class=\"abstract_t\">22,23</a>]. Moreover, studies in adults have shown that soybean lipid infusions of &gt;1 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/kg</span> are one of several risk factors for developing cholestatic liver disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intestinal-failure-associated-liver-disease-in-infants/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Studies of limiting the lipid dose in pediatric populations have mixed results (see <a href=\"#H1570775209\" class=\"local\">'Efficacy'</a> below). Finally, preliminary studies in infants demonstrate a reversal of IFALD after changing from soy-based to fish oil-based fat emulsions. (See <a href=\"#H22\" class=\"local\">'Fish oil-based lipid emulsions'</a> below.)</p><p>A proposed mechanism through which soy-based lipid emulsions might cause liver injury is that excessive omega-6 fatty acids have proinflammatory effects and impair triglyceride export [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intestinal-failure-associated-liver-disease-in-infants/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. By contrast, omega-3 fatty acids tend to have anti-inflammatory and insulin-sensitizing effects, acting through the GPR120 receptor [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intestinal-failure-associated-liver-disease-in-infants/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. Soy-based lipid emulsions also contain phytosterols (eg, stigmasterol, beta-sitosterol, and campesterol) that reduce bile secretion and may contribute to liver injury [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intestinal-failure-associated-liver-disease-in-infants/abstract/26-28\" class=\"abstract_t\">26-28</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h3\">Amino acid dose and composition</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A role for amino acids in the pathogenesis of IFALD in humans has been suggested. In animals, amino acid infusion impairs bile secretion, and some amino acids (eg, glycine, methionine) are hepatotoxic [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intestinal-failure-associated-liver-disease-in-infants/abstract/29,30\" class=\"abstract_t\">29,30</a>]. In infants, short-term amino acid infusions cause biochemical evidence of cholestasis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intestinal-failure-associated-liver-disease-in-infants/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]. In addition, photodegradation products of amino acids and other components of PN may also contribute [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intestinal-failure-associated-liver-disease-in-infants/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>]. One retrospective study found different rates of IFALD among infants treated with two different types of pediatric amino acid preparations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intestinal-failure-associated-liver-disease-in-infants/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>]; a second smaller study did not support this conclusion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intestinal-failure-associated-liver-disease-in-infants/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>].</p><p>Clinical studies in humans have failed to confirm an association between the total dose of amino acids and IFALD. A randomized trial examined the effects of two doses of amino acid supplementation as part of PN given to premature infants [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intestinal-failure-associated-liver-disease-in-infants/abstract/35,36\" class=\"abstract_t\">35,36</a>]. There was no difference in the rates of cholestasis at 28 days of life (12.5 percent in patients given the lower dose of amino acids versus 8.6 in those given a higher dose), but the study was underpowered to detect such an effect. Similarly, a retrospective study did not find a difference in the protein: nonprotein calorie ratio among infants with cholestasis as compared with those without cholestasis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intestinal-failure-associated-liver-disease-in-infants/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>].</p><p>Even if the total dose of amino acids is not associated with IFALD, an imbalance in several conditionally essential amino acids may increase the risk. As examples, taurine deficiency, L-cysteine deficiency, and methionine excess have been implicated as a cause of IFALD.</p><p>Conjugation of bile acids with taurine can reduce their conjugation with glycine, which may protect the liver since glycine-conjugated bile acids are hepatotoxic [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intestinal-failure-associated-liver-disease-in-infants/abstract/38,39\" class=\"abstract_t\">38,39</a>]. Neonates have limited ability to convert methionine into taurine due to low cystathionase activity. To prevent taurine deficiency, amino acid products for neonates contain higher concentrations of taurine compared with amino acid preparations designed for adults. Thus, neonates receiving the &quot;adult&quot; product may develop taurine deficiency, which may contribute to the development of IFALD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intestinal-failure-associated-liver-disease-in-infants/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h3\">Carbohydrate excess</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Although dextrose is not considered hepatotoxic, excessive carbohydrate in PN may contribute to the development of IFALD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intestinal-failure-associated-liver-disease-in-infants/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. The proposed mechanism is that excessive carbohydrates enhance insulin release, leading to upregulation of enzymes involved in fatty acid synthesis, which causes hepatic steatosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intestinal-failure-associated-liver-disease-in-infants/abstract/41,42\" class=\"abstract_t\">41,42</a>]. Hepatic steatosis is thought to predispose to inflammation via oxidative stress from reactive oxygen species.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h3\">Other PN components</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Other factors that have been proposed to contribute to IFALD in infants are the chemical composition of the tubing used to infuse PN, toxicity from trace elements, and aluminum toxicity. The concerns about each of these factors are based on limited evidence:</p><p>In one study, changing from an infusion system in which diethylhexylphthalate (DEHP) was used as a plasticizing agent to DEHP-free tubing was associated with a marked reduction in the incidence of cholestasis among neonates receiving PN for two or more weeks (from 50 to 18 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intestinal-failure-associated-liver-disease-in-infants/abstract/43\" class=\"abstract_t\">43</a>]. Determining whether DEHP has a causal role in the pathogenesis of IFALD will depend on whether these findings are reproduced in other care settings, as well as analysis for potential confounders.</p><p>Because copper and manganese are primarily excreted through the biliary tract, concerns have been raised that these trace elements might accumulate in patients with cholestasis and contribute to hepatic injury <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> cause neurotoxicity. Some studies and case reports document elevated serum or liver levels of copper and manganese in patients on long-term PN; there is no direct evidence that this had adverse effects in these patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intestinal-failure-associated-liver-disease-in-infants/abstract/44-47\" class=\"abstract_t\">44-47</a>]. Nonetheless, many institutions routinely reduce or eliminate trace element infusions in PN after cholestasis develops [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intestinal-failure-associated-liver-disease-in-infants/abstract/48\" class=\"abstract_t\">48</a>]. Careful monitoring for copper deficiency is imperative if copper is removed or reduced in the PN. One case series discusses the development of clinical symptoms of copper deficiency after the removal of copper from their PN solutions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intestinal-failure-associated-liver-disease-in-infants/abstract/49\" class=\"abstract_t\">49</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-dietary-trace-minerals#H9\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of dietary trace minerals&quot;, section on 'Copper'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-dietary-trace-minerals#H41\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of dietary trace minerals&quot;, section on 'Manganese'</a>.) </p><p>Aluminum toxicity can predispose to cholestasis in infants. Neonates and premature infants receiving long-term PN therapy are at the highest risk. Aluminum is found in raw materials and may become incorporated into products during the manufacturing process. In addition, aluminum can contaminate solutions as a result of leaching from glass containers during storage. Although the aluminum content of parenteral nutrition (PN) solutions has been substantially reduced during the past 30 years, several commonly used solutions that are used for PN, including <a href=\"topic.htm?path=calcium-gluconate-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">calcium gluconate</a> and phosphate salts, contain clinically significant levels of aluminum. Aluminum promotes hepatocellular uptake of transferrin, which allows aluminum to enter the hepatocyte bound to transferrin, an effect that can theoretically lead to cholestasis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intestinal-failure-associated-liver-disease-in-infants/abstract/50\" class=\"abstract_t\">50</a>]. </p><p>There is no consensus to define &quot;safe&quot; levels of parenteral aluminum intake. Intakes of less than 2 <span class=\"nowrap\">micrograms/kg</span> per day were recommended by the American Society of Clinical Nutrition and American Society for Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition in 1990 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intestinal-failure-associated-liver-disease-in-infants/abstract/51\" class=\"abstract_t\">51</a>]. In 2004, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) recommended that parenteral aluminum exposure be limited to less than 4 to 5 <span class=\"nowrap\">micrograms/kg/day</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intestinal-failure-associated-liver-disease-in-infants/abstract/52\" class=\"abstract_t\">52</a>]. However, it is often difficult to achieve exposures under these limits using available products, particularly for preterm infants who typically have high calcium needs. Even when the solutions with the lowest available aluminum concentrations are used, the aluminum exposure from PN solutions exceeds the FDA recommendation for infants and children weighing less than 50 kg [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intestinal-failure-associated-liver-disease-in-infants/abstract/53,54\" class=\"abstract_t\">53,54</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL FEATURES</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14\"><span class=\"h2\">Presentation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Infants with IFALD typically develop jaundice and elevated levels of conjugated (direct) bilirubin about two weeks after starting parenteral nutrition (PN), but the onset may be later. The laboratory findings are not specific; in addition to conjugated bilirubin, aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), and gammaglutamyl transpeptidase (GGTP) may be mildly elevated [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intestinal-failure-associated-liver-disease-in-infants/abstract/12,55\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,55</a>].</p><p>Cholestasis should be attributed to PN only after other major causes have been excluded. Common causes of transient conjugated hyperbilirubinemia in neonates include sepsis or infection. All infants with sustained conjugated hyperbilirubinemia should be evaluated for biliary obstruction (eg, biliary atresia), infection, and several metabolic and genetic liver diseases that require specific therapy. Several of these disorders require urgent management. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=causes-of-cholestasis-in-neonates-and-young-infants\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Causes of cholestasis in neonates and young infants&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=approach-to-evaluation-of-cholestasis-in-neonates-and-young-infants\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Approach to evaluation of cholestasis in neonates and young infants&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15\"><span class=\"h2\">Histopathology</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Histologic changes in IFALD range from steatosis to cirrhosis. Steatosis (fatty liver without inflammation) is often the first histologic change seen on liver biopsy, and is more frequently seen in adults on PN [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intestinal-failure-associated-liver-disease-in-infants/abstract/56\" class=\"abstract_t\">56</a>]. Continued exposure to PN leads to progressive changes, including hepatocellular ballooning with steatosis, portal inflammation, canalicular and intracellular cholestasis (bile plugs), and bile duct proliferation that may mimic biliary obstruction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intestinal-failure-associated-liver-disease-in-infants/abstract/57\" class=\"abstract_t\">57</a>]. The degree of fibrosis can range from minimal portal fibrosis to cirrhosis. It is important to recognize that subcapsular wedge biopsies obtained at operation can overestimate the degree of fibrosis; percutaneous needle biopsy usually provides more accurate staging of fibrosis.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H16\"><span class=\"h2\">Clinical course</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The liver disease usually is progressive as long as PN is continued, although the disease may progress more slowly if oral feeds are advanced and PN is decreased.</p><p>The cholestasis and liver test abnormalities tend to improve after the parenteral therapy is discontinued, but may persist in some cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intestinal-failure-associated-liver-disease-in-infants/abstract/58-60\" class=\"abstract_t\">58-60</a>]. As an example, among 31 infants with IFALD who were successfully weaned from PN, conjugated bilirubin normalized at a median of 13 weeks after weaning (95% CI 8-14 weeks), and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) levels normalized at a median of 35 weeks (95% CI 24-80 weeks) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intestinal-failure-associated-liver-disease-in-infants/abstract/58\" class=\"abstract_t\">58</a>].

Overall, the limited available evidence is insufficient to conclude that SMOF is useful for treatment of IFALD, but raises the possibility that it may be helpful for preventing IFALD or delaying disease progression [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intestinal-failure-associated-liver-disease-in-infants/abstract/76,108,114,115\" class=\"abstract_t\">76,108,114,115</a>]. </p><p>A SMOF product is available in the United States but is not approved for use in pediatric patients. SMOF is not suitable for lipid restriction (lipid intake &lt;1 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/kg/day),</span> as it may predispose patients to essential fatty acid deficiency due to its relatively low content of essential fatty acids. Further study is needed to determine its role in the prevention or management of IFALD. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=parenteral-nutrition-in-infants-and-children#H61819649\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Parenteral nutrition in infants and children&quot;, section on 'Fat'</a>.) </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H651357938\"><span class=\"h2\">Lipid reduction strategies</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Because of increasing evidence that soy-based lipid emulsions contribute to the development of IFALD, a few studies have explored the effects of reducing the dose of lipid for treating or preventing IFALD. The studies also explored possible adverse effects on growth and essential fatty acid deficiency (EFAD). The limited data in this area are inconclusive.</p><p>One study suggested that a lipid reduction strategy is effective for <strong>treatment</strong> of infants with established IFALD. Among 31 neonates with IFALD, the dose of a soy-based lipid emulsion was markedly reduced to 1 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/kg</span> <strong>twice weekly</strong> (a dose equivalent to 0.14 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/kg/day)</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intestinal-failure-associated-liver-disease-in-infants/abstract/116\" class=\"abstract_t\">116</a>]. In comparison to historical controls receiving 3 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/kg</span> per day of intravenous lipids, infants receiving the low fat regimens experienced a significant decline in total bilirubin levels compared with controls. Resolution of IFALD (defined as direct bilirubin &lt;2.5 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL)</span> was achieved in 42 percent of infants on the low fat regimen compared with 10 percent among matched historical controls. Comparison of growth in the two groups was similar. Mild EFAD was detected in 8 of 31 infants and was reversed with additional days of lipid infusion. </p><p>Other studies showed no effect of lipid reduction strategies in <strong>preventing</strong> or delaying the onset of IFALD. As an example, a randomized trial that included 136 neonates without IFALD compared the effects of low-dose soy-based lipid (1 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/kg/day)</span> with standard dose (3 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/kg/day)</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intestinal-failure-associated-liver-disease-in-infants/abstract/117\" class=\"abstract_t\">117</a>]. After two weeks of PN, similar proportions of infants in each group had developed cholestasis (69 versus 63 percent, respectively); at 28 days of life and hospital discharge, there were no differences in growth velocity or major neonatal morbidities. Similar conclusions were reached by a smaller observational study [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intestinal-failure-associated-liver-disease-in-infants/abstract/118\" class=\"abstract_t\">118</a>]. </p><p>The potential risks of lipid reduction strategies were further explored in a study of 31 infants who developed IFALD while on PN with standard dose soy-based lipid emulsion (3 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/kg/day)</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intestinal-failure-associated-liver-disease-in-infants/abstract/119\" class=\"abstract_t\">119</a>]. The infants were switched to a lipid reduction protocol, and initially treated with 1 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/kg/d</span> <strong>twice weekly</strong>, with an increase to 1 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/kg/day</span> three times weekly if EFAD developed, and a further dose increase to 2 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/kg/day</span> three times weekly if the EFAD persisted. This severe lipid restriction protocol resulted in a statistically significant reduction in total bilirubin without impacting growth or causing EFAD, compared with historical controls.</p><p>Together, these studies provide some support for the notion that soy-based lipid emulsion may contribute to IFALD, but they are not sufficient to establish a threshold of soy-based lipid emulsion that consistently reverses or prevents IFALD. They provide some reassurance that at least modest reduction of lipids can be achieved without adverse effects on growth or EFAD. However, larger datasets are needed to evaluate the outcomes of lipid-reduction strategies, especially regarding the growth consequences of lipid restrictions below 1 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/kg/day</span>. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H26\"><span class=\"h2\">Other interventions</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Except for these preliminary results of omega-3 fatty acids and the optimization of PN and achievement of full enteral feedings, no specific therapy to either prevent or reduce the severity of IFALD has been found. Strategies with some merit include the following:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Cholecystokinin-octapeptide, a gastrointestinal hormone that induces gallbladder contraction and increases intrahepatic bile flow, showed initial promise [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intestinal-failure-associated-liver-disease-in-infants/abstract/120\" class=\"abstract_t\">120</a>] but was not effective in either preventing or reducing the severity of cholestasis in a controlled trial [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intestinal-failure-associated-liver-disease-in-infants/abstract/121\" class=\"abstract_t\">121</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><a href=\"topic.htm?path=cysteine-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">Cysteine</a> supplementation has been suggested to counteract the effects of excessive methionine, which is thought to be a mechanism of oxidative hepatotoxicity in IFALD, as discussed above. In a small case series, N-acetyl cysteine was given as a source of cysteine to two infants and one older child with IFALD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intestinal-failure-associated-liver-disease-in-infants/abstract/122\" class=\"abstract_t\">122</a>]. Treatment for 3 to 18 months with N-acetyl cysteine was associated with apparent improvement in cholestatic liver disease, as suggested by reductions in serum bilirubin, aminotransferase activities and ferritin in all three patients. Although these results are promising, considerably more study is required before this can be generally recommended as a treatment for IFALD.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Antioxidant therapy has been suggested as a therapeutic option in treating IFALD. This approach is based on the hypothesis that oxidative stress acts as a second &quot;hit&quot; leading to the cell injury and death in the setting of hepatic steatosis (see <a href=\"#H11\" class=\"local\">'Carbohydrate excess'</a> above). Although treatment with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=vitamin-e-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">vitamin E</a> appears to attenuate hepatic injury in animal models, human data is still lacking. Proponents of this hypothesis suggest that the addition of alpha tocopherol to parenteral lipid emulsions, either at the time of manufacturer or exogenously, can minimize risks for IFALD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intestinal-failure-associated-liver-disease-in-infants/abstract/69,123\" class=\"abstract_t\">69,123</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H27\"><span class=\"h1\">PREVENTION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>For all infants requiring parenteral nutrition (PN), we make concerted efforts to maximize enteral feedings and progressively wean off of PN as soon as possible, while preserving nutritional status. This is especially important in infants with short bowel syndrome. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-short-bowel-syndrome-in-children#H9\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of short bowel syndrome in children&quot;, section on 'Enteral feeding'</a>.)</p><p>In patients unable to be weaned from PN, the following interventions are used in an effort to prevent IFALD. We often use multiple approaches concurrently:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Review the nutritional history to ensure that the patient is not receiving excessive energy from carbohydrate or fats. For critically ill children who are fluid restricted, medications may be diluted in dextrose-containing fluids to deliver adequate calories. As fluids are liberalized, reducing the carbohydrate concentration of the PN may be necessary. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=parenteral-nutrition-in-infants-and-children#H135425541\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Parenteral nutrition in infants and children&quot;, section on 'How to prescribe PN'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Review the medication list for potentially hepatotoxic medications that could be contributing to the development of liver disease. As an example, drugs such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ranitidine-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">ranitidine</a> (which is often added directly to PN) can cause elevations of serum aminotransferase levels. Cholestasis may be associated with certain anti-infectives, such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fluconazole-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">fluconazole</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole-co-trimoxazole-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=erythromycin-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">erythromycin</a>, and penicillins (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=oxacillin-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">oxacillin</a> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ampicillin-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">ampicillin</a>).

There is some evidence that this limits PN hepatotoxicity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intestinal-failure-associated-liver-disease-in-infants/abstract/124\" class=\"abstract_t\">124</a>]. Cycling of PN is not generally tolerated in neonates because of hypoglycemia, and is not usually attempted before 44 to 48 weeks postmenstrual age. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=parenteral-nutrition-in-infants-and-children#H20519158\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Parenteral nutrition in infants and children&quot;, section on 'Cycling'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Limit the lipid dose of pure soybean oil lipid emulsions in the PN prescription.

This replaces the term parenteral nutrition-associated liver disease (PNALD), which recognized the important role of parenteral nutrition in the pathogenesis of the disease. The diagnosis of IFALD is usually made on clinical grounds in children with intestinal failure, long-term dependence on parenteral nutrition (PN), and cholestasis, if other specific causes of liver injury have been excluded. Cholestasis is usually defined as an elevated serum conjugated bilirubin &ge;2 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> (34.2 <span class=\"nowrap\">micromol/L)</span>. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Definition'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Risk factors for developing IFALD are young age, short bowel syndrome, intercurrent infections, lack of enteral feedings, and duration of PN. Emerging evidence suggests that the soybean oils that are used in conventional intravenous lipid emulsions may contribute to the risk for developing IFALD. (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Epidemiology'</a> above and <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Pathogenesis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The clinical features of IFALD are conjugated hyperbilirubinemia, with mild or moderate elevations of serum AST, ALT, and GGTP. The liver disease is usually progressive unless parenteral therapy can be discontinued. End-stage liver disease develops in a substantial portion of infants requiring sustained PN, and leads to liver transplantation or death. (See <a href=\"#H13\" class=\"local\">'Clinical features'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H29\"><span class=\"h2\">General measures</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For all infants requiring PN, the risk for IFALD can be reduced by adjusting PN to provide the minimum level of total energy and macronutrients required for adequate growth, transitioning to enteral feeds as rapidly as is tolerated, cycling PN when possible, and preventing and promptly treating catheter-related sepsis. Techniques that are useful for maximizing enteral feeds in infants with short bowel syndrome are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"#H18\" class=\"local\">'Enteral feeding'</a> above and <a href=\"#H27\" class=\"local\">'Prevention'</a> above and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-short-bowel-syndrome-in-children\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of short bowel syndrome in children&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For infants requiring PN for more than 30 days, we suggest administering lipids at no more than 1 <span class=\"nowrap\">gram/kg/day</span> (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). This suggestion assumes that adequate calories for growth can be safely provided through other PN components. (See <a href=\"#H19\" class=\"local\">'Parenteral nutrition composition'</a> above and <a href=\"#H651357938\" class=\"local\">'Lipid reduction strategies'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H30\"><span class=\"h2\">Treatment</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The optimal management of IFALD has not been established, and may continue to evolve with improvements in understanding the pathogenesis of the disorder. Recognizing that the evidence supporting any of the interventions described above is limited, we take the following approach in our practice:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For infants who develop cholestasis (conjugated bilirubin &gt;2 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL),</span> we ensure that each of the general measures discussed above are in place, particularly reduction of the lipid dose to no more than 1 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/kg/day,</span> and adjusting PN to provide the minimum level of total energy and macronutrients required for adequate growth. (See <a href=\"#H651357938\" class=\"local\">'Lipid reduction strategies'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For infants who develop cholestasis and are able to tolerate some enteral intake, we generally treat with ursodiol (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=ursodeoxycholic-acid-ursodiol-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">ursodeoxycholic acid</a>), 10 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg/dose,</span> given twice or three times daily. (See <a href=\"#H21\" class=\"local\">'Ursodiol'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>If the direct bilirubin is &gt;2 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> for 30 days despite reduction of lipid dose and other preventative measures, we reduce the dose of the trace elements in the PN by 50 percent. We maintain the prior level of zinc supplementation through the use of supplements. Because the reduced dose of trace elements might cause copper deficiency, we monitor copper and ceruloplasmin periodically. (See <a href=\"#H12\" class=\"local\">'Other PN components'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For infants with severe and progressive IFALD despite the above measures, we suggest treating with a fish-oil source of lipids rather than soybean oil source (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). If fish oil is used as the exclusive source of lipids, at least 1 <span class=\"nowrap\">gram/kg/day</span> should be given, and the triene:tetraene ratio should be monitored to detect essential fatty acid deficiency. (See <a href=\"#H22\" class=\"local\">'Fish oil-based lipid emulsions'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Because the use of fish oil-based lipid emulsions for PN is still an investigational therapy in the United States, its implementation requires compassionate use protocols. These products are available and approved for this use in many countries outside of the United States.
