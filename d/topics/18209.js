Most cases of TTTS present in the early second trimester and are staged according to the Quintero system (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F107708\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef107708 \">table 1</a>). The stage may remain stable, regress, or progress over time, and progression can occur rapidly. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=twin-twin-transfusion-syndrome-and-twin-anemia-polycythemia-sequence-pathogenesis-and-diagnosis#H10\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Twin-twin transfusion syndrome and twin anemia polycythemia sequence: Pathogenesis and diagnosis&quot;, section on 'Monitoring for TTTS'</a>.)</p><p>The three primary approaches to management of TTTS are expectant management, fetoscopic laser ablation of anastomotic vessels, and amnioreduction. Selective fetal reduction is another option, but is rarely performed in the absence of discordant malformations or severe selective fetal growth restriction. The choice of approach depends on the Quintero stage, maternal symptoms and signs, gestational age, and availability of requisite technical expertise.</p><p>This topic will review the management and outcome of TTTS. The pathogenesis, clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and monitoring for TTTS are discussed separately.

No randomized trials have compared treatment approaches for stage I TTTS. A 2016 systematic review concluded that the optimal initial management of stage I TTTS &quot;remains in equipoise&quot; [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/twin-twin-transfusion-syndrome-management-and-outcome/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1936016371\"><span class=\"h2\">Women with no or tolerable symptoms and a normal cervical length</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4166261930\"><span class=\"h3\">Choice of therapy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>For women with Quintero stage I (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F107708\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef107708 \">table 1</a>) TTTS and no maternal symptoms or tolerable symptoms and transvaginal cervical length &gt;25 mm, we avoid intervention and monitor TTTS status with weekly ultrasound examinations to detect progression to more severe disease. In addition to the morbidity associated with any intervention, unnecessary intervention can affect therapeutic options later in pregnancy if intervention becomes indicated because of progressive disease. For example, amnioreduction performed as a first-line treatment of minimally symptomatic stage I disease can result in an inadvertent septostomy or bloody amniotic fluid, which would make subsequent laser treatment difficult to undertake when indicated because of worsening TTTS.</p><p>This approach is based on limited but reassuring data of the outcome of well-defined stage I disease in the absence of any intervention. In a 2016 systematic review of 18 observational studies, the pooled incidence of progression in these pregnancies was 27 percent (95% CI 16-39) and overall survival was 79 percent (95% CI 62-92) with expectant management [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/twin-twin-transfusion-syndrome-management-and-outcome/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Overall survival with amnioreduction, laser therapy if progression occurs, and laser therapy as first-line therapy was 77, 68, and 84 percent, respectively. Although these findings suggest laser surgery as a first-line treatment might have a small benefit, they are limited by the biases inherent in observational data. An international randomized trial comparing expectant management with laser ablation in management of stage I TTTS is underway and should provide better data on which to base recommendations regarding the appropriate role of early intervention at the onset of TTTS [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/twin-twin-transfusion-syndrome-management-and-outcome/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3513629834\"><span class=\"h3\">Prenatal follow-up and care</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>We monitor pregnancies with stage I TTTS and no maternal symptoms or tolerable symptoms and transvaginal cervical length &gt;30 mm for disease progression with ultrasound: </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Amniotic fluid volume is assessed weekly.

In a systematic review that assessed progression of stage I TTTS with various interventions, no pregnancy treated with laser ablation progressed to a more advanced Quintero stage, whereas 30 percent of pregnancies treated with amnioreduction progressed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/twin-twin-transfusion-syndrome-management-and-outcome/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>].</p><p>The procedure is described below.

We have adopted the following protocol for routine post-laser fetal surveillance:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Weekly ultrasounds are performed for the first two weeks and then every other week after laser therapy until 30 weeks of gestation, to evaluate for complications and response to therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/twin-twin-transfusion-syndrome-management-and-outcome/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>] (see <a href=\"#H106993491\" class=\"local\">'Complications'</a> below):</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>The amniotic fluid and fetal membranes are assessed to detect signs of membrane separation, inadvertent septostomy, membrane rupture, unexpected changes in amniotic fluid volume, and evidence of a therapeutic response. Normalization of the amniotic fluid volume occurs by week 5 in the donor amniotic sac and by week 8 in the recipient amniotic sac in more than 95 percent of cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/twin-twin-transfusion-syndrome-management-and-outcome/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>MCA-PSV is measured to detect TAPS due to residual placental anastomoses TAPS usually occurs in the first six weeks after laser therapy. As discussed above, TAPS is diagnosed when MCA-PSV is &gt;1.5 MoM in one fetus in conjunction with a value of &lt;1.0 MoM in the other. (See <a href=\"#H1346982519\" class=\"local\">'Twin anemia polycythemia sequence'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Fetal weight is estimated every three to four weeks to identify severe growth lag (ie, one fetus with estimated fetal weight &lt;10<sup>th </sup>percentile), which is typically seen in the ex-donor twin. Doppler blood flow studies of the umbilical artery in the growth-restricted fetus are obtained weekly once viability is reached. If absent or reversed diastolic flow is observed in the umbilical artery, Doppler flow studies of the ductus venosus are added to the monitoring paradigm.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Growth-restricted donor twins often exhibit catch-up growth after laser ablation. One study reported the proportion of donor twins with growth restriction fell from 65 to 29 percent after the procedure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/twin-twin-transfusion-syndrome-management-and-outcome/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. However, if preterm delivery because of growth restriction seems likely, a course of antenatal glucocorticoids is administered. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=antenatal-corticosteroid-therapy-for-reduction-of-neonatal-respiratory-morbidity-and-mortality-from-preterm-delivery\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Antenatal corticosteroid therapy for reduction of neonatal respiratory morbidity and mortality from preterm delivery&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Normalization of the amniotic fluid volume occurs by week 5 in the donor amniotic sac and by week 8 in the recipient amniotic sac in more than 95 percent of cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/twin-twin-transfusion-syndrome-management-and-outcome/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. Therefore, after the first two weeks, ultrasound examination is performed every two weeks to assess for recurrent TTTS, TAPS, and fetal growth and development. (See <a href=\"#H1737441589\" class=\"local\">'Persistent or recurrent TTTS'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Beginning at 30 weeks of gestation, biophysical profile scores are obtained weekly.</p><p/><p>We do not routinely order postlaser fetal magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Although 2 to 6 percent of fetuses will have an ischemic hemorrhagic lesion on MRI at 30 to 32 weeks of gestation following laser therapy, one study noted that 82 percent of these cases were detected by ultrasound prior to MRI [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/twin-twin-transfusion-syndrome-management-and-outcome/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. In addition, monochorionic twins are known to have white matter injury, even those without known diagnosis of TTTS, so if an injury is seen, it will not be known whether it is due to the procedure. Lastly, few centers have qualified individuals on-site to <span class=\"nowrap\">read/interpret</span> a fetal MRI. </p><p>However, MRI may be informative in cases with a co-twin demise postlaser. In theory, all vascular communications between the twins should be closed so the surviving co-twin should not be at risk of <span class=\"nowrap\">hypotension/emboli</span> at the time of the demise, but since recurrent TTTS is possible, International Society of Ultrasound in Obstetrics and Gynecology (ISUOG) guidelines suggest consideration of imaging (MRI) 4 to 6 weeks after a demise is detected [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/twin-twin-transfusion-syndrome-management-and-outcome/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>].</p><p>We schedule delivery by 37+0 weeks of gestation, in the absence of complications necessitating earlier delivery.

Practically, laser ablation at more advanced gestational ages would be subject to several technical limitations: Fetal vernix in the amniotic fluid reduces optimal visualization, placental vessels are larger in caliber and more difficult to successfully coagulate, and current fetoscopes may not easily traverse greater in utero distances. However, some centers outside the United States offer laser ablation after 26 weeks of gestation, and there is increasing evidence that procedures performed at later gestational ages can result in outcomes comparable with those performed in the traditional 16- to 26-week period [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/twin-twin-transfusion-syndrome-management-and-outcome/abstract/17-20\" class=\"abstract_t\">17-20</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H171924003\"><span class=\"h3\">Prenatal follow-up and care</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>We have adopted the following protocol for routine post-amnioreduction fetal surveillance:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Following amnioreduction, fetal ultrasound examination is performed weekly to evaluate for complications, progression to more advanced stage of TTTS, and response to therapy.

Overall perinatal survival with Quintero stage II or more was only approximately 30 percent in a literature review of 28 studies involving a total of 68 pregnancies with untreated TTTS between 1966 and 1991 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/twin-twin-transfusion-syndrome-management-and-outcome/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. By comparison, perinatal survival was approximately 60 percent in two large series with therapeutic intervention [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/twin-twin-transfusion-syndrome-management-and-outcome/abstract/22,23\" class=\"abstract_t\">22,23</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3850880923\"><span class=\"h2\">Choice of therapy at 16 to 26 weeks of gestation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Fetoscopic laser ablation of placental anastomoses is the preferred procedure for definitive treatment of Quintero stage II to IV TTTS between 16 and 26 weeks of gestation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/twin-twin-transfusion-syndrome-management-and-outcome/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>].</p><p>Although a 2014 meta-analysis of randomized trials comparing laser ablation with amnioreduction did not find a statistically significant improvement in survival with laser therapy, the two trials had discordant results (Eurofetus reported improved survival with laser ablation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/twin-twin-transfusion-syndrome-management-and-outcome/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]; the United States trial did not [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/twin-twin-transfusion-syndrome-management-and-outcome/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]) and in both trials the laser ablation group was more likely to be alive without neurologic complications at six years of age [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/twin-twin-transfusion-syndrome-management-and-outcome/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. However, there were several limitations to these data: &lt;200 pregnancies were studied; approximately 90 percent of pregnancies in both trials had stage II or III disease, but the proportions of stage I and stage IV disease randomized were insufficient to answer the question regarding benefit. The Eurofetus trial enrolled patients at all stages of TTTS; of the 142 randomized cases, 11 were stage I (6 randomized to laser and 5 to amnioreduction) and 2 were stage IV cases (1 randomized to laser and 1 to amnioreduction). In the United States trial, stage I cases were excluded; of the 42 randomized cases, 4 were stage IV (3 randomized to laser and 1 to amnioreduction). Thus pregnancies in the United States trial were at the more severe end of the disease spectrum. Both trials were stopped early: Eurofetus was stopped early because a planned interim analysis demonstrated a significant benefit in the laser group. The United States trial was stopped early because referring clinicians were no longer willing to refer patients to the participating centers for randomization after the publication of the Eurofetus report. The reduced enrollment along with the finding of a statistical trend in adverse outcomes in recipient twins undergoing laser resulted in the decision to stop the trial.</p><p>Additional support for the effectiveness of laser therapy was provided by a 2013 meta-analysis of cerebral injury following laser therapy versus amnioreduction, which included four observational studies involving 357 children in the amnioreduction group and 269 children in the laser group [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/twin-twin-transfusion-syndrome-management-and-outcome/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. Cerebral injury in live born infants in the amnioreduction group was more than sevenfold higher than in live borns in the laser group (95% CI 2.8-20). After excluding neonatal deaths from the analysis, infants from pregnancies treated with amnioreduction still had a marked increase in neurologic injury (relative risk 3.23, 95% CI 1.45-7.14) compared with the laser group. The gestational age at the time of intervention was comparable, 20 to 22 weeks; however, the median gestational age at delivery was lower in the amnioreduction group compared with the laser group, 28 to 31 versus 32 to 34. The authors speculated that the increased risk of cerebral injury in the amnioreduction group was due to the higher rate of prematurity.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H288481423\"><span class=\"h3\">Prenatal follow-up and care</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Prenatal follow-up and care are identical to that in stage I TTTS patients treated with laser ablation.

The goal is to optimize the outcome for the surviving co-twin and avoid complications of iatrogenic prematurity. A thorough ultrasound survey of the surviving co-twin should be performed including Doppler blood flows studies of the middle cerebral artery peak systolic velocity (MCA-PSV). Excluding fetal anemia (MCA-PSV) in the setting of an acute fetal co-twin demise essentially eliminates the possibility that major exsanguination occurred and most likely has a favorable prognosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/twin-twin-transfusion-syndrome-management-and-outcome/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. In the preterm fetus, expectant observation with serial fetal ultrasound examinations every three to four weeks is performed to follow fetal growth and central nervous development.

We perform in utero transfusion after an acute demise when fetal anemia is documented by MCA-PSV &gt;1.5 MoMs. A fetal blood sample is drawn for <span class=\"nowrap\">hemoglobin/hematocrit</span> and a slow transfusion is started while awaiting the results, which are used to determine the volume of transfusion.

Although anastomoses exist deep in the placenta, their afferent and efferent branches are superficial. Theoretically, coagulation of the superficial vessels should eliminate unbalanced twin-twin transfusion.</p><p>The procedure is available at several tertiary obstetrical centers in the United States and worldwide. It should only be performed by clinicians with extensive training and expertise performing the procedure.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1341819151\"><span class=\"h2\">Patient preparation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Fetoscopic laser coagulation is generally performed as an outpatient procedure under local anesthesia with intravenous sedation, although some centers use regional anesthesia. General anesthesia with endotracheal intubation may be required in select cases because of maternal respiratory distress from extreme polyhydramnios. We administer a first-generation cephalosporin within one hour of starting the procedure; <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nifedipine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">nifedipine</a> 10 mg orally is given just prior to the procedure to suppress uterine contractions. After 24 weeks of gestation, a course of antenatal corticosteroids is administered in case of preterm delivery. Although some centers administer <a href=\"topic.htm?path=indomethacin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">indomethacin</a> rather than nifedipine, we do not use indomethacin because of reports of an increased risk of renal compromise in the donor twin when multiple doses of this agent were used to treat hydramnios in the recipient twin.</p><p>A thorough obstetrical ultrasound examination is performed, including determination of the distance between the two placental umbilical cord insertion sites. If the sites are too close together (defined as &lt;2 cm), the vascular anastomoses can be difficult to visualize and coagulate [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/twin-twin-transfusion-syndrome-management-and-outcome/abstract/30,31\" class=\"abstract_t\">30,31</a>] and an alternative intervention or expectant management may be necessary. However, proximate cord insertions are uncommon, occurring in only 1 to 2 percent of cases of TTTS.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3145684519\"><span class=\"h2\">Procedure</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The suspected inter-twin vascular equator is located in the region between the two placental umbilical cord insertion sites. The lie of the &quot;stuck&quot; donor twin typically parallels this equator. A site for entry into the recipient sac is selected at 90 degrees to the equator. Power Doppler is used to locate an avascular area in the uterine wall. </p><p>The skin is prepped with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hexachlorophene-united-states-not-available-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">hexachlorophene</a> and anesthetized with a local anesthetic (we use 0.25 percent <a href=\"topic.htm?path=bupivacaine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">bupivacaine</a>). Percutaneous entry may be via the Seldinger technique or by sharp trocar. For the Seldinger technique, an 18-gauge diamond point needle is inserted followed by insertion of a J wire through the needle and then removal of the needle. A 9 to 12 French intravenous catheter is then placed percutaneously over the guide wire under ultrasound guidance. Alternatively, a sharp metal trocar can be placed in the cannula and used for entry into the uterus.</p><p>A 2 to 3 mm diameter fetoscope is then inserted through the cannula. If the placenta is anterior and centrally located, entry into the uterus from an extreme lateral approach can result in puncture of the placental edge or the dilated adnexal vascular complex. Specialized fetoscopes with 30 and 70 degree lens have been developed that allow better visualization of the anterior placenta in these cases. In rare cases where percutaneous access is not possible due to the adnexal vasculature, a laparoscopic-assisted approach can be utilized. This method directs the fetoscope through the posterior-lateral uterine wall under direct visualization [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/twin-twin-transfusion-syndrome-management-and-outcome/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>].</p><p>We try to visualize all four distal extremities of both fetuses. This is especially important in cases of TTTS complicated by twin anemia polycythemia sequence (TAPS) where the plethoric twin may show signs of thrombosis of extremities (eg, skin bullae and blanching of the affected limb) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/twin-twin-transfusion-syndrome-management-and-outcome/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>].</p><p>We prefer the equatorial dichorionization (Solomon) technique, which has three components:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Identify the vascular equator and map the anastomoses</strong> &ndash; The inter-twin membrane on the placental surface is located as a landmark. The vascular equator is then identified and the types of anastomoses mapped. The type of anastomosis is determined based on several features as they are visualized through the fetoscope.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Arteriovenous (AV) or venoarterial (VA) connections appear as a single vessel originating from the donor or recipient; this vessel disappears into the placental mass and a second vessel in immediate proximity of the disappearing vessel can be traced leading back to the co-twin. The arterial component of the anastomosis is dark red-blue (deoxygenated blood), while the venous component is bright red (oxygenated blood). If color differentiation can be easily discerned, a vessel can be traced back to its origin from the cord insertion into the placenta. Placental arteries are noted to cross over placental veins.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Arterio-arterial (AA) anastomoses appear as dark tortuous vessels that connect the twin circulations on the surface of the placenta. Often, pulsating color changes can be seen by fetoscopy as the blood components of the two twins oscillate in the vessel.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Veno-venous (VV) anastomoses are rare. When present, they appear as relatively straight vessels that course between the two fetal circulations on the placental surface.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">In most cases, the vascular equator can be located in the recipient sac; however, occasionally it is irregular with some component located in the donor sac. The uterine wall at either end of the placenta is examined carefully to ensure that an eccentric communicating vessel is not coursing outside of the placental mass.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Coagulate all visible anastomoses</strong> &ndash; Laser energy (20 to 40 watts from a diode or YAG laser) is applied through a 400 to 600 micron quartz fiber introduced through an operating channel in the fetoscope. A second channel allows for continuous irrigation to promote visualization. The anastomotic vessels are then coagulated in a specific sequential sequence (called sequential selective laser photocoagulation): Arteriovenous (AV, donor artery to recipient vein), then venous-arterial (VA, donor vein to recipient artery), and lastly arterial-arterial (AA) and venous-venous (VV) anastomoses. As an example, ablation of an AV anastomosis is shown in the video (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F64395\" class=\"graphic graphic_movie graphicRef64395 \">movie 1</a>) and in the following series of photographs (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F67539\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef67539 \">picture 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F80616\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef80616 \">picture 2</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F56339\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef56339 \">picture 3</a>).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Sequential selective ablation has been associated with a 40 to 50 percent reduction in risk of intrauterine demise of the donor or recipient twin compared with selective ablation, the older standard technique. The sequential selective technique requires a specific order of ablation of the type of anastomoses as stated above, whereas ablations of the anastomoses with the selective technique are done in no specific order [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/twin-twin-transfusion-syndrome-management-and-outcome/abstract/23,34\" class=\"abstract_t\">23,34</a>]. It has also been associated with an almost doubling of the rate of dual perinatal survival. However, these results should be interpreted cautiously because pregnancies that underwent the standard procedure in these studies did so because of technical difficulties that prevented them from receiving the full sequential selective treatment, potentially biasing the results [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/twin-twin-transfusion-syndrome-management-and-outcome/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Coagulate the vascular equator (equatorial dichorionization)</strong> &ndash; After coagulation of all visible anastomoses, a thin line of placental surface at the vascular equator is coagulated. This line extends from one edge of the placenta to the other and connects the white areas that resulted from coagulation of the individual anastomoses. The two parts of the chorionic surface of the placenta become completely separated.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">In a multicenter randomized trial comparing this Solomon technique with standard laser coagulation (ie, without coagulation of the vascular equator) in 274 patients with Quintero stage II, III, or IV TTTS, equatorial dichorionization resulted in lower rates of TAPS (3 versus 16 percent, odds ratio [OR] 0.16, 95% CI 0.05-0.49) and recurrence of TTTS (1 versus 7 percent, OR 0.21, 95% CI 0.04-0.98) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/twin-twin-transfusion-syndrome-management-and-outcome/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>]. When placentas were injected after delivery to look for residual anastomoses, fewer residual anastomoses were found when equatorial coagulation was performed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/twin-twin-transfusion-syndrome-management-and-outcome/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>]. However, equatorial coagulation did not lead to significant differences in perinatal mortality or severe neonatal morbidity, and neurodevelopment outcomes at two years of age were similar for both approaches [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/twin-twin-transfusion-syndrome-management-and-outcome/abstract/35,37\" class=\"abstract_t\">35,37</a>].</p><p/><p>The fetoscope is then removed and an amnioreduction is performed until the amniotic fluid volume appears normal in the recipient sac (maximum vertical pocket &lt;8 cm).

The decision regarding the best approach is based on gestational age and the acuity of the TAPS. If there is a significant disparity in the MCA velocities of the twins soon after the procedure, we offer selective fetal reduction or an attempt at repeat laser ablation.

(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=intrauterine-fetal-transfusion-of-red-cells\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Intrauterine fetal transfusion of red cells&quot;</a>.) Some centers will undertake a partial exchange of the plethoric twin at the same setting to potentially reduce the complications associated with hyperviscosity. In these cases, aliquots of blood are removed and replaced with equal volumes of sterile saline. Repeat procedures are based on subsequent MCA-PSVs. after 32+0 weeks of gestation.

There is no consensus regarding how much fluid to remove, how rapidly to remove the fluid, use of tocolytic medications, or use of antibiotics.</p><p>A reasonable approach is to anesthetize the skin with a long-acting local anesthetic (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=bupivacaine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">bupivacaine</a>). Under ultrasound guidance, a long 18-gauge spinal needle is introduced into the amniotic sac with polyhydramnios, avoiding the placental edge, if possible. The placenta may be markedly thinned on ultrasound imaging because of uterine distension from the excessive amniotic fluid. </p><p>The needle is placed as close to the midline of the uterus as possible with a slight angulation toward the maternal xiphoid to reduce the risk of needle displacement as the uterine size diminishes with drainage of amniotic fluid. The needle can be connected to one end of the specialized tubing included in a disposable thoracocentesis tray (male to male ends) while the other end of the tubing is connected to a short 18-gauge needle that is spiked into a disposable vacuum bottle. This set-up maintains a closed system, avoids excessive needle manipulation, and allows the rate of flow to be controlled with the rollerball valve in the line.</p><p>Some authors recommend removing fluid until polyhydramnios is no longer present (maximum vertical pocket &lt;8 cm); others suggest removing no more than 5 liters of amniotic fluid over approximately an hour [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/twin-twin-transfusion-syndrome-management-and-outcome/abstract/80\" class=\"abstract_t\">80</a>]. Decompression of the uterus with rapid removal of a large volume of fluid may cause placental abruption or fetal bradycardia; therefore, we suggest removing no more than 3 liters of fluid in severe TTTS.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H860705111\"><span class=\"h2\">Outcome</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The International Amnioreduction Registry reported outcomes from the largest series of TTTS patients undergoing amnioreduction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/twin-twin-transfusion-syndrome-management-and-outcome/abstract/81\" class=\"abstract_t\">81</a>]. A total of 223 twin pregnancies from 20 fetal medicine units were diagnosed with TTTS prior to 28 weeks of gestation and treated with 760 amnioreductions. The major findings from this series were:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Complications associated with the procedure included PPROM within 48 hours of the procedure (6 percent), spontaneous delivery (3 percent), fetal distress (2 percent), fetal death (2 percent), placental abruption (1.3 percent), and chorioamnionitis (1 percent).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Both twins were live born in 55 percent of pregnancies, one twin was live born in 31 percent, and both twins were stillborn in the remaining 14 percent. During the first four weeks of neonatal life, an additional 30 percent of liveborn twins succumbed.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Intracranial abnormalities were observed on neonatal cranial ultrasound in 24 percent of recipient twins and 25 percent of donor twins that survived to four weeks of age.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3182452927\"><span class=\"h1\">SELECTIVE FETAL REDUCTION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Selective reduction of one twin is an option that may improve the prognosis of the co-twin if a technique is used that does not impact its circulation. While perinatal outcomes are comparable amongst the various procedures (bipolar cord coagulation, laser cord coagulation, and radiofrequency ablation [RFA]), RFA is our preferred technique for selective reduction of monochorionic twins because the smaller device reduces maternal morbidity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/twin-twin-transfusion-syndrome-management-and-outcome/abstract/82\" class=\"abstract_t\">82</a>].</p><p>The fetus predicted to have the least chance for survival is usually selected for the reduction procedure. For example, a recipient with advance cardiac findings or hydrops or a donor that is growth restricted with discordant fetal weight &gt;30 percent and abnormal umbilical artery Doppler [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/twin-twin-transfusion-syndrome-management-and-outcome/abstract/83\" class=\"abstract_t\">83</a>].</p><p>The available data do not show a difference in survival according to whether the donor or recipient twin is targeted [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/twin-twin-transfusion-syndrome-management-and-outcome/abstract/84\" class=\"abstract_t\">84</a>]. If bipolar cautery is used, reduction of the recipient twin is technically easier since its cord is easily visualized floating amid the excess amniotic fluid. Oligohydramnios around the donor makes this twin a more difficult target, although the donor cord can be grasped through the inter-twin membrane after entry into the recipient's amniotic cavity. This can result in a septostomy and the risk of subsequent cord entanglement. However, if the donor twin is the primary target, amnioinfusion can be performed to improve access for the bipolar forceps. Radiofrequency ablation does not require amnioinfusion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/twin-twin-transfusion-syndrome-management-and-outcome/abstract/85\" class=\"abstract_t\">85</a>].</p><p>Experience with selective reduction for TTTS is limited. One study including 15 cases of TTTS treated with bipolar coagulation of the umbilical cord reported an overall survival of 87 percent in the co-twin, but preterm prelabor rupture of membranes occurred in 20 percent of pregnancies within three weeks of the procedure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/twin-twin-transfusion-syndrome-management-and-outcome/abstract/86\" class=\"abstract_t\">86</a>].

We perform weekly ultrasound examinations to detect progression to more severe disease. We also follow these pregnancies with weekly Doppler blood flow studies to assess middle cerebral artery peak systolic velocities (MCA-PSV) and biophysical profile scoring, beginning at 28 and 30 weeks of gestation, respectively. Delivery is scheduled at 36 to 37 weeks if TTTS stage and symptoms remain stable. (See <a href=\"#H1936016371\" class=\"local\">'Women with no or tolerable symptoms and a normal cervical length'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For women with Quintero stage I TTTS at 16 to 26 weeks of gestation with debilitating symptoms (eg, significant respiratory distress <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> preterm contractions) or short cervix (&le;25 mm) due to severe polyhydramnios, we recommend fetoscopic laser ablation rather than amnioreduction (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=2\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1B</a>). Amnioreduction performed as a first-line treatment can result in an inadvertent septostomy or bloody amniotic fluid, which would make subsequent laser treatment difficult to undertake when indicated because of worsening TTTS. Amnioreduction is also more likely to require serial procedures. (See <a href=\"#H765350812\" class=\"local\">'Women with debilitating symptoms or short cervical length at 16 to 26 weeks of gestation'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Post-laser therapy, normalization of the amniotic fluid volume occurs by week 5 in the donor amniotic sac and by week 8 in the recipient amniotic sac in more than 95 percent of cases.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>These pregnancies are followed closely with ultrasound and Doppler to detect abnormalities of amniotic fluid volume, abnormalities of the inter-twin membranes, and discordance in MCA-PSV or fetal growth. Biophysical profile scoring is performed weekly as of 30 weeks of gestation. Delivery is scheduled at 36 to 37 weeks of gestation, in the absence of complications necessitating earlier delivery.

The US Food and Drug Administration investigational device exemption for fetoscopes limits their use to treatment of TTTS at 16 to 26 weeks of gestation, and practically, laser ablation at more advanced gestational ages would be subject to several technical limitations.

Delivery is scheduled at 36 to 37 weeks of gestation in the absence of complications necessitating earlier delivery.

We use a sequential selective technique followed by the &quot;Solomon&quot; method to assure complete dichorionization of the placenta.

Use of laser therapy after 26 weeks is limited in the United States due to US Food and Drug Administration restrictions on the use of current fetoscopes as well as technical issues that make laser therapy difficult in the third trimester. (See <a href=\"#H1777599192\" class=\"local\">'Choice of therapy at &gt;26 weeks of gestation'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Selective feticide may be the best option when TTTS is complicated by a life-threatening anomaly in one of the fetuses, after failed laser ablation, or when TAPS or recurrent TTTS occurs soon after laser therapy.
