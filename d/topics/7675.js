The introduction of balloon angioplasty, formally termed percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA), in the 1970s provided a nonsurgical revascularization alternative to coronary artery bypass graft surgery (CABG). However, acute arterial recoil and coronary dissection were early and potentially fatal complications of the procedure and angiographic restenosis occurred in approximately 40 percent of patients at six months, 50 to 75 percent of whom had recurrent ischemic symptoms. Accordingly, 20 to 30 percent of patients required repeat revascularization of the initially treated lesion within the first year after balloon angioplasty. Recurrent ischemic symptoms after one year were most often due to a new or progressive lesion; the initially treated lesion remained stable or actually regressed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/general-principles-of-the-use-of-intracoronary-stents/abstract/1-3\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-3</a>].</p><p>Bare metal stents (BMS) were developed to prevent abrupt artery closure due to recoil or dissection following balloon angioplasty and they succeeded in doing so. Acute closure has been reduced from 2 to 10 percent with PTCA alone to &lt;1 percent in the stent era. In the stent era, PCI became safer with low rates of periprocedural myocardial infarction and emergency CABG. </p><p>As a result, stenting became the standard of care for PCIs, with balloon angioplasty alone being used only in situations where a stent could not be delivered to the targeted lesion. With refinement of stent design and implantation technique, the rate of clinically-indicated target lesion revascularization at one year after BMS placement fell to between 10 and 20 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/general-principles-of-the-use-of-intracoronary-stents/abstract/4-6\" class=\"abstract_t\">4-6</a>]. The rate has fallen further with the placement of drug-eluting stents in most patients.

Vessels smaller than 2 mm are not suitable for stenting. Tortuous, angulated, and calcified arterial segments continue to pose challenges for even the newest stent designs because of difficulty delivering the stent to the target lesion. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=drug-eluting-intracoronary-stents-general-principles\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Drug-eluting intracoronary stents: General principles&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Coronary stents are delivered and deployed on balloon catheters (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F52634\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef52634 \">figure 1</a>), which are inserted via the femoral or the radial artery. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Optimal stenting</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The single most important contribution to stenting efficacy is to achieve full expansion of the arterial lumen (so-called optimal stenting). Attainment of a large luminal diameter minimizes the risk of both stent thrombosis and restenosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/general-principles-of-the-use-of-intracoronary-stents/abstract/4,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,5</a>]. Suboptimal luminal dilation is due to inadequate balloon expansion. This may be related to plaque characteristics, poor technique, or to elastic recoil, which is associated with stent design and resistance [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/general-principles-of-the-use-of-intracoronary-stents/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].

As with balloon angioplasty, there should be final TIMI low grade 3, without occlusion of a significant side branch, flow-limiting dissection, distal embolization, or angiographic thrombus&hellip;&rdquo; [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/general-principles-of-the-use-of-intracoronary-stents/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>].</p><p>The deleterious effects of suboptimal stenting were illustrated in the STARS trial in which 16 percent of patients who underwent stenting were excluded from the randomized study because of a suboptimal result (defined as residual stenosis &gt;10 percent, evidence of stent thrombosis, dissection or abrupt closure, absence of TIMI III flow, or need for three or more stents) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/general-principles-of-the-use-of-intracoronary-stents/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. Those with suboptimal stenting had the following differences in outcome compared to patients who achieved an optimal stent result:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>An increase in the periprocedural non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (MI) (8.7 versus 4.2 percent), overall 30-day mortality (1.1 versus 0.06 percent), and clinical restenosis (27 versus 16 percent); the last effect was associated with a smaller final lumen diameter and the use of multiple stents.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>At nine months, an increased incidence of major cardiac events (death, MI, target lesion revascularization), largely due to increases in non-ST elevation MI (9 versus 4.6 percent), and the need for target vessel revascularization (15.5 versus 10.2 percent).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>These findings have been supported by other data from the drug-eluting stent (DES) era, wherein stent underexpansion has been associated with adverse late outcomes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/general-principles-of-the-use-of-intracoronary-stents/abstract/12,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,13</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h3\">Predilation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Predilation of the lesion is performed in most cases. Direct stenting, an alternative, may be reasonable based upon anticipated ease of delivery and deployment. Should predilation suggest that the lesion is not &quot;dilatable,&quot; an alternative strategy such as rotational atherectomy, high-pressure noncompliant balloon dilatation, or not placing a stent needs to be considered. Angiographic predictors of inability to predilate include moderate or severe coronary calcification, heavy plaque burden, or diffuse coronary artery disease. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H546978945\"><span class=\"h3\">Direct stenting without predilation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The availability of low-profile stent-delivery systems has led to the consideration of direct stenting (ie, without predilation). Although stenting reduces the incidence of restenosis after percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty, the classic approach of predilation, stent deployment, and high-pressure post-dilation is associated with increased procedure duration, more radiation exposure and contrast use, and increased cost compared to direct stenting [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/general-principles-of-the-use-of-intracoronary-stents/abstract/14,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">14,15</a>].</p><p>Settings in which direct stenting might be considered include [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/general-principles-of-the-use-of-intracoronary-stents/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Vessel &ge;2.5 mm in diameter</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Proximal lesion location</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Absence of severe coronary calcification</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Absence of significant angulation (bend &gt;45&ordm;)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Absence of very severe lesions and bifurcation lesions </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>ST-elevation MI</p><p/><p>A number of randomized clinical trials (BET, SWIBAP, PREDICT, CONVERTIBLE, and TRENDS) have compared direct stenting to stenting after balloon dilation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/general-principles-of-the-use-of-intracoronary-stents/abstract/16-20\" class=\"abstract_t\">16-20</a>]. Major outcomes were similar, including procedural success (although 6 to 14 percent of patients in the direct stenting group required predilation because of an inability to cross the lesion), adverse effects, and major cardiac events at follow-up. The authors of PREDICT concluded that direct stenting was safe and successful, but offered only modest cost savings and no reduction in late restenosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/general-principles-of-the-use-of-intracoronary-stents/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>].</p><p>Given the limited advantages and potential risks, we favor predilation in most lesions. One possible exception is in degenerated saphenous vein grafts. In this situation, each balloon dilatation is associated with a risk of embolization of degenerated graft material and obstruction of the coronary microcirculation and its consequences.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h3\">High pressure balloon dilation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A major strategy to attain optimal stent deployment is high-pressure balloon dilation during or after stent deployment. Initial studies showed clear improvement in stent expansion and apposition with high-pressure dilation post-stenting [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/general-principles-of-the-use-of-intracoronary-stents/abstract/21-23\" class=\"abstract_t\">21-23</a>]. These observations provided the basis for modern stenting techniques using routine high-pressure dilation in addition to antiplatelet therapy to prevent stent thrombosis. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=antithrombotic-therapy-for-elective-percutaneous-coronary-intervention-clinical-studies\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Antithrombotic therapy for elective percutaneous coronary intervention: Clinical studies&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Stents are usually deployed with a high-pressure technique utilizing &ge;12 to 16 atm. Lower pressure deployment (8 to 14 atm) is indicated when there is significant vessel tapering or when proximal edge injury is a concern, as is the case with use of DES. In most cases, we perform high-pressure post-dilation with an appropriately sized noncompliant balloon at a minimum of 12 to 16 atm to achieve full stent expansion. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h3\">IVUS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Intravascular ultrasound (IVUS, also called intracoronary ultrasound) is a diagnostic procedure that allows the operator to visualize how well a stent is deployed; this includes quantitating the residual luminal diameter [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/general-principles-of-the-use-of-intracoronary-stents/abstract/21,24\" class=\"abstract_t\">21,24</a>]. Several studies have assessed the benefit of routine IVUS. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=intravascular-ultrasound-optical-coherence-tomography-and-angioscopy-of-coronary-circulation#H321553541\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Intravascular ultrasound, optical coherence tomography, and angioscopy of coronary circulation&quot;, section on 'Intravascular ultrasound'</a>.)</p><p>Early studies of patients who received bare metal stents suggested a reduction in the need for target vessel revascularization from routine IVUS guidance [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/general-principles-of-the-use-of-intracoronary-stents/abstract/22,25\" class=\"abstract_t\">22,25</a>], but the results from subsequent randomized trials are conflicting [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/general-principles-of-the-use-of-intracoronary-stents/abstract/26-30\" class=\"abstract_t\">26-30</a>].</p><p>With regard to early drug-eluting stents (DES), multiple meta-analyses of predominantly small, observational studies have suggested that IVUS-guided implantation improves outcomes compared with angiographic guidance [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/general-principles-of-the-use-of-intracoronary-stents/abstract/31-33\" class=\"abstract_t\">31-33</a>]. In these meta-analyses, the large majority of patients received bare metal stent or early generation DES. </p><p>Second generation DES are now used most cases. In the IVUS-XPL trial, 1400 patients with at least one long coronary lesion (expected implanted stent length to be &ge;28 mm) requiring PCI determined at the time of diagnostic coronary angiography were identified [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/general-principles-of-the-use-of-intracoronary-stents/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>]. Patients were then randomly assigned to IVUS- or angiography-guided evaluation after PCI. Only everolimus-eluting stents were implanted. The primary outcome measure of major adverse cardiac events (cardiac death, target lesion-related myocardial infarction, or ischemic-driven target lesion revascularization) at one year occurred less often with IVUS&ndash;guided evaluation (2.9 versus 5.8 percent; hazard ratio 0.48, 95% CI 0.28-0.83). This result was driven by a lower risk of ischemia-driven target lesion revascularization (2.5 versus 5.0 percent). Adjunct post-stent balloon dilation was performed significantly more often in the IVUS-guided group (76 versus 57 percent). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=comparison-of-drug-eluting-intracoronary-stents#H21\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Comparison of drug-eluting intracoronary stents&quot;, section on 'Summary and recommendations'</a>.)</p><p>The optimal use of IVUS after stent placement is unknown and remains controversial. Due to the added time and expense and lack of availability in many interventional laboratories, IVUS tends to be performed in only a small proportion of patients, although use varies considerably between centers. It is most useful when under-expansion is suspected on coronary angiography, with long lesions, when the final size goal is uncertain, or when stent expansion is expected to be difficult, as with calcified lesions or a lesion in the left main coronary artery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/general-principles-of-the-use-of-intracoronary-stents/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. There is evidence that intracoronary imaging to help guide optimal PCI results in improved outcomes. Certainly, techniques to optimize stent results should be routine. Post-deployment high pressure dilation may meet this goal in most cases, but it is advisable that PCI operators are trained and have IVUS or optical coherence tomography (OCT) available for cases where optimal stent expansion or sizing is uncertain.</p><p>In patients with prior stent placement, IVUS may be especially valuable when restenosis or thrombosis occurs, particularly if these events develop as a result of stent underexpansion. Additionally, in some patients, stent thrombosis may be related to disease progression just proximal or distal to the stent. Such lesions can be identified by IVUS and are typically treated with an additional stent.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6097273\"><span class=\"h3\">Optical coherence tomography</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>OCT has a higher spatial resolution than IVUS and is more useful for assessing stent apposition and strut coverage during follow-up imaging. Both techniques may be useful for guiding optimal stent deployment.

Two measurements have been evaluated: the relative coronary flow velocity reserve and the coronary pressure-derived myocardial fractional flow reserve. </p><p>The coronary pressure-derived myocardial fractional flow reserve (FFRmyo) compares the intracoronary pressure distal to the stented site (measured with a specially designed angioplasty guidewire) to the aortic root pressure measured through the guiding catheter during maximal hyperemic flow produced by bolus intracoronary <a href=\"topic.htm?path=adenosine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">adenosine</a> injection or a continuous intravenous infusion. It is an easy, inexpensive, and rapidly obtainable index.

In the largest series, FFRmyo was measured in 750 patients who had undergone apparently satisfactory stent implantation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/general-principles-of-the-use-of-intracoronary-stents/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>]. At six months, adverse cardiac events occurred in 10 percent, primarily target vessel revascularization (70 percent) and MI (25 percent). By multivariate analysis, the FFR was the major independent predictor of adverse events. At a normal FFR (&gt;0.95) adverse events occurred in 4.9 percent compared to 6.2, 20.3, and 29.5 percent, respectively, for FFR between 0.90 and 0.95, &lt;0.9 and &lt;0.80.</p><p>Although these methods are useful to predict optimal stent result and predict future events, they are seldom used for this purpose, for which most operators rely on angiographic appearance or IVUS. </p><p>A separate issue is the value of the routine use of FFRmyo before PCI on all lesions deemed to require PCI using angiographic criteria.

It usually presents as recurrent angina but can present as acute myocardial infarction in approximately 10 percent of patients. It can usually be managed by repeat percutaneous revascularization. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=intracoronary-stent-restenosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Intracoronary stent restenosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p>In contrast, stent thrombosis is an abrupt thrombotic occlusion of a previously widely patent stent.&nbsp;It is a catastrophic complication that presents as sudden death or large myocardial infarction in most patients.&nbsp;Despite successful repeat revascularization, the six-month mortality is high.
