It happens when a gland in your neck, called the thyroid gland, makes too much thyroid hormone (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F66834\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef66834 \">figure 1</a>). This hormone controls how the body uses and stores energy.</p><p>Hyperthyroidism is the medical term for when a person makes too much thyroid hormone. People sometimes confuse this condition with HYPOthyroidism, which is when a person does not make enough thyroid hormone.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H471368526\"><span class=\"h1\">What are the symptoms of hyperthyroidism?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Some people with hyperthyroidism have no symptoms. When they do occur, symptoms can include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Anxiety, irritability, or trouble sleeping</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Weakness (especially in the arms and thighs, which can make it hard to lift heavy things or climb stairs)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Trembling</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Sweating a lot and having trouble dealing with hot weather</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Fast or uneven heartbeats</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Feeling tired</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Weight loss even when you are eating normally</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Frequent bowel movements </p><p/><p>Hyperthyroidism can also cause a swelling in the neck called a &quot;goiter.&quot; If it is caused by a medical problem called Graves' disease, the condition can also make the eyes bulge (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F58509\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef58509 \">figure 2</a>).</p><p>Untreated hyperthyroidism can cause a heart rhythm disorder called &quot;atrial fibrillation,&quot; chest pain, and rarely, heart failure.</p><p>In women, hyperthyroidism can disrupt monthly periods. It can also make it hard to get pregnant. In men, hyperthyroidism can cause the breasts to grow or lead to sexual problems. These problems go away when hyperthyroidism is treated.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H471368533\"><span class=\"h1\">Is there a test for hyperthyroidism?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Yes. Your doctor or nurse can test you for hyperthyroidism using a simple blood test. If the blood test indicates a problem, the doctor or nurse might run other tests, too.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H471368540\"><span class=\"h1\">How is hyperthyroidism treated?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Hyperthyroidism can be treated with:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Medicines</strong> &ndash; Two types of medicines can be used to treat hyperthyroidism:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Anti-thyroid medicines reduce the amount of hormone your thyroid gland makes.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Beta-blocker medicines help reduce the symptoms of hyperthyroidism. Beta-blockers can make you more comfortable until the thyroid imbalance is under control.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Radioactive iodine</strong> &ndash; Radioactive iodine comes in a pill or liquid you swallow. It destroys much of the thyroid gland. Pregnant women should not use this treatment, because it can damage the baby's thyroid gland. But the treatment is safe for women who are not pregnant and for men. The amount of radiation used is small. It does not increase the chance of getting cancer, and it does not cause problems getting pregnant in the future or increase the risk of birth defects in future pregnancies.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Surgery</strong> &ndash; Doctors can do surgery to remove part or all of the thyroid gland. Doctors do not often recommend surgery, because the other treatment choices are safer and less costly. But surgery is the best choice in some cases.</p><p/><p>Most people who are treated with radioactive iodine or who have surgery end up making too little thyroid hormone after treatment. They must take thyroid hormone pills after treatment &ndash; for the rest of their life.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H471368547\"><span class=\"h1\">What if I want to get pregnant?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>If you take anti-thyroid medicine, talk to your doctor or nurse before you start trying to get pregnant. You will probably need to take different medicines at different times in your pregnancy. Plus, your doses might need to be adjusted.</p><p>If you were treated with radioactive iodine, wait at least 6 months before you start trying to get pregnant. This will give your doctor enough time to find out if your thyroid is making enough thyroid hormone after the radioactive iodine treatment. If the radioactive iodine caused the thyroid to make too little thyroid hormone, you will need to take thyroid hormone pills. It is important to have a normal amount of thyroid hormone in your body before getting pregnant.</p><p>Whatever treatment you use, you should have your thyroid hormone levels checked often during pregnancy. Thyroid hormone levels must be at the right level during pregnancy to avoid risks to both the mother and the baby.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H471368554\"><span class=\"h1\">More on this topic</span></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=hypothyroidism-underactive-thyroid-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Hypothyroidism (underactive thyroid) (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=hyperthyroidism-overactive-thyroid-and-pregnancy-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Hyperthyroidism (overactive thyroid) and pregnancy (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=thyroiditis-after-pregnancy-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Thyroiditis after pregnancy (The Basics)</a></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=hyperthyroidism-overactive-thyroid-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Hyperthyroidism (overactive thyroid) (Beyond the Basics)</a></p></div><div id=\"reviewProcess\"><span>All topics are updated as new evidence becomes available and our <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/home/editorial-policy\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"policy policy_editorialpolicy\">peer review process</a> is complete.</span></div><div id=\"topicRetrievedDate\"><span class=\"emphasis\">This topic retrieved from UpToDate on: </span>Apr 02, 2018.</div><div id=\"disclaimer\">The content on the UpToDate website is not intended nor recommended as a substitute for medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.
