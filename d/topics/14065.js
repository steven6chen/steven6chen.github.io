Between 1988 and 2003, mortality from acute pancreatitis decreased from 12 percent to 2 percent, according to a large epidemiologic study from the United States [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/predicting-the-severity-of-acute-pancreatitis/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. However, mortality rates remain much higher in subgroups of patients with severe disease. The ability to predict its severity can help identify patients at increased risk for morbidity and mortality, thereby assisting in appropriate early triage to intensive care units and selection of patients for specific interventions.</p><p>This topic review will summarize methods for predicting the severity of AP. The clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and treatment of AP are discussed separately.

Some of these can be performed on admission to assist in triage of patients, while others can only be obtained after the first 48 to 72 hours or later.</p><p>However, these predictive models have low specificity (ie, high false positive rates), which, when coupled with the low prevalence of severe AP (15 to 25 percent), results in low positive predictive values [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/predicting-the-severity-of-acute-pancreatitis/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Future predictive models will need to incorporate additional factors (eg, biomarkers, genetic polymorphisms and mutations, and proteomic and metabolomic patterns) and methods of analyses [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/predicting-the-severity-of-acute-pancreatitis/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">CLASSIFICATION OF ACUTE PANCREATITIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The revised Atlanta classification system divides acute pancreatitis into two broad categories (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F87683\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef87683 \">table 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/predicting-the-severity-of-acute-pancreatitis/abstract/5,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,6</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Interstitial edematous acute pancreatitis, which is characterized by acute inflammation of the pancreatic parenchyma and peripancreatic tissues, but without recognizable tissue necrosis</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Necrotizing acute pancreatitis, which is characterized by inflammation associated with pancreatic parenchymal necrosis <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> peripancreatic necrosis</p><p/><p>According to the severity, acute pancreatitis is divided into the following:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Mild acute pancreatitis which is characterized by the absence of organ failure and local or systemic complications</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Moderately severe acute pancreatitis which is characterized by transient organ failure (resolves within 48 hours) <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> local or systemic complications without persistent organ failure (&gt;48 hours)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Severe acute pancreatitis which is characterized by persistent organ failure that may involve one or multiple organs</p><p/><p>Local complications of acute pancreatitis include acute peripancreatic fluid collection, pancreatic pseudocyst, acute necrotic collection, and walled-off necrosis (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F87683\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef87683 \">table 1</a>). </p><p>Organ failure is defined as a score of two or more for any one of three organ systems (respiratory, cardiovascular, or renal) using the modified Marshall scoring system (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F87718\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef87718 \">table 2</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/predicting-the-severity-of-acute-pancreatitis/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL PREDICTORS</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Clinical judgment</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Clinical judgment based upon clinical and laboratory data at admission might underestimate the severity of AP.

In one report, organ failure within 72 hours of admission was associated with the presence of extended pancreatic necrosis and a mortality rate of 42 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/predicting-the-severity-of-acute-pancreatitis/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. Several subsequent studies found that the evolution and clinical course of organ failure was a more accurate predictor of adverse outcomes. In one study, persistent and deteriorating (&ge;48 hours) organ failure were associated with mortality rates of 21 and 55 percent, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/predicting-the-severity-of-acute-pancreatitis/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. On the other hand, early organ dysfunction that was not persistent (&lt;48 hours) was associated with a mortality rate of 0 percent. In a second study, transient organ failure was associated with a mortality rate of 1.4 percent, whereas persistent organ failure had a 35 percent mortality rate [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/predicting-the-severity-of-acute-pancreatitis/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. Persistent organ failure is widely accepted as a reliable criterion for severe AP.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h1\">LABORATORY AND RADIOLOGIC PREDICTORS</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h2\">Hemoconcentration</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Acute pancreatitis results in significant third space losses, resulting in hemoconcentration and a high hematocrit. Studies evaluating the hematocrit as a predictor of the severity of AP have produced variable results [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/predicting-the-severity-of-acute-pancreatitis/abstract/18-22\" class=\"abstract_t\">18-22</a>]. The discrepancies may be due to differences in values chosen as a cutoff and the time that they were obtained. Despite these differences, it appears that a normal or low hematocrit at admission and during the first 24 hours is generally associated with a milder clinical course.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h2\">C-reactive protein</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>C-reactive protein (CRP) is one of the acute phase reactants made by the liver in response to interleukin-1 and interleukin-6. Levels of CRP above 150 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/L</span> at 48 hours discriminate severe from mild disease. At 48 hours, CRP above 150 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/L</span> has a sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value of 80, 76, 67, and 86 percent, respectively, for severe acute pancreatitis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/predicting-the-severity-of-acute-pancreatitis/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].</p><p>CRP rises steadily in relation to the severity of pancreatitis, is inexpensive to measure, and testing is readily available [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/predicting-the-severity-of-acute-pancreatitis/abstract/23-25\" class=\"abstract_t\">23-25</a>]. As a result, we suggest it be used to help predict the severity of pancreatitis, especially at 48 hours.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13833085\"><span class=\"h2\">Blood urea nitrogen</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In a large hospital-based cohort, serial blood urea nitrogen (BUN) measurements were the most reliable routine laboratory test to predict the mortality in AP [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/predicting-the-severity-of-acute-pancreatitis/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. For every increase in the BUN of 5 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> during the first 24 hours, the adjusted odds ratio (OR) for mortality was 2.2.</p><p>A subsequent study by the same group that included 1043 patients found that a BUN level of 20 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> or higher at admission was associated with an increased risk of death compared with a BUN level of less than 20 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> (OR 4.6) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/predicting-the-severity-of-acute-pancreatitis/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. In addition, any increase in BUN at 24 hours was also associated with an increased risk of death (OR 4.3).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13833093\"><span class=\"h2\">Serum creatinine</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>An elevated serum creatinine within the first 48 hours may predict the development of pancreatic necrosis. In one study of 129 patients, a peak creatinine of greater than 1.8 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> during the first 48 hours had a positive predictive value of 93 percent for the development of pancreatic necrosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/predicting-the-severity-of-acute-pancreatitis/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. However, a study from Germany did not find this association, though it did show that a normal creatinine had a high negative predictive value for the development of pancreatic necrosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/predicting-the-severity-of-acute-pancreatitis/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. The authors suggested that a normal creatinine in the absence of complications obviated the need for an abdominal computed tomographic (CT) scan. The discrepancy between the two studies may have been due to a lower prevalence of pancreatic necrosis in the German study, which could have resulted in a lower positive predictive value.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14\"><span class=\"h2\">Other serum markers</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Multiple other serum markers have been studied for predicting the severity of pancreatitis including: urinary trypsinogen activation peptide (TAP); procalcitonin; polymorphonuclear elastase; pancreatic-associated protein; amylase; lipase; serum glucose; serum calcium; procarboxypeptidase-B; carboxypeptidase-B activation peptide; serum trypsinogen-2; phospholipase A-2; serum amyloid protein-A; substance P; antithrombin III; platelet activating factor; interleukins 1, 6, and 8; tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha or soluble TNF receptor; angiopoietin-2, and various genetic polymorphisms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/predicting-the-severity-of-acute-pancreatitis/abstract/22,29-32\" class=\"abstract_t\">22,29-32</a>]. </p><p>Tests for most of these markers are not widely available, and their test characteristics are incompletely understood. Exceptions are a dipstick test for procalcitonin, an enzyme-linked immunoassay test for urine TAP, and a test for urine anionic trypsinogen, which are likely to become commercially available.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Procalcitonin is the most rapid general acute-phase reactant. In a validation study, the procalcitonin strip test had an accuracy of 86 percent for predicting severe AP [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/predicting-the-severity-of-acute-pancreatitis/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>TAP is cleaved from the amino-terminal end of trypsinogen when trypsin is activated. TAP is the most studied activation peptide in AP. A European multicenter study found a sensitivity of 58 percent and specificity of 73 percent with urinary TAP within 24 hours of symptom onset [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/predicting-the-severity-of-acute-pancreatitis/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4314399\"><span class=\"h2\">Chest radiographs</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A pleural effusion <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> pulmonary infiltrates during the first 24 hours may be associated with necrosis and organ failure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/predicting-the-severity-of-acute-pancreatitis/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3192492\"><span class=\"h2\">CT scan</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>CT scan is probably the most frequently used radiologic investigation when severe AP is suspected. It is used to look for pancreatic necrosis and extrapancreatic inflammation. Intravenous contrast-enhanced CT distinguishes between edematous and necrotizing pancreatitis, since areas of necrosis and exudates do not enhance. CT is more accurate than ultrasonography for the diagnosis of severe pancreatic necrosis (90 versus 73 percent in one report) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/predicting-the-severity-of-acute-pancreatitis/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>].</p><p>After assessment of the patient, a contrast-enhanced CT scan is indicated in patients who are deteriorating or have severe pancreatitis determined clinically and by the Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Examination (APACHE) II score (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=calculator-apache-ii-scoring-system-in-adults\" class=\"calc calc_professional\">calculator 1</a>). A CT scan is not required on the first day unless there are other diagnoses are being considered. A retrospective analysis of the performance of several CT scoring systems for the severity of AP found that none was statistically superior to the APACHE II or bedside index of severity in acute pancreatitis scoring systems [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/predicting-the-severity-of-acute-pancreatitis/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>]. In addition, it takes time for pancreatic necrosis to develop, and treatment is unlikely to be altered on the basis of CT findings on day one. Although there are some experimental data that suggest ionic contrast may worsen pancreatitis, the association is probably not strong and the information obtained from the CT scan justifies the potential risk.</p><p>Perfusion CT can differentiate reversible from irreversible ischemic tissue in the brain and uses less contrast than the conventional contrast-enhanced CT. One report described the utility of perfusion CT in predicting pancreatic necrosis in early stages of AP [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/predicting-the-severity-of-acute-pancreatitis/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>]. Ten of 30 patients with AP had pancreatic ischemia on perfusion CT and nine patients were proven to have pancreatic necrosis subsequently on contrast-enhanced CT. A subtraction color map using subtraction CT with unenhanced and enhanced images also is accurate in the diagnosis of pancreatic necrosis in the early stage of AP [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/predicting-the-severity-of-acute-pancreatitis/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>]. Subtraction CT is easier to perform than perfusion CT and results in less radiation, although perfusion CT requires a smaller amount of iodinated contrast. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3192392\"><span class=\"h2\">MRI and MRCP</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography (MRCP) are being used increasingly to diagnose AP and to assess its severity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/predicting-the-severity-of-acute-pancreatitis/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>]. MRI appears to be comparable to CT, if not better, in providing precise information regarding the severity of the disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/predicting-the-severity-of-acute-pancreatitis/abstract/40-42\" class=\"abstract_t\">40-42</a>]. MRI is as effective as CT in demonstrating the presence and extent of pancreatic necrosis and fluid collections, and is probably superior for indicating the suitability of such collections for nonsurgical drainage [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/predicting-the-severity-of-acute-pancreatitis/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>].</p><p>MRI can characterize the &quot;pancreatic necrosis&quot; seen on CT as necrotic pancreatic parenchyma, peripancreatic necrotic fluid collections, or hemorrhagic foci [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/predicting-the-severity-of-acute-pancreatitis/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>]. One study found that MRI was reliable for staging the severity of AP and predicting prognosis with fewer contraindications than CT [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/predicting-the-severity-of-acute-pancreatitis/abstract/43\" class=\"abstract_t\">43</a>]. It can also detect pancreatic duct disruption, which can occur early in the course of AP.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H16\"><span class=\"h1\">SCORING SYSTEMS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Many scoring systems have been reported but none has proven to be perfect [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/predicting-the-severity-of-acute-pancreatitis/abstract/44,45\" class=\"abstract_t\">44,45</a>]. While they can be useful to group patients for the purpose of interinstitutional comparisons and reporting, none has high accuracy in predicting the severity of AP in a given patient at the bedside. On the other hand, they are superior to clinical judgment for triaging patients to more intensive care and aggressive therapy. (See <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Clinical judgment'</a> above.)</p><p>Many scoring systems (eg, Ranson, Glasgow) take 48 hours to complete, can be used only once, and do not have a high degree of sensitivity and specificity (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F56775\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef56775 \">table 3</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/predicting-the-severity-of-acute-pancreatitis/abstract/46-48\" class=\"abstract_t\">46-48</a>]. In addition, some have limited utility since they focus on specific complications or are invasive (eg, Leeds diagnostic peritoneal lavage) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/predicting-the-severity-of-acute-pancreatitis/abstract/46\" class=\"abstract_t\">46</a>]. As a result, many of these systems are not used routinely.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H17\"><span class=\"h2\">Ranson's criteria</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A score based upon Ranson's criteria is one of the earliest scoring systems for severity in AP [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/predicting-the-severity-of-acute-pancreatitis/abstract/47\" class=\"abstract_t\">47</a>]. Ranson's criteria consist of 11 parameters. Five of the factors are assessed at admission and six are assessed during the next 48 hours (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F56775\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef56775 \">table 3</a>) (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=calculator-ranson-criteria-for-pancreatitis-prognosis\" class=\"calc calc_professional\">calculator 2</a>). A later modification for biliary pancreatitis included only 10 points [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/predicting-the-severity-of-acute-pancreatitis/abstract/49\" class=\"abstract_t\">49</a>]. Mortality increases with an increasing score. Using the 11 component score, mortality was 0 to 3 percent when the score was &lt;3, 11 to 15 percent when the score was &ge;3, and 40 percent when the score was &ge;6 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/predicting-the-severity-of-acute-pancreatitis/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. Although the system continues to be used, a meta-analysis of 110 studies found the Ranson score to be a poor predictor of severity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/predicting-the-severity-of-acute-pancreatitis/abstract/50\" class=\"abstract_t\">50</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H18\"><span class=\"h2\">The APACHE II score</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Examination (APACHE) II score was originally developed for critically ill patients in intensive care units (ICUs). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=predictive-scoring-systems-in-the-intensive-care-unit\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Predictive scoring systems in the intensive care unit&quot;</a>.)</p><p>It has 12 physiologic measures and extra points based upon age and presence of chronic disease (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=calculator-apache-ii-scoring-system-in-adults\" class=\"calc calc_professional\">calculator 1</a>). It is probably the most widely studied severity scoring system in AP. It has good negative predictive value and modest positive predictive value for predicting severe AP and can be performed daily. Decreasing values during the first 48 hours suggest a mild attack, while increasing values suggest a severe attack. Studies suggest that mortality is less than 4 percent with a score &lt;8 and is 11 to 18 percent with a score &gt;8 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/predicting-the-severity-of-acute-pancreatitis/abstract/8,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,9</a>].</p><p>Some limitations of the APACHE II score are that is complex and cumbersome to use, it does not differentiate between interstitial and necrotizing pancreatitis, and it does not differentiate between sterile and infected necrosis. Finally, it has a poor predictive value at 24 hours [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/predicting-the-severity-of-acute-pancreatitis/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].</p><p>The addition of a body mass index (BMI) score to APACHE II (known as APACHE O) improved the prediction of severe pancreatitis compared with the conventional APACHE II score in one study [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/predicting-the-severity-of-acute-pancreatitis/abstract/51\" class=\"abstract_t\">51</a>]. One point was added for a BMI of &gt;25 to 30 and two points were added for a BMI &gt;30. However, the improved performance of APACHE O was not validated in a second study [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/predicting-the-severity-of-acute-pancreatitis/abstract/52\" class=\"abstract_t\">52</a>]. A simplified Acute Physiology Score II developed in ICU patients may be comparable to APACHE II [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/predicting-the-severity-of-acute-pancreatitis/abstract/53\" class=\"abstract_t\">53</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=predictive-scoring-systems-in-the-intensive-care-unit\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Predictive scoring systems in the intensive care unit&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Several additional variables were added to APACHE II to improve its accuracy leading to the development of APACHE III. Both APACHE II and III scores use physiology, age, and chronic health to calculate prognosis; they differ in total score, the number of physiologic variables (12 for APACHE II versus 17 for APACHE III), and the assessment of chronic health status. However, the APACHE III system does not appear to be as useful as APACHE II for distinguishing mild from severe attack [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/predicting-the-severity-of-acute-pancreatitis/abstract/54\" class=\"abstract_t\">54</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H19\"><span class=\"h2\">Systemic inflammatory response syndrome score</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>As noted above, the presence of the systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) is associated with increased mortality. A score based upon the systemic inflammatory response syndrome has been developed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/predicting-the-severity-of-acute-pancreatitis/abstract/55\" class=\"abstract_t\">55</a>]. Initial studies suggest it can reliably predict the severity of pancreatitis and has the added advantage that it can be applied easily at the bedside every day (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F69207\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef69207 \">table 4</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/predicting-the-severity-of-acute-pancreatitis/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. In one validation study, mortality rates were 25, 8, and 0 percent in those with persistent SIRS from admission, SIRS at admission but not persistent, and no SIRS, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/predicting-the-severity-of-acute-pancreatitis/abstract/56\" class=\"abstract_t\">56</a>]. Another study found that the severity of AP was greater among patients with AP and SIRS on day one, particularly in those with three or four SIRS criteria, compared with those without SIRS on day one [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/predicting-the-severity-of-acute-pancreatitis/abstract/57\" class=\"abstract_t\">57</a>]. Thus, it appears that the SIRS score is inexpensive, readily available, and compares favorably with other more complicated scores.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H20\"><span class=\"h2\">BISAP score</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Development of the bedside index of severity in acute pancreatitis (BISAP) score was based upon 17,922 cases of AP from 2000 to 2001 and validated in 18,256 cases from 2004 to 2005 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/predicting-the-severity-of-acute-pancreatitis/abstract/58\" class=\"abstract_t\">58</a>]. Patients are assigned 1 point for each of the following during the first 24 hours: BUN &gt;25 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL,</span> impaired mental status, SIRS (using the same criteria as the SIRS score, (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F69207\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef69207 \">table 4</a>)), age &gt;60 years, or the presence of a pleural effusion (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=calculator-bedside-index-of-severity-in-acute-pancreatitis-bisap-score-in-adults\" class=\"calc calc_professional\">calculator 3</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/predicting-the-severity-of-acute-pancreatitis/abstract/58\" class=\"abstract_t\">58</a>]. Patients with a score of zero had a mortality of less than one percent, whereas patients with a score of five had a mortality rate of 22 percent. In the validation cohort, the BISAP score had similar test performance characteristics for predicting mortality as the APACHE II score. As is a problem with many of the other scoring systems, the BISAP has not been validated for predicting outcomes such as length of hospital stay, need for ICU care, or need for intervention.</p><p>A validation study of the BISAP score that included 185 patients found that its performance was similar to APACHE II, Ranson's criteria, and the CT severity index system [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/predicting-the-severity-of-acute-pancreatitis/abstract/59\" class=\"abstract_t\">59</a>]. While the BISAP score is meant to be easily calculated at the bedside, it has been noted that to do so is not as simple as was initially reported because four variables need to be considered to determine if SIRS is present [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/predicting-the-severity-of-acute-pancreatitis/abstract/60\" class=\"abstract_t\">60</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13833427\"><span class=\"h2\">Harmless acute pancreatitis score</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The harmless acute pancreatitis score can typically be calculated within 30 minutes of admission and takes into account three parameters: lack of rebound tenderness or guarding, normal hematocrit, and normal serum creatinine. It was derived on a cohort of 394 patients and validated in a cohort of 452 patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/predicting-the-severity-of-acute-pancreatitis/abstract/61\" class=\"abstract_t\">61</a>]. This score correctly identified 200 of 204 patients (98 percent) with a harmless course. Presumably patients were considered likely to have a harmless course if none of the three parameters were present, though this was not clearly defined in the report.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H21\"><span class=\"h2\">Organ failure-based scores</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>As noted above, organ failure is a marker of the severity of pancreatitis. While there are several scoring systems for organ failure, they do not directly measure the severity of AP, but rather measure the severity of the organ failure itself. (See <a href=\"#H10\" class=\"local\">'Organ failure'</a> above.)</p><p>This distinction is potentially important as reflected in the limitations of Atlanta classification system described above [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/predicting-the-severity-of-acute-pancreatitis/abstract/62,63\" class=\"abstract_t\">62,63</a>]. Organ failure was listed as being present or absent, without specifying the number of organs failing or the severity of each organ failure, issues that are potentially clinically relevant. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Classification of acute pancreatitis'</a> above.)</p><p>Organ failure scoring systems such as the Goris multiple organ failure score [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/predicting-the-severity-of-acute-pancreatitis/abstract/64\" class=\"abstract_t\">64</a>], the Marshall (or multiple) organ dysfunction score [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/predicting-the-severity-of-acute-pancreatitis/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>], the Bernard score [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/predicting-the-severity-of-acute-pancreatitis/abstract/65\" class=\"abstract_t\">65</a>], the sequential organ failure assessment (SOFA) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/predicting-the-severity-of-acute-pancreatitis/abstract/66\" class=\"abstract_t\">66</a>], and the logistic organ dysfunction system score [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/predicting-the-severity-of-acute-pancreatitis/abstract/67\" class=\"abstract_t\">67</a>] have been described. All these scores take into account the number of organ systems involved and the degree of dysfunction of each individual organ. Some also include the use of inotropic or vasopressor agents, mechanical ventilation, or dialysis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/predicting-the-severity-of-acute-pancreatitis/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. As noted above, the presence of persistent organ failure lasting for more than 48 hours appears to be important [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/predicting-the-severity-of-acute-pancreatitis/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H10\" class=\"local\">'Organ failure'</a> above.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H22\"><span class=\"h2\">CT severity index</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A CT severity score (the Balthazar score) has been developed based upon the degree of necrosis, inflammation, and the presence of fluid collections (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F68191\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef68191 \">table 5</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/predicting-the-severity-of-acute-pancreatitis/abstract/68\" class=\"abstract_t\">68</a>]. In an initial validation study, mortality was 23 percent with any degree of pancreatic necrosis and 0 percent with no necrosis. In addition, there was a strong association between necrosis &gt;30 percent and morbidity and mortality [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/predicting-the-severity-of-acute-pancreatitis/abstract/68\" class=\"abstract_t\">68</a>].</p><p>The finding of necrotizing pancreatitis (or even infected necrosis) does not necessarily predict the occurrence of organ failure, but may alter the therapeutic approach [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/predicting-the-severity-of-acute-pancreatitis/abstract/69\" class=\"abstract_t\">69</a>]. In a retrospective study of 268 patients with AP assessed by the CT severity index, patients with a CT severity index &gt;5 were 8 times more likely to die, 17 times more likely to have a prolonged hospital course, and 10 times more likely to undergo necrosectomy than the patients with scores &lt;5 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/predicting-the-severity-of-acute-pancreatitis/abstract/70\" class=\"abstract_t\">70</a>]. While necrosis on CT predicts a severe attack, there was no uniform correlation with the extent of necrosis and organ failure <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> mortality. Such a correlation may become more apparent with newer scoring systems that measure the number of failing organ systems and the severity of each failing organ system.

We favor the SIRS score because it is simple, cheap, readily available, and as accurate as any other complex scoring system, especially persistent SIRS. (See <a href=\"#H16\" class=\"local\">'Scoring systems'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We suggest a contrast-enhanced CT be performed in patients considered to have severe AP based upon clinical criteria or possibly the APACHE II score (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=calculator-apache-ii-scoring-system-in-adults\" class=\"calc calc_professional\">calculator 1</a>) to determine if necrotizing pancreatitis is present.<br/><br/>A CT scan is not required on the first day unless other diagnoses are being considered. It takes time for pancreatic necrosis to develop and thus CT may be normal in the first 48 to 72 hours. Although there are some experimental data that ionic contrast may worsen pancreatitis, the association is probably not strong and the information obtained from the CT scan justifies the potential risk. (See <a href=\"#H3192492\" class=\"local\">'CT scan'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Magnetic resonance imaging is emerging as a useful imaging tool in pancreatitis, especially to identify stones in the bile duct, visualize pancreatic duct, and to distinguish the contents of fluid collections seen on CT. However, experience remains inadequate in the setting of acute pancreatitis primarily because of its high cost and need for prolonged examination time. (See <a href=\"#H3192392\" class=\"local\">'MRI and MRCP'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Laboratory tests have an adjunctive role in predicting the severity of acute pancreatitis. We agree with the guidelines issued by the American College of Gastroenterology and International Association of <span class=\"nowrap\">Pancreatology/American</span> Pancreatic Association, which suggest that advanced age, comorbidities, body mass index &gt;30, pleural effusion or pulmonary infiltrates, hematocrit &gt;44, blood urea nitrogen (BUN) &gt;20, rising BUN, high creatinine, initial SIRS score &ge;2, persistent SIRS, and persistent organ failure as predictors of severe disease.
