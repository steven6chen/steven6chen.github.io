A pooled analysis of data from 17 studies (nearly all retrospective; total n = 1039 adolescent patients with anorexia nervosa) found that the average incidence of refeeding hypophosphatemia was 14 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anorexia-nervosa-in-adults-and-adolescents-the-refeeding-syndrome/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. The risk of hypophosphatemia during refeeding appears to be greater in patients who are more severely malnourished [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anorexia-nervosa-in-adults-and-adolescents-the-refeeding-syndrome/abstract/12-14\" class=\"abstract_t\">12-14</a>]. In addition, a retrospective study (n = 123 patients with severe anorexia nervosa) found that one predictor of refeeding hypophosphatemia was higher hemoglobin levels, which are probably a marker for hemoconcentration due to dehydration and intravascular volume depletion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anorexia-nervosa-in-adults-and-adolescents-the-refeeding-syndrome/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>].

Retrospective studies of patients who are hospitalized for anorexia nervosa suggest that the phosphorous nadir generally occurs during the first week of admission [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anorexia-nervosa-in-adults-and-adolescents-the-refeeding-syndrome/abstract/2,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,14</a>].</p><p>The pathogenesis of hypophosphatemia begins when stores of phosphate are depleted during episodes of anorexia nervosa and starvation. When nutritional replenishment starts and patients are fed carbohydrates, glucose causes release of insulin, which triggers cellular uptake of phosphate (and potassium and magnesium). Insulin also causes cells to produce a variety of depleted molecules that require phosphate (eg, adenosine triphosphate and 2,3-diphosphoglycerate), which further depletes the body&rsquo;s stores of phosphate [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anorexia-nervosa-in-adults-and-adolescents-the-refeeding-syndrome/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>].

These deficiencies are exacerbated by the onset of anabolic processes that accompany refeeding the patient. &#160; </p><p>Volume overload begins with an increase in insulin secretion during the early stage of refeeding the patient [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anorexia-nervosa-in-adults-and-adolescents-the-refeeding-syndrome/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].

Other risk factors for the refeeding syndrome include low baseline levels of phosphate, potassium, or magnesium prior to refeeding the patient; and little or no nutritional intake for the previous 5 to 10 days. Criteria for hospitalization of patients with anorexia nervosa are discussed separately.

Atrophy of the heart during starvation renders the patient more vulnerable to fluid overload and heart failure. Sodium and fluid retention can also increase circulatory volume and lead to volume overload in patients with cardiac atrophy, and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=vitamin-b1-thiamine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">thiamine</a> (vitamin B1) deficiency may also contribute to heart failure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anorexia-nervosa-in-adults-and-adolescents-the-refeeding-syndrome/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].

A &ldquo;normal&rdquo; heart rate may in fact be a harbinger of cardiac compromise in these patients.

(See <a href=\"#H365505732\" class=\"local\">'Refeeding syndrome'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The refeeding syndrome is marked by hypophosphatemia and volume overload. (See <a href=\"#H86792383\" class=\"local\">'Pathogenesis and clinical features'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Multiple organ systems can be affected as part of the refeeding syndrome. Most fatalities that occur because of the syndrome are due to cardiac complications (induced by hypophosphatemia), including impaired contractility, decreased stroke volume, heart failure, and arrhythmias. Seizures can also occur. (See <a href=\"#H86794251\" class=\"local\">'Medical complications'</a> above and <a href=\"#H86794340\" class=\"local\">'Cardiovascular'</a> above and <a href=\"#H86794383\" class=\"local\">'Neurologic'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The refeeding syndrome can nearly always be avoided by judiciously limiting the amount of calories and fluid provided in the early stages of refeeding, avoiding very rapid increases in the amount of daily calories ingested, and closely monitoring the patient during the first few weeks of the refeeding process. If the refeeding syndrome occurs, clinicians should immediately slow nutritional replenishment and aggressively correct hypophosphatemia and other electrolyte abnormalities, while evaluating the cardiovascular system. Moderately to severely ill patients with marked edema or a serum phosphorous &lt; 2 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> should be hospitalized to intravenously correct electrolyte deficiencies. (See <a href=\"#H86792390\" class=\"local\">'Prevention and management'</a> above.)</p></div><div id=\"topicAgreement\">Use of UpToDate is subject to the <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/legal/license\" class=\"licenseLink\" id=\"sla_in_page\">Subscription and License Agreement</a>.</div><div id=\"references\" class=\"headingAnchor\"><h1>REFERENCES</h1><ol id=\"reference\"><li class=\"breakAll\">Eating Disorders: Core Interventions in the Treatment of and Management of Anorexia Nervosa, Bulimia Nervosa and Related Eating Disorders.
