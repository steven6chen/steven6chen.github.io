The association of breast implants with a cancer of the immune system has created understandable concern among patients, plastic surgeons, and oncologists. </p><p>Initial studies suggest that BIA-ALCL follows a relatively indolent course in most patients and those with early stage disease have an excellent prognosis. However, reports of disseminated cancer and deaths attributed to the disease emphasize the importance of appropriate surveillance, timely diagnosis, and adequate treatment. </p><p>BIA-ALCL is rarely seen at most medical centers, and thus a diagnosis of BIA-ALCL can become delayed, often not being suspected and only diagnosed at the time of implant revision surgery performed for a persistent seroma. Thus, clinicians must maintain a high index of suspicion. BIA-ALCL usually presents as localized disease with either a seroma or, less commonly, a discrete breast mass adjacent to the implant. Most cases present approximately one decade after implant placement, although earlier or later presentations can be seen. </p><p>The clinical features, diagnosis, treatment, and prognosis of BIA-ALCL are reviewed here. The diagnosis and management of systemic ALCL (anaplastic lymphoma kinase [ALK]-positive and ALK-negative) and primary cutaneous ALCL are presented separately.

The peripheral T cell lymphomas are a heterogeneous group that are derived from cells that normally develop into T lymphocytes (cytotoxic T lymphocytes, helper T lymphocytes, or regulatory T lymphocytes). Peripheral T cell lymphomas constitute &lt;15 percent of all lymphomas in adults. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=classification-of-the-hematopoietic-neoplasms#H8\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Classification of the hematopoietic neoplasms&quot;, section on 'Lymphoid neoplasms'</a>.)</p><p>Anaplastic large cell lymphoma (ALCL), <span class=\"nowrap\">T/null</span> cell type is the second or third most common peripheral T cell lymphoma histology depending on the series analyzed and accounts for &lt;2 percent of lymphomas in adults. The 2016 revisions of the World Health Organization (WHO) classification of lymphoid neoplasms recognizes four distinct forms of ALCL based on clinical features and molecular characterization (including anaplastic lymphoma kinase [ALK] expression) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/breast-implant-associated-anaplastic-large-cell-lymphoma/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Primary systemic ALCL, ALK positive (ALK-positive ALCL)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Primary systemic ALCL, ALK negative (ALK-negative ALCL)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Primary cutaneous ALCL (PC-ALCL)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Breast implant-associated ALCL (BIA-ALCL, provisional) </p><p/><p>Neither PC-ALCL nor BIA-ALCL expresses ALK. In contrast, primary systemic ALCLs are subclassified according to ALK expression (ie, ALK-positive ALCL versus ALK-negative ALCL). ALK expression is most commonly a result of the t(2;5) translocation involving the 2p23 and the 5q35 chromosomes that create an oncogenic fusion protein of the <em>ALK</em> gene and the nucleophosmin gene [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/breast-implant-associated-anaplastic-large-cell-lymphoma/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].<sup> </sup>(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-pathologic-features-and-diagnosis-of-systemic-anaplastic-large-cell-lymphoma#H16\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations, pathologic features, and diagnosis of systemic anaplastic large cell lymphoma&quot;, section on 'Molecular genetics'</a>.)</p><p>While ALCL has been historically considered a clinically aggressive lymphoma, the clinical course varies considerably among subtypes. Without treatment, systemic ALCL often pursues an aggressive clinical course with widespread involvement and rapid progression. Among those with systemic ALCL, ALK expression is associated with better outcomes. By contrast, PC-ALCL is usually more clinically indolent with excellent survival rates at five years (&gt;90 to 95 percent) and is classified as a lymphoproliferative disorder by WHO [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/breast-implant-associated-anaplastic-large-cell-lymphoma/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. BIA-ALCL appears to behave clinically more like the less aggressive PC-ALCL rather than the more aggressive systemic forms, but it is still classified by WHO as a lymphoma along with ALK-positive and ALK-negative systemic ALCL and further research is needed to better understand its nature [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/breast-implant-associated-anaplastic-large-cell-lymphoma/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].

Available evidence suggests that BIA-ALCL develops in the setting of implant-induced chronic inflammation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/breast-implant-associated-anaplastic-large-cell-lymphoma/abstract/6,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,7</a>]. Whether there is any link between the reports of chronic immune stimulation in some of these patients is unclear [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/breast-implant-associated-anaplastic-large-cell-lymphoma/abstract/5,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,8</a>]. One proposed mechanism implicates chronic T cell stimulation with local antigenic drive in the development of lymphoma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/breast-implant-associated-anaplastic-large-cell-lymphoma/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. The immune system&rsquo;s response to chronic inflammation surrounding the breast implant may lead to genetic degeneration and dysplasia in a genetically susceptible patient [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/breast-implant-associated-anaplastic-large-cell-lymphoma/abstract/7,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,10</a>]. </p><p>No etiologic factors as the cause of chronic immune stimulation have been clearly identified. Many causes have been theorized, including a response to particulate from textured implants, the presence of a subclinical biofilm, a consequence of capsular contracture or repeated capsular trauma (such as with closed capsulotomies), or a genetic predisposition [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/breast-implant-associated-anaplastic-large-cell-lymphoma/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>], but these observations have not been confirmed in formal epidemiological studies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/breast-implant-associated-anaplastic-large-cell-lymphoma/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. Further research is required to identify modifiable risk factors, susceptible populations, and optimal screening and surveillance modalities. </p><p>Laboratory studies suggest that texturing may induce BIA-ALCL. In an Australian laboratory study, the capsules of textured and smooth implants in pigs were compared; textured implants showed increased numbers of lymphocytes with a predominance of T cells compared with smooth breast implants [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/breast-implant-associated-anaplastic-large-cell-lymphoma/abstract/13,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,14</a>]. All clinical case reports and case series have demonstrated a strong predominance of textured surface implants. Among the 359 adverse events of implants and ALCL reported to the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA), where surface characteristics were known, 92.3 percent of cases occurred with textured devices [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/breast-implant-associated-anaplastic-large-cell-lymphoma/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. Twenty-eight smooth-implant ALCL cases have been reported to the FDA, but these reports are lacking clinical verification that there had been no prior textured implant. Another study that reported a summary of 79 published patients and 94 previously unreported cases found that each patient had a history of having at least one textured device [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/breast-implant-associated-anaplastic-large-cell-lymphoma/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. Microbiology cultures were negative in all cases when taken, although a formal biofilm evaluation was not performed. In a later study that compared the implant capsules of patients with BIA-ALCL with those exhibiting normal capsular contracture, a high bacterial load and significantly different microbiome associated with capsular contracture were found in the BIA-ALCL specimens with a high predominance of the bacteria <em>Ralstonia pickettii</em>, a gram-negative rod and common contaminant in drinking water [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/breast-implant-associated-anaplastic-large-cell-lymphoma/abstract/17,18\" class=\"abstract_t\">17,18</a>].</p><p>Although these studies are intriguing, not all investigators have been convinced of an infectious etiology, or that texturing is a significant risk factor for the development of BIA-ALCL [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/breast-implant-associated-anaplastic-large-cell-lymphoma/abstract/19-21\" class=\"abstract_t\">19-21</a>]. Nevertheless, in July 2016, the French National Agency for Medicines and Health Product Safety (ANSM) released an update on BIA-ALCL based upon 29 French BIA-ALCL patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/breast-implant-associated-anaplastic-large-cell-lymphoma/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. Due to a predominance of textured cases, ANSM called for breast implant manufacturers to submit clear safety data for textured implants within one year, otherwise their devices would be restricted from sale in France. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H127601843\"><span class=\"h1\">EPIDEMIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>BIA-ALCL is a rare but increasingly well-described entity and the exact incidence is not known. Most cases present approximately one decade after implant placement, although earlier or later presentations can be seen. This corresponds to a median age of onset of approximately 50 years of age [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/breast-implant-associated-anaplastic-large-cell-lymphoma/abstract/23,24\" class=\"abstract_t\">23,24</a>].</p><p>Among women with breast implants, the absolute risk of developing ALCL is extremely low, although this entity occurs much more frequently in this population when compared with the general population (ie, high relative risk). This was illustrated in a population-based case-control study from the Netherlands (approximately 9 million women) which reported an 18-fold higher rate of ALCL arising in the breast among women with breast implants compared with women who did not have implants (odds ratio 18.2, 95% CI 2.1-156.8) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/breast-implant-associated-anaplastic-large-cell-lymphoma/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. Despite this high odds ratio, only 11 cases of BIA-ALCL were reported over a 17-year period, underscoring the rarity of the condition. While a number of prior studies failed to show an association between breast implants and lymphoma, these studies were limited by small sample sizes <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> short follow-up time [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/breast-implant-associated-anaplastic-large-cell-lymphoma/abstract/26-29\" class=\"abstract_t\">26-29</a>]. These studies illustrate the difficulty of determining the incidence and prevalence of a very rare and newly recognized clinical entity. </p><p>Reliable epidemiologic data for the incidence and prevalence of BIA-ALCL have been difficult to determine for the estimated &gt;11 million women with breast implants worldwide [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/breast-implant-associated-anaplastic-large-cell-lymphoma/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. As examples:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Between 1997 and 2016, approximately 134 cases were reported either in individual reports or within literature reviews on BIA-ALCL [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/breast-implant-associated-anaplastic-large-cell-lymphoma/abstract/5,6,20,23,30-63\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,6,20,23,30-63</a>]. The number of cases published annually has increased with the formal recognition of BIA-ALCL as an entity and wider physician education about BIA-ALCL (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F108779\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef108779 \">figure 1</a>). </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The Manufacturer and User Facility Device Experience (MAUDE) database received approximately 359 reported cases of ALCL in women with breast implants as of February 1, 2017 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/breast-implant-associated-anaplastic-large-cell-lymphoma/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>].<sup> </sup>In a review of the top 40 global breast implant markets worldwide, 363 adverse event reports of BIA-ALCL were reported to government authorities [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/breast-implant-associated-anaplastic-large-cell-lymphoma/abstract/64\" class=\"abstract_t\">64</a>]. This worldwide study was performed prior to the March 21, 2017 Food and Drug Administration (FDA) update. Therefore, taking the FDA report into account, there are approximately 464 adverse event reports of BIA-ALCL to government authorities worldwide. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In the Netherlands database study, the predicted incidence of ALCL was estimated to be one to three cases per million women with implants per year [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/breast-implant-associated-anaplastic-large-cell-lymphoma/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>One study estimated an incidence of BIA-ALCL of 203 per 100 million person-years by comparing pathologically confirmed cases in the United States (US) with US textured implant sales (presuming that BIA-ALCL occurs only in textured breast implants) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/breast-implant-associated-anaplastic-large-cell-lymphoma/abstract/65\" class=\"abstract_t\">65</a>]. This incidence is 67.6 times higher than that of primary ALCL of the breast in the general population (ie, 3 per 100 million per year. This rate corresponded to a lifetime prevalence of 1 per 30,000 patients with textured breast implants. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In the largest series reported for any type of textured implant, which included 17,656 women receiving 31,985 salt-loss textured implants, four cases of breast implant&ndash;associated ALCL cases occurred at a mean follow-up of 3.4 years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/breast-implant-associated-anaplastic-large-cell-lymphoma/abstract/66\" class=\"abstract_t\">66</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The Australian Therapeutic Goods Administration released an update on BIA-ALCL estimating a disease risk of 1 in 1000 to 1 in 10,000 women with textured implants based on data from 46 national cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/breast-implant-associated-anaplastic-large-cell-lymphoma/abstract/67\" class=\"abstract_t\">67</a>]. This discrepancy in risk between Australia and US data may be due to geographic predisposition or physician reporting and requires further study.</p><p/><p>The reason for implant placement (cosmetic versus reconstructive) does not seem to influence the risk of lymphoma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/breast-implant-associated-anaplastic-large-cell-lymphoma/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. The number of BIA-ALCL cases reported following primary breast augmentation compared with reconstruction for breast cancer or for prophylaxis are nearly equivalent; however, the number of women receiving augmentation implants outnumbers by double those women receiving reconstructive implants. Animal studies have suggested an increased risk with textured implants, but there does not appear to be a clear clinical association between the type of implant (silicone versus saline) and the subsequent risk of BIA-ALCL [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/breast-implant-associated-anaplastic-large-cell-lymphoma/abstract/62\" class=\"abstract_t\">62</a>]. </p><p>There is no consistent finding of ALCL associated with other implanted medical devices other than breast implants.

BIA-ALCL should be suspected in patients who develop seroma more than one year after placement of a breast implant that is not readily explainable by infection or trauma. Suspicious fluid collections should be aspirated and screened for BIA-ALCL by CD30 immunohistochemistry. Confirmation of diagnosis is performed with cell block cytology demonstrating anaplastic large cells as well as flow cytometry demonstrating a T-cell clonal population.

Note that all implants will have a minute amount of periprosthetic fluid, which is normal and does not necessarily warrant investigation for BIA-ALCL.

While early reports used the Ann Arbor staging system, many experts are now using the TNM staging system, although the American Joint Committee on Cancer has yet to make formal staging recommendations.</p><p>Patients with any type of lymphoma are traditionally staged according to the Lugano revisions to the Ann Arbor staging system (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F97479\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef97479 \">table 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/breast-implant-associated-anaplastic-large-cell-lymphoma/abstract/101,102\" class=\"abstract_t\">101,102</a>]. Using this system, stage IE disease is limited to breast involvement only, and stage IIE disease is limited to the breast and ipsilateral axillary lymph nodes. Using this system, nearly all BIA-ALCL patients have low-stage disease. In one study, patients were either stage IE (84 percent) or stage IIE (16 percent) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F108783\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef108783 \">figure 3</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/breast-implant-associated-anaplastic-large-cell-lymphoma/abstract/75\" class=\"abstract_t\">75</a>].

Rather, excisional biopsies should be performed for axillary lymph nodes found to be enlarged on clinical exam or imaging studies. Approximately 60 percent of enlarged axillary nodes are pathologically involved [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/breast-implant-associated-anaplastic-large-cell-lymphoma/abstract/62\" class=\"abstract_t\">62</a>]; fine needle aspiration is avoided, as it can yield false-negative results. </p><p>For patients with bilateral implants, we remove the contralateral uninvolved implant and capsule to avoid the risk of a contralateral recurrence or second contralateral lymphoma. </p><p>Capsule-confined BIA-ALCL most commonly follows an indolent course following adequate surgical treatment, without the need for adjunctive therapy (chemotherapy, radiotherapy) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/breast-implant-associated-anaplastic-large-cell-lymphoma/abstract/8,62,75\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,62,75</a>].

However, when the ability to completely excise the mass was taken into account, recurrence rates and prognosis were similar.

The median overall survival for patients with a discrete breast mass was 12 years, whereas the median overall survival had not been reached for patients who did not have a discrete breast mass. </p><p>A review included 87 BIA-ALCL patients treated with surgery alone (40 percent); surgery and radiation (9 percent); surgery and chemotherapy (19 percent); surgery, chemotherapy, and radiation (30 percent); or with chemotherapy alone (2 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/breast-implant-associated-anaplastic-large-cell-lymphoma/abstract/75\" class=\"abstract_t\">75</a>].

Procedure-specific informational pamphlets at an initial consultation are useful to help patients understand surgical details, and engender more effective recall [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/breast-implant-associated-anaplastic-large-cell-lymphoma/abstract/113\" class=\"abstract_t\">113</a>].

Even if suggested, it is unknown whether patients would consent to screening for BIA-ALCL in the absence of guaranteed insurance reimbursement. </p><p>Similar barriers are seen with breast implant rupture screening. The FDA recommends that all women with silicone breast implants undergo evaluation for breast implant failure at three years post-implantation and removal of the implant if rupture is identified. However, since insurance policies do not cover such screening, the suggested magnetic resonance imaging study is not widely performed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/breast-implant-associated-anaplastic-large-cell-lymphoma/abstract/114\" class=\"abstract_t\">114</a>].</p><p>Fortunately, compliance with recommendations for BIA-ALCL appears to be better. In patients with clinical signs of the development of a periprosthetic fluid collection, the physician should not hesitate to evaluate for the presence a seroma, and if there is a reasonable clinical suspicion of BIA-ALCL, should also not hesitate to recommend to their patients appropriate pathologic review of the effusion, importantly with CD30 immunohistochemistry (which is not typically performed on routine specimen evaluation).

Confirmed cases in the registry are available for research studies to better characterize BIA-ALCL. Further research is needed to determine the exact role of breast implants in the etiology of the disease, to determine whether some women have a predisposition to the development of the disease, and to determine if there are any patient or implant modifiable risk factors. </p><p>The establishment and characterization of a BIA-ALCL model cell line (TLBR-1) as well as heterotransplantation of the disease into immune-compromised mice has been reported [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/breast-implant-associated-anaplastic-large-cell-lymphoma/abstract/49\" class=\"abstract_t\">49</a>]. Establishment of cell lines from effusion or excisional biopsies will be important to completely characterize the disease and identify potential molecular targets. Future research into the development of primary cell lines and biologic models will be important to fully elucidate the exact etiology and pathogenesis of BIA-ALCL. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4215200018\"><span class=\"h1\">SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Breast implant-associated anaplastic large cell lymphoma (BIA-ALCL) is a rare CD30-positive peripheral T cell lymphoma arising around breast implants placed for either reconstructive or cosmetic indications. Among women with breast implants, the absolute risk of developing BIA-ALCL is very low, and screening or prophylactic implant removal is not recommended. (See <a href=\"#H127601843\" class=\"local\">'Epidemiology'</a> above and <a href=\"#H404418847\" class=\"local\">'Counseling women with implants'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Most cases present approximately one decade after implant placement with either a seroma or, less commonly, a discrete breast mass adjacent to the implant. While most cases are unilateral, bilateral breast involvement has been reported in a minority of patients with bilateral breast implants. (See <a href=\"#H3833694126\" class=\"local\">'Clinical and pathologic features'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The tumor involves the luminal surface of the fibrous capsule surrounding the implant and may show varying degrees of infiltration of the capsule, the surrounding soft tissue, or the breast parenchyma. The CD30-positive tumor cells morphologically resemble those of systemic ALCL. Unlike systemic ALCL, BIA-ALCL lacks expression of anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) and does not have gene rearrangements involving the <em>ALK</em> gene on chromosome 2p23. (See <a href=\"#H1662497009\" class=\"local\">'Pathologic features'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The evaluation of suspected cases includes a bilateral breast examination, ultrasound of the involved breast, aspiration of the effusion (seroma), and biopsy of the capsule. The seroma fluid is sent for culture and specific pathology tests. (See <a href=\"#H2390757439\" class=\"local\">'Evaluation of suspected cases'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>BIA-ALCL is a clinicopathologic diagnosis based upon characteristic morphologic features and immunohistochemical patterns found on biopsy specimens in conjunction with the clinical features found on presentation. It must be differentiated from primary breast lymphoma, primary cutaneous ALCL, nodal ALCL with breast involvement, primary or recurrent breast cancer, nonmalignant complications of breast implants, and breast infection. (See <a href=\"#H448126207\" class=\"local\">'Diagnosis and differential diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Disease stage can usually be determined based on the pathologic findings at the time of complete surgical resection in conjunction with findings on imaging (ie, positron emission <span class=\"nowrap\">tomography/computed</span> tomography <span class=\"nowrap\">[PET/CT]</span> scan). Disseminated disease suggested on imaging should be confirmed pathologically. (See <a href=\"#H184951769\" class=\"local\">'Staging'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Data regarding the treatment of BIA-ALCL come from case series and case reports. Our approach is generally consistent with expert consensus recommendations. (See <a href=\"#H1533993778\" class=\"local\">'Selection of therapy'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>For all patients with BIA-ALCL, we recommend complete surgical resection of the implant, the capsule, and any associated mass (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=2\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1B</a>). This recommendation is in accordance with National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) BIA-ALCL guidelines. (See <a href=\"#H1249695891\" class=\"local\">'Complete surgical resection'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>For patients with localized disease (presenting as malignant effusion or mass) that can be completely excised by surgical removal of the breast implant and capsule (Ann Arbor stage IE, MD Anderson TNM Stage 1A to 2A), we suggest no adjunctive therapy (chemotherapy, radiotherapy) (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>For patients with pathologically confirmed disseminated disease or patients who fail surgical therapy alone, we follow NCCN guidelines with either an anthracycline-based regimen (ie. CHOP) or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=brentuximab-vedotin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">brentuximab vedotin</a> for first-line therapy (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F107277\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef107277 \">algorithm 2</a>). (See <a href=\"#H3378948616\" class=\"local\">'Adjuvant therapy for advanced disease'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Following the completion of therapy, patients are seen at periodic intervals to monitor for treatment complications and assess for possible relapse. BIA-ALCL generally appears to be a biologically indolent disease with a good prognosis with complete surgical resection provided there is no extension beyond the implant capsule.
