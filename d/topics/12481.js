Neuromuscular toxins act in various ways to inhibit this process. These toxins are naturally occurring [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-neuromuscular-junction-toxins/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>], and some have been developed as biochemical weapons.</p><p>This topic will briefly discuss the neuromuscular transmission disorders due to botulism, tick paralysis, snake venom, organophosphates and carbamates, and hypermagnesemia or hypocalcemia.</p><p>Acquired myasthenia gravis, congenital and neonatal myasthenia gravis, and Lambert-Eaton myasthenic syndrome are discussed separately.

Within the presynaptic terminal are vesicles containing acetylcholine, adenosine triphosphate (ATP), magnesium, and calcium [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-neuromuscular-junction-toxins/abstract/2,3\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,3</a>]. Most of these vesicles are bound to the actin cytoskeleton by proteins called synapsins. When an action potential induces opening of calcium channels, increased intracellular calcium levels promote phosphorylation of synapsins. This phosphorylation results in release of the vesicles from their cytoskeletal sites [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-neuromuscular-junction-toxins/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].</p><p>After release from the cytoskeleton, vesicles become bound at the presynaptic membrane terminal in areas called active zones [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-neuromuscular-junction-toxins/abstract/2,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,5</a>]. This &quot;docking&quot; allows rapid exocytosis of the vesicles. Docking is mediated by proteins termed SNARES (soluble N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive-fusion-attachment protein receptors). SNARES attached to the terminal membrane (t-SNARES) form complexes with proteins located on the vesicle (v-SNARES) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-neuromuscular-junction-toxins/abstract/6-8\" class=\"abstract_t\">6-8</a>].</p><p>Proteins involved in SNARE complexes include VAMP (vesicle-associated membrane protein), which is found on the vesicle surface, along with SNAP-25 (synaptosomal-associated protein of 25 kD) and syntaxin, proteins found at the terminal membrane [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-neuromuscular-junction-toxins/abstract/6-8\" class=\"abstract_t\">6-8</a>]. VAMP, syntaxin, and SNAP-25 are targets of the protease activity of botulinum toxin.</p><p>Phosphorylation of docking proteins occurs in response to increased calcium levels. This induces SNARE complex formation, followed by exocytosis of the vesicle contents [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-neuromuscular-junction-toxins/abstract/6,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,8</a>]. The vesicle membrane becomes added to the terminal membrane. Vesicles are recycled when pits form in the terminal membrane and become coated with a protein called clathrin. These clathrin-coated pits then pinch off to form vesicles [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-neuromuscular-junction-toxins/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. Acetylcholine is then synthesized and repackaged into these vesicles.</p><p>The postsynaptic membrane is heavily folded and invaginated. Acetylcholine receptors are found at the crests of the junctional folds, and voltage-sensitive Na+ channels are concentrated within the folds. The acetylcholine receptors have an ideal binding constant to allow reversible binding of acetylcholine. When bound, ion channels within the receptor are opened with an influx of Na+, and there is a transient depolarization of the end-plate region. If this end-plate potential is large enough, a muscle fiber action potential is generated, which leads to muscle contraction. Acetylcholine remaining in the synapse is rapidly degraded by the enzyme acetylcholinesterase, and the muscle is allowed to repolarize [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-neuromuscular-junction-toxins/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">BOTULISM</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Botulism is an uncommon and life-threatening disease caused by bacteria in the Clostridium family. The botulinum neurotoxin is considered the most potent lethal substance known. In high enough doses, it causes rapid and severe paralysis of skeletal muscles.</p><p>Botulism is briefly reviewed here and is discussed in detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=botulism\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Botulism&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Epidemiology</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Organisms of the Clostridium genus are commonly found in soil and include C. botulinum, C baratii, and C butyricum. They are all gram-positive, anaerobic, spore-forming rods, which have evolved to produce a potent neurotoxin.</p><p>Eight distinct C. botulinum toxin types have been described: A, B, C1, C2, D, E, F, and G. Of these eight, types A, B, E, and rarely F and G cause human disease. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=botulism#H3\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Botulism&quot;, section on 'Pathogenesis'</a>.)</p><p>The modern syndrome of botulism occurs in five forms, differentiated by the mode of acquisition:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Food borne botulism occurs after ingestion of food contaminated by preformed botulinum toxin</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Infant botulism occurs after the ingestion of clostridial spores that then colonize the host's gastrointestinal (GI) tract and release toxin produced in vivo</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Wound botulism occurs after infection of a wound by Clostridium botulinum with subsequent in vivo production of neurotoxin</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Adult enteric infectious botulism or adult infectious botulism of unknown source is similar to infant botulism in that toxin is produced in vivo in the GI tract of an infected adult host</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Inhalational botulism is the form that would occur if aerosolized toxin was released in an act of bioterrorism</p><p/><p>An average of 110 cases of botulism is reported each year in the United States. Approximately 72 percent of these cases are infant botulism, 25 percent are food borne botulism, and the remaining 3 percent are wound botulism. The incidence of wound botulism has increased due to the use of heroin. Adult infectious botulism is only occasionally reported. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=botulism#H4\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Botulism&quot;, section on 'Epidemiology'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Clinical features</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Symptoms range from minor cranial nerve palsies associated with symmetric descending weakness to rapid respiratory arrest. Key features of the botulism syndrome include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Absence of fever</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Symmetric neurologic deficits</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Preserved responsiveness</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Normal or slow heart rate and normal blood pressure</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>No sensory deficits with the exception of blurred vision</p><p/><p>Fever may be seen with wound botulism, but it probably results from concurrent bacterial infection of the wound by non-clostridial species. Food borne botulism produces gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms such as nausea, vomiting, or diarrhea. These may precede neurologic symptoms. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=botulism#H10\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Botulism&quot;, section on 'Clinical manifestations'</a>.)</p><p>Disease presentation and severity are quite variable in infant botulism, most likely as a result of size of the bacterial inoculum and host susceptibility. A detailed discussion of infant botulism is presented separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=neuromuscular-junction-disorders-in-newborns-and-infants#H14\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Neuromuscular junction disorders in newborns and infants&quot;, section on 'Infant botulism'</a>.)</p><p>Routine lab tests in botulism are generally nonspecific, and specific laboratory confirmation may take up to days. Therefore, the diagnosis is usually clinical. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=botulism#H16\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Botulism&quot;, section on 'Diagnosis'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Neurophysiology</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Electrodiagnostic studies (nerve conduction studies and electromyography) are frequently helpful in diagnosis of botulism. Sensory action potentials and nerve conduction velocities are typically normal. However, compound motor action potential (CMAP) amplitudes are decreased if the presynaptic block is severe enough. Repetitive nerve stimulation (RNS) at frequencies of 2 to 5 Hz depletes readily available stores of acetylcholine from the neuromuscular junction and decreases CMAP amplitudes even further, a finding termed the decremental response [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-neuromuscular-junction-toxins/abstract/11,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,12</a>]. A decrement of greater than 10 percent is considered abnormal. In more severe cases, the baseline CMAP may be too low to see decremental response.</p><p>In contrast, increased rates of stimulation (20 to 50 Hz) or exercise cause accumulation of calcium in the presynaptic terminal and increase release of acetylcholine, a finding termed the incremental response, or postactivation facilitation (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F63756\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef63756 \">figure 2</a>). This can be seen in approximately 60 percent of cases of adult botulism poisoning [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-neuromuscular-junction-toxins/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. The amount of facilitation seen with botulism (40 to 100 percent) is usually less than that seen in Lambert-Eaton myasthenic syndrome (200 percent or more) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F66509\" class=\"graphic graphic_waveform graphicRef66509 \">waveform 1</a>)&nbsp;[<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-neuromuscular-junction-toxins/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. No increment or only very mild increment will be seen if the block produced by botulism is too severe. The post-tetanic facilitation may also be extraordinarily prolonged with botulism, occasionally up to four minutes. Postactivation exhaustion, a decrease in CMAP amplitude occurring two to four minutes after maximal muscle contraction, is not present in cases of botulism poisoning [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-neuromuscular-junction-toxins/abstract/11,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,12</a>].</p><p>In summary, EMG diagnosis of botulism should be based on the following findings [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-neuromuscular-junction-toxins/abstract/11-13\" class=\"abstract_t\">11-13</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Reduced baseline CMAP amplitude</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Postactivation facilitation (between 40 and 200 percent)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Absence of postactivation exhaustion</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Postactivation facilitation which persists longer than two minutes</p><p/><p>The sensitivity of repetitive nerve stimulation is much greater in cases of infantile botulism.

(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=botulism#H21\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Botulism&quot;, section on 'Treatment'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h1\">TICK PARALYSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Several tick species produce a toxin that inhibits transduction at the neuromuscular junction. The ticks primarily responsible include the Rocky Mountain wood tick (<em>Dermacentor andersoni</em>), the American dog tick (<em>Dermacentor variabilis</em>), the Lone Star tick (Amblyomma americanum), the black-legged tick (<em>Ixodes scapularis</em>), the western black-legged tick (<em>Ixodes pacificus</em>), the Gulf coast tick (<em>Amblyomma maculatum</em>), and the Australian paralysis tick (<em>Ixodes holocyclus)</em>. The neurotoxins of <em>Ixodes </em>species ticks are known as holocyclotoxins. These toxins decrease release of acetylcholine from the presynaptic membrane by inhibiting presynaptic voltage gated calcium channels [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-neuromuscular-junction-toxins/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. This reduces calcium entry into the nerve terminal thereby decreasing quanta of acetylcholine released [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-neuromuscular-junction-toxins/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>].</p><p>Tick paralysis is briefly reviewed here; a detailed discussion is presented separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tick-paralysis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Tick paralysis&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h2\">Clinical features</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Symptoms include anorexia, lethargy, muscle weakness, nystagmus, and an ascending flaccid paralysis. Symptom onset occurs three to seven days after attachment of the tick. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tick-paralysis#H5\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Tick paralysis&quot;, section on 'Clinical features'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h2\">Neurophysiology</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Electromyography shows a reduced amplitude of compound muscle action potentials [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-neuromuscular-junction-toxins/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. No abnormalities are seen with repetitive nerve stimulation studies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-neuromuscular-junction-toxins/abstract/16,17\" class=\"abstract_t\">16,17</a>]. There may be subtle abnormalities of motor nerve conduction velocity and sensory action potentials.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h2\">Diagnosis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The diagnosis of tick paralysis usually relies on the finding of a tick attached to the patient. Tick paralysis is a rare, but easily remedied, cause of ascending paralysis. Therefore, patients with this presentation should always be thoroughly searched for ticks. Unexposed areas such as the scalp, genitalia, and external meatus should be inspected carefully. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tick-paralysis#H9\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Tick paralysis&quot;, section on 'Differential diagnosis'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tick-paralysis#H10\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Tick paralysis&quot;, section on 'Suggested approach to diagnosis and management'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h2\">Treatment</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Removal of the tick is the primary treatment of tick paralysis. The tick can be removed with forceps. However, it should be paralyzed with an insecticide prior to removal to ensure removal of mouth parts.</p><p>Clinical improvement is generally fairly rapid after removal of American ticks. Symptoms may continue and worsen for two to three days after removal of Australian ticks. For severely affected patients, an antivenom derived from dogs is available.

These toxins have phospholipase A2 activity and are called SPANS (snake presynaptic phospholipase A2 neurotoxins). They catalyze the hydrolysis of phosphatidylcholine, a major component of the plasma membrane, forming lysophosphatides and releasing both saturated and unsaturated fatty acids [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-neuromuscular-junction-toxins/abstract/20-22\" class=\"abstract_t\">20-22</a>].</p><p>The exact mechanism of toxicity is undefined, but hydrolysis of these phospholipids leads to massive release of synaptic vesicles. Fusion of synaptic vesicles with the presynaptic membrane is induced, followed by inhibited reformation of the vesicles after exocytosis. Further neurotransmitter release is therefore prevented [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-neuromuscular-junction-toxins/abstract/23,24\" class=\"abstract_t\">23,24</a>]. Poisoned nerve terminals show an absence of vesicles [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-neuromuscular-junction-toxins/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>], which causes delayed degeneration of the motor nerve terminals. Recovery requires nerve terminal regeneration, a process that may take weeks. The presynaptic neurotoxins also possess myotoxic activity, which may lead to degeneration of skeletal muscle and death from acute renal failure.</p><p>The postsynaptic-acting toxins are present in venom of snakes from the Elapidae family [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-neuromuscular-junction-toxins/abstract/22,26\" class=\"abstract_t\">22,26</a>]. They bind irreversibly to the acetylcholine receptor site, and prevent the opening of the associated sodium channel [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-neuromuscular-junction-toxins/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>].

This progresses to weakness of limb muscles [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-neuromuscular-junction-toxins/abstract/27,28\" class=\"abstract_t\">27,28</a>]. Clotting time is also increased [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-neuromuscular-junction-toxins/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>].</p><p>The postsynaptic toxins produce findings on electrodiagnostic studies identical to those seen in myasthenia gravis, since the mechanism of disease is similar [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-neuromuscular-junction-toxins/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>].

These compounds are formed as the esters of phosphoric or phosphorothioic acid or as the esters of carbamic acid, and are commonly used as pesticides. Each year, over 10,000 cases of organophosphate or carbamate poisoning occur in the United States, and 3,000,000 people are exposed worldwide. Exposure routes include oral ingestion, inhalation, or dermal contact. Organophosphorus &quot;nerve gases&quot; (eg, tabun [GA], sarin [GB], soman [GD]) have also been developed.</p><p>Organophosphate and carbamate toxicity is briefly reviewed here; a detailed discussion is presented separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=organophosphate-and-carbamate-poisoning\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Organophosphate and carbamate poisoning&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H19\"><span class=\"h2\">Pathophysiology</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Although the organophosphates and the carbamates have a common mode of action (anticholinesterase activity leading to an overabundance of acetylcholine in the synapse), there are significant differences between their reactions with the enzyme. The bond between an organophosphorus ester and the active site of the acetylcholinesterase enzyme is extremely stable, and these compounds are referred to as irreversible inhibitors. The carbamates interact with acetylcholinesterase in a fashion similar to acetylcholine. They bind noncovalently and the free, active enzyme is regenerated.</p><p>The spontaneous hydrolysis of organophosphates from acetylcholinesterase is generally very slow. Oximes, specifically <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pralidoxime-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">pralidoxime</a>, are typically used to induce more rapid dephosphorylation. If the oxime is not administered soon enough after acetylcholinesterase has been inhibited, an alkoxy group may be lost from the phosphorylated enzyme, resulting in a conformational change, known as &quot;aging.&quot; Aging can occur within minutes for some compounds or may take up to days. Once aging has occurred, oximes can no longer induce dephosphorylation.</p><p>The excess synaptic acetylcholine produced by organophosphates and carbamates binds muscarinic receptors in the central nervous system (CNS) and the parasympathetic portion of the autonomic nervous system. It also binds nicotinic receptors in the CNS, sympathetic and parasympathetic ganglia, and the neuromuscular junction.

These result from the accumulation of acetylcholine in sympathetic ganglia and at the adrenal medulla (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F63540\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef63540 \">table 2</a>).

This is caused by excess accumulation of acetylcholine in the synapse and subsequent depolarization of the postsynaptic muscle membrane. The presynaptic receptors are also activated.
