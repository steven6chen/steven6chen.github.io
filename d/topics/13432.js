The 2007 Joint Task Force of the European Society of Cardiology, American College of Cardiology Foundation, the American Heart Association, and the World Health Federation <span class=\"nowrap\">(ESC/ACCF/AHA/WHF)</span> defined acute MI as a clinical event that results in the death of cardiac myocytes (myocardial necrosis) and is caused by ischemia (but not other etiologies such as myocarditis or trauma) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/perioperative-myocardial-infarction-or-injury-after-noncardiac-surgery/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. This definition was not fundamentally changed in the third universal definition of MI released in 2012 by the <span class=\"nowrap\">ESC/ACCF/AHA/WHF</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/perioperative-myocardial-infarction-or-injury-after-noncardiac-surgery/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. The definition requires a rise <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> fall of cardiac biomarker values. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=criteria-for-the-diagnosis-of-acute-myocardial-infarction#H2\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Criteria for the diagnosis of acute myocardial infarction&quot;, section on 'Third universal definition of MI'</a>.)</p><p>MINS is a broader term than MI (after noncardiac surgery) and is defined as myocardial cell injury during the first 30 days after noncardiac surgery due to an ischemic etiology (ie, no evidence of a nonischemic etiology like sepsis, pulmonary embolism, cardioversion, chronically elevated troponin, etc) and is independently associated with mortality. MINS includes MI (both symptomatic and non-symptomatic) and patients with postoperative elevations in troponin but who do not have symptoms, electrocardiographic abnormalities, or other criteria that meet the universal definition described above, and have no evidence of a nonischemic etiology for their troponin elevation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/perioperative-myocardial-infarction-or-injury-after-noncardiac-surgery/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H74856543\"><span class=\"h1\">MECHANISM</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The pathophysiology of perioperative myocardial infarction (MI) is debated. Although supply-demand mismatch (eg, hypertension, hypotension, or tachycardia in the setting of a fixed coronary artery stenosis) has long been thought to explain many perioperative MIs, the evidence to support this explanation is limited. However, plaque rupture may play a central role in some cases. In one angiographic study, nearly 50 percent of patients with perioperative acute coronary syndrome had evidence of plaque rupture [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/perioperative-myocardial-infarction-or-injury-after-noncardiac-surgery/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. </p><p>In patients with myocardial injury after noncardiac surgery (MINS), the most common pathologies are either underlying obstructive coronary artery disease, which can cause elevations of cardiac troponin due to a supply-demand mismatch, or an acute thrombus [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/perioperative-myocardial-infarction-or-injury-after-noncardiac-surgery/abstract/5-7\" class=\"abstract_t\">5-7</a>]. Those who propose use of the term MINS do not apply it to patients in whom myocardial injury is likely due to a nonischemic etiology such as pulmonary embolism, sepsis, or cardioversion. </p><p>Two large prospective cohort studies in which adjudicators attempted to evaluate each case of an elevated troponin for evidence of a nonischemic etiology found that over 85 percent of troponin elevations after surgery were likely due to myocardial ischemia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/perioperative-myocardial-infarction-or-injury-after-noncardiac-surgery/abstract/3,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,8</a>]. Regardless of the etiology, these elevations have important prognostic relevance. (See <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'Prognosis'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">INCIDENCE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Studies that have evaluated the incidence of perioperative cardiac troponin (cTn) elevation attempt to report whether the elevation is a myocardial infarction (MI) or myocardial injury after noncardiac surgery (MINS) (see <a href=\"#H110790502\" class=\"local\">'Definitions of myocardial infarction and myocardial injury'</a> above). In these studies, the incidence of MINS ranges between 8 and 19 percent. MI accounts for about 40 percent of MINS when a non-high sensitivity cTn is evaluated, and about 20 to 30 percent of these events when a high sensitivity cTn (hs-cTn) assay is used. </p><p>Factors that explain between-study differences in the incidence of MINS and the percent of MINS that are labelled as MI include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Most patients are receiving analgesic medication that can mask cardiac ischemic symptoms during the first 48 hours after surgery when MI occurs (see <a href=\"#H110790508\" class=\"local\">'Clinical presentation'</a> below). Had patients been symptomatic, they would likely have been classified as MI. Also, electrocardiograms (ECGs) are mainly ordered after the detection of an elevated troponin, which may be 12 to 24 hours after the event, and ECG changes may have resolved by the time the ECG is obtained [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/perioperative-myocardial-infarction-or-injury-after-noncardiac-surgery/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The incidence of MINS is influenced by the sensitivity of the biomarker used. As demonstrated across the VISION cohort studies discussed later in this section, as the sensitivity of cTn assays improved (ie, from a non-high sensitivity to an hs-cTn assay), the frequency of identifying perioperative troponin elevations increased. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The characteristics of the study population, such as severity of patient risk and the risk of surgery, will influence incidence. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A baseline troponin is necessary to determine if a postoperative troponin elevation represents an acute or chronic event. Some studies have not rigorously compared postoperative with preoperative troponin values.</p><p><br/>Five large studies have evaluated the incidence of troponin elevations after noncardiac surgery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/perioperative-myocardial-infarction-or-injury-after-noncardiac-surgery/abstract/3,10-13\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,10-13</a>]. The best data on incidence of MINS and MI come from the following two studies:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The VISION Study was a prospective cohort study that included a representative sample of patients &ge;45 years of age undergoing in-hospital noncardiac surgery, and all of the participants had troponin measurements after surgery. Two cohorts have been reported:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>In the first VISION cohort of 15,065 patients, a non-high sensitivity fourth generation cTn assay was measured during the first three postoperative days [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/perioperative-myocardial-infarction-or-injury-after-noncardiac-surgery/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Among the patients with an elevated troponin, all were assessed for ischemic symptoms, had &ge;1 ECG obtained, and had two independent adjudicators to determine if there was evidence of a non-ischemic cause (eg, pulmonary embolism, sepsis) of the troponin elevation. Baseline cTnT values were not available. Study adjudicators determined that 93 percent of patients with a troponin elevation had an ischemic etiology for their troponin elevation and that 1200 (8 percent) patients suffered MINS. Among the MINS patients, 41.8 percent fulfilled the universal definition of MI. A limitation of this study is that troponin measurements were not obtained systematically in patients before surgery. &#160;</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>In the second VISION cohort of 21,842 patients, which followed the same procedures as the first cohort, an hs-cTn assay was measured during the first three postoperative days; 40.4 percent of the participants had a preoperative troponin measurement [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/perioperative-myocardial-infarction-or-injury-after-noncardiac-surgery/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. Study adjudicators determined that 11 percent had evidence of a non-ischemic etiology for their elevated troponin, and among the patients who had an elevated perioperative troponin measurement, 13.8 percent had a preoperative high-sensitivity troponin T measurement that was greater than or equal to the peak postoperative troponin value. In this cohort with high-sensitivity troponin T measurements, 3904 patients (17.9 percent) were adjudicated as having suffered MINS, and among these patients, 21.7 percent fulfilled the universal definition of MI. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A 2017 prospective, diagnostic study of 2018 patients (2546 surgeries) at increased cardiovascular risk and undergoing noncardiac surgery routinely measured hs-cTnT before and after surgery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/perioperative-myocardial-infarction-or-injury-after-noncardiac-surgery/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. Perioperative myocardial injury was defined as an absolute increase in hs-CTnT of &ge;14 <span class=\"nowrap\">ng/L</span> above preoperative values. Perioperative myocardial injury occurred in 16 percent of surgeries. Of these, 6 percent had typical chest pain, 18 percent had any ischemic symptom, and 29 percent had one or more of the following: an ischemic symptom, a diagnostic change on an ECG, or evidence of loss of myocardial viability on imaging. </p><p/><p>Additional information regarding incidence of perioperative MI in the troponin era comes from over 8000 patients in the randomized POISE trial of perioperative beta blocker therapy in patients at increased cardiovascular risk undergoing noncardiac surgery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/perioperative-myocardial-infarction-or-injury-after-noncardiac-surgery/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. In POISE, perioperative MI was defined as an elevated cardiac biomarker or enzyme level (with separate definitions for troponin or creatine kinase MB fraction), and one or more of the following: ischemic symptoms, ECG changes in two contiguous leads (ie, development of pathologic Q waves, ST-segment elevation, ST-segment depression, or T-wave inversion), coronary artery intervention, or evidence of MI on cardiac imaging or autopsy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/perioperative-myocardial-infarction-or-injury-after-noncardiac-surgery/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. The incidence of MI in POISE was 5 percent at 30 days (4.2 and 5.7 in the beta blocker and placebo groups, respectively), and the majority of these MIs (74 percent) occurred within 48 hours of surgery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/perioperative-myocardial-infarction-or-injury-after-noncardiac-surgery/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. It is not clear that guideline-recommended cut-off values were used in POISE, which relied on local values. Thus, from the biochemical perspective, these data probably underestimate the true frequency of elevated cTn measurements and thus perhaps the true frequency of MI as well. In POISE, 65 percent of the patients who had a perioperative MI did not experience ischemic symptoms. Perioperative, asymptomatic MIs were associated with a similar increased risk of 30-day mortality (adjusted odds ratio 4; 95% CI 2.65-6.06) as with symptomatic MIs (adjusted odds ratio, 4.76; 95% CI 2.68-8.43).

Risk factors include high-risk surgery, history of ischemic heart disease, heart failure, cerebrovascular disease, diabetes mellitus requiring treatment with insulin, and preoperative serum creatinine &gt;2.0 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span>.

In this very-high-risk group, age greater than 70 years, abdominal aortic surgery, diabetes mellitus, angina, and baseline ST-T abnormalities were significantly associated with the development of MI.</p><p>While high-risk surgery such as abdominal aortic surgery is associated with the development of perioperative MI, other surgeries such as total hip and knee replacement also place patients at risk. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-of-cardiac-risk-prior-to-noncardiac-surgery#H8\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation of cardiac risk prior to noncardiac surgery&quot;, section on 'Risk factors used in risk prediction models'</a>.) </p><p>In the POISE trial, in addition to the Goldman risk predictors, serious bleeding (disabling or requiring &ge;2 units of blood) and an increase in every 10 beats in baseline heart rate were significant independent predictors of perioperative MI (adjusted odds ratio 3.62, 95% CI 2.07-6.36; and 1.29, 95% CI 1.13-1.50, respectively) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/perioperative-myocardial-infarction-or-injury-after-noncardiac-surgery/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. </p><p>Perioperative hemorrhage as a predictor of MI (or stroke) was also evaluated in a study of 651,775 patients who underwent surgery between 2005 and 2009 at centers participating in the United States National Surgical Quality Improvement Program [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/perioperative-myocardial-infarction-or-injury-after-noncardiac-surgery/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. Major hemorrhage, defined as bleeding necessitating transfusion of more than four units of packed red blood cells or whole blood, occurred in 0.80 percent of patients. Q-wave MI occurred in 0.24 percent, and stroke in 0.20 percent. Hemorrhage was independently associated with MI (hazard ratio [HR] 2.7, 95% CI 2.1-3.4) and stroke (HR 2.3, 95% CI 1.9-3.3), and the risk was related to the severity of bleeding. The risk of MI may be an underestimate due to the use of Q-wave MI as the definition of MI, rather than the use of biomarkers and clinical findings. </p><p>In the POISE-2 trial comparing low-dose <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aspirin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">aspirin</a> with placebo and low-dose <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clonidine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">clonidine</a> with placebo in 10,010 adults undergoing noncardiac surgery, the following preoperative independent predictors of perioperative MI were found: history of coronary artery disease, peripheral arterial disease, congestive heart failure, estimated glomerular filtration rate &lt;60 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/minute/1</span>.73m<sup>2</sup>, and age &ge;75 years.

In the POISE trial, approximately 65 percent of the patients with MI did not experience ischemic symptoms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/perioperative-myocardial-infarction-or-injury-after-noncardiac-surgery/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. We recommend that all patients with symptoms or signs suggestive of myocardial ischemia or those suspected for other reasons, such as hemodynamic instability or respiratory distress, receive a 12-lead electrocardiogram and serial (two or three) troponin measurements. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h1\">DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In the setting of noncardiac surgery, the diagnosis of perioperative myocardial infarction (MI) is confirmed with a highly sensitive troponin with at least one of the following present: symptoms of ischemia, new or presumed new significant <span class=\"nowrap\">ST-segment/T</span> wave changes or new left bundle branch block, development of pathological Q waves on the electrocardiogram (ECG), new or presumed new imaging evidence of loss of viable myocardium or regional wall motion abnormality, or identification of an intracoronary thrombus by angiography or autopsy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/perioperative-myocardial-infarction-or-injury-after-noncardiac-surgery/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].

For patients in whom the diagnosis remains uncertain after considering symptoms, ECG changes, and the results of biomarker testing, information from additional noninvasive studies (such as a new wall-motion abnormality or fixed defect on echocardiography, or radionuclide myocardial perfusion imaging) may be needed. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=noninvasive-testing-and-imaging-for-diagnosis-in-patients-at-low-to-intermediate-risk-for-acute-coronary-syndrome\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Noninvasive testing and imaging for diagnosis in patients at low to intermediate risk for acute coronary syndrome&quot;</a>.)</p><p>For those patients who have an elevated troponin, the ECG shows a new ischemic abnormality in a minority. In the first VISION study, which used non-high sensitivity troponin (see <a href=\"#H110790502\" class=\"local\">'Definitions of myocardial infarction and myocardial injury'</a> above), about 35 percent of patients had an ischemic ECG finding. T wave inversion and ST depression were the most common findings (23 and 16 percent, respectively). It is likely that a higher proportion of patients who suffer myocardial injury after noncardiac surgery (MINS) experienced ischemic ECG changes at some point in their postoperative course, but these changes are likely frequently missed for the following reasons:&nbsp;Most patients do not experience ischemic symptoms to trigger obtaining an ECG during the period of ischemia; most ECGs are obtained after detection of an elevated troponin, which is usually obtained at 24-hour intervals after surgery; and a troponin elevation only occurs hours after the initiation of an ischemic event.&nbsp;If clinicians are suspicious, additional studies are warranted.</p><p>Some may find it appropriate to only use the diagnosis of MINS (see <a href=\"#H110790502\" class=\"local\">'Definitions of myocardial infarction and myocardial injury'</a> above) when a diagnosis of acute MI is not fulfilled. In this case, MINS would be deemed present when there is an elevated troponin but no symptoms or ECG or noninvasive testing abnormalities. In addition, these patients should have had a nonischemic cause of an elevated troponin excluded.

A highly sensitive troponin should be obtained at 6 to 12 hours and on days one, two, and three after surgery (see <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Predictors'</a> above). In addition, we obtain a baseline preoperative cardiac troponin (cTn) in these patients since an isolated elevated postoperative cTn may represent a chronic process rather than an acute event. </p><p>The risk of MI is elevated, and the likelihood of missing the diagnosis based on symptoms or ECG changes is significant, as was shown in the POISE trial discussed above [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/perioperative-myocardial-infarction-or-injury-after-noncardiac-surgery/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>] (see <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Incidence'</a> above).

As the use of screening has not been well studied in these patients, we do not routinely screen them. (See <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'Prognosis'</a> below.)</p><p>Screening with troponin may identify individuals with MINS; that is, they did not have symptoms of myocardial ischemia and the ECG was normal, unchanged, or nondiagnostic. The rationale for this screening recommendation is that a positive troponin will lead to recommendations for preventative therapies such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aspirin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">aspirin</a> and statin use and will prompt evaluation by additional ECGs or imaging studies that might not otherwise be done, which could reveal an MI. (See <a href=\"#H530579136\" class=\"local\">'Myocardial injury patients'</a> below.)</p><p>For patients found to have an elevated screening perioperative troponin, two issues should be kept in mind before a diagnosis of MINS is made (see <a href=\"#H110790502\" class=\"local\">'Definitions of myocardial infarction and myocardial injury'</a> above):</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The diagnosis should not be based only on a postoperative elevation in troponin, as this may represent a chronic elevation. This possibility is why a baseline troponin value is so important. The baseline (preoperative) value may be available either because it had been performed as a routine test, as discussed below, or because a preoperative residual sample can be tested. The diagnosis requires either a normal baseline value or a typical rise and fall of the biomarker. A challenge to clinicians is that many patients may not have a preoperative baseline troponin value to compare. In such instances, a prior sample may be available and used to test for cTn. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">In the VISION high-sensitivity cohort study (see <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Incidence'</a> above), among the patients who had an elevated perioperative troponin measurement, 13.8 percent had a preoperative high-sensitivity troponin T measurement that was greater than or equal to the peak postoperative troponin value.

Some of our experts routinely perform screening of lower-risk patients.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>With regard to obtaining a 12-lead electrocardiogram (see <a href=\"#H378049\" class=\"local\">'Management'</a> above):</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>We recommend performing 12-lead electrocardiography for all patients with symptoms of myocardial ischemia.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>For all asymptomatic patients at high cardiac risk for perioperative MI (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F57075\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef57075 \">table 1</a>), we suggest obtaining a 12-lead electrocardiogram (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>).

On day one of therapy, we typically give <a href=\"topic.htm?path=atorvastatin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">atorvastatin</a> 80 mg and aspirin 81 to 325 mg; we continue with the same dose of atorvastatin and aspirin 75 to 100 mg daily.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients with ST-elevation MI, we recommend treatment with a beta blocker (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=2\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1B</a>). <br/><br/>In addition, we usually proceed with urgent primary percutaneous coronary intervention after careful discussion of the benefits and risks with all managing healthcare providers.
