The material that has lodged in the extremity decreases blood flow because of occlusion or severe stenosis of the blood vessel. By understanding the breadth of that definition, the variables of &quot;material&quot; and &quot;elsewhere in the body&quot; provide a way to systematically think through the various etiologies. In addition, a systematic approach helps to avoid jumping to diagnostic conclusions based purely on what is common or what may have been previously seen in practice. </p><p>The priorities of managing acute embolism to the lower extremities are first to address the ischemia and then to institute measures to prevent further embolic events. </p><p>The clinical presentations, evaluation, diagnosis, and general management of embolism to the lower extremities are reviewed here. Other causes of acute arterial occlusion to the lower extremities are reviewed elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-acute-lower-extremity-ischemia\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical features and diagnosis of acute lower extremity ischemia&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2939549419\"><span class=\"h1\">ETIOLOGY</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4280819048\"><span class=\"h2\">Cardiac sources</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The most commonly reported source of lower extremity emboli is the heart, accounting for 55 to 87 percent of events [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/embolism-to-the-lower-extremities/abstract/1-3\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-3</a>]. The main sources of embolism from the heart are thrombus from within the cardiac chambers and debris shedding off valves (native, prosthetic). Rarely, cardiac tumor, most commonly atrial myxoma, can also embolize [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/embolism-to-the-lower-extremities/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].</p><p>Emboli from intracardiac thrombus usually come from the left atrium, often associated with atrial fibrillation. Thrombus can also form in the left ventricle (eg, severe cardiomyopathy, post-myocardial infarction). In either case, an area of relative stasis within the heart allows thrombus to form locally, which can dislodge and embolize to virtually anywhere in the body, including the lower extremities. Intracardiac sources of thrombus are often fibrin rich, with acute thrombus generally responding well to thrombolytic agents (eg, tissue plasminogen activator) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/embolism-to-the-lower-extremities/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=atrial-fibrillation-risk-of-embolization\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Atrial fibrillation: Risk of embolization&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=left-ventricular-thrombus-after-acute-myocardial-infarction\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Left ventricular thrombus after acute myocardial infarction&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The aortic or mitral valves can also be sources of emboli to the lower extremities. This may be from debris on diseased native or prosthetic valves, vegetative growths from bacterial endocarditis, or nonbacterial vegetations such as Libman-Sacks endocarditis in lupus [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/embolism-to-the-lower-extremities/abstract/6,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,7</a>]. As these types of embolic debris are not largely thrombotic in nature, they do not respond well to thrombolysis. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-evaluation-of-adults-with-suspected-native-valve-endocarditis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and evaluation of adults with suspected native valve endocarditis&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-prosthetic-valve-endocarditis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Epidemiology, clinical manifestations, and diagnosis of prosthetic valve endocarditis&quot;</a>.)</p><p>When septic emboli from cardiac valves lodge in the lower extremity, they can cause local destruction of the artery, abscess formation, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> mycotic pseudoaneurysms in addition to the usual ischemic picture. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=complications-and-outcome-of-infective-endocarditis#H22613914\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Complications and outcome of infective endocarditis&quot;, section on 'Septic embolization'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-infected-mycotic-arterial-aneurysm\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of infected (mycotic) arterial aneurysm&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4162790879\"><span class=\"h2\">Aortic plaque</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A diseased aortic wall with complex atherosclerotic plaque can also be a source of emboli. Presumably following the rupture of the fibrous cap overlying an atherosclerotic plaque, luminal irregularities and ulcerations result in a surface that is thrombogenic [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/embolism-to-the-lower-extremities/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. In addition to embolization of larger pieces of accumulated thrombus, microembolization of cholesterol crystals can also occur. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=embolism-from-aortic-plaque-thromboembolism\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Embolism from aortic plaque: Thromboembolism&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=embolism-from-atherosclerotic-plaque-atheroembolism-cholesterol-crystal-embolism\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Embolism from atherosclerotic plaque: Atheroembolism (cholesterol crystal embolism)&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Asymptomatic atherosclerotic disease of the aorta often seen incidentally on imaging studies (the so-called &quot;shaggy aorta syndrome&quot;) describes a condition that can lead to macrovascular or microvascular embolization (or both) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/embolism-to-the-lower-extremities/abstract/9,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,10</a>]. This can occur anywhere along the aorta, including the ascending aorta, aortic arch, descending thoracic aorta, or abdominal aorta. </p><p>Another source of emboli from the aorta is thrombus that appears to be nearly free-floating with attachment at one end to the wall of the aorta (also known as mural thrombus, mobile aortic thrombus, pedunculated aortic thrombus) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/embolism-to-the-lower-extremities/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. Sometimes these are found incidentally on imaging studies and other times during the evaluation for an embolic source. When surgically removed, the attachment point appears often to originate from an intimal <span class=\"nowrap\">irregularity/defect,</span> suggesting that these may start from a ruptured plaque or other primary intimal defect. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1913043073\"><span class=\"h2\">Aortic and peripheral aneurysm</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Blood flow within aortic aneurysms (thoracic or abdominal) is altered such that mural thrombus frequently forms within the aneurysm sac. Unlike with rupture risk, there is no known association of embolic potential of aortic aneurysms relative to their diameter. Although mural thrombus in an aortic aneurysm is common, dislodgement of aortic thrombus is an uncommon but known source of embolization to the lower extremities [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/embolism-to-the-lower-extremities/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. Embolism may be spontaneous, during manipulation of the aneurysm during open or endovascular repair, or during arterial instrumentation for another reason. (See <a href=\"#H1382211073\" class=\"local\">'Instrumentation'</a> below.)</p><p>Peripheral aneurysms such as femoral and popliteal aneurysms have a propensity to thrombose, which may propagate to occlude the distal vasculature, or alternatively mural thrombus can embolize distally. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=femoral-artery-aneurysm\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Femoral artery aneurysm&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=popliteal-artery-aneurysm\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Popliteal artery aneurysm&quot;</a>.) </p><p>Although iliac artery aneurysms are more likely to be complicated by rupture, thrombosis with the potential for embolism can occur. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=iliac-artery-aneurysm\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Iliac artery aneurysm&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3868618474\"><span class=\"h2\">Paradoxical embolism</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A paradoxical embolus results from venous thrombus embolizing to the right heart and then crossing into the arterial circulation through an intracardiac septal defect, or a right-to-left shunt in the pulmonary circulation. </p><p>Although the most commonly described manifestation of paradoxical embolism is acute stroke, embolization elsewhere in the peripheral arterial system has been described, including to the lower extremities. Because these clots originate in the veins, they tend to be larger, and when they embolize to the lower extremities, they tend to obstruct larger vessels. </p><p>A timely diagnosis of paradoxical embolism requires a high index of suspicion because it is quite rare due to the low prevalence of the requisite structural defects required to allow crossing over from the venous to arterial circulation. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1382211073\"><span class=\"h2\">Instrumentation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The incidence of lower extremity embolization as result of cardiac or peripheral interventions (catheter based or surgical) is quite low, but it is important to consider as a potential etiology when evaluating an embolic event. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=complications-of-diagnostic-cardiac-catheterization#H28\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Complications of diagnostic cardiac catheterization&quot;, section on 'Atheroembolism'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H602615294\"><span class=\"h3\">Endovascular intervention</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Careful manipulation of wires, catheters, and treatment devices during endovascular interventions is important to minimize damage from the intervention itself. Disruption of plaque or thrombus can occur during any type of intervention, including diagnostic studies and stent or stent-graft placement.</p><p>The incidence of iatrogenic embolization is not well known, but angiographically or clinically noted macroembolic events are estimated to occur in 4 to 5 percent, with smaller, undetected microembolic events likely occurring at much higher rates [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/embolism-to-the-lower-extremities/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. The clinical implications of microembolic events are not well known [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/embolism-to-the-lower-extremities/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. </p><p>The intraprocedural embolic event may be recognized at the time of the procedure on completion imaging that shows a new filling defect or loss of outflow vessels. Early recognition provides an opportunity to immediately address the problem, with the goal of minimizing negative clinical effects, which can often be accomplished using endovascular means. Embolization related to instrumentation can also occur in a delayed manner after the intervention has been completed. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2914646862\"><span class=\"h3\">Arterial closure devices</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A variety of arterial closure devices (suture-mediated closure, metal clip-mediated closure, collagen or other soluble plugs) can be used at the end of endovascular procedures, usually with good results [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/embolism-to-the-lower-extremities/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. Vessel thrombosis <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> distal embolization are potential complications of these devices, with embolization occurring infrequently (&lt;1 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/embolism-to-the-lower-extremities/abstract/16-18\" class=\"abstract_t\">16-18</a>]. </p><p>Such complications are usually related to an unrecognized maldeployment of the device such that an external component is deployed within the vessel wall or intraluminally. Although the component is generally designed to dissolve over time, the timeframe is usually over weeks to months. Any narrowing of the vessel causing ischemia will usually need to be addressed sooner. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H669299776\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL PRESENTATIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The clinical presentation of lower extremity embolization varies depending upon the source of the thrombus, the size of the embolic debris, and the ability of the extremity to compensate for reduced flow related to the obstruction, which varies by the location of the obstruction. Some clinical presentations increase suspicion for certain etiologies. Coexisting peripheral artery disease may alter the manner in which an embolic event presents.</p><p>Emboli tend to lodge at arterial branch points where the caliber of vessels changes or at a site of narrowing from a preexisting atherosclerotic plaque. In one of the largest series on embolic disease, lower extremity emboli accounted for 63 percent of events, with the femoral artery affected most commonly (28 percent), followed by the aortoiliac segment (18 percent), and then the popliteal segment (17 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/embolism-to-the-lower-extremities/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3282444174\"><span class=\"h2\">Acute limb ischemia</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The working definition of acute limb ischemia is based on the 2007 Inter-Society Consensus for the Management of Peripheral Arterial Disease (TASC II), which describes acute limb ischemia as &quot;a quickly developing or sudden decrease in limb perfusion, usually producing new or worsening symptoms or signs, and often threatening limb viability&quot; [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/embolism-to-the-lower-extremities/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. The duration of symptoms that distinguishes acute from chronic limb ischemia is defined as &lt;2 weeks [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/embolism-to-the-lower-extremities/abstract/21-23\" class=\"abstract_t\">21-23</a>]. </p><p>Emboli from cardiac sources or paradoxical emboli tend to lodge in larger arteries and tend to occur in individuals without peripheral artery disease. Symptoms are sudden and rapidly progressive. The severity of the initial presentation corresponds to the degree of urgency needed for treatment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/embolism-to-the-lower-extremities/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H874203818\"><span class=\"h2\">Blue toe syndrome</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Digital ischemia with intact large vessel circulation, also called the &quot;blue toe&rdquo; syndrome, is a variation of acute limb ischemia, except that the size of the embolic material is small enough to travel into the end arteries [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/embolism-to-the-lower-extremities/abstract/24,25\" class=\"abstract_t\">24,25</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=embolism-from-atherosclerotic-plaque-atheroembolism-cholesterol-crystal-embolism#H120148342\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Embolism from atherosclerotic plaque: Atheroembolism (cholesterol crystal embolism)&quot;, section on 'Blue toe syndrome'</a>.)</p><p>The patient will often have intact pedal pulses, but there is inadequate circulation to the individual toe(s). In patients who do not have concomitant neuropathy or other sensory deficits, this condition is extremely painful. The toe will often become discolored, hence this syndrome's moniker. The clinical course after the acute insult varies, sometimes with complete resolution, other times with chronic <span class=\"nowrap\">pain/nerve</span> damage but with preservation of the toe, and at other times with progression to gangrene and need for toe amputation. Unless extensive, there is minimal threat of major (above-ankle) amputation. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1706523702\"><span class=\"h2\">Subclinical progression to chronic ischemia</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In contrast to acute limb ischemia, repeated emboli to the lower extremities can manifest with a stepwise deterioration of distal arterial flow from individual embolic events that have either no or mild symptoms. </p><p>Disruption of the lower extremity outflow circulation can become sufficiently severe to cause rest pain or tissue loss. The resultant clinical presentation is similar to chronic peripheral artery disease but with an embolic rather than atherosclerotic or other etiology [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/embolism-to-the-lower-extremities/abstract/26,27\" class=\"abstract_t\">26,27</a>].

A systematic approach is used to avoid missing potential embolic sources that can lead to recurrent embolism. The extent and timing of the clinical evaluation largely depends on the nature of the clinical presentation. (See <a href=\"#H669299776\" class=\"local\">'Clinical presentations'</a> above.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For acute limb ischemia, management of the limb takes priority over determining the source of the embolus. The evaluation focuses primarily on what is necessary to make appropriate treatment decisions, namely determining clinical severity, defining the anatomy, and identifying comorbidities that may influence treatment. Identifying the suspected embolic source may need to be deferred until after treatment is begun. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For other presentations (eg, subclinical progression, blue toe syndrome), acute treatment options may be limited, and the emphasis is on preventing future embolic events. </p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1859388065\"><span class=\"h2\">History and physical</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The history should evaluate risk factors associated with lower extremity embolism. (See <a href=\"#H2939549419\" class=\"local\">'Etiology'</a> above.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A history of atrial fibrillation, valve replacement, structural heart defects, or known valvular problems may point toward a potential cardiac source, but it must be kept in mind that for some people, cardiac disease may be undiagnosed. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients who are anticoagulated, it is important to identify the reason for anticoagulation and whether the medication is being taken regularly and as prescribed, as well as when the last dose was taken. For patients taking <a href=\"topic.htm?path=warfarin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">warfarin</a> for atrial fibrillation, a nontherapeutic international normalized ratio (INR) increases the risk for embolization. In a Veterans Administration study of over 34,000 patients with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation, low INR (&lt;2.0) increased the risk for systemic embolization (relative risk 6.3; 95% CI 4.4-8.9) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/embolism-to-the-lower-extremities/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients with a history of peripheral artery disease, it is important to determine the baseline symptoms, which may help determine the acuity of the current symptoms and, after treatment, whether there has been a return to baseline. For patients with diabetes, a history of any baseline neurologic deficits is important.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For the patient with a known history of aneurysmal disease or a family history of aneurysms, it is important to consider all potential aneurysm sites. Aneurysm in one location increases the risk for aneurysms in other locations. Patients with an abdominal aortic aneurysm have a prevalence of approximately 20 percent for popliteal aneurysms, many of which may not be easily detected on physical exam [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/embolism-to-the-lower-extremities/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. Up to 80 percent of patients with one peripheral aneurysm have multiple aneurysms, and in patients with a popliteal aneurysm, the incidences of aortoiliac and bilateral popliteal aneurysms are approximately 60 and 50 percent, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/embolism-to-the-lower-extremities/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The patient should also be asked about any recent catheterization procedures.</p><p/><p>A thorough examination evaluates for signs of acute limb ischemia (six Ps) and any signs of chronic limb ischemia. For the lower extremity, this involves evaluating the femoral, popliteal, dorsalis pedis, and posterior tibial pulses bilaterally. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-acute-lower-extremity-ischemia#H403210236\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical features and diagnosis of acute lower extremity ischemia&quot;, section on 'Six Ps'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=embolism-from-atherosclerotic-plaque-atheroembolism-cholesterol-crystal-embolism#H6\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Embolism from atherosclerotic plaque: Atheroembolism (cholesterol crystal embolism)&quot;, section on 'Clinical manifestations'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-lower-extremity-peripheral-artery-disease#H380413346\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical features and diagnosis of lower extremity peripheral artery disease&quot;, section on 'Physical examination'</a>.)</p><p>Often in acute presentations, the history and physical examination may be all that is necessary to guide therapy. As an example, an absent femoral pulse in the affected extremity but a normal or near-normal pulse examination in the unaffected extremity in a patient with an appropriate history (eg, atrial fibrillation) may be all that is needed to proceed to embolectomy.

The patient will at least be started on anticoagulation and has a high likelihood of being administered iodinated contrast for catheter-based arteriography or computed tomographic (CT) angiography at some point during diagnosis and treatment. As such, we obtain a complete blood count, basic metabolic panel, prothrombin <span class=\"nowrap\">time/international</span> normalized ratio <span class=\"nowrap\">(PT/INR),</span> and partial thromboplastin time (PTT). For patients in whom thrombolysis will be considered, a baseline fibrinogen should be included with the coagulation profile. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3487041672\"><span class=\"h2\">Vascular imaging</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Whether or not to proceed with vascular imaging depends upon the suspected cause, physical findings, and the severity of ischemia. For patients with acute lower extremity embolism, the history and physical examination may be sufficient to provide the diagnosis and to initiate treatment. Whenever feasible, we suggest obtaining CT angiography because it provides valuable information about the location of embolic debris (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RADIOL%2F98593\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef98593 \">image 1</a>) and the amount and location of baseline atherosclerotic plaque burden, and it will detect aneurysmal disease. Even in the setting of acute limb ischemia, CT angiography can usually be quickly accomplished while preparing the patient for intervention. The information gained from CT angiography may also be helpful for deciding whether to pursue open surgery or catheter-based intervention as well as aiding with the specifics of the chosen approach. As an example, if an open approach would be favored, then arterial puncture for angiography, which comes with its own risks, can be avoided. The benefits of CT angiography must be weighed against any potential risks (eg, treatment delays, worsening renal function). </p><p>The objective is to obtain good imaging of the lower extremity vasculature as well as the abdominal and pelvic inflow. Although complete vascular imaging would be desirable, it is often very difficult to get good-quality images of the chest, abdomen, pelvis, and bilateral lower extremities with a single contrast bolus. In this setting, evaluation of the chest can be deferred until the postoperative period, if still needed. (See <a href=\"#H54123214\" class=\"local\">'Subsequent diagnostic evaluation'</a> below.)</p><p>Magnetic resonance (MR) angiography has limitations when evaluating acute embolic disease, one of which is the additional time needed to complete the study. The extent of calcium within the walls of the vessels is particularly relevant for deciding the best way to obtain proximal and distal control of the artery during open surgery. Calcium is poorly visualized, and the spatial resolution may also be limited for evaluating ulcerative plaques or irregular atheroma, but this can vary by available equipment and protocols. &#160;</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4231402507\"><span class=\"h1\">INITIAL MANAGEMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Initial management of acute embolism to the lower extremities includes systemic anticoagulation and intravenous fluid therapy, which can be started while awaiting evaluation by a specialist trained to treat the lower extremity embolic event (typically a vascular surgeon). Medical risk assessment, which may require consultation with medicine or cardiology services, should also be initiated to aid in selecting the best option for treatment. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2716525458\"><span class=\"h2\">Anticoagulation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Systemic anticoagulation (intravenous heparin bolus followed by continuous intravenous heparin infusion), along with intravenous fluid therapy (as needed), should be initiated as soon as the diagnosis of embolism is made on clinical grounds, and before subsequent imaging [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/embolism-to-the-lower-extremities/abstract/20,32\" class=\"abstract_t\">20,32</a>]. Patients should remain anticoagulated and monitored for progression of ischemia throughout any vascular imaging. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=heparin-and-lmw-heparin-dosing-and-adverse-effects#H4\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Heparin and LMW heparin: Dosing and adverse effects&quot;, section on 'Dosing and monitoring'</a>.)</p><p>Anticoagulation prevents further propagation of thrombus and inhibits thrombosis distally in the arterial and venous systems due to low flow and stasis. Anticoagulation may result in clinical improvements that may decrease the threat to the limb as collaterals open up and vasospasm improves, possibly allowing more time for evaluation and treatment. </p><p>For some patients, systemic anticoagulation alone may serve as definitive treatment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/embolism-to-the-lower-extremities/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>]. This strategy may be useful for very-high-risk patients with viable limbs and some with marginally threatened limbs who have numerous comorbidities or more pressing medical issues. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H130613753\"><span class=\"h2\">Medical risk assessment</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The majority of patients with lower extremity embolism have underlying cardiovascular disease. The severity of any underlying cardiac condition(s) may increase the risk of treatment and limit the options available for restoring blood flow to the ischemic extremity. When time allows, preoperative cardiac evaluation should be included in the management of these patients to assess surgical risk. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-of-cardiac-risk-prior-to-noncardiac-surgery\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation of cardiac risk prior to noncardiac surgery&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-cardiac-risk-for-noncardiac-surgery\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of cardiac risk for noncardiac surgery&quot;</a>.)</p><p>For patients who require emergency revascularization, a baseline electrocardiogram, chest radiography, and a clinical history of the patient's level of activity (ie, whether or not the patient can perform &gt;4 metabolic equivalents) help stratify risk. An echocardiogram can usually be obtained following revascularization; however, if thrombolytic therapy is being considered, obtaining an echocardiogram beforehand is useful to evaluate for mural thrombus. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1832097577\"><span class=\"h1\">APPROACH TO LIMB MANAGEMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>While embolism to the lower extremities has a variety of potential causes as well as treatment strategies, the approach to limb management strongly depends on the clinical presentation, particularly the severity of limb ischemia at presentation (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F75112\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef75112 \">table 1</a>) and duration of symptoms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/embolism-to-the-lower-extremities/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H3222622295\" class=\"local\">'Classification of ischemia'</a> above.)</p><p>Other factors that may play into decision making include the etiology and anatomy of the embolic occlusion, runoff quality below the occlusion, patient comorbidities, prior operations, endovascular device availability, and contingency plans in the event of treatment failure. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3439932503\"><span class=\"h2\">By severity of acute ischemia</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1388227119\"><span class=\"h3\">Viable or marginally threatened extremity</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>For most patients with a viable or marginally threatened extremity, based upon the outcomes of several randomized trials, we agree with major society guidelines that support an initial attempt at thrombolysis for appropriately selected patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/embolism-to-the-lower-extremities/abstract/22,32,34-36\" class=\"abstract_t\">22,32,34-36</a>]. For viable limbs, treatment can usually be approached urgently rather than as an emergency. </p><p>Clinical features that are useful for determining whether thrombolysis or surgical revascularization is the most appropriate initial treatment include the following:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Presumed etiology</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Lesion location and length</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Duration of symptoms</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Suitability of the patient for surgery</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Availability of autologous vein for bypass grafting</p><p/><p>As examples, proximal thrombus (eg, aortoiliac, common femoral artery) may be more amenable to thrombectomy. On the other hand, an embolus to a distal vessel (eg, tibial artery) may be best treated with thrombolysis. In general, older thrombus (eg, from aneurysm sac) does not respond well to thrombolysis, and thrombolysis has no effect on nonthrombotic material, so if either is strongly suspected, surgery may be the preferred treatment. In patients who have previously undergone surgery, reoperative fields can make surgical exposure more difficult, increasing the risk for complications. In addition, peripheral artery disease can make an embolectomy more challenging. High-grade stenoses can make it difficult to pass embolectomy catheters, and calcified plaque tends to pop the embolectomy balloon. Arterial dissection can also occur from the catheter passing behind the plaque. Passing an embolectomy through a recent stent or vascular anastomosis increases the risk of dislodging the stent or rupturing the vessel. </p><p>Thrombolysis is generally a safe and effective alternative to surgery for appropriately selected patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/embolism-to-the-lower-extremities/abstract/37,38\" class=\"abstract_t\">37,38</a>]. However, failure of thrombolysis can lead to progression of ischemia to a higher degree of limb threat that may necessitate conversion to immediate surgical revascularization to reduce the risk of limb loss. Although the success of thrombolytic therapy may be limited by the time required to dissolve thrombus and severity and duration of ischemia, when subsequent revascularization is needed, the magnitude and complexity of the procedure is frequently less for those receiving compared with not receiving prior thrombolytic therapy. (See <a href=\"#H3605128928\" class=\"local\">'By etiology/anatomy'</a> below and <a href=\"#H2723390259\" class=\"local\">'Intra-arterial thrombolysis'</a> below and <a href=\"#H2287840559\" class=\"local\">'Open embolectomy'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2468998411\"><span class=\"h3\">Immediately threatened extremity</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>For most patients with an immediately threatened extremity, surgical revascularization is the most appropriate initial treatment. (See <a href=\"#H2287840559\" class=\"local\">'Open embolectomy'</a> below.)</p><p>Patients with an immediately threatened limb are generally not good candidates for thrombolysis. Although pharmacologic thrombolysis may successfully dissolve the embolus, the time required is usually too long for it to be an acceptable alternative to surgery. Progression to an unsalvageable limb can occur in as little as four to six hours if prompt revascularization is not performed. Thus, open embolectomy is preferred; however, some clinicians may initiate thrombolysis in selected clinical circumstances, such as if the neurologic deficits are mild and open revascularization represents an excessive risk for the patient. If thrombolysis is to be considered at all, the limb needs be closely monitored to identify any signs of deterioration, which can happen quickly. In addition, there needs to be expedient operating room availability in the event of clinical worsening to convert emergently to open surgical revascularization for appropriate candidates. </p><p>Depending upon the duration and severity of the ischemia, a fasciotomy may be required to prevent the development of compartment syndrome following reperfusion. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acute-compartment-syndrome-of-the-extremities\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Acute compartment syndrome of the extremities&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lower-extremity-fasciotomy-techniques\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Lower extremity fasciotomy techniques&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2576070893\"><span class=\"h3\">Nonviable extremity</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients with nonviable extremities should undergo prompt amputation. Vascular imaging prior to surgery is usually not necessary, since the level of amputation is determined by clinical findings and by the viability of tissues at the time of surgery. Every effort should be made to preserve as many joints as possible to decrease the work of ambulating with a prosthetic, which improves the likelihood for successful rehabilitation. Delays in amputation of a nonviable extremity can result in infection, myoglobinuria, acute renal failure, and hyperkalemia. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lower-extremity-amputation\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Lower extremity amputation&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=techniques-for-lower-extremity-amputation\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Techniques for lower extremity amputation&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3605128928\"><span class=\"h2\">By etiology/anatomy</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Suspected cardiac source &ndash; Emboli from cardiac sources tend to be large and lodge at the bifurcations of major lower extremity vessels, such as the common femoral artery or aortic bifurcation. These patients often do not have underlying vascular disease, present without a femoral pulse on the affected side, and have a normal vascular exam on the contralateral side. These findings may be all that is needed prior to going to the operating room. In this setting, open embolectomy is generally the best procedure, given that these emboli are often are too large to aspirate and may have limited response to thrombolysis, though exceptions may exist. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Distal vessel <span class=\"nowrap\">occlusion/thrombosis</span> &ndash; For patients who have little to no flow in the distal vessels on initial arteriography, we suggest thrombolysis to improve outflow. Occlusion of the distal vessels can be the direct result of embolization or can be due to low flow from a more proximally lodged embolus. The outflow may thrombose to the extent that no suitable target is available for revascularization on initial arteriography. Clearing distal thrombus may reveal treatment options that were not apparent on initial arteriography, improving options for subsequent open <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> endovascular treatment. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients whose history suggests that the embolic material is chronic thrombus (eg, mural thrombus from aneurysm, aortic thrombus) or nonthrombotic material (eg, tumor, embolized device fragments), open embolectomy or transcatheter embolectomy are better options compared with thrombolysis as these materials are not likely to or simply will not respond to thrombolytic agents. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients with recurrent embolism leading to subclinical progression, the suspected embolic source needs to be found and treated. Revascularization is performed as needed based upon clinical symptoms and anatomy, similar to the approach for chronic peripheral artery disease. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-chronic-limb-threatening-ischemia\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of chronic limb-threatening ischemia&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Embolization during intervention &ndash; When distal embolization occurs during a peripheral intervention, it is ideally identified at the index procedure and treated in the same setting. This can often be done by aspirating the embolic material through a catheter (using a guiding catheter or specifically designed catheter for removing emboli). Sometimes, applying low doses of tissue plasminogen activator (tPA; 2 to 4 mg) through the catheter into the affected vessel can dissolve the embolized material, particularly when embolus is very distal. Rarely, in larger vessels it may be necessary to place a stent to trap the embolized material against the vessel wall to preserve luminal flow. (See <a href=\"#H2196186441\" class=\"local\">'Transcatheter embolectomy'</a> below and <a href=\"#H2723390259\" class=\"local\">'Intra-arterial thrombolysis'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Blue toe syndrome &ndash; The treatment of blue toe syndrome is predominantly medical, so it is important to recognize it when it occurs; otherwise, the patient could be subjected to treatments that are ineffective.

Severe complications of thrombolysis include intracranial hemorrhage, which has high mortality, and major gastrointestinal bleeding, which is potentially life-threatening.</p><p>Thrombolytic therapy can be initiated in a hybrid operating room suite, a standard operating room with portable C-arm capabilities, or an interventional suite. Whenever thrombolysis is performed, it is important to have an operating room available in the event that ischemia progresses during thrombolysis, the treatment fails, or bleeding occurs that requires operative intervention. </p><p>A Cochrane review that included five trials evaluated the best approach to thrombolytic therapy when this form of treatment is chosen [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/embolism-to-the-lower-extremities/abstract/39,40\" class=\"abstract_t\">39,40</a>]. Comparisons were available between tissue plasminogen activator (tPA), streptokinase, and urokinase. This review concluded that intra-arterial tPA may be more effective at improving patency compared with intra-arterial streptokinase [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/embolism-to-the-lower-extremities/abstract/40,41\" class=\"abstract_t\">40,41</a>]. Three other studies comparing tPA and urokinase found that although intra-arterial tPA led to more rapid initial lysis, these agents appeared to be equally effective in terms of treated vessel patency, and no significant differences were found for rates of limb salvage, bleeding complications, or death [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/embolism-to-the-lower-extremities/abstract/42-44\" class=\"abstract_t\">42-44</a>]. For urokinase, higher dose (8 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/hour</span> versus 2 or 4 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/hour)</span> and forced infusion techniques resulted in more rapid thrombolysis, but bleeding risk appeared to be increased, and clinical outcomes were no different [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/embolism-to-the-lower-extremities/abstract/45\" class=\"abstract_t\">45</a>]. </p><p>Our approach to lower extremity thrombolysis is as follows:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>To obtain access with minimal trauma, which is always important during percutaneous intervention but is particularly so in cases when a thrombolytic agent will be infused, we recommend ultrasound guidance to assist arterial puncture to ensure a single stick into the artery (typically common femoral) and to avoid puncturing the back wall (ie, a &quot;through-and-through&quot; stick), which increases the likelihood of access site <span class=\"nowrap\">bleeding/hematoma</span>. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Once the access is established and an arterial sheath has been placed, a wire is used to cross the site of thrombosis intraluminally; subintimal passage of wires and catheters should be avoided. The thrombolytic agent is generally infused though a multi-sidehole infusion catheter that is placed over the wire within the extent of the thrombus. The multi-sidehole catheter must be long enough to encompass the length of the involved segment. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Once the catheter has been positioned, we generally bolus 4 to 10 mg of tPA (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=alteplase-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">alteplase</a>) through the catheter on the table and then initiate a drip of 1 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/hour</span> through the catheter with a simultaneous infusion of intravenous heparin (400 <span class=\"nowrap\">units/hour)</span> through the side port of the sheath. After securing the catheters, the patient is transferred to an intensive care unit to monitor the limb for potential worsening limb ischemia, bleeding, compartment syndrome, or other complications (eg, acute neurologic changes). </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We obtain serial labs to monitor for bleeding risk as well as for the possible development of thrombocytopenia or hypofibrinogenemia. We obtain hemoglobin, hematocrit, platelets, partial thromboplastin time, and fibrinogen every six hours. An increased risk for bleeding has been correlated with reduced fibrinogen levels after intravenous stroke thrombolysis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/embolism-to-the-lower-extremities/abstract/46\" class=\"abstract_t\">46</a>]; however, in a review of catheter-directed intra-arterial or intravenous thrombolysis, there were no differences in major bleeding events when comparing patients with low (&lt;150 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL)</span> versus higher fibrinogen levels [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/embolism-to-the-lower-extremities/abstract/47\" class=\"abstract_t\">47</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For fibrinogen &lt;200 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL,</span> we generally reduce the rate of infusion by one-half, and if the fibrinogen falls below 150 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL,</span> we hold the infusion for one hour, and then recheck fibrinogen levels. If fibrinogen levels are low and there is concern for bleeding, fresh frozen plasma or cryoprecipitate can be transfused, but this is rarely needed. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For evidence of significant bleeding, the infusion is stopped. Low-dose heparinized saline can generally be continued to prevent rethrombosis of clot that has already lysed. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The need for ongoing infusion, possible repositioning of the catheter, or another course of therapy is determined by repeat arteriography (daily or in response to clinical changes). If needed, the infusion can be continued up to two to three days, as long as the extremity is not threatened. </p><p/><p>Pharmacomechanical thrombolysis involves the additional use of some sort of mechanical force to assist in breaking up the clot. The mechanism differs among the various devices and includes pulsed spray, rotating wire, ultrasound energy, or other mechanisms to break up the thrombus [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/embolism-to-the-lower-extremities/abstract/48,49\" class=\"abstract_t\">48,49</a>]. The segment being treated is generally also initially laced with a thrombolytic agent. Some devices can also be used as a mechanical thrombectomy device alone, if there are contraindications to thrombolysis. The goal of pharmacomechanical thrombolysis is to reduce the overall thrombolysis time as well as overall dose of the lytic agent. Some advocate using a distal filter when performing pharmacomechanical thrombolysis to prevent propagation of smaller emboli distally, while others would manage such events with either catheter thrombectomy or infusion of intra-arterial thrombolysis. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2287840559\"><span class=\"h2\">Open embolectomy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>One of the main advantages of open embolectomy is that blood flow is generally restored quite quickly. However, revascularization may be accompanied by adverse cardiac events due to sudden release of acid and potassium from the ischemic tissue.</p><p>For patients with large emboli that lodge <span class=\"nowrap\">at/near</span> the femoral bifurcation, an open embolectomy is an expedient solution that can be performed on almost any patient. If comorbidities increase the risk for general anesthesia, a femoral cutdown and embolectomy can be performed under regional or local anesthesia. </p><p>Either a transverse or longitudinal incision can be made over the common femoral artery. If the vessel is soft and healthy, a transverse arteriotomy is made for embolectomy, which prevents luminal narrowing on repair. If the artery is diseased, we generally prefer to use the longitudinal incision because it provides greater flexibility for additional exposure if a concomitant endarterectomy and patch angioplasty becomes necessary. </p><p>From the single arteriotomy, Fogarty balloon catheters can be passed proximally into the iliac artery and distally into the superficial and deep femoral arteries, and often down to the popliteal artery. A #5 Fogarty is often sufficient for the common femoral and iliac arteries, and a #4 Fogarty is typically used in the superficial femoral artery, although smaller or larger catheters may be necessary as the circumstances dictate. To embolectomize down to the popliteal artery from the groin, a #3 Fogarty catheter will often be necessary. Once strong inflow and backbleeding are obtained with clean passes of the Fogarty embolectomy catheters, intraoperative completion arteriography is performed to evaluate the adequacy of distal blood flow. Intraoperative administration of a thrombolytic agent directly into the distal vessels may be necessary if small emboli are still present in the runoff vessels. </p><p>If needed, additional exposures of the below-knee popliteal artery at the tibial trifurcation <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> distal <span class=\"nowrap\">tibial/pedal</span> vessels can be used to ensure adequate flow. Passing embolectomy catheters into tibial vessels requires extreme care as these vessels are easily injured. A #2 Fogarty is generally used for tibial vessels. Very distal thrombus can sometimes be treated with localized intra-arterial tPA injection. Spasm of otherwise healthy vessels or dissection of the arteries can occur with embolectomy. If spasm is suspected, intra-arterial administration of a vasodilator such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nitroglycerin-glyceryl-trinitrate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">nitroglycerin</a> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=papaverine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">papaverine</a> will often resolve the issue. If a dissection is flow limiting, angioplasty <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> stenting may be required. </p><p>If embolectomy fails, bypass grafting may become necessary, although for purely embolic events without baseline peripheral artery disease, this is rarely necessary. For immediately threatened limbs, prosthetic graft (ie, polytetrafluoroethylene [PTFE]) is often chosen to avoid the time needed for vein harvest, which expedites restoration of blood flow with the tradeoff of decreased expected patency. Individual surgeons need to weigh the risks and benefits for each patient based on the clinical scenario. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2196186441\"><span class=\"h2\">Transcatheter embolectomy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Techniques have been developed for using guiding catheters to engage thrombus and directly aspirate embolus that occurs, primarily during an intervention.

These are particularly useful for cases of intraprocedural embolization of <span class=\"nowrap\">plaque/thrombus</span> large enough to lodge in major runoff vessels or in cases where there is a contraindication to the use of thrombolytic agents. In addition, a device based on the same system that has been used for neuro-rescue in acute strokes is also available with catheter sizes and lengths for treating lower extremity emboli, even those occurring distally [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/embolism-to-the-lower-extremities/abstract/50\" class=\"abstract_t\">50</a>].

Compared with open procedures, the general advantages include less pain, faster recovery time, and less perioperative morbidity and mortality. A combination of open and endovascular approaches can sometimes be used to treat multiple areas suspected to be sources of embolus [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/embolism-to-the-lower-extremities/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. </p><p>Endovascular stent grafts have been used to exclude thoracic or abdominal aortic and popliteal sources of lower extremity embolization. At all sites, adequate sealing above and below the affected area is necessary. When a stent-graft is used to cover an area that is suspected of having been an embolic source, it is important to avoid manipulations that may cause intraprocedural embolization.

However, it is clear that, in spite of optimal therapy, acute embolism is associated with high rates of morbidity and mortality [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/embolism-to-the-lower-extremities/abstract/55,56\" class=\"abstract_t\">55,56</a>].

A majority of amputations are above the knee. </p><p>Cardiopulmonary complications account for the majority of the deaths, underscoring the severity of the baseline medical condition of the typical patient. Approximately 15 to 20 percent of patients die within one year after presentation, usually from the medical illnesses that predisposed them to acute limb ischemia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/embolism-to-the-lower-extremities/abstract/60\" class=\"abstract_t\">60</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1384067372\"><span class=\"h1\">SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Clinical manifestations of acute embolism to the lower extremities can range from isolated digital ischemia to profound acute global limb ischemia. Some patients will experience a subclinical progressive loss of outflow vessels from recurrent embolism leading to a chronic peripheral artery disease (PAD)-like picture. (See <a href=\"#H669299776\" class=\"local\">'Clinical presentations'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A variety of etiologies can potentially lead to embolization of the lower extremities, and understanding these should guide an efficient and thorough clinical evaluation, treatment, and source control. (See <a href=\"#H2939549419\" class=\"local\">'Etiology'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The history and physical examination may be sufficient to determine the most likely etiology and to initiate treatment. Whenever feasible, we suggest obtaining computed tomographic (CT) angiography because it provides valuable information about the location of the disease and level of baseline atherosclerotic plaque burden. Even in the setting of acute limb ischemia, CT angiography can usually be quickly accomplished while preparing the patient for intervention, but imaging can be deferred if it will delay treatment. (See <a href=\"#H3487041672\" class=\"local\">'Vascular imaging'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For those who present with acute limb ischemia, anticoagulation with a heparin drip and intravenous fluid therapy should be immediately initiated prior to making plans for intervention. These can be started while awaiting evaluation by a specialist trained to treat the embolic event. (See <a href=\"#H4231402507\" class=\"local\">'Initial management'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Options for managing lower extremity embolism include open embolectomy, thrombolysis, and transcatheter thrombectomy. Factors such as anatomy, degree of limb threat, runoff, suspected etiology, and patient factors will guide the choice of one over the other. (See <a href=\"#H1832097577\" class=\"local\">'Approach to limb management'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>For patients without a femoral pulse who have a normal vascular exam on the contralateral side, open embolectomy is generally the best procedure, though exceptions may exist. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>For patients who have embolized or thrombosed their tibial runoff, initial thrombolytic therapy may improve outflow, leading to better options for open <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> endovascular treatment. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>For patients whose history suggests that the embolic material is chronic thrombus (eg, mural thrombus from aneurysm, aortic thrombus) or nonthrombotic material (eg, tumor, embolized device fragments), open embolectomy or transcatheter embolectomy are better options compared with thrombolysis. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Once the acute limb issues have been attended to, the subsequent diagnostic evaluation is focused on identifying the suspected embolic source, typically using echocardiography or additional vascular imaging. Once the source is known, additional intervention to remove or exclude the source from the circulation is generally preferred over anticoagulation alone. For patients with coronary heart disease equivalents, treatment with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aspirin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">aspirin</a> and statins should be a component of their medical therapy.
