Acidemia (as opposed to acidosis) is defined as a low arterial pH (&lt;7.35), which can result from a metabolic acidosis, respiratory acidosis, or both. Not all patients with metabolic acidosis have a low arterial pH; the pH and hydrogen ion concentration also depend upon the coexistence of other acid-base disorders. Thus, the pH in a patient with metabolic acidosis may be low, high, or normal.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1759297906\"><span class=\"h2\">Pathogenesis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Metabolic acidosis can be produced by three major mechanisms.

The normal anion gap metabolic acidoses must, by definition, manifest hyperchloremia (relative to the sodium concentration).

As ketoacidosis resolves, metabolism of the ketoacid anions results in regeneration of the bicarbonate that was lost in the initial buffering reaction. Thus, if these ketoacid anions are lost into the urine before they can be metabolized, they represent lost potential bicarbonate. The effect of these urinary losses is that most patients with diabetic ketoacidosis develop a normal anion gap metabolic acidosis following insulin therapy. Similarly, the loss of sodium and potassium lactate into the urine also represents loss of potential bicarbonate.

However, movement of bicarbonate into the extracellular fluid from intracellular and bone buffers and the binding of hydrogen ions by proteins such as albumin and hemoglobin largely mitigate the fall in serum bicarbonate caused by volume expansion. In an animal model, for example, the fall in serum bicarbonate was only 10 percent (eg, from 24 to 22 <span class=\"nowrap\">mEq/L)</span> despite a 28 percent expansion of the extracellular volume with isotonic saline [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-adult-with-metabolic-acidosis/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. Thus, dilution acidosis is not likely to produce a marked metabolic acidosis unless an extraordinarily large volume of alkali-free isotonic fluid is infused [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-adult-with-metabolic-acidosis/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h1\">DIAGNOSIS AND EVALUATION</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1759298153\"><span class=\"h2\">Diagnosis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A metabolic acidosis is diagnosed when the serum pH is reduced and the serum bicarbonate concentration is abnormally low (often defined as &lt;22 <span class=\"nowrap\">mEq/L,</span> but the threshold may vary across clinical laboratories).</p><p>When a simple metabolic acidosis exists, the serum pH and bicarbonate concentration will both be reduced. Although both measurements may be needed, under many clinical circumstances, the diagnosis can be made on the basis of a reduced bicarbonate concentration alone (provided that chronic respiratory alkalosis can be ruled out on clinical grounds). The lower normal range limit for a peripheral venous bicarbonate measurement is generally 22 <span class=\"nowrap\">mEq/L,</span> but this may vary among different laboratories.</p><p>However, if metabolic acidosis coexists with respiratory acidosis or metabolic alkalosis, then the serum bicarbonate may be normal or elevated. The bicarbonate concentration, serum pH, and other electrolyte measurements will often be required to correctly diagnose such complicated mixed acid-base disorders. In such patients, a metabolic acidosis is diagnosed when the serum bicarbonate is lower than it should be, even if the value falls within the normal range. This issue is discussed in detail elsewhere but can be illustrated here. Suppose a patient with chronic respiratory acidosis, characterized by hypercapnia and a compensatory rise in the serum bicarbonate concentration, develops diarrhea. The loss of bicarbonate in the stool will lower the serum bicarbonate concentration and produce a metabolic acidosis, but the serum bicarbonate concentration may still be within or above the &quot;normal&quot; range since the baseline value may have been very high. In this setting, metabolic acidosis is defined as a serum bicarbonate concentration that is lower than the expected compensation for the degree of chronic hypercapnia (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEPH%2F79833\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef79833 \">figure 1</a>). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=simple-and-mixed-acid-base-disorders#H12584090\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Simple and mixed acid-base disorders&quot;, section on 'Respiratory acidosis'</a>.)</p><p>It is important to recognize that the evaluation of an acid-base disorder often occurs at a single point in time. If the previous (or &quot;baseline&quot;) acid-base parameters are not known, then the single set of values can be misinterpreted. Whenever a series of laboratory results are available, the analysis should consider the changes that occurred over time.

Although some believe that this analysis may be helpful in certain unusual settings, we and others prefer an approach based upon the serum pH, HCO<sub>3</sub>, pCO<sub>2</sub>, and anion gap (corrected for albumin concentration) because it is much simpler and adequate in the vast majority of circumstances [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-adult-with-metabolic-acidosis/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].

These issues are discussed elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=serum-anion-gap-in-conditions-other-than-metabolic-acidosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Serum anion gap in conditions other than metabolic acidosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1759298245\"><span class=\"h3\">Measurement of the arterial pH and pCO2</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Measurement of the serum bicarbonate concentration alone may not be sufficient since a low serum bicarbonate concentration can reflect a primary metabolic acidosis or, alternatively, the compensatory response to a primary respiratory alkalosis. If the patient has a simple metabolic acidosis, rather than metabolic compensation for a respiratory alkalosis, then the arterial pH should be low. In contrast, if the patient has a mixed disorder consisting of a metabolic acidosis plus an alkalosis (respiratory, metabolic, or both), then the arterial pH may not be low and can even be elevated. Venous pH, rather than arterial pH, may be utilized in most clinical circumstances. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=venous-blood-gases-and-other-alternatives-to-arterial-blood-gases\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Venous blood gases and other alternatives to arterial blood gases&quot;</a>.)</p><p>However, blood gas measurement is not mandatory in all cases. In the appropriate clinical setting, the diagnosis of metabolic acidosis may be readily apparent (ie, lactic acidosis with shock, hyperchloremic acidosis with diarrhea, ketoacidosis with uncontrolled type 1 diabetes, etc). An arterial blood gas is necessary to determine the presence of a primary respiratory disorder or to accurately determine the degree of respiratory compensation for metabolic disorders.

The reduction in the serum bicarbonate and pH caused by the metabolic acidosis results in hyperventilation and a reduction of the pCO<sub>2</sub>. The Henderson-Hasselbalch equation shows that the pH is determined by the ratio between the HCO<sub>3</sub> concentration and pCO<sub>2</sub>. Thus, this fall in pCO<sub>2</sub> will partially mitigate the fall in pH caused by a reduced HCO<sub>3</sub>.</p><p>In all <strong>simple</strong> acid-base disorders, the primary abnormality will cause a compensatory response such that the HCO<sub>3</sub> concentration and pCO<sub>2</sub> will move in the same direction (either both will increase or both will decrease). These directional changes will always act to return the pH toward the normal range [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-adult-with-metabolic-acidosis/abstract/3,8,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,8,9</a>]. The compensatory responses are mediated at least in part by parallel alterations in pH within cells of the renal tubules or respiratory center [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-adult-with-metabolic-acidosis/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=simple-and-mixed-acid-base-disorders\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Simple and mixed acid-base disorders&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The respiratory compensation for metabolic acidosis generates a reproducible and relatively linear relationship between the arterial pCO<sub>2</sub> and bicarbonate concentration. This respiratory response to metabolic acidosis begins within the first 30 minutes and is complete by 12 to 24 hours. In addition, the relationship is very similar in all forms of metabolic acidosis (ie, lactic acidosis, ketoacidosis, hyperchloremic acidosis caused by diarrhea, etc). In order to determine whether an appropriate compensatory response exists, a variety of acid-base diagrams, charts, nomograms, and mathematical relations have been published. These are discussed elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=simple-and-mixed-acid-base-disorders#H12584056\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Simple and mixed acid-base disorders&quot;, section on 'Metabolic acidosis'</a>.)</p><p>Several mathematical rules are acceptable for clinical use. They include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>pCO<sub>2</sub> = 1.5 x HCO<sub>3</sub> + 8 &plusmn; 2. This equation, which is called Winter&rsquo;s formula, was derived in children, half of whom were between two months and two years of age.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>pCO<sub>2</sub> = HCO<sub>3</sub> + 15.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The pCO<sub>2</sub> should approximate the decimal digits of the arterial pH. As an example, if the pH is 7.25, then the pCO<sub>2</sub> should be approximately 25 mmHg.</p><p/><p>These rules work well for mild to moderately severe metabolic acidosis (HCO<sub>3</sub> between 7 and 22 <span class=\"nowrap\">mEq/L)</span>. For more severe metabolic acidosis (HCO<sub>3</sub> less than 7 <span class=\"nowrap\">mEq/L),</span> the pCO<sub>2</sub> should be maximally reduced to the 8 to 12 mmHg range. As an example, assume the following results are obtained in a patient with metabolic acidosis: pH = 7.30; pCO<sub>2</sub> = 30 mmHg (4.0 kPa); HCO<sub>3</sub> = 15 <span class=\"nowrap\">mEq/L</span>. This is consistent with a simple metabolic acidosis with appropriate respiratory compensation; all three of these mathematical rules presented above are satisfied. It should be noted that these rules should not be used for determining the compensatory response for other acid-base disorders and that the pCO<sub>2</sub> cannot be reduced to less than 8 to 12 mmHg in individuals with normal neuro-respiratory function. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=simple-and-mixed-acid-base-disorders#H12584056\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Simple and mixed acid-base disorders&quot;, section on 'Metabolic acidosis'</a>.)</p><p>An inability to generate an appropriate hyperventilatory response is generally indicative of significant underlying respiratory disease and is diagnostic of a mixed acid-base disorder: metabolic acidosis and respiratory acidosis.

This normal range has decreased over the past several decades because a change in the analytical instruments used to measure Cl resulted in an upward drift in that anion's normal range. Consequently, the normal value for the serum anion gap is now approximately 3 to 10 <span class=\"nowrap\">mEq/L</span> (averaging 6 <span class=\"nowrap\">mEq/L)</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-adult-with-metabolic-acidosis/abstract/10,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,11</a>].

Interpretation of the serum anion gap is most helpful when serial measurements are available from the same laboratory (including baseline values). It is also important to know an individual&rsquo;s usual, or baseline, anion gap. As an example, if a patient normally has an anion gap of 4 <span class=\"nowrap\">mEq/L</span> and it is now 12 <span class=\"nowrap\">mEq/L,</span> then the 8 <span class=\"nowrap\">mEq/L</span> increase in the anion gap is significant despite the fact that the anion gap is still within the &quot;normal&quot; range for a specific laboratory. Unfortunately, baseline data are often unavailable.</p><p>In normal subjects, the major unmeasured anion responsible for the serum anion gap is albumin, which has a net negative charge in the physiologic pH range. As a result, the expected &quot;normal&quot; value for the anion gap must be adjusted downward in patients with hypoalbuminemia.

Potassium is an &quot;unmeasured&quot; cation using the equation that does not include the serum K.

Examples include lactate in lactic acidosis, beta-hydroxybutyrate and acetoacetate in ketoacidosis, formate after methanol ingestion, and multiple acid anions such as sulfate and phosphate in patients with uremic acidosis. Much less commonly, negatively charged proteins such as immunoglobulin A in IgA myeloma or hyperalbuminemia with volume contraction accumulate and raise the anion gap [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-adult-with-metabolic-acidosis/abstract/11,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,13</a>]. Conversely, a decrease in the concentration of unmeasured anions (eg, hypoalbuminemia as noted above) or an increase in the concentration of unmeasured cations (eg, some immunoglobulin G proteins in IgG multiple myeloma) will decrease the anion gap.

Note that, in this oversimplified schema, the magnitude of decrease in HCO<sub>3</sub> matches the magnitude of increase in the lactate concentration and the anion gap. However, this 1:1 relationship between the fall in HCO<sub>3</sub> and rise in serum anion gap does not always occur; the reasons for this are discussed elsewhere.

These unidentified anions may include a number of organic acids generated by the Krebs cycle (citrate, isocitrate, alpha-ketoglutarate, succinate, and malate) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-adult-with-metabolic-acidosis/abstract/14-17\" class=\"abstract_t\">14-17</a>].</p><p>Normal anion gap (hyperchloremic) metabolic acidoses are caused by loss of bicarbonate or the combination of a relatively normal glomerular filtration rate with diminished renal acid excretion. A less commonly encountered cause of normal anion gap metabolic acidosis is the ingestion or infusion of hydrogen chloride or compounds which generate hydrogen chloride (NH<sub>4</sub>Cl, arginine HCl, CaCl<sub>2</sub>). (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Definition and pathogenesis'</a> above.)</p><p>When hydrogen chloride is added to the extracellular fluid space, bicarbonate is replaced on an equimolar basis by chloride.

The loss of such fluid (urine, pancreatic secretions, stool) will contract the extracellular fluid volume &quot;around&quot; a relatively stable quantity of chloride.

Experts disagree about the indications for the use of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sodium-bicarbonate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">sodium bicarbonate</a> or other buffering agents. Some studies indicate that myocardial depression, decreased catecholamine efficacy, and arrhythmias develop when the pH falls below 7.1. However, these data come mainly from animal or tissue experiments. Human studies of the cardiovascular effects of severe acidemia have generally <strong>not</strong> supported these animal experiments. Transient decreases in pH to 6.8 in individuals with diabetic ketoacidosis are not associated with depressed cardiac function [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-adult-with-metabolic-acidosis/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. In addition, raising the pH may have adverse consequences including intracellular acidification, increased lactate production, and myocardial depression. It is, however, important to recognize that, at a pH below 7.1, small changes in pCO<sub>2</sub> or HCO<sub>3</sub> can have very large pH effects. Thus, most clinicians initiate treatment of metabolic acidosis when the bicarbonate is very low and the pH is below 7.1.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Severe and symptomatic acute acidemia can most rapidly be treated by the intravenous administration of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sodium-bicarbonate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">sodium bicarbonate</a> or tris-hydroxymethyl aminomethane (THAM). Despite the potential adverse effects of sodium bicarbonate, it remains the most frequently used alkalinizing agent. Less severe acute metabolic acidosis does not usually require bicarbonate treatment. This is especially the case when &quot;potential&quot; bicarbonate (ie, lactate, ketoacid anions) has been retained and can be converted to bicarbonate when the underlying pathologic derangement has been alleviated or eliminated. Even if the &quot;potential bicarbonate&quot; has been excreted (and a hyperchloremic metabolic acidosis exists), a patient with relatively intact kidney function can restore normal acid-base status in a reasonably short timeframe by excreting <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ammonium-chloride-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ammonium chloride</a> into the urine.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Chronic metabolic acidosis</strong> &ndash; The most common causes of chronic metabolic acidosis are diarrhea, advanced chronic kidney disease, and the various forms of RTA.

When the decision to administer <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sodium-bicarbonate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">sodium bicarbonate</a> is made for a patient with severe acute metabolic acidosis, it is usually accomplished with 50 mL vials of hypertonic NaHCO<sub>3</sub>. They are generally available as 8.4 percent (50 <span class=\"nowrap\">mEq/50</span> mL) or 7.2 percent (44.6 <span class=\"nowrap\">mEq/50</span> mL). If the virtual bicarbonate space (see <a href=\"#H174823155\" class=\"local\">'The virtual bicarbonate distribution space'</a> below) is roughly 50 percent of lean body weight, then one vial will raise the serum HCO<sub>3</sub> concentration by approximately 1.3 to 1.5 <span class=\"nowrap\">mEq/L</span> in a 70 kg patient. Note that this solution is hypertonic (100 <span class=\"nowrap\">mEq/50</span> mL = 2000 <span class=\"nowrap\">mosm/L)</span>. Thus, it will raise the serum sodium concentration and cause movement of water from the intracellular to the extracellular space. If more than two vials are administered, additional free water should be considered to avoid hypernatremia. Alternatively, three vials can be added to 1 liter of 5 percent dextrose to generate an intravenous solution with approximately 150 <span class=\"nowrap\">mEq/L</span> of sodium bicarbonate.</p><p>When chronic alkali treatment is required, options include the sodium or potassium salts of either bicarbonate or a metabolizable anion such as citrate or lactate. The potassium salts are indicated when hypokalemia and total body potassium deficits exist. In general, the initial dose is 50 to 100 mEq per day, which is then titrated up, or down, as required.

Acidemia (as opposed to acidosis) is defined as a low arterial pH (&lt;7.35), which can result from a metabolic acidosis, respiratory acidosis, or both. Not all patients with metabolic acidosis have a low arterial pH; the pH and hydrogen ion concentration also depend upon the coexistence of other acid-base disorders. Thus, the pH in a patient with metabolic acidosis may be low, high, or normal.

When a simple metabolic acidosis exists, the serum pH and bicarbonate concentration will both be reduced. Although both measurements may be needed, under many clinical circumstances the diagnosis can be made on the basis of a reduced bicarbonate concentration alone (provided that chronic respiratory alkalosis can be ruled out on clinical grounds). The lower normal range limit for a peripheral venous bicarbonate measurement is generally 22 <span class=\"nowrap\">mEq/L,</span> but this may vary in different laboratories. However, if metabolic acidosis coexists with respiratory acidosis or metabolic alkalosis, then the serum bicarbonate may be normal or elevated. The bicarbonate concentration, serum pH, and other electrolyte measurements will often be required to correctly diagnose such complicated mixed acid-base disorders. In such patients, a metabolic acidosis is diagnosed when the serum bicarbonate is lower than it should be, even if the value falls within the normal range.
