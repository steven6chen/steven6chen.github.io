Approximately 50 percent of patients already have advanced incurable disease at the time of initial presentation, and even those who undergo potentially curative resection have high rates of distant as well as local recurrence. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=surgical-management-of-invasive-gastric-cancer#H19\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Surgical management of invasive gastric cancer&quot;, section on 'Prognosis'</a>.)</p><p>Palliative treatments for advanced gastric cancer can be either local or systemic. While cytotoxic chemotherapy is the most effective treatment modality for patients with metastatic disease, it is frequently inadequate for palliation of local symptoms, such as nausea, pain, obstruction, perforation, or bleeding from a locally advanced or locally recurrent primary tumor, which require multidisciplinary management using endoscopic, surgical, radiotherapeutic, or other approaches. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=systemic-therapy-for-locally-advanced-unresectable-and-metastatic-esophageal-and-gastric-cancer\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Systemic therapy for locally advanced unresectable and metastatic esophageal and gastric cancer&quot;</a>.)</p><p>This topic review will focus on local palliative treatments for patients with locally advanced unresectable or metastatic gastric cancer. Chemotherapy for locally advanced unresectable or metastatic esophageal and gastric cancer is discussed elsewhere, as is endoscopic palliation for dysphagia in patients with locally advanced or recurrent esophageal cancer, and primary surgical treatment. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=systemic-therapy-for-locally-advanced-unresectable-and-metastatic-esophageal-and-gastric-cancer\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Systemic therapy for locally advanced unresectable and metastatic esophageal and gastric cancer&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=endoscopic-palliation-of-esophageal-cancer\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Endoscopic palliation of esophageal cancer&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=surgical-management-of-invasive-gastric-cancer\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Surgical management of invasive gastric cancer&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=surgical-management-of-resectable-esophageal-and-esophagogastric-junction-cancers\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Surgical management of resectable esophageal and esophagogastric junction cancers&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">THERAPEUTIC OPTIONS FOR LOCAL PALLIATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Therapeutic options to control symptoms of local disease progression, such as nausea, pain, bleeding, and obstruction, include palliative surgical resection, surgical bypass (gastrojejunostomy), radiation therapy (RT), and endoscopic techniques. All forms of palliative therapy must take into account the overall prognosis of the patient in order to avoid excessive morbidity and mortality or lengthy hospital stays in those with a limited life span.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2536379015\"><span class=\"h2\">Nonsurgical palliation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A variety of nonsurgical measures have been evaluated for palliation of obstructive symptoms or uncontrolled bleeding, which may be acute or chronic. Medical therapies, such as antacids and H2-antagonists, are often of little benefit. In general, we prefer RT in most circumstances, particularly in instances where there needs to be control of tumor bleeding, because it provides longer term tumor control. For more immediate relief in a patient where chemotherapy cannot be given concurrently with RT, we prefer placement of an endoscopic stent over RT. Besides a shorter duration of tumor control, stents also can cause increased heartburn and require dietary modifications to avoid stent displacement, which can be difficult for patients.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2238204954\"><span class=\"h3\">Radiation therapy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>External beam RT has a well-defined role in the control of pain, bleeding, or obstruction in patients with localized but unresectable gastric cancer [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/local-palliation-for-advanced-gastric-cancer/abstract/1-6\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-6</a>]. A retrospective review of 115 patients with gastric cancer treated with palliative RT (ranging from 8 Gy in a single fraction to 40 Gy in 16 fractions) revealed that control of bleeding, <span class=\"nowrap\">dysphagia/obstruction,</span> and pain was achieved in 81, 53, and 46 percent of patients, respectively, at one month [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/local-palliation-for-advanced-gastric-cancer/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. Treatment was well tolerated, with only three (2.6 percent) with grade 3 toxicity (nausea, vomiting, and anorexia). Palliation lasted the duration of most patients' lives. There was no difference in response between low (&le;39 Gy) and high (&gt;39 Gy) biologically effective dose regimens, although there was a trend toward poorer local control with doses &le;39 Gy.</p><p>Three other studies evaluating palliative chemoradiotherapy have also demonstrated durable palliation of dysphagia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/local-palliation-for-advanced-gastric-cancer/abstract/2,3\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,3</a>], as well as pain and bleeding [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/local-palliation-for-advanced-gastric-cancer/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].</p><p>There are no controlled studies that directly compare RT or chemoradiotherapy with endoscopic or surgical techniques for symptomatic palliation. However, responses to RT are not as immediate as with stenting or surgical palliation. Furthermore, while control of bleeding may be possible with low RT doses that are not associated with significant side effects [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/local-palliation-for-advanced-gastric-cancer/abstract/4,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,5</a>], doses above 40 Gy (which may be associated with significant adverse effects) are often required for palliation of obstruction.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3613074157\"><span class=\"h3\">Endoscopic stent placement</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>For palliation of obstructive symptoms, endoscopic placement of a stent provides a less invasive alternative to surgery for symptom palliation and may possibly be more effective for symptom relief. Published experience with enteral stenting for gastroduodenal obstruction is derived mostly from case series and small comparative trials. The available data suggest that enteral stenting has a similar success rate to surgical palliation (with approximately 90 percent of patients improving clinically) but is associated with less morbidity, procedure-related mortality, and cost. Furthermore, stenting may achieve better quality of life compared with other forms of palliation (such as non-oral feeding through a jejunostomy tube), although they have not been directly compared in controlled trials.</p><p>In a review of two randomized trials of endoscopic stenting versus palliative gastrojejunostomy, six comparative studies, and 36 retrospective series, there were no statistically significant differences between the two procedures in terms of efficacy or complications [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/local-palliation-for-advanced-gastric-cancer/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. However, stenting was associated with a trend toward shorter hospital stay, a higher clinical success rate, and faster relief of obstructive symptoms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/local-palliation-for-advanced-gastric-cancer/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. Patients who received stents did require reintervention more frequently than did surgically treated patients.</p><p>This subject is addressed in further detail elsewhere.

Laser photocoagulation can be effective, particularly for large tumors with diffuse bleeding, although the equipment is expensive and not widely available [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/local-palliation-for-advanced-gastric-cancer/abstract/12,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,13</a>]. An alternative that is being used increasingly is argon plasma coagulation. Another alternative that is available in Canada, Europe, and most of Asia is endoscopic application of a hemostatic nanopowder (Hemospray) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/local-palliation-for-advanced-gastric-cancer/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. In the United States, it is not US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved but is available for compassionate use.

Palliative gastrectomy should be reserved for extreme, highly symptomatic cases where less invasive methods cannot be used.</p><p>For patients with advanced gastric cancer, the benefits of palliative gastrectomy include rapid symptomatic relief of pain, nausea, bleeding, obstruction, and perforation. In addition, several retrospective reports and a small prospective study conducted in patients with limited metastatic disease suggest that the procedure might be associated with a survival benefit [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/local-palliation-for-advanced-gastric-cancer/abstract/15-20\" class=\"abstract_t\">15-20</a>], although this has not been seen in all studies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/local-palliation-for-advanced-gastric-cancer/abstract/21-25\" class=\"abstract_t\">21-25</a>]. A significant problem with all of these reports is selection bias; those patients who were candidates for surgical resection may have had a smaller disease burden and a better performance status and prognosis than those who received only a bypass procedure or no surgical intervention at all. Furthermore, most of the reports do not control for other factors that could influence survival, such as use of postoperative systemic chemotherapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/local-palliation-for-advanced-gastric-cancer/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. </p><p>The survival benefit of gastrectomy in patients treated with modern systemic chemotherapy was directly tested in the phase III REGATTA trial, in which 175 patients with advanced gastric cancer and a single noncurable factor confined to the liver, peritoneum, or paraaortic lymph nodes were randomly assigned to chemotherapy alone (S-1 plus <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cisplatin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cisplatin</a>) or to gastrectomy followed by the same chemotherapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/local-palliation-for-advanced-gastric-cancer/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. The study was closed prematurely after an interim analysis suggested that the primary endpoint, overall survival, was not significantly improved by gastrectomy. In the final analysis, two-year survival for chemotherapy alone versus gastrectomy plus chemotherapy was 32 versus 25 percent. Furthermore, patients undergoing gastrectomy had a significantly higher incidence of several serious adverse events related to chemotherapy, including leucopenia, nausea, anorexia, and hyponatremia. Palliative gastrectomy cannot be justified in these patients.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H134637940\"><span class=\"h2\">Gastrojejunostomy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In current practice, palliative gastrojejunostomy for patients with metastatic gastric cancer is reserved for cases where less invasive methods, such as palliative RT with or without chemotherapy, and endoscopic procedures, such as ablation, stenting, or J-tube placement to establish a route for enteral nutrition, cannot be used.</p><p>Palliative gastrojejunostomy for gastric outlet obstruction associated with unresectable advanced gastric cancer can improve food intake [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/local-palliation-for-advanced-gastric-cancer/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. Multiple case reports and small studies report successful palliation of malignant gastric outlet obstruction using minimally invasive laparoscopic gastrojejunostomy. A small retrospective comparison of patients who had palliative laparoscopic (n = 10) versus open (n = 10) gastrojejunostomy showed a similar mean surgery time but less intraoperative blood loss (23 versus 142 mL) and a shorter length of stay (8 versus 124 days) for the laparoscopically treated group [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/local-palliation-for-advanced-gastric-cancer/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>].
