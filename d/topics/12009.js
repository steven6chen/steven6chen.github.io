In a study of 431 patients with OCD, the majority of patients experienced both obsessions and compulsions, rather than one or the other [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/obsessive-compulsive-disorder-in-adults-epidemiology-pathogenesis-clinical-manifestations-course-and-diagnosis/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>].

Obsessions are not pleasurable or experienced as voluntary. They are intrusive, unwanted, and cause marked distress or anxiety in most individuals. A person suffering from OCD attempts to ignore, avoid, or suppress obsessions or to neutralize them with another thought or action (eg, performing a compulsion). </p><p>Compulsions (or rituals) are repetitive behaviors (eg, washing, checking) or mental acts (eg, counting, repeating words silently) that the individual feels driven to perform in response to an obsession (eg, washing rituals in response to obsessive fears of contamination) or according to rules that must be applied rigidly. The aim can be to reduce the distress triggered by obsessions or to prevent a feared event (eg, becoming ill). However, these compulsions are either not connected in a realistic way to the feared event (eg, arranging items symmetrically to prevent harm to a loved one) or are clearly excessive (eg, showering for hours each day). Compulsions may also be performed in response to a sense of &ldquo;incompleteness&rdquo; (eg, a need to perform actions until &ldquo;just right&rdquo;). Compulsions are not done for pleasure, although some individuals experience relief from anxiety or distress.</p><p>Whether obsessions lead to compulsions or compulsions lead to obsessions is debated in the field [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/obsessive-compulsive-disorder-in-adults-epidemiology-pathogenesis-clinical-manifestations-course-and-diagnosis/abstract/36,37\" class=\"abstract_t\">36,37</a>].</p><p>The frequency and severity of obsessions and compulsions vary among people with OCD: some have mild to moderate symptoms (spending one to three hours per day obsessing or doing compulsions), whereas others have near constant obsessions or compulsions that can be incapacitating. </p><p>The specific content of obsessions and compulsions varies widely among individuals; however, there are certain identifiable themes, also described as &ldquo;symptom dimensions&rdquo;. People with OCD often have symptoms in multiple dimensions, which include: </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Cleaning &ndash; Fears of contamination and cleaning rituals</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Symmetry &ndash; Symmetry obsessions and repeating, ordering, and counting compulsions</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Forbidden or taboo thoughts &ndash; Examples include aggressive, sexual, and religious obsessions, and related compulsions</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Harm (eg, thoughts or images about harm befalling oneself or others and checking compulsions)</p><p/><p>A 2015 review and meta-analysis suggest that there is a strong link between suicidal thoughts and behaviors and OCD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/obsessive-compulsive-disorder-in-adults-epidemiology-pathogenesis-clinical-manifestations-course-and-diagnosis/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>]. Lifetime rates of suicidality varied widely across studies but were as high as 63.5 percent for suicidal ideation (across 18 studies) and 46 percent for suicide attempts (across 22 studies). Worsening levels of suicidality in OCD patients are associated with comorbid axis I disorders, severity of depressive and anxiety symptoms, severity of obsessions, feelings of hopelessness, and past history of suicide attempts. Data from 3711 adults with OCD across multiple treatment centers from seven countries found that suicidal ideation in the last month was reported in 6 percent, and a lifetime suicidal attempt was reported in 9 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/obsessive-compulsive-disorder-in-adults-epidemiology-pathogenesis-clinical-manifestations-course-and-diagnosis/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>]. Some patients with OCD experience intrusive fears that they will harm others, but there are no data suggesting that they are more likely to do so at a rate higher than the general population.</p><p>Avoidance behavior is common in OCD. In some cases, people with OCD avoid people, places, or things that trigger obsessions and compulsions. For example, individuals with contamination concerns might avoid public situations (eg, restaurants, public restrooms) to reduce exposure to feared contaminants; those with intrusive thoughts about causing harm to others may avoid social interactions. Avoidance can become pervasive and severely restrict functioning.</p><p>Once obsessions and compulsions are triggered, people with OCD may experience a range of affective responses. As an example, some may feel marked anxiety, which can include recurrent panic attacks. Others report strong feelings of disgust. While performing compulsions, individuals may report a distressing sense of &ldquo;incompleteness&rdquo; or uneasiness until things look, feel, or sound &ldquo;just right&rdquo;.</p><p>Many individuals with OCD experience dysfunctional beliefs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/obsessive-compulsive-disorder-in-adults-epidemiology-pathogenesis-clinical-manifestations-course-and-diagnosis/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>], including:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Inflated responsibility and the tendency to overestimate threat</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Perfectionism and the intolerance of uncertainty</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Overvaluing the importance of thoughts (eg, believing that having a forbidden thought is as bad as acting on it) and the need to control thoughts</p><p/><p>These beliefs are present in individuals with other anxiety disorders as well.</p><p>People with OCD differ in the degree to which they believe that their obsessions and compulsions are excessive or unreasonable [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/obsessive-compulsive-disorder-in-adults-epidemiology-pathogenesis-clinical-manifestations-course-and-diagnosis/abstract/34,35,41\" class=\"abstract_t\">34,35,41</a>].

As examples: </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Obsessions about harm can make relationships with family and friends feel hazardous, resulting in avoidance </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Obsessions about symmetry can derail the timely completion of school or work projects because the project never feels &ldquo;just right,&rdquo; potentially resulting in school failure or job loss</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Individuals with contamination concerns may avoid physicians due to fears of exposure to germs </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Patients may develop dermatological problems, such as skin lesions due to excessive washing</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Sometimes the symptoms of OCD interfere with its own treatment, eg, when medications are considered contaminated </p><p/><p>When OCD starts in childhood or adolescence, individuals may experience developmental difficulties. As examples, adolescents may avoid socializing with peers. Young adults may struggle to leave home and live independently, with few significant relationships outside the family, a lack of autonomy, and continued financial dependence on their family of origin. </p><p>Individuals with OCD may try to impose rules and prohibitions on family members because of their disorder (eg, no one in the family can have visitors to the house for fear of contamination). This usually manifests in the form of family&rsquo;s accommodation of rituals and participation in the rituals. </p><p>High family accommodation is often associated with high expressed emotion and together can contribute to not only poor treatment response but also to high family burden and poorer quality of life among family members who live with the individual suffering from OCD. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H718079259\"><span class=\"h1\">ASSESSMENT AND DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In a diagnostic assessment of a patient with possible OCD, the clinician should ask specifically about the presence of intrusive thoughts, images, or urges, and to inquire about repetitive behaviors and mental rituals. The frequency, amount of time consumed, and extent to which <span class=\"nowrap\">obsessions/compulsions</span> cause the patient distress or interfere with his or her life helps to distinguish OCD from occasional intrusive thoughts or repetitive behaviors that are common in the general population (eg, double-checking that a door is locked) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/obsessive-compulsive-disorder-in-adults-epidemiology-pathogenesis-clinical-manifestations-course-and-diagnosis/abstract/52-54\" class=\"abstract_t\">52-54</a>]. </p><p>Identifying the main symptom dimensions (eg, cleaning, symmetry, harm) provides useful information to inform treatment and monitor changes in the severity of the disorder over time. Identifying a link between obsessions and compulsions, and confirming that the obsessions lead to anxiety or distress can help to differentiate OCD from other disorders on the intrusive thoughts or repetitive behaviors spectrum. Evaluation should assess for symptoms and behaviors resulting from co-occurring psychiatric disorders. (See <a href=\"#H408548123\" class=\"local\">'Clinical manifestations'</a> above and <a href=\"#H408548046\" class=\"local\">'Comorbidities'</a> above.)</p><p>DSM-5 diagnostic criteria for obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) are as follows [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/obsessive-compulsive-disorder-in-adults-epidemiology-pathogenesis-clinical-manifestations-course-and-diagnosis/abstract/55\" class=\"abstract_t\">55</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A.

Recurrent and persistent thoughts, urges, or images that are experienced, at some time during the disturbance, as intrusive and unwanted, and that in most individuals cause marked anxiety or distress. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>2. The individual attempts to ignore or suppress such thoughts, urges, or images, or to neutralize them with some other thought or action (ie, by performing a compulsion).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Compulsions as defined by:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>1. Repetitive behaviors (eg, hand washing, ordering, checking) or mental acts (eg, praying, counting, repeating words silently) that the individual feels driven to perform in response to an obsession, or according to rules that must be applied rigidly.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>2. The behaviors or mental acts are aimed at preventing or reducing anxiety or distress or preventing some dreaded event or situation; however, these behaviors or mental acts either are not connected in a realistic way with what they are designed to neutralize or prevent, or are clearly excessive.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>B. The obsessions or compulsions are time-consuming (eg, take more than one hour per day) or cause clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>C.

OCD-related concerns generally involve content that is odd, irrational, or of a seemingly magical nature. In OCD, compulsions are almost always present and usually linked to the obsessions. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=generalized-anxiety-disorder-in-adults-epidemiology-pathogenesis-clinical-manifestations-course-assessment-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Generalized anxiety disorder in adults: Epidemiology, pathogenesis, clinical manifestations, course, assessment, and diagnosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1058856560\"><span class=\"h4\">Specific phobia</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients with specific phobias, like those with OCD, may have a fear reaction to specific objects or situations.

Patients who have obsessions that are typical of OCD (eg, concerns about incompleteness or harm) that lead to compulsive hoarding behaviors (eg, acquiring all objects in a set to attain a sense of completeness or not discarding old newspapers because they may contain information that could prevent harm) should be diagnosed with OCD. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H408548158\"><span class=\"h3\">Major depressive disorder</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The ruminative thoughts present in major depressive disorder are typically mood-congruent and are not necessarily experienced as intrusive as in OCD. Ruminations in depression are not linked to compulsions as is typical in OCD.

OCPD is not a subsyndromal version of OCD, and is not characterized by obsessions. The repetitive behaviors in OCPD are not performed in relation to obsessions. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-personality-disorders\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of personality disorders&quot;</a> and <a href=\"#H408548046\" class=\"local\">'Comorbidities'</a> above.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H408548186\"><span class=\"h3\">Other disorders</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Other disorders that include intrusive thoughts and repetitive behaviors can be distinguished from OCD by the nature of the thoughts and behaviors. In body dysmorphic disorder, intrusive thoughts are limited to concerns about appearance. In trichotillomania, the repetitive behavior is limited to hair-pulling. In anorexia nervosa, intrusive thoughts and repetitive behaviors are limited to concerns about weight and food. Other possible foci and the associated disorders are described in Criteria D of the diagnostic criteria above.

In these conditions, an individual generally derives pleasure from the activity (at least early in the illness) and may wish to resist it only because of its deleterious consequences.
