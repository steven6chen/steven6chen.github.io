There are more than 100 species of jellyfish, and the severity and treatment of their stings vary widely, depending upon the type of jellyfish, the size of the sting, and the individual patient.</p><p>This topic will discuss the clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and treatment of jellyfish stings. Recognition and treatment of marine envenomations by other animals are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=marine-envenomations-from-corals-sea-urchins-fish-or-stingrays\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Marine envenomations from corals, sea urchins, fish, or stingrays&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1569196\"><span class=\"h1\">MARINE BIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Jellyfish are members of the phylum Cnidaria, as are sea anemones. Jellyfish are invertebrates that float in salt and brackish water. They have a central bell and lengthy tentacles that disconnect easily (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F67670\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef67670 \">picture 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F81807\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef81807 \">picture 2</a>). Jellyfish consume fish, crustaceans, and mollusks by injecting venomous capsules called nematocysts into their prey. The nematocysts are clustered along the jellyfish's tentacles and discharge rapidly on contact. Although <em>Physalia sp</em> (Portuguese man-of-war, also called bluebottle jellyfish), which are also members of the phylum Cnidaria, are not true jellyfish, they are discussed here as well. </p><p>Jellyfish nematocysts inject a mixture of proteinaceous toxins through hollow, barbed tubes into their victims' skin at an approximate force of 2 to 5 pounds per square inch [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/jellyfish-stings/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. The venom enters the dermis and general circulation and can cause both skin and systemic symptoms in affected patients.</p><p>Jellyfish do not actively seek out humans. However, they can be difficult to see, and most injuries occur when humans blunder into their tentacles.</p><p>The long-term effects of climate change and overfishing on jellyfish populations are uncertain. Jellyfish numbers appear to be increasing in some ecosystems, but decreasing in others [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/jellyfish-stings/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">EPIDEMIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Jellyfish stings are common in warm and cold coastal waters throughout the world. As an example, approximately 500,000 envenomations occur annually in the Chesapeake Bay while estimates suggest 60,000 to 200,000 annual stings along the Florida coast [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/jellyfish-stings/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Most jellyfish envenomations in North America are mild although two deaths from Portuguese man-of-war stings along the Atlantic coast of the United States were reported in one year [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/jellyfish-stings/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].</p><p>In tropical northern Australia, stings from the major box jellyfish <em>Chironex fleckeri</em> continue to result in about one pediatric death in a remote area every two to three years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/jellyfish-stings/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. There are more nonfatal and less severe cases mainly in the Northern Territory [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/jellyfish-stings/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. A few hundred cases of Irukandji syndrome from other box jellyfish, including <em>Carukia barnesi</em>, occur in the same region each year [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/jellyfish-stings/abstract/6,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,7</a>]. <em>Physalia </em>stings are very common throughout the country. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL MANIFESTATIONS</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Overview</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The clinical presentation of a patient with jellyfish stings varies according to the type of jellyfish, individual characteristics of the patient, duration of exposure and amount of skin exposed, and type of treatment administered at the time of exposure. Clinicians should familiarize themselves with common jellyfish species in their region.</p><p>Patients may not see the tentacle, but they usually experience immediate pain at the time of the sting. Linear red, urticarial lesions typically develop a few minutes later, although sometimes these lesions do not appear for several hours [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/jellyfish-stings/abstract/8,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,9</a>]. The lesions often burn intensely and may itch and throb. The pain can radiate up a limb to the torso.</p><p>&quot;Tentacle prints&quot; may be seen on examination of the skin, and less commonly vesiculation and ecchymosis (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F54564\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef54564 \">figure 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F71299\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef71299 \">picture 3</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F66901\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef66901 \">picture 4</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F67949\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef67949 \">picture 5</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/jellyfish-stings/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. </p><p>Skin necrosis can occur with more severe stings, such as with <em>C. fleckeri</em>. The initial erythematous lesions are usually localized to the area of the sting. In some cases eruptions, such as papular urticarial reactions (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F65535\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef65535 \">picture 6</a>), can recur days later and may be intensely pruritic. This is seen in about 60 percent of <em>C. fleckeri</em> stings [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/jellyfish-stings/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. Lesions usually resolve within 10 days, although they may occasionally persist for weeks [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/jellyfish-stings/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>].</p><p>Ocular jellyfish stings can initially cause burning pain, photophobia, epithelial keratitis, corneal stromal edema, endothelial cell swelling, and anterior chamber inflammation, which usually resolve within 48 hours [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/jellyfish-stings/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. Several patients who developed severe iritis and increased intraocular pressure after corneal stings have been described including one patient who developed chronic unilateral glaucoma four years after a jellyfish sting sustained in the Chesapeake Bay [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/jellyfish-stings/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Irukandji syndrome</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Irukandji syndrome typically involves a mild to moderately painful local sting that is followed 20 to 40 minutes later by the onset of severe generalized back, chest, and abdominal pain, gastrointestinal symptoms, sweating, agitation, hypertension, and tachycardia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/jellyfish-stings/abstract/6,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,7</a>]. Patients may develop myocardial injury and pulmonary edema 6 to 18 hours after the sting [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/jellyfish-stings/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>].</p><p><em>Carukia barnesi</em>, found in Northern Australian waters, was the first jellyfish identified to cause Irukandji syndrome [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/jellyfish-stings/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. <em>C. barnesi</em> is a creature with a tiny bell (often 2 cm in diameter) and long tentacles. Other Australian jellyfish may also cause some cases of Irukandji syndrome [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/jellyfish-stings/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>].</p><p>There have been case reports of an Irukandji-like syndrome occurring in locations outside the habitat of <em>Carukia barnesi</em>, including off Hawaii and the southern coast of Florida [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/jellyfish-stings/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Severe stings</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Major box jellyfish (<em>Chironex fleckeri</em>) stings have caused more than 70 known deaths in Australia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/jellyfish-stings/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. Multiple tentacles arise from the four corners of this large jellyfish and may stretch up to 2 m. These tentacles are lined with nematocysts containing venom that has produced cardiotoxic and dermonecrotic effects in the clinical setting, and experimental in vitro hemolytic effects [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/jellyfish-stings/abstract/17,18\" class=\"abstract_t\">17,18</a>]. While most Australian box jellyfish stings are of little consequence [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/jellyfish-stings/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>], with large tentacular contact patients can experience rapid onset of cardiac arrest within minutes of the sting [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/jellyfish-stings/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. Delayed hypersensitivity reactions occurring 7 to 14 days after the sting, consisting of papular urticaria at the initial site of contact are common. As an example, in one series 11 of 19 patients presenting to an emergency department with <em>C. fleckeri</em> stings developed delayed hypersensitivity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/jellyfish-stings/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].</p><p>Rare deaths have been reported with the Atlantic Portuguese man-of-war; Man-of-war (<em>Physalia sp</em>, also called bluebottle jellyfish) cause numerous stings throughout the world. Patients may develop cardiovascular or respiratory arrest or drown from paralysis of a limb [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/jellyfish-stings/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. There has also been a report of a fatal envenomation of a child by <em>Chiropsalmus quadrumanus</em> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/jellyfish-stings/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Seabather's eruption</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Seabather's eruption is an itchy dermatitis that has been described in Florida, the Caribbean, Bermuda, and Long Island, New York [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/jellyfish-stings/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. It occurs on parts of skin that are covered by a swimsuit and is believed to be caused by jellyfish and sea anemone larvae, which become trapped and pressed between the garment and the person's skin (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F68535\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef68535 \">picture 7</a>). The skin reaction may recur when the outfit is worn again, due to persistence of nematocysts in the fabric. Malaise, fever, and gastrointestinal symptoms can also occur in a minority of patients with this condition.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h1\">DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In most cases, the diagnosis of a jellyfish sting is made clinically or is simply recognized by the patient who has been stung in waters known to harbor jellyfish. Clues to the type of jellyfish include the geographic area where the sting occurred, the distance from the shore, and the pattern of the tentacle print on the skin (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F54564\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef54564 \">figure 1</a>).</p><p>A definitive diagnosis is sometimes needed when the clinical picture is unclear or for research purposes. When such a diagnosis is required, nematocysts can be examined under a microscope and compared to known nematocysts from various jellyfish. Nematocysts can generally be easily identified for common jellyfish. For uncommon jellyfish or in areas where stings are uncommon, the microscopic examination should be performed by an expert who has access to the cnidomes of medically significant jellyfish.</p><p>Nematocysts can be obtained by skin scrapings or by applying sticky tape to the sting site [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/jellyfish-stings/abstract/5,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,6</a>]. Skin scraping is the better method for retrieving nematocysts but is slightly painful; it is the only method that can be used to collect nematocysts from bell stings (eg, <em>C. barnesi</em>). The skin is scraped over the sting site to collect remaining nematocysts, which are then put in 1 to 4 percent formalin.</p><p>Sticky taping the sting site is appropriate for stings from tentacles and is less painful. Adhesive tape is placed over the site and then pulled off to remove nematocysts. The tape is then applied to a microscope slide. This method is useful for both Chironex stings and Physalia stings [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/jellyfish-stings/abstract/5,23\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,23</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12734707\"><span class=\"h1\">DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Marine envenomation by a variety of animals including corals, sea urchins, fish, and stingrays and skin lesions associated with marine animals are the primary diagnostic considerations when jellyfish stings are suspected. Marine envenomations are suggested by the presence of lacerations or puncture wounds (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F74728\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef74728 \">picture 8</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F54699\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef54699 \">picture 9</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F67496\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef67496 \">picture 10</a>). Swimmer&rsquo;s itch (cercarial dermatitis) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F82849\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef82849 \">picture 11</a>), seabather&rsquo;s eruption (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F68535\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef68535 \">picture 7</a>), and stinging sponge dermatitis are identified by the predominance of pruritus rather than pain and a characteristic eruption. Differentiating features of these diagnoses are discussed in greater detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=marine-envenomations-from-corals-sea-urchins-fish-or-stingrays#H9223633\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Marine envenomations from corals, sea urchins, fish, or stingrays&quot;, section on 'Differential diagnosis'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h1\">TREATMENT</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1177661\"><span class=\"h2\">Recommended first aid</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h3\">Nematocyst removal</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>It is important to remove jellyfish tentacles promptly, since nematocysts may continue to fire toxins into attached skin. The tentacles can be brushed off using a plastic object (such as a credit card) and a substance such as shaving cream. We recommend <strong>not</strong> immersing the wound in cool fresh water or vigorously rubbing the wound because the osmotic pressure of fresh water may cause nematocysts to fire. Seawater can be used to wash tentacles off affected areas. Vigorous rubbing can stimulate nematocysts and should be avoided [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/jellyfish-stings/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15\"><span class=\"h3\">Hot water immersion</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>After tentacle removal, we recommend that pain from stings by <em>Carybdea alata</em> (Hawaiian box jellyfish) and <em>Physalia sp</em> (Portuguese man-of-war, also called bluebottle jellyfish) be treated with hot water immersion rather than cold therapy, acetic acid, or papain meat tenderizer. The water temperature should be 40 to 45&deg;C (104 to 113&deg;F) and should be applied by immersion of a limb or by hot shower for approximately 20 minutes. If a thermometer is not available, use the hottest water temperature that is tolerated by the patient on an unaffected limb; adults should test the water temperature for young children.</p><p>Heat may alter the protein structure of jellyfish toxins and, based upon small trials and observational studies, is more effective for pain relief than cold or other topical therapies for stings by <em>Physalia</em> <em>sp</em> and <em>C. alata</em> (Hawaiian box jellyfish) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/jellyfish-stings/abstract/25,26\" class=\"abstract_t\">25,26</a>].</p><p>The following studies provide the best evidence in support of hot water immersions for these species:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a crossover study, 25 healthy adult volunteers had Hawaiian box jellyfish (<em>C. alata</em>) tentacles applied to both forearms and then randomly immersed one forearm in hot (40 to 41&deg;C [104 to 106&deg;F]) fresh water compared with application of either household vinegar (5 percent acetic acid) or papain meat tenderizer (Adolph's meat tenderizer) and water in a 4:1 ratio to the other forearm [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/jellyfish-stings/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. Hot water immersion resulted in clinically significant pain relief at four and 20 minutes that was greater for the forearm that received hot water immersion relative to either meat tenderizer or vinegar (mean difference in 10 cm visual analog scores 1.1 and 1.6 cm, respectively).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a trial of 96 Australian patients stung by <em>Physalia sp</em> who received either hot water immersion (45&deg;C [113&deg;F]) or ice packs, clinically important pain relief after 20 minutes was reported in significantly more patients who received hot water immersion (87 versus 33 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/jellyfish-stings/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. However, these results may somewhat overestimate the relative benefits of hot water because the trial was stopped early based upon an interim analysis, and because pain at baseline was greater in the hot water treatment group. The authors note that hot water immersion at higher temperatures or for longer than one hour could increase the risk of burns.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A randomized trial in Florida, where <em>Physalia sp</em> are common, found that patients whose affected limbs were soaked in hot water (43&deg;C [110&deg;F]) after nematocyst removal experienced faster pain relief than patients who applied cold packs to the affected area [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/jellyfish-stings/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>] </p><p/><p>Taken together, these studies indicate that hot water immersion is effective for jellyfish stings by two species common to North America and Hawaii. Hot water immersion may be helpful for stings from other jellyfish as well. However, it is not necessarily appropriate to extrapolate from studies in one species of jellyfish to other species.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2825004402\"><span class=\"h1\">CORNEAL STINGS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Case reports describe good recovery in patients who underwent liberal irrigation of the eyes with saline or seawater (the latter in cases of immediate first aid), and subsequent treatment with topical steroids, antibiotics, antihistamines, or cycloplegics [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/jellyfish-stings/abstract/29,30\" class=\"abstract_t\">29,30</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1177587\"><span class=\"h2\">Severe stings</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H20\"><span class=\"h3\">Supportive care</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>For most jellyfish stings, tentacle removal and pain management is the primary therapy and can often be accomplished by hot water immersion and, for patients with persistent pain, oral or parenteral opioids (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hydrocodone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">hydrocodone</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=morphine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">morphine</a>). </p><p>Aggressive management of airway, breathing, and circulation may be necessary in patients with severe stings caused by <em>Chironex fleckeri</em> or with the Irukandji syndrome including management of myocardial infarction and cardiac collapse.

In vitro studies of acetic acid (which is present in household vinegar) have found that it inhibits the discharge of nematocysts from Australian box jellyfish [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/jellyfish-stings/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]. The Australian Resuscitation Council's 2010 guidelines recommend immediate application of acetic acid for box jellyfish stings [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/jellyfish-stings/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>]. Acetic acid has not been tested on species that cause Irukandji syndrome, but it is commonly used for these stings as well [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/jellyfish-stings/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>]. Although it prevents further discharge of nematocysts from at least some species of jellyfish, acetic acid does not treat established envenomation effects and the symptomatic pain relief that it provides appears to be inferior to the analgesia associated with hot water immersion for minor or moderate <em>C. alata</em> stings [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/jellyfish-stings/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>].

The antivenom, which is made from sheep serum, is indicated for cardiopulmonary instability and cardiac arrest [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/jellyfish-stings/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. It should be given intravenously soon after the sting, since most deaths occur within 5 to 20 minutes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/jellyfish-stings/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>].</p><p>We suggest that administration of antivenom be confined to early use in patients with cardiogenic shock or cardiac arrest. When used, administer one vial (20,000 units) intravenously over 5 to 10 minutes as the initial dose; dosing may be repeated up to a maximum of six vials for patients who remain in cardiogenic shock or cardiac arrest. The same dose is used for adults and children.</p><p>There are significant concerns regarding the efficacy of the antivenom [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/jellyfish-stings/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. A study examined this issue both in vitro and in animal models [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/jellyfish-stings/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>]. In vitro, the antivenom binds all major toxins (on Western blot). In a rat model, mixtures of venom-antivenom do not cause cardiovascular collapse, while this occurs rapidly with venom alone. However, when the antivenom was administered to the rats, rather than preincubated with venom, it was ineffective in preventing cardiovascular collapse even when administered intravenously prior to giving the venom. This study shows that although the antivenom is biologically active, it is unlikely to be able to work quickly enough clinically to prevent the rapid effects of venom on the cardiovascular system. It is unlikely that any clinical trial will be performed with the antivenom. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1176667\"><span class=\"h4\">Magnesium sulfate</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Evidence for the use of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=magnesium-sulfate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">magnesium sulfate</a> for severe jellyfish stings is lacking.

In a blinded experimental study, 24 volunteers had the inhibitor applied to one forearm and a sunscreen placebo applied to the other forearm and then each forearm was exposed to a jellyfish tentacle; 12 subjects were exposed to <em>Chrysaora fuscescens</em> (a type of sea nettle) and 12 were exposed to <em>Chiropsalmus quadrumanus</em> (a type of box jellyfish) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/jellyfish-stings/abstract/51\" class=\"abstract_t\">51</a>].

Patients may not see the tentacle, but they usually experience immediate pain at the time of the sting. The majority of jellyfish stings present with linear red, urticarial <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> painful lesions typically developing a few minutes later, although sometimes these lesions do not appear for several hours.

The water temperature should be 43 to 45&deg;C (110 to 113&deg;F) and should be applied by immersion of a limb or by hot shower for approximately 20 minutes. If a thermometer is not available, use the hottest water temperature that is tolerated by the patient on an unaffected limb; adults should test the water temperature for young children. Hot water may be helpful for stings from other jellyfish as well, but has not been studied for <em>C. fleckeri</em> (Australian box jellyfish) stings or species known to cause Irukandji syndrome.
