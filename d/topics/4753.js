The major consequences of pancreatic insufficiency are due to fat malabsorption, which is caused by decreased production of pancreatic enzymes. As a result, patients are at risk for steatorrhea, malnutrition, and fat-soluble vitamin deficiencies.</p><p>The pathogenesis, clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and management of pancreatic insufficiency in children with CF will be discussed here. The nutritional consequences of this disorder and other gastrointestinal complications of CF are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cystic-fibrosis-nutritional-issues\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Cystic fibrosis: Nutritional issues&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cystic-fibrosis-overview-of-gastrointestinal-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Cystic fibrosis: Overview of gastrointestinal disease&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">EPIDEMIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Traditionally, patients with CF have been categorized as pancreatic sufficient (10 to 15 percent) and pancreatic insufficient (the remainder) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cystic-fibrosis-assessment-and-management-of-pancreatic-insufficiency/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. It is now clear that pancreatic function in CF varies along a spectrum from normal to severely deficient. Patients with normal or near normal pancreatic function tend to have less severe lung disease, and their nutritional status is better than their counterparts who have more severe pancreatic dysfunction. Pancreatic function also varies with the age of the patient, tending to worsen over time.</p><p>Pancreatic function correlates strongly with genotype in patients with CF. Pancreatic insufficiency generally develops within the first few months of life in patients with two &quot;severe&quot; mutations of the CF transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) gene, including F508del, N1303K, G542X, and G551D (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F99734\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef99734 \">table 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cystic-fibrosis-assessment-and-management-of-pancreatic-insufficiency/abstract/4-6\" class=\"abstract_t\">4-6</a>]. These severe mutations usually are from functional class I (defective CFTR protein synthesis), class II (defective CFTR protein processing), or class III (defective <span class=\"nowrap\">regulation/gating</span> of the CFTR channel). By contrast, the presence of at least one &quot;mild&quot; mutation such as R117H or A445E usually is associated with pancreatic sufficiency [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cystic-fibrosis-assessment-and-management-of-pancreatic-insufficiency/abstract/5,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,7</a>]. These mild mutations tend to be from functional class IV (decreased CFTR channel conductance) or class V (reduced synthesis or trafficking). Of note, this genotype association is stronger for the pancreatic insufficiency phenotype, and much weaker for pulmonary disease phenotype. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cystic-fibrosis-genetics-and-pathogenesis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Cystic fibrosis: Genetics and pathogenesis&quot;</a>.) </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">PATHOGENESIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Defective functioning of the CF transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) leads to impaired transport of chloride, sodium, and bicarbonate. As a result, water does not diffuse out of the cell into the mucus layer, leading to viscous epithelial secretions. The resultant protein-rich, viscous exocrine fluid becomes inspissated in the proximal pancreatic ducts, leading to their obstruction. </p><p>Pancreatic duct obstruction begins during fetal life, as early as the second trimester of gestation. The functioning acinar cells are gradually replaced with adipose tissue and, later, with fibrotic tissue. Patients with pancreatic insufficiency have decreased or absent levels of pancreatic amylase, lipase, colipase, and phospholipases. However, they have increased or normal production of salivary and brush border amylases, lingual lipases, and possibly brush border peptidases, which account for increased monosaccharide absorption, some residual lipolysis, and possibly increased amino acid absorption, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cystic-fibrosis-assessment-and-management-of-pancreatic-insufficiency/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. Because of the CFTR mutation, patients with CF also have decreased amounts of bicarbonate in their pancreatic secretions, which may further contribute to the deficiency of enzymatic activity since the remaining enzymes may not function optimally in an acidic environment. </p><p>In addition, patients with CF may have primary abnormalities in fatty acid metabolism, as have been noted in biopsies of CFTR-expressing tissues [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cystic-fibrosis-assessment-and-management-of-pancreatic-insufficiency/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. These changes, which result in increased tissue levels of arachidonic acid, are also present in the mouse model of CF.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL MANIFESTATIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Approximately two-thirds of infants with CF have pancreatic insufficiency at birth due to progressive pancreatic injury in utero [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cystic-fibrosis-assessment-and-management-of-pancreatic-insufficiency/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. If CF is not diagnosed through newborn screening, it will usually be diagnosed because of failure to thrive, protein-calorie malnutrition, or rectal prolapse, typically presenting before the age of one year [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cystic-fibrosis-assessment-and-management-of-pancreatic-insufficiency/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. Even individuals with relatively normal pancreatic function at birth will usually develop pancreatic dysfunction and insufficiency over time, but clinically apparent protein and fat deficiencies do not occur until over 90 percent of pancreatic function is lost.</p><p>Patients with pancreatic insufficiency characteristically have frequent, bulky, foul-smelling stools that may be oily. Older children may also report that their stools float or stick to the toilet bowl (reflecting their high fat content). These features may not be as evident in infants since they have wide variation in stool patterns at baseline [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cystic-fibrosis-assessment-and-management-of-pancreatic-insufficiency/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. Abdominal distention may also be present [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cystic-fibrosis-assessment-and-management-of-pancreatic-insufficiency/abstract/12,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,13</a>]. These characteristics, all suggestive of fat malabsorption, are not specific to pancreatic insufficiency due to CF; they can also be seen in patients with small bowel mucosal disease or in other non-CF causes of pancreatic insufficiency. Moreover, these symptoms are subjective and nonspecific, so laboratory testing should usually be performed to determine if fat malabsorption is present. Fat malabsorption can develop at variable time points in the course of CF. As a result, patients with CF may require repeat testing and modification of their therapy as the disease progresses. (See <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Diagnosis'</a> below.)</p><p>Individuals with CF involving the pancreas are at risk for developing CF-related diabetes, due to progressive destruction of the pancreatic tissue and loss of its endocrine function; this is most common in those with underlying pancreatic insufficiency. Other patients may develop pancreatitis, which is most common among patients with pancreatic <strong>sufficiency</strong> at diagnosis; these patients may be at greater risk of developing pancreatic insufficiency as the disease progresses. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cystic-fibrosis-related-diabetes-mellitus\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Cystic fibrosis-related diabetes mellitus&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cystic-fibrosis-overview-of-gastrointestinal-disease#H21\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Cystic fibrosis: Overview of gastrointestinal disease&quot;, section on 'Pancreatitis'</a>.) </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h1\">DIAGNOSIS</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1689144866\"><span class=\"h2\">Clinical approach</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Because a variety of factors can contribute to growth failure and abdominal symptoms, we suggest an objective assessment of pancreatic insufficiency (eg, fecal elastase testing or fecal fat collection) to document the need for pancreatic enzyme replacement therapy (PERT). This approach is particularly appropriate for patients identified by newborn screening programs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cystic-fibrosis-assessment-and-management-of-pancreatic-insufficiency/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. Approximately 60 percent of infants with CF have pancreatic insufficiency at birth, and 75 to 90 percent have developed pancreatic insufficiency by one year of age [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cystic-fibrosis-assessment-and-management-of-pancreatic-insufficiency/abstract/10,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,15</a>]. </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pancreatic insufficiency &ndash; For patients with CF and a strong clinical suspicion of pancreatic insufficiency, it is reasonable to begin PERT empirically prior to formal testing for pancreatic insufficiency [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cystic-fibrosis-assessment-and-management-of-pancreatic-insufficiency/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. This includes patients with typical symptoms of pancreatic insufficiency (growth failure and symptoms of steatorrhea), or those with two CF transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) mutations known to be associated with pancreatic insufficiency (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F99734\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef99734 \">table 1</a>) (see <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Epidemiology'</a> above). In this case, pancreatic insufficiency should be confirmed after starting PERT, by measuring fecal elastase. If the abdominal symptoms do not improve with PERT, alternate causes of the symptoms, including the possibility of constipation or small intestine bacterial overgrowth, should be sought and treated. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">For patients with a lower clinical suspicion of pancreatic insufficiency, pancreatic function should be evaluated prior to beginning PERT, usually by measuring fecal elastase or fecal fat, as described below. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pancreatic sufficiency &ndash; For patients with pancreatic sufficiency, as determined by normal fecal elastase or fecal fat testing and no clinical evidence of malabsorption, PERT is not indicated. In particular, patients with one or two CFTR mutations known to be associated with pancreatic sufficiency (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F99734\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef99734 \">table 1</a>) should not be given PERT unless there is clear evidence of fat malabsorption [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cystic-fibrosis-assessment-and-management-of-pancreatic-insufficiency/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>] (see <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Epidemiology'</a> above). Because pancreatic insufficiency may develop over time, these patients should be evaluated at every visit for clinical symptoms of fat malabsorption, and also monitored with periodic measurements of fecal elastase and fat-soluble vitamins [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cystic-fibrosis-assessment-and-management-of-pancreatic-insufficiency/abstract/10,16\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,16</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1689144353\"><span class=\"h2\">Testing methods</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>For the initial diagnosis of pancreatic insufficiency in CF, measurement of elastase or fat in the stool are practical and sufficiently accurate for clinical use, although they have a number of limitations. Pancreatic function also can be measured directly by performing a <a href=\"topic.htm?path=secretin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">secretin</a> stimulation test at endoscopy. However, this test is invasive and expensive and is not routinely used. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h3\">Fecal elastase</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>For initial diagnosis of pancreatic insufficiency and to determine the need for PERT, we suggest measuring fecal elastase, which serves as an index of pancreatic exocrine function [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cystic-fibrosis-assessment-and-management-of-pancreatic-insufficiency/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. The test does not require discontinuation of PERT and can be performed on a single stool sample that requires no special storage. Fecal elastase values less than 200 <span class=\"nowrap\">micrograms/gram</span> indicate pancreatic insufficiency [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cystic-fibrosis-assessment-and-management-of-pancreatic-insufficiency/abstract/10,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,14</a>]. However, this test is <strong>not</strong> useful as a measure to monitor the effectiveness of PERT because it is a measure of intrinsic pancreatic function and not a measure of fat malabsorption [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cystic-fibrosis-assessment-and-management-of-pancreatic-insufficiency/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].</p><p>Fecal elastase testing has high sensitivity and specificity in detecting severe pancreatic insufficiency in children with CF [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cystic-fibrosis-assessment-and-management-of-pancreatic-insufficiency/abstract/3,17-19\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,17-19</a>]. However, the test performs less well for detecting mild or moderate pancreatic insufficiency and also displays variability with repeat testing in this type of patient [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cystic-fibrosis-assessment-and-management-of-pancreatic-insufficiency/abstract/20,21\" class=\"abstract_t\">20,21</a>]. Thus, results of fecal elastase testing should be combined with clinical observations, including nutritional status and symptoms of steatorrhea, to determine the need for PERT.</p><p>The results of fecal elastase testing correlate well with the <a href=\"topic.htm?path=secretin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">secretin</a> stimulation test [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cystic-fibrosis-assessment-and-management-of-pancreatic-insufficiency/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. The sensitivity and specificity of fecal elastase in detecting severe pancreatic insufficiency in children with CF range from 89 to 100 percent and 86 to 100 percent, respectively, depending upon the cut-off values (&lt;100 versus &lt;200 <span class=\"nowrap\">mcg/g</span> stool) and the gold-standard for diagnosis (eg, secretin stimulation, fecal fat collection, clinical evaluation) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cystic-fibrosis-assessment-and-management-of-pancreatic-insufficiency/abstract/19,22-25\" class=\"abstract_t\">19,22-25</a>].</p><p>Measurements of fecal chymotrypsin or lipase also can be used for the diagnosis of pancreatic insufficiency, but appear to be less sensitive than fecal elastase [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cystic-fibrosis-assessment-and-management-of-pancreatic-insufficiency/abstract/26,27\" class=\"abstract_t\">26,27</a>]. For these tests, PERT must be withheld for several days prior to testing, whereas this is not necessary for fecal elastase testing. The diagnostic accuracy of these tests is discussed in greater detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=exocrine-pancreatic-insufficiency\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Exocrine pancreatic insufficiency&quot;</a>.) </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1689144378\"><span class=\"h3\">Measurements of fecal fat</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>For monitoring for fat malabsorption to determine the adequacy of PERT, we suggest a measurement of fecal fat. The most accurate and commonly used fecal fat test is the collection of a 72-hour stool sample, in conjunction with a careful dietary inventory (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F67223\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef67223 \">table 2</a>). For an individual older than six months of age, fecal fat excretion is considered abnormal if it is more than 7 percent of the fat intake [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cystic-fibrosis-assessment-and-management-of-pancreatic-insufficiency/abstract/11,28\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,28</a>]. For infants under six months of age, fecal fat excretion of up to 15 percent of total fat intake can be normal [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cystic-fibrosis-assessment-and-management-of-pancreatic-insufficiency/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. This test has moderate sensitivity and specificity for fat malabsorption, but the collection procedure is onerous for most patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cystic-fibrosis-assessment-and-management-of-pancreatic-insufficiency/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. The test does not distinguish between hepatobiliary, mucosal, and pancreatic causes of fat malabsorption. The test can be used for initial diagnosis of pancreatic insufficiency, but in this case PERT must be discontinued during the collection period. </p><p>Other approaches to evaluating fecal fat are easier to perform, but have low accuracy. Qualitative measurement (Sudan stain) of a spot stool specimen is easier to perform but not reliable because fecal fat may not be evenly distributed in individuals consuming a mixed diet. </p><p>These tests for fecal fat are discussed in more detail in a separate topic review. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-malabsorption#H8\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical features and diagnosis of malabsorption&quot;, section on 'Tests for fat malabsorption'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1689144749\"><span class=\"h3\">Direct tests</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Direct tests of pancreatic function are more accurate than indirect tests across the range of pancreatic function, but require endoscopy, so they are invasive and expensive [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cystic-fibrosis-assessment-and-management-of-pancreatic-insufficiency/abstract/18,28\" class=\"abstract_t\">18,28</a>]. Therefore, they are rarely appropriate for the initial diagnosis or monitoring of pancreatic insufficiency in a patient with CF, except in unusual cases in which indirect tests or empiric trials of PERT are inconclusive. </p><p>These tests involve the collection of duodenal aspirates via endoscopy, after stimulation of the pancreas with a secretagogue, such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=secretin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">secretin</a>. The basis for this test is that secretin causes the secretion of bicarbonate and enzyme rich fluid from the pancreas. A peak bicarbonate concentration of less than 80 <span class=\"nowrap\">mEq/L</span> is consistent with pancreatic exocrine insufficiency. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=exocrine-pancreatic-insufficiency#H4\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Exocrine pancreatic insufficiency&quot;, section on 'Direct pancreatic function tests'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h1\">MANAGEMENT</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h2\">Pancreatic enzyme replacement therapy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The mainstay of treatment for pancreatic insufficiency in CF is pancreatic enzyme replacement therapy (PERT). Multiple formulations of pancreatic enzymes exist with different combinations of lipase, protease, and amylase (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F57416\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef57416 \">table 3</a>). Preparations with equivalent doses of enzymes may still differ in their effects. Patients should be reevaluated after any changes in the enzyme preparation or dose. The guidelines endorsed by the CF Foundation do not recommend use of generic or non-proprietary preparations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cystic-fibrosis-assessment-and-management-of-pancreatic-insufficiency/abstract/14,29\" class=\"abstract_t\">14,29</a>]. Individual product contents, preparation type, and units of activity vary by country, so product information should be consulted before using or changing products. See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pancrelipase-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Pancrelipase</a> drug information.</p><p>Pancreatic enzymes are extracts of porcine pancreas containing varying amounts of lipase, protease, and amylase. Most enzyme preparations are in the form of granules or microspheres that are coated with a pH-sensitive material that protects the enzyme from destruction by acid in the stomach (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F57416\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef57416 \">table 3</a>). The coating dissolves in the alkaline milieu of the duodenum, releasing the enzyme [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cystic-fibrosis-assessment-and-management-of-pancreatic-insufficiency/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>].</p><p>PERT clearly improves fecal fat absorption in most patients with pancreatic insufficiency. This was demonstrated by a double-blind placebo-controlled trial in which PERT increased the coefficient of fat absorption (CFA), decreased stool frequency, and improved stool consistency in both adult and pediatric patients with CF [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cystic-fibrosis-assessment-and-management-of-pancreatic-insufficiency/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]. The effectiveness of PERT in an individual patient may be limited by variations in the pH of the gastrointestinal tract in CF from patient to patient and also varies over time in the same patient [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cystic-fibrosis-assessment-and-management-of-pancreatic-insufficiency/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>]. Several studies suggest that suppression of gastric acid improves the efficiency of PERT in CF, but most of the evidence is low quality [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cystic-fibrosis-assessment-and-management-of-pancreatic-insufficiency/abstract/33,34\" class=\"abstract_t\">33,34</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h3\">Dosing considerations</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Most pancreatic enzyme preparations consist of capsules containing microspheres. Older children and adults generally swallow the capsule whole. For younger children and infants, enzymes are administered by opening the capsule and sprinkling the microspheres on food. The food should be soft so that it does not require chewing and should be relatively acidic to avoid dissolving the enteric coating (eg, applesauce, gelatins, pureed apricot, bananas, or sweet potatoes).</p><p>Dosing of pancreatic enzymes is based upon the units of lipase determined as a function of patient weight or dietary fat intake.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The weight-based method can generally be used at any age. The starting dose for children less than four years of age is 1000 lipase <span class=\"nowrap\">units/kg</span> body weight per meal, and for children older than four years of age is 500 lipase <span class=\"nowrap\">units/kg</span> body weight per meal [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cystic-fibrosis-assessment-and-management-of-pancreatic-insufficiency/abstract/29,35\" class=\"abstract_t\">29,35</a>]. Smaller doses usually are offered with fat-containing snacks eaten between meals. Dosing is increased based upon symptoms of pancreatic insufficiency, to a maximum of 2500 lipase <span class=\"nowrap\">units/kg</span> body weight per meal. (See <a href=\"#H11\" class=\"local\">'Adverse effects'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The fat-based method is useful for infants who take a known amount of formula or in patients who receive tube feedings. The dose starts at approximately 2000 lipase <span class=\"nowrap\">units/120</span> ml of formula or per breast feeding (about 1600 lipase <span class=\"nowrap\">units/gram</span> of fat ingested per day). The dose can be adjusted up to no more than 2500 lipase <span class=\"nowrap\">units/kg</span> body weight per feeding, with a maximum daily dose of 10,000 lipase <span class=\"nowrap\">units/kg</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cystic-fibrosis-assessment-and-management-of-pancreatic-insufficiency/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. Enzyme replacement for patients receiving nutritional support via enteral feedings is discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cystic-fibrosis-nutritional-issues#H29\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Cystic fibrosis: Nutritional issues&quot;, section on 'Enzyme replacement'</a>.)</p><p/><p>Patients who fail to respond to maximal doses of supplemental pancreatic enzymes may benefit from reduction of gastric acidity by addition of histamine 2 receptor antagonists (H2RAs) such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ranitidine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ranitidine</a>, or proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=omeprazole-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">omeprazole</a>. The reason for this improvement is that some enzyme products require a higher pH for the entire product to be released [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cystic-fibrosis-assessment-and-management-of-pancreatic-insufficiency/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>], but the practice is based on limited evidence [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cystic-fibrosis-assessment-and-management-of-pancreatic-insufficiency/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>]. The use of H2RAs is limited by the development of tachyphylaxis, and the use of PPIs is limited by potential adverse effects, including possibly increased risks for vitamin B12 deficiency and detrimental effects on bone health. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-gastroesophageal-reflux-disease-in-children-and-adolescents#H7\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of gastroesophageal reflux disease in children and adolescents&quot;, section on 'Safety'</a>.) </p><p>Adjustment of PERT doses is typically guided by patient-reported symptoms of malabsorption, such as diarrhea (foul smelling, greasy, bulky stools), bloating, gassiness, and abdominal pain. Unfortunately, symptoms do not correlate well with the efficacy of PERT in individual patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cystic-fibrosis-assessment-and-management-of-pancreatic-insufficiency/abstract/12,37\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,37</a>]. Thus, if PERT dosing appears to be adequate, alternate causes of abdominal symptoms, including the possibility of constipation or small intestine bacterial overgrowth, should be sought and treated. There is no evidence that constipation is caused by higher enzyme doses.</p><p>Laboratory tests generally are not helpful for adjustment of PERT doses because there are no methods that are accurate and clinically practical. If there is uncertainty about optimal dosing of PERT in an individual patient after adjustment based on clinical symptoms, then fecal fat measurements can be performed.

To prevent this complication, children should learn to swallow capsules as early as possible; some can master the technique as young as three to four years of age. When it is necessary to open the capsules for enzyme delivery to younger children, the microspheres should be administered with food (eg, applesauce), even in infants. The mouth should be inspected after eating and rinsed with water, milk, or formula if necessary to remove any beads clinging to the oral mucosa [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cystic-fibrosis-assessment-and-management-of-pancreatic-insufficiency/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>].</p><p>Limited evidence suggests that excessive doses of PERT are associated with fibrosing colonopathy, characterized by inflammation and strictures.

This problem tends to worsen over time, and at least 85 percent develop clinically important pancreatic insufficiency. There is a moderate association between the patient's genotype and the probability of developing pancreatic insufficiency (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F99734\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef99734 \">table 1</a>). (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Epidemiology'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>All patients with CF should be screened for pancreatic insufficiency; this is generally done with fecal elastase testing. Those with normal results should be retested periodically to monitor for development of pancreatic insufficiency. (See <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients with pancreatic insufficiency (as determined by fecal elastase testing or other measure) should be treated with pancreatic enzyme replacement therapy (PERT) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F57416\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef57416 \">table 3</a>). Dosing is generally estimated by the patient's weight and adjusted depending on the patient's response and symptoms. Suppression of gastric acid may improve the efficiency of PERT in selected patients, but this practice is based on limited evidence and must be balanced against potential adverse effects of the acid-suppressing medications. (See <a href=\"#H10\" class=\"local\">'Dosing considerations'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Prolonged contact of the enzyme supplements with oral mucosa may cause ulcers and should be avoided. PERT doses should be limited to 2500 lipase <span class=\"nowrap\">units/kg</span> body weight per meal to avoid fibrosing colonopathy. (See <a href=\"#H11\" class=\"local\">'Adverse effects'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Even with optimal management, patients with pancreatic insufficiency are at risk for growth failure, deficiencies of fat-soluble vitamins and other micronutrients, and bone disease. Prevention and monitoring for these complications are discussed separately.
