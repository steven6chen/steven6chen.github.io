PFP is characterized by pain around or behind the patella that is aggravated by one or more activities that involve loading the patellofemoral joint during weight bearing on a flexed knee, and that cannot be attributed to another discrete intra-articular (eg, meniscus tear) or peripatellar (eg, patellar tendinopathy) pathology. PFP is the most common cause of knee pain seen by primary care physicians, orthopedic surgeons, and sports medicine specialists [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/patellofemoral-pain/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>]. The etiology of PFP remains unclear, and diagnosis and treatment can be challenging. Research suggests that PFP is often recalcitrant and symptoms can persist for years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/patellofemoral-pain/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. &#160;</p><p>This topic review will discuss the pathophysiology, diagnosis, and management of PFP. An approach to the diagnosis of knee pain and other specific causes of knee pain are reviewed elsewhere.

PFP describes a symptom complex and is a diagnosis of exclusion.</p><p>The terminology used to describe PFP is used inconsistently and can be confusing. Common synonymous terms include retropatellar pain syndrome, runner's knee, lateral facet compression syndrome, and idiopathic anterior knee pain. The term chondromalacia patella is used to describe pathologic changes in the articular cartilage of the patella, such as softening, erosion, and fragmentation. While frequently confused with PFP, chondromalacia patella is a pathologic diagnosis and constitutes a distinct cause of knee pain [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/patellofemoral-pain/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">EPIDEMIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patellofemoral pain (PFP) is among the most common diagnoses in sports medicine. Although PFP is often seen in active individuals and may account for 25 to 40 percent of all knee problems seen in a sports injury clinic, the true incidence is not known [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/patellofemoral-pain/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. PFP affects many running athletes and constitutes nearly 25 percent of all identified knee injuries [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/patellofemoral-pain/abstract/6-8\" class=\"abstract_t\">6-8</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-running-injuries-of-the-lower-extremity\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of running injuries of the lower extremity&quot;</a>.)</p><p>PFP more commonly affects women [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/patellofemoral-pain/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. In a seven year review of patients diagnosed with PFP at a sports medicine clinic, the ratio of women to men was nearly 2:1 (33.2 versus 18.1 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/patellofemoral-pain/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. Another retrospective review found similar results [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/patellofemoral-pain/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].</p><p>PFP occurs disproportionately in active adolescents and adults in the second and third decades of life [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/patellofemoral-pain/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. One observational study found a prevalence of over 20 percent among adolescents [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/patellofemoral-pain/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h1\">ANATOMY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Knowledge of the knee's extensor mechanism and the complexity of the articulation between the patella and the femoral trochlea are fundamental to understanding patellofemoral pain (PFP).</p><p>The patella is a sesamoid bone that lies within the quadriceps tendon and rides in the trochlear groove of the distal femur. Its primary function is to improve leverage for knee extension. Articular cartilage on both the underside of the patella and the trochlear groove interface at the patellofemoral articulation. Proper tracking within the trochlear groove requires a balance of the forces acting on the patella [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/patellofemoral-pain/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. Key landmarks for the evaluation of PFP relate to this balance of forces at the patella and include (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F54565\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef54565 \">figure 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/patellofemoral-pain/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Proximal knee: quadriceps tendon</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Lateral knee: lateral retinaculum, attachment of the vastus lateralis, iliotibial band</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Medial knee: medial retinaculum, attachment of the vastus medialis</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Distal knee: patellar tendon and its attachment at the tibial tubercle</p><p/><p>Other structures surrounding the patella that should be examined as part of the evaluation for PFP include the fat pads dorsal to and along alongside the patellar tendon (the fat pad of Hoffa) and the subcutaneous and deep infrapatellar bursae of the patellar tendon.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h1\">ETIOLOGY AND RISK FACTORS</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Overview</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patellofemoral pain (PFP) appears to be multifactorial, resulting from a complex interaction among intrinsic anatomic and extrinsic training factors. Although clinicians frequently make the diagnosis of PFP, no consensus exists about its etiology or the factors most responsible for causing pain [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/patellofemoral-pain/abstract/1,8,12,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,8,12,13</a>]. Overuse, malalignment, and trauma are commonly cited causative factors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/patellofemoral-pain/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. Of these, overuse (ie, training overload) is most common (see <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'Overload'</a> below and <a href=\"#H8\" class=\"local\">'Malalignment'</a> below and <a href=\"#H9\" class=\"local\">'Trauma'</a> below). Early sports specialization has been identified as a risk factor for the development of PFP [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/patellofemoral-pain/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. </p><p>The concept of overloading the knee's extensor mechanism is fundamental to all theories of the pathophysiology underlying PFP. The overload may or may not involve malalignment. Overload likely leads to such injuries as subchondral bone degeneration, retinacular strain, and damage to small nerves, which culminate in PFP. (See <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'Overload'</a> below.)</p><p>One theory, commonly referred to as &quot;patellar tracking,&quot; suggests that anterior knee pain arises from abnormal force generation and distribution during movement of the patella within the femoral trochlea. Articular cartilage is poorly innervated and pain correlates poorly with the extent of articular cartilage lesions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/patellofemoral-pain/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. Therefore, the most likely sources of pain are subchondral bone, synovium, retinaculum, skin, muscle, and nerve [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/patellofemoral-pain/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>].</p><p>In contrast to traditional structural and biomechanical mechanisms, one alternative explanation emphasizes abnormal tissue homeostasis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/patellofemoral-pain/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. According to this theory, a number of interrelated pathophysiologic processes, including inflamed synovial lining and fat pad tissues, retinacular neuromas, increased intraosseous pressure, and increased osseous metabolic activity of the patella, create pain and dysfunction.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Overload</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The majority of patients with PFP has no history of trauma and do not demonstrate malalignment during physical or radiographic examinations. In contrast, a careful history often identifies activities that overload the patellofemoral joint potentially leading to injury, and possibly disturbances in tissue homeostasis, culminating in PFP [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/patellofemoral-pain/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>].</p><p>Several studies note that runners' total mileage (or volume) correlates with the development of PFP [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/patellofemoral-pain/abstract/16,17\" class=\"abstract_t\">16,17</a>]. Furthermore, patients with PFP often report that symptoms began during a period of increased physical activity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/patellofemoral-pain/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. PFP occurs more often in patients participating in competitive sports than age matched controls, and correlates with increasing levels of physical activity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/patellofemoral-pain/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>].</p><p>Studies among military recruits have identified a number of risk factors that consistently correlate with overuse lower extremity injuries [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/patellofemoral-pain/abstract/19,20\" class=\"abstract_t\">19,20</a>]. These include fitness level upon entry into the service, prior exercise behavior, body mass index (BMI) over 25, and training load. A high BMI is associated with increased risk for PFP generally [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/patellofemoral-pain/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Malalignment</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Proper function of the patellofemoral joint requires interplay among numerous static and dynamic structures involving the entire lower extremity as the patella tracks along the trochlea. Multiple authors postulate that patellar malalignment, resulting in abnormal patellar tracking, is the primary cause of PFP. The many studies of malalignment generally subdivide it into static and dynamic components.</p><p>Static biomechanical abnormalities include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Leg length discrepancy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/patellofemoral-pain/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Abnormal foot morphology [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/patellofemoral-pain/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Hamstrings and hip musculature tightness [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/patellofemoral-pain/abstract/24-27\" class=\"abstract_t\">24-27</a>]</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Abnormal patellar mobility [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/patellofemoral-pain/abstract/28,29\" class=\"abstract_t\">28,29</a>]</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Angular and rotational deformities of the lower extremity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/patellofemoral-pain/abstract/18,30\" class=\"abstract_t\">18,30</a>]</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Hallux valgus [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/patellofemoral-pain/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>] </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Trochlear morphology [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/patellofemoral-pain/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>] </p><p/><p>Dynamic biomechanical abnormalities include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Muscle weakness or imbalance (eg, vastus medialis and hip abductors) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/patellofemoral-pain/abstract/25,33-35\" class=\"abstract_t\">25,33-35</a>]</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Knee abduction impulses [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/patellofemoral-pain/abstract/25,36\" class=\"abstract_t\">25,36</a>]</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Hip weakness and adduction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/patellofemoral-pain/abstract/37-40\" class=\"abstract_t\">37-40</a>]</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Ground reaction forces [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/patellofemoral-pain/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Excessive foot pronation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/patellofemoral-pain/abstract/25,37,41,42\" class=\"abstract_t\">25,37,41,42</a>]</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Insufficient foot pronation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/patellofemoral-pain/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>]</p><p/><p>Studies of the biomechanical factors that potentially contribute to PFP demonstrate conflicting results, a lack of reproducibility, and no firm conclusions. Authors consistently cite the difficulty of research due to PFP&rsquo;s likely multifactorial nature. However, new research tools and studies continue to emerge.&nbsp;As an example, a study using functional MRI found that patients with PFP did not demonstrate differences in quadriceps muscle recruitment when compared with controls [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/patellofemoral-pain/abstract/43\" class=\"abstract_t\">43</a>]. </p><p>Several studies have concluded that dynamic forces play a major role in the development of PFP, particularly hip abductor weakness [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/patellofemoral-pain/abstract/5,39,44,45\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,39,44,45</a>]. One prospective observational study in female runners assessed the role of hip biomechanics and reported that greater hip adduction angles were strongly associated with an increased risk for developing PFP [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/patellofemoral-pain/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>].&nbsp;A systematic review of ten case-control studies reported that dynamic malalignment related to weakness of the gluteus medius may stem from delayed and briefer activation of this muscle, as demonstrated by electromyography [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/patellofemoral-pain/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>].</p><p>Despite these findings, the role of hip abductor weakness in patients who develop PFP remains unclear and is a subject of active research. The authors of another systematic review noted that while multiple cross sectional studies have demonstrated hip abductor weakness in patients with PFP, the few prospective studies performed have not found an association between hip weakness and increased risk for developing the condition [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/patellofemoral-pain/abstract/46\" class=\"abstract_t\">46</a>]. Moreover, in one prospective study involving 255 adolescent female athletes, those who developed PFP demonstrated greater hip abduction strength [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/patellofemoral-pain/abstract/47\" class=\"abstract_t\">47</a>].</p><p>Faulty biomechanics with foot pronation or supination may play a role in PFP. In a prospective trial involving military recruits, under-pronation best predicted patellofemoral pain [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/patellofemoral-pain/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>]. The authors postulate that both excessive and insufficient pronation may play an important role [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/patellofemoral-pain/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>]. In our clinical experience, seemingly innocent biomechanical abnormalities, when unmasked through overload, can lead to PFP.</p><p>Of the many static abnormalities that may contribute to PFP, the role of the Q angle has been the subject of numerous studies (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F55389\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef55389 \">figure 2</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/patellofemoral-pain/abstract/48,49\" class=\"abstract_t\">48,49</a>]. According to a systematic review of prospective studies, Q angle is not a risk factor for PFP [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/patellofemoral-pain/abstract/50\" class=\"abstract_t\">50</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h2\">Trauma</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Direct and indirect injuries can damage structures around the patellofemoral joint. Direct blows sustained during falls, contact sports, or motor vehicle collisions (eg, knee striking dashboard) can injure the patella and trochlea, including articular surfaces, and surrounding structures. Indirect injuries from falls may include patellar dislocation or subluxations, retinacular strain, or damage to the articular cartilage.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h1\">DIAGNOSIS AND DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patellofemoral pain (PFP) is a clinical diagnosis, with no pathognomonic sign or symptom. For most patients a careful history and physical examination establish the diagnosis, but the clinician must first exclude other conditions that mimic PFP. Typically, knee pain from PFP worsens with squatting, running, prolonged sitting, or when ascending or descending steps. Pain is often poorly localized &quot;under&quot; or &quot;around&quot; the patella, and is usually described as &quot;achy&quot; but may be &quot;sharp&quot;. Examination findings consistent with PFP are described below; the broad differential diagnosis of anterior knee pain is reviewed separately. (See <a href=\"#H13\" class=\"local\">'Physical examination'</a> below and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=approach-to-the-adult-with-knee-pain-likely-of-musculoskeletal-origin\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Approach to the adult with knee pain likely of musculoskeletal origin&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=approach-to-the-adult-with-unspecified-knee-pain\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Approach to the adult with unspecified knee pain&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Six anatomic areas are thought to contribute to patellofemoral pain: subchondral bone, synovium, retinaculum, skin, nerve, and muscle [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/patellofemoral-pain/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. The differential diagnosis of anterior knee pain involves these structures (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F59940\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef59940 \">table 1</a>). (See <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Etiology and risk factors'</a> above.)</p><p>The clinician must distinguish PFP from patellofemoral osteoarthritis, patellofemoral instability, and similar conditions that cause anterior knee pain. Patellofemoral osteoarthritis (PF OA) generally occurs in patients who are older than those who develop PFP and has characteristic radiographic findings. There is no known link between PFP and PF OA [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/patellofemoral-pain/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. The patient with patellofemoral instability may have a history of patellar dislocation or describe a sensation of instability or movement of the patella. Both of these disorders, while related to PFP, require specific treatments unrelated to PFP. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-osteoarthritis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of osteoarthritis&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=recognition-and-initial-management-of-patellar-dislocations\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Recognition and initial management of patellar dislocations&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL PRESENTATION AND EXAMINATION</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h2\">History</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The diagnosis of patellofemoral pain (PFP) is based primarily upon history [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/patellofemoral-pain/abstract/48\" class=\"abstract_t\">48</a>]. The onset of anterior knee pain may be gradual or acute, and may be precipitated by trauma. Pain may occur in one or both knees. Typically knee pain worsens with squatting, running, prolonged sitting, or when ascending or descending steps [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/patellofemoral-pain/abstract/48\" class=\"abstract_t\">48</a>]. Pain is often poorly localized &quot;under&quot; or &quot;around&quot; the patella, and is usually described as &quot;achy&quot; but may be &quot;sharp&quot;. Some patients may describe the affected knee as &quot;giving way&quot; or &quot;buckling&quot;. In PFP, this perceived instability may be due to pain inhibiting proper contraction of the quadriceps, but it must be distinguished from instability arising from a patellar dislocation or subluxation, or from ligamentous injury of the knee.</p><p>Although some patients may describe a &quot;catching&quot; sensation under the patella, true locking of the knee or effusion are signs of intraarticular pathology NOT explained by the diagnosis of PFP. Such findings require further evaluation (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=approach-to-the-adult-with-unspecified-knee-pain\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Approach to the adult with unspecified knee pain&quot;</a>). Patients may describe an audible &quot;popping&quot; or &quot;creaking&quot; often after standing following prolonged sitting, or when ascending or descending stairs.</p><p>Overload and trauma are important risk factors for PFP. The clinician should inquire about exercise history to identify changes in training load. It is also important to ask about any prior knee surgery or knee injuries, especially to the patella.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h2\">Physical examination</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14\"><span class=\"h3\">Knee examination</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A detailed description of a complete knee examination is presented elsewhere (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=approach-to-the-adult-with-unspecified-knee-pain\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Approach to the adult with unspecified knee pain&quot;</a>).

Despite the dearth of evidence, the tests described below are commonly performed and may help to determine the diagnosis when considered in the context of the history and general examination findings. According to one small observational study, combinations of functional signs and tests, such as pain with resisted quadriceps contraction and pain with squatting, may be more diagnostic of PFP than any one examination maneuver [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/patellofemoral-pain/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Squatting &ndash; 80 percent of patients with PFP experience pain with squatting [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/patellofemoral-pain/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patellar tendon palpation &ndash; Tenderness directly ventral or dorsal to the patellar tendon is associated with patellar bursitis and tendinopathy, while tenderness along either side of the patellar tendon is associated with inflammation of the fat pad of Hoffa.

Translation less than one-quarter of the patella's width signifies a tight retinaculum, while translation of three-quarters of the patella's width signifies a hypermobile patella [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/patellofemoral-pain/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Apprehension test &ndash; With the quadriceps relaxed and the knee flexed to 30 degrees, apply pressure to the medial patella to push the patella laterally while looking at the patient's face. Apprehension as the patella reaches maximum passive displacement and the patient attempts to straighten the knee are a positive sign for patellar subluxation. The test has a reported sensitivity of 39 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/patellofemoral-pain/abstract/54\" class=\"abstract_t\">54</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Popliteal angle &ndash; The popliteal angle is a measure of hamstring flexibility. Tight hamstrings contribute to compressive forces across the patellofemoral joint and are associated with PFP [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/patellofemoral-pain/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">With the patient relaxed and supine and their knee bent, flex the hip to 90 degrees, then gently extend the knee by lifting the lower leg until you appreciate resistance (felt as tension in the hamstring) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F77452\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef77452 \">picture 2</a>). The hip remains at 90 degrees of flexion while the knee is extended. The angle of the leg at the point of resistance is the popliteal angle, which is a relatively objective measure of hamstring flexibility. At 0 degrees the entire lower extremity is perpendicular to the exam table. Measurements greater than 20 degrees are consistent with hamstring inflexibility. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Evaluation for dynamic malalignment:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">While the patient is barefoot and in shorts, observe their gait for excessive varus or valgus knee movement.

Perform a Trendelenburg test to assess for gluteus medius weakness. The test is performed by having the patient stand on one leg and observing the pelvis. The ipsilateral iliac crest should remain level or rise slightly; a drop of the iliac crest indicates gluteus medius weakness. Because fatigability of the hip abductors may be a component of dynamic instability, excessive knee valgus motion may not be apparent in the office setting.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Static testing of hip abductor and external rotator strength may help identify weakness and confirm observations noted on dynamic assessment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/patellofemoral-pain/abstract/33,39,44,45\" class=\"abstract_t\">33,39,44,45</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patellar grind &ndash; We believe this test is unnecessarily painful and unhelpful and suggest it not be performed.

In the absence of a history of trauma, overt instability, effusion, prior surgery, or pain at rest, imaging is not performed until the patient's symptoms fail to improve after one to two months of appropriate conservative therapy. Radiographic findings do not correlate well with clinical complaints and frequently the injured side is difficult to differentiate from the uninjured side [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/patellofemoral-pain/abstract/56\" class=\"abstract_t\">56</a>].</p><p>When imaging is indicated, plain films of the knee (weight bearing PA, weight bearing lateral, and sunrise view (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F75306\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef75306 \">image 1</a>)) are useful to rule out other sources of anterior knee pain, including bipartite patella (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F75919\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef75919 \">image 2</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F50267\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef50267 \">image 3</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RADIOL%2F91644\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef91644 \">image 4</a>), osteoarthritis (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RHEUM%2F74675\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef74675 \">image 5</a>), loose bodies, and occult fractures.</p><p>Advanced imaging, including magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), computed tomography (CT), musculoskeletal ultrasound (MSK US), and radionuclide scanning, is not indicated in the initial evaluation of the patient with PFP, but may help identify other pathology. MRI can detect chondromalacia patella, articular cartilage injuries, osteochondritis dissecans, and injuries to the patellar retinaculum and patellofemoral ligament. CT scanning with serial flexion views can identify patellofemoral malalignment and instability. MSK US may show enhanced echogenicity suggestive of patellar tendinopathy. Bone scans can reveal increased bone activity associated with subchondral stress. Even advanced imaging is limited in that there is often poor correlation between radiographic and clinical findings.</p><p>In one study correlating clinical exam to MRI and ultrasound findings in PFP, slight effusion or increased signal intensity at the attachment site of the medial retinaculum were present on MRI in two out of five severe cases of PFP [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/patellofemoral-pain/abstract/57\" class=\"abstract_t\">57</a>]. The synovium, retinaculum, joint capsule, fat pad of Hoffa, and subchondral bone appeared normal in all cases. MSK US revealed a slight to moderate effusion and enlargement of the synovium in two of five severe cases.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H17\"><span class=\"h1\">INITIAL TREATMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The goals of treatment for patellofemoral pain (PFP) are to reduce pain, improve patellofemoral tracking and alignment, and return the patient to as a high a level of function as possible. The acute phase of treatment during the first week focuses on pain control; the subsequent recovery phase focuses on modification of risk factors and biomechanical deficits.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H18\"><span class=\"h2\">Acute phase</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Activity modification &ndash; Most experts believe that overload plays an important role in the development of PFP. Patients need to avoid activities that cause pain during rehabilitation. Most runners need to reduce their running volume and those with severe signs or symptoms (eg, limping) should curtail all running activities. Patients with less severe symptoms may need to stop only more extreme training, such as hill running and stadium step running. Athletes can maintain aerobic fitness by using a stationary bicycle (recumbent or upright), an upper body cycle, or by swimming, water running, or other activities, provided they do not cause pain.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) &ndash; There is no evidence to support the long-term use of NSAIDs for the treatment of PFP. According to one systematic review, limited evidence supports their use in the short term (two to three weeks) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/patellofemoral-pain/abstract/58\" class=\"abstract_t\">58</a>]. In this review, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=naproxen-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">naproxen</a> produced more significant pain reduction compared with placebo, but <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aspirin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">aspirin</a> did not.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Other modalities &ndash; Although formal studies are lacking, applying ice to the anterior knee is reasonable to relieve pain associated with PFP. There is no empiric evidence to support the use of ultrasound, iontophoresis, phonophoresis, or electrical stimulation in the treatment of PFP [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/patellofemoral-pain/abstract/58-62\" class=\"abstract_t\">58-62</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H19\"><span class=\"h2\">Recovery phase</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H20\"><span class=\"h3\">Approach</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Although many randomized clinical trials assessing treatments for PFP have been performed, the results do not support any specific rehabilitation protocol [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/patellofemoral-pain/abstract/63,64\" class=\"abstract_t\">63,64</a>]. A relatively large proportion of patients (about 40 percent) diagnosed with PFP continue to have symptoms one year following typical conservative care [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/patellofemoral-pain/abstract/3,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,5</a>]. Evidence does suggest that exercises to increase knee and hip strength improve symptoms and function [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/patellofemoral-pain/abstract/63-67\" class=\"abstract_t\">63-67</a>]. According to one randomized trial, supervised physical therapy may be superior to a home exercise program [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/patellofemoral-pain/abstract/68\" class=\"abstract_t\">68</a>]. We have included a sample rehabilitation prescription (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F80867\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef80867 \">table 2</a>).</p><p>A comprehensive approach to treatment should systematically address potential deficiencies in the interrelated group of muscles and other structures involved in moving the lower body (ie, the lower body kinetic chain).

Further research is needed.</p><p>Ideally, patients should begin physical therapy under the guidance of a knowledgeable physical therapist or comparable professional. For those unable to do so, general exercises for the treatment of PFP can be found at several websites, including the American Academy of Family Practice (<a href=\"http://www.aafp.org/afp/991101ap/991101b.html&amp;token=Zhk3SsDNzGEOSDTcBVv9fZB+NXJCsAr5cVcRAmT7mRXLdkdRnpPvH0mJRsU4A5K1&amp;TOPIC_ID=204\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">www.aafp.org/afp/991101ap/991101b.html</a>) and the Lennox Hill Hospital Nicholas Institute (<a href=\"http://www.nismat.org/patients/injury-evaluation-treatment/lower-body/patellofemoral-pain-syndrome&amp;token=z5PnYajPJo6sALrc2sGD5WMrXTxNmbyaoiZs2r9gEieaCkk5F7roWwsNFudQ8byMtM/r3cAX0x3reTg0Bjy+e8t75FyjJ+siYLvZb4Yp5febNq3AmBQF26cogUcHim8o&amp;TOPIC_ID=204\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">www.nismat.org/patients/injury-evaluation-treatment/lower-body/patellofemoral-pain-syndrome</a>). These exercises should not cause pain. Patients experiencing anything more than mild soreness should reduce the intensity of the inciting exercise. Patients with persistent or severe pain from rehabilitation exercises should be reevaluated by their clinician.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H21\"><span class=\"h3\">Stretching</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Although an association between inflexibility and injury remains unproven, the decrease in stress at the patellofemoral joint provided by increased quadriceps, hamstring, and iliotibial band flexibility seems a reasonable therapeutic goal. Observational studies suggest an association exists between decreased quadriceps flexibility and PFP [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/patellofemoral-pain/abstract/24,69\" class=\"abstract_t\">24,69</a>]. In a prospective case control study, a regime of quadriceps stretching decreased pain and improved function among patients with PFP, although these improvements did not correlate closely with the gains in quadriceps flexibility [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/patellofemoral-pain/abstract/70\" class=\"abstract_t\">70</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H22\"><span class=\"h3\">Hip strengthening</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Several observational studies implicate hip abductor weakness in the development of PFP [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/patellofemoral-pain/abstract/33,35,39,44,45\" class=\"abstract_t\">33,35,39,44,45</a>]. In response, many therapists incorporate hip abductor strengthening into their rehabilitation programs.</p><p>Although published evidence is limited it suggests that strengthening of the hip musculature reduces pain and improves function [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/patellofemoral-pain/abstract/71\" class=\"abstract_t\">71</a>]. In one small single-blinded randomized trial, improvements in pain and function were noted in patients with PFP whose rehabilitation program emphasized hip strengthening exercises [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/patellofemoral-pain/abstract/72\" class=\"abstract_t\">72</a>]. In an observational study, a six week program of closed kinetic chain hip strengthening and stretching resulted in significant improvements in pain and function [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/patellofemoral-pain/abstract/73\" class=\"abstract_t\">73</a>]. Closed kinetic chain exercises are performed with the feet planted in a fixed position throughout the exercise (eg, squat, leg press). Case reports describe similar rehabilitation programs focused on improving core and hip stability and strength that allowed athletes to return to their previous level of activity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/patellofemoral-pain/abstract/74,75\" class=\"abstract_t\">74,75</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H23\"><span class=\"h3\">Quadriceps strengthening</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Quadriceps muscle weakness is a common problem among patients with PFP [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/patellofemoral-pain/abstract/76,77\" class=\"abstract_t\">76,77</a>]. Treatment plans for PFP should include general quadriceps strengthening exercises using closed or open kinetic chain movements, depending upon the severity of symptoms and biomechanical dysfunction. Closed kinetic chain (CKC) exercises are performed with the feet planted in a fixed position throughout the exercise (eg, squat, leg press) and thus provide greater stability. With open kinetic chain (OKC) exercises the feet change position.</p><p>Some researchers believe CKC exercises are better tolerated and produce less patellofemoral joint stress than OKC exercises [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/patellofemoral-pain/abstract/78\" class=\"abstract_t\">78</a>] and may preferentially activate the vastus medialis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/patellofemoral-pain/abstract/75\" class=\"abstract_t\">75</a>]. In one small randomized controlled trial, the selected CKC exercise (semisquat) was more effective than the OKC exercise (straight leg raise) in treating &quot;patellar chondromalacia&quot; [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/patellofemoral-pain/abstract/79\" class=\"abstract_t\">79</a>].

Many experts suggest that exercises to improve core strength be included in rehabilitation programs for PFP [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/patellofemoral-pain/abstract/81\" class=\"abstract_t\">81</a>]. Such exercises generally involve multiple joints and incorporate trunk rotation and flexion of the knee and hip.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H25\"><span class=\"h2\">Adjunctive therapy</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H26\"><span class=\"h3\">Foot orthoses</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Limited evidence suggests that foot orthoses may be useful for symptom relief in some patients with PFP [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/patellofemoral-pain/abstract/12,66,67,82,83\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,66,67,82,83</a>]. Semirigid full length foot orthotics can help control excessive foot overpronation or supination, which are associated with dynamic instability, and reduce impact. </p><p>Two systematic reviews of studies of limited quality suggest that orthotics and physical therapy are more effective than physical therapy alone in reducing symptoms of PFP [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/patellofemoral-pain/abstract/65,66\" class=\"abstract_t\">65,66</a>]. However, two other systematic reviews with more stringent inclusion criteria report that, although the available evidence is weak, there does not appear to be a clear benefit from treatment with foot orthoses [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/patellofemoral-pain/abstract/84,85\" class=\"abstract_t\">84,85</a>]. The highest quality trial included in both these systematic reviews included 179 patients with symptoms of PFP of at least six weeks duration without prior treatment who were randomly assigned to treatment with orthotics, flat inserts, physical therapy, or orthotics plus physical therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/patellofemoral-pain/abstract/83\" class=\"abstract_t\">83</a>]. Although there was a trend towards greater short-term improvement among patients treated with orthotics (relative risk [RR] 0.66; 99% CI 0.05-1.17), no significant difference in long-term outcomes were noted.</p><p>An important unresolved clinical issue with foot orthoses is determining which subset of patients may benefit. According to a few observational studies, foot orthoses may be most effective in individuals with increased dynamic foot pronation and midfoot flexibility [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/patellofemoral-pain/abstract/42,67,86\" class=\"abstract_t\">42,67,86</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H27\"><span class=\"h3\">Bracing and patellar taping</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Although the foundation of treatment for PFP remains exercise and strengthening, if a patient cannot participate fully in rehabilitation exercises due to pain or does not make progress, it is reasonable to perform taping or patellofemoral bracing if this improves symptoms.</p><p>A meta-analysis of 20 studies of patellar taping concluded that there is moderate evidence in support of this therapy for both reducing pain and improving functional capacity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/patellofemoral-pain/abstract/87\" class=\"abstract_t\">87</a>]. The review found that tailored taping (versus untailored or non-customized taping) that controlled the lateral tilt, glide, and spin (ie, rotation) of the patella was important for efficacy and provided immediate pain relief, although benefits appear to fade in long-term follow up. In addition, taping plus exercise provided greater pain relief than exercise alone at four weeks. Taping may be less effective in patients with higher body mass indices [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/patellofemoral-pain/abstract/88\" class=\"abstract_t\">88</a>]. </p><p>According to two systematic reviews of controlled clinical trials involving patients with PFP, the available evidence is of limited quality but there does not appear to be a clear benefit from bracing for either reducing symptoms or improving function compared with physical therapy alone [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/patellofemoral-pain/abstract/85,89\" class=\"abstract_t\">85,89</a>].

One observational study concluded that running barefoot decreased peak patellofemoral joint stress by 12 percent in comparison to shod running [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/patellofemoral-pain/abstract/91\" class=\"abstract_t\">91</a>]. Minimalist running is reviewed separately.

All groups received conservative therapy that consisted of quadriceps strengthening, activity modification, and oral NSAIDs. Although both injection groups had better function at six weeks compared with the no-injection group, this difference was lost at six months.

If the patient reports recurrence or persistence of knee pain, assess the patient's compliance with and response to the prescribed therapy.</p><p>Have the patient explain in detail the exercises they have been doing. When did they first see the physical therapist? How many times a week do they go to physical therapy? How often do they do their home program? Have the patient demonstrate some of the exercises. Ask about their tolerance of the therapy and quantify their cardiovascular workouts (eg, &quot;I can ride the stationary bike for 10 minutes until my knee hurts,&quot; or &quot;I'm still running 25 miles per week&quot;).</p><p>Because overuse is a significant risk factor for PFP, activity levels need to be quantified. Ask about previously aggravating activities and assess improvement (eg, &quot;I can walk down stairs without pain now&quot;).</p><p>If there is improvement, continue physical therapy until the patient can perform all exercises without pain, and then slowly reintroduce activities which previously caused pain (eg, running). Increase activity levels in a gradual, step-wise progression, until the patient achieves the desired level. If symptoms are unchanged and the patient appears to be compliant with both therapy and activity modification, re-examine the patient to confirm the original diagnosis. Imaging with plain radiographs may be useful, as may orthotics, taping, or bracing if not previously done. If the compliant patient has not improved in three to six months of therapy, obtain an MRI or orthopedic consultation.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H30\"><span class=\"h1\">INDICATIONS FOR ORTHOPEDIC REFERRAL</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Evidence supporting surgical intervention for the treatment of patellofemoral pain (PFP) is lacking, and is not recommended in the 2016 PFP consensus statement [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/patellofemoral-pain/abstract/67\" class=\"abstract_t\">67</a>]. In rare cases, it may be considered when an extensive trial of nonoperative therapies have failed, but it is a treatment of last resort. Nonoperative therapy should be pursued for 24 months prior to considering operative intervention [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/patellofemoral-pain/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p>Before surgery, other causes of anterior knee pain should be carefully excluded and a clearly identified structural abnormality amenable to surgery (eg, tight lateral retinaculum) should exist. Any surgery for PFP must address the patient's specific characteristics of abnormal patellar tracking; inappropriate and overzealous surgery can lead to significant patient disability [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/patellofemoral-pain/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. </p><p>Patellar alignment, patellar resurfacing, and patellar arthroplasty comprise the three principal categories of operative intervention for PFP. Most studies evaluating such surgery are uncontrolled case series, so the effectiveness of operative intervention remains unclear. In one randomized controlled trial involving 56 patients with chronic PFP, no difference in outcome was found in patients treated with arthroscopy and a home exercise program compared with those treated with exercise alone [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/patellofemoral-pain/abstract/95,96\" class=\"abstract_t\">95,96</a>].

Long-term observational studies suggest that at two to eight years most patients with PFP patients report only mild occasional symptoms. In a seven year follow-up of patients from a randomized, controlled trial, nearly 85 percent treated with a home exercise program reported successful outcomes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/patellofemoral-pain/abstract/98\" class=\"abstract_t\">98</a>].</p><p>Not all patients with PFP successfully complete nonoperative therapy and return to sporting activity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/patellofemoral-pain/abstract/93\" class=\"abstract_t\">93</a>]. Some must retire prematurely from sports that aggravate PFP. Persistent abnormal tracking of the patella or patellar instability can lead to patellofemoral osteoarthritis or chronic pain. Risk factors associated with a poor long-term prognosis include a hypermobile patella, older age, and bilateral symptoms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/patellofemoral-pain/abstract/2,98\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,98</a>]. One predictor of a poor functional outcome is fear avoidance behavior; addressing psychological comorbidities may be an important intervention for individuals who are failing to progress [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/patellofemoral-pain/abstract/99\" class=\"abstract_t\">99</a>]. </p><p>The failure of nonoperative therapy does not imply successful surgical treatment. A significant number of patients do not improve or are made worse by PFP surgery, at times requiring a salvage procedure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/patellofemoral-pain/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H30\" class=\"local\">'Indications for orthopedic referral'</a> above.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H32\"><span class=\"h1\">RETURN TO SPORT OR WORK</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Return to sport for the patient with patellofemoral pain (PFP) follows basic guidelines applicable for all overuse injuries. The patient should demonstrate motion equal to that of the uninvolved extremity, and strength at least 80 percent that of the opposite side. The presence of significant quadriceps atrophy or an effusion precludes a return to full activity. The patient should have no complaints of nocturnal pain or pain with activities of daily living prior to beginning sports. In general, mild pain that diminishes with activity is not concerning. Increased pain should prompt termination of the activity and reassessment by the clinician.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4147527\"><span class=\"h1\">PREVENTION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>According to a randomized controlled trial conducted among army recruits in the United Kingdom, an exercise program much like that used to treat patellofemoral pain (PFP) may be effective at preventing the development of anterior knee pain [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/patellofemoral-pain/abstract/100\" class=\"abstract_t\">100</a>]. In this trial, 36 new cases of PFP (described as &ldquo;overuse anterior knee pain&rdquo;) developed in the control group of 743 recruits compared to 10 new cases among the 759 recruits who participated in the preventative exercise program (HR 0.25; 95% CI 0.13-0.52). </p><p>With the exception of the prevention exercises, recruits participated in the exact same training activities over the 14-week trial period. Physicians assessing the recruits were blinded to which groups participated in the intervention. The prevention program consisted of the following exercises:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Isometric hip abduction against a wall</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Forward lunges</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Single leg step downs</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Single leg squats</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Stretches for the quadriceps, iliotibial band, hamstrings, and calves </p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"PATIENT_INFORMATION\"><span class=\"h1\">INFORMATION FOR PATIENTS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>UpToDate offers two types of patient education materials, &ldquo;The Basics&rdquo; and &ldquo;Beyond the Basics&rdquo;. The Basics patient education pieces are written in plain language, at the 5<sup>th</sup> to 6<sup>th</sup> grade reading level, and they answer the four or five key questions a patient might have about a given condition. These articles are best for patients who want a general overview and who prefer short, easy-to-read materials. Beyond the Basics patient education pieces are longer, more sophisticated, and more detailed. These articles are written at the 10<sup>th</sup> to 12<sup>th</sup> grade reading level and are best for patients who want in-depth information and are comfortable with some medical jargon.</p><p>Here are the patient education articles that are relevant to this topic.

PFP is characterized by pain around or behind the patella that is aggravated by one or more activities that involve loading the patellofemoral joint during weight bearing on a flexed knee, and that cannot be attributed to another discrete intra-articular (eg, meniscus tear) or peripatellar (eg, patellar tendinopathy) pathology. There is no consensus about its pathophysiology. Overuse is common among patients with PFP. (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Epidemiology'</a> above and <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Etiology and risk factors'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>PFP has no pathognomonic sign or symptom. PFP is a clinical diagnosis made based upon the history, examination, and the exclusion of alternative diagnoses; plain films are not required for initial management. (See <a href=\"#H11\" class=\"local\">'Clinical presentation and examination'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Physical therapy focused upon improving the strength of the knee, hip, and core muscles, including the hip abductors and quadriceps, are generally effective as a sole treatment for PFP. (See <a href=\"#H19\" class=\"local\">'Recovery phase'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>There is no evidence to support the long-term use of nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) for the treatment of PFP; limited evidence supports their use for short-term pain relief. (See <a href=\"#H18\" class=\"local\">'Acute phase'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Surgical interventions for patellofemoral pain lack compelling evidence, but may be considered in rare cases when nonoperative therapies have failed. Nonoperative therapy should be pursued for 24 months prior to considering operative intervention and a clearly identified structural abnormality amenable to surgery (eg, tight lateral retinaculum) should exist. (See <a href=\"#H30\" class=\"local\">'Indications for orthopedic referral'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The majority of PFP patients experience a resolution of symptoms following conservative treatment, although the condition can be recalcitrant to treatment and symptoms may persist for years in some cases.</p></div><div id=\"topicAgreement\">Use of UpToDate is subject to the <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/legal/license\" class=\"licenseLink\" id=\"sla_in_page\">Subscription and License Agreement</a>.</div><div id=\"references\" class=\"headingAnchor\"><h1>REFERENCES</h1><ol id=\"reference\"><li><a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/patellofemoral-pain/abstract/1\" class=\"nounderline abstract_t\">Thome&eacute; R, Augustsson J, Karlsson J.
