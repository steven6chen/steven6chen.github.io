Laparoscopic gastrectomy (LG) was first described in Japan in 1994, where a distal gastrectomy with Billroth I gastroduodenostomy reconstruction was performed for an early-stage gastric cancer [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/laparoscopic-gastrectomy-for-cancer/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Since then, surgical experience with LG has been increasing, particularly in Eastern countries such as Japan, Korea, and China, where gastric adenocarcinoma is more prevalent.</p><p>The indications, patient selection, surgical techniques, postoperative care, and outcomes of LG for cancer are discussed in this topic. OG and LG for benign diseases (eg, peptic ulcer) or weight loss are discussed in other topics.

According to national surveys, LG accounted for approximately 25 percent of all gastric surgeries performed for cancer in Japan and South Korea as early as 2009 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/laparoscopic-gastrectomy-for-cancer/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. The efficacy of LG has been demonstrated for both early and locally advanced gastric cancers in Eastern countries.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2186314145\"><span class=\"h3\">Early gastric cancer</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Early gastric cancer is defined as invasive gastric cancer that invades no more deeply than the submucosa, regardless of lymph node metastasis (T1, any N, M0) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F77850\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef77850 \">table 1</a>). Early gastric cancer is of particular importance to patients in East Asia, where it accounts for 25 to 50 percent of all gastric cancers diagnosed because of screening programs. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=early-gastric-cancer-epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-staging\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Early gastric cancer: Epidemiology, clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and staging&quot;</a>.)</p><p>An early Japanese study involving 1294 patients undergoing LG (91.5 percent distal gastrectomy) for gastric cancer from 1994 to 2003 showed mortality and morbidity rates of 0 and 14.8 percent and a recurrence rate of 0.6 percent at a median follow-up of three years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/laparoscopic-gastrectomy-for-cancer/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. The five-year disease-free survival rate was 99.8 percent for stage IA disease, 98.7 percent for stage IB disease, and 85.7 percent for stage II disease.</p><p>A subsequent Japanese study (LOC-1) compared the outcomes of 3630 patients with early gastric cancer treated with LG or open gastrectomy (OG) from 2006 to 2012 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/laparoscopic-gastrectomy-for-cancer/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. By propensity score-matched analysis, there was no difference in five-year overall survival (97.1 percent LG versus 96.3 percent OG), three-year recurrence-free survival (97.7 versus 97.4 percent), or local recurrence rate (2.3 versus 2.4 percent). </p><p>In a Korean trial (KLASS-1), over 1400 patients with stage I early gastric cancer were randomly assigned to either open or laparoscopic distal gastrectomy between 2006 and 2010 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/laparoscopic-gastrectomy-for-cancer/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. The overall complication rate (13 versus 20 percent) and wound complication rate (3.6 versus 7 percent) were lower in the LG group. Major intra-abdominal complication and perioperative mortality rates were similar between the two groups. At five years, preliminary data showed that the overall (95.8 percent LG and 95.9 percent OG) and relapse-free survival rates were not different between the two groups either [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/laparoscopic-gastrectomy-for-cancer/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. </p><p>Another large trial from Japan (JCOG0912) randomly assigned 921 patients with clinical stage I gastric cancer in the middle or lower third of the stomach to either LG or OG from 2010 to 2013 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/laparoscopic-gastrectomy-for-cancer/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. Compared with OG, LG required longer operative time but had less blood loss. Otherwise, there was no difference in short-term morbidity and mortality rates. Oncologic outcomes will not be due to be analyzed until 2018.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2578770416\"><span class=\"h3\">Locally advanced gastric cancer</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Locally advanced gastric cancer invades deeper than the submucosa, regardless of lymph node metastasis (&ge;T2, any N, M0) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F77850\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef77850 \">table 1</a>). As their experience with LG for early gastric cancer grew, Eastern surgeons began to treat locally advanced gastric cancers with LG as well. In particular, the paucity of early gastric cancer and abundance of locally advanced gastric cancer in China (relative to Japan and Korea) prompted surgeons there to pursue LG for locally advanced gastric cancers.</p><p>A single-center, nonrandomized study from China included 44 patients with locally advanced gastric cancer treated with either laparoscopic or open distal gastrectomy after neoadjuvant chemotherapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/laparoscopic-gastrectomy-for-cancer/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. Compared with OG, LG was associated with similar blood loss, mean operative time, number of retrieved lymph nodes, and negative margin rate. </p><p>In a retrospective study of over 1100 patients in China who underwent LG for stage I, II, or III gastric cancer between 2003 and 2009, perioperative morbidity and mortality rates were 10 and 0.1 percent, overall and locoregional recurrence rates were 16.7 and 2.3 percent, and survival at a median follow-up of 12 months varied between 60 and 90 percent, depending on disease stage [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/laparoscopic-gastrectomy-for-cancer/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].</p><p>In a Chinese trial conducted from 2012 to 2014, over 1000 patients with locally advanced gastric cancer (T2-4, N0-3, M0) were randomly assigned to either LG or OG, both including a D2 lymphadenectomy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/laparoscopic-gastrectomy-for-cancer/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. Only short-term outcomes have been reported: LG and OG resulted in similar perioperative morbidity (15 versus 13 percent) and mortality rates (0.4 versus 0 percent) as well as compliance rates of D2 lymphadenectomy (both &gt;99 percent).</p><p>Two other trials, KLASS-2 from Korea [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/laparoscopic-gastrectomy-for-cancer/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>] and JLSSG0901 from Japan [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/laparoscopic-gastrectomy-for-cancer/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>], are currently ongoing to evaluate the efficacy of LG for locally advanced gastric cancer.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1426999265\"><span class=\"h2\">Western experience</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Compared with Eastern countries, LG is underutilized in Western countries. An analysis of the University Health System Consortium database demonstrated that 89.5, 8.2, and 2.3 percent of over 9500 gastrectomies were performed open, laparoscopically, and robotically from 2008 to 2013 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/laparoscopic-gastrectomy-for-cancer/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. Another analysis of the United States National Cancer Database showed that 73.4, 23.1, and 3.5 percent of over 6400 gastrectomies for cancer were performed open, laparoscopically, and robotically between 2010 and 2012 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/laparoscopic-gastrectomy-for-cancer/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. Limited by a lower prevalence of gastric cancer, fewer studies and no randomized trials of LG have been conducted in Western countries. </p><p>In a study of 87 LGs and 87 matched OGs performed for stage I, II, or III gastric cancer from 2005 to 2013 at the Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, LG was associated with a longer operative time but shorter length of stay and fewer early and late complications [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/laparoscopic-gastrectomy-for-cancer/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. </p><p>The same study using the National Cancer Database mentioned above showed LG to be associated with a shorter length of hospital stay (by a day), a greater lymph node yield (odds ratio 1.16 of having &ge;15 nodes), and comparable negative margin and mortality rates compared with OG [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/laparoscopic-gastrectomy-for-cancer/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>].</p><p>A prospective randomized multicenter trial of LG versus OG in patients with resectable gastric adenocarcinoma was opened in the Netherlands on December 1, 2014 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/laparoscopic-gastrectomy-for-cancer/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. However, results are not expected until 2022. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1519274607\"><span class=\"h2\">East versus West</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Clinicopathological presentations of gastric cancer are known to vary widely between Eastern and Western countries. In a study comparing all patients undergoing curative resections (R0) for gastric cancer at two high-volume hospitals from the United States (US; 711 patients) and Korea (1646 patients), age and body mass index were significantly higher in US patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/laparoscopic-gastrectomy-for-cancer/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. The location of tumors was more often proximal in the US (39 versus 9 percent) and distal in Korea (54 versus 33 percent). Korean patients had more early-stage tumors (42 versus 28 percent stage IA) and a greater lymph node yield (97 versus 79 percent, &ge;15 lymph nodes). With the exception of lymph node yield, all the other factors were potentially biased against US patients, which may at least partially explain why Eastern patients have a better survival rate than Western patients. </p><p>There is also evidence that Eastern patients may have superior survival compared with Western patients on a stage-for-stage basis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/laparoscopic-gastrectomy-for-cancer/abstract/17,18\" class=\"abstract_t\">17,18</a>]. However, it remains controversial whether the difference in survival is due to tumor biology; patient, genetic, and environmental factors; or treatment. There is no suggestion, however, that the survival is influenced by technical aspects such as the use of LG.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4178591148\"><span class=\"h1\">PATIENT SELECTION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Studies cited above suggest that LG is safe, feasible, and oncologically sound when performed by experienced surgeons in both Eastern and Western countries. Whether to pursue LG or open gastrectomy (OG) depends on the following provider and patient factors.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3920423179\"><span class=\"h2\">Provider factors</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>LG is a technically demanding procedure that requires advanced skills and teamwork. The surgeon performing LG must be experienced with both complex gastrointestinal and advanced minimally invasive procedures and be supported by staff and hospital resources of equal competence. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1440876302\"><span class=\"h3\">Surgeon experience</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>LG is a complex minimally invasive procedure. The &quot;learning curve&quot; associated with becoming proficient in performing LG, particularly the D2 lymphadenectomy and reconstruction portions of the operation, can be quite steep. </p><p>Studies from Eastern countries estimated that surgeons would require at least between 40 and 60, and possibly over 90, cases of laparoscopic distal gastrectomy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/laparoscopic-gastrectomy-for-cancer/abstract/19-21\" class=\"abstract_t\">19-21</a>], or over 100 cases of laparoscopic total gastrectomy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/laparoscopic-gastrectomy-for-cancer/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>], to become proficient. In at least one study, performing fewer than 45 cases of laparoscopic total gastrectomy was associated with higher morbidity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/laparoscopic-gastrectomy-for-cancer/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. There have been no studies on the learning curve of LG from Western countries.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3927976077\"><span class=\"h3\">Hospital resources</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>An experienced surgeon needs to be supported by an operating room and anesthesia staff that is equally facile with handling advanced minimally invasive surgery. In the event that a complication occurs, additional support from critical care intensivists, therapeutic gastroenterologists, and interventional radiologists may be required. Expert physical therapy and nutritional support services are also imperative to good outcomes, as many patients with gastric cancer come to surgery in frail or debilitated conditions, especially after receiving neoadjuvant chemotherapy.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3602889694\"><span class=\"h2\">Patient factors</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patient-related factors, such as body habitus, comorbidities, and cancer stage, can also influence the choice of LG versus OG. Patients who have early gastric cancer and those who are free from significant cardiopulmonary comorbidities, obesity, and previous upper abdominal surgery are the best candidates for LG.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1627191901\"><span class=\"h3\">Comorbidities</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients with severe obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) or cardiac disease may not tolerate the prolonged pneumoperitoneum that is often required for LG. Such patients should undergo OG instead.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H977811886\"><span class=\"h3\">Obesity</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Obesity (body mass index &ge;30 <span class=\"nowrap\">kg/m<sup>2</sup>),</span> or increased visceral adiposity, can make LG with D2 lymphadenectomy technically challenging. Studies from Eastern countries found that LG in obese patients may require longer operative time than OG, although lymph node yield, postoperative recovery, and complication rate were not different [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/laparoscopic-gastrectomy-for-cancer/abstract/24-26\" class=\"abstract_t\">24-26</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H940728785\"><span class=\"h3\">Previous abdominal surgery</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Previous abdominal surgery may make LG technically challenging due to the presence of adhesions or altered anatomy. However, this factor alone should not preclude LG [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/laparoscopic-gastrectomy-for-cancer/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3929587685\"><span class=\"h3\">Disease extent</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients with early-stage disease without local invasion into surrounding structures or bulky lymphadenopathy are optimal candidates for surgeons to initiate a LG experience. Patients with locally advanced tumors that downstage after neoadjuvant therapy and those who undergo prophylactic total gastrectomy for <em>CDH1 </em>or other mutations may also be candidates for LG. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=surgical-management-of-hereditary-diffuse-gastric-cancer\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Surgical management of hereditary diffuse gastric cancer&quot;</a>.)</p><p>However, in the United States and other Western countries, patients often present in advanced stages of gastric cancer. Larger tumors and locally advanced tumors with clear invasion into adjacent organs are best resected with OG, which offers tactile feedback that is lacking in LG.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1528984104\"><span class=\"h1\">SURGICAL TECHNIQUES</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1039478236\"><span class=\"h2\">Laparoscopic total gastrectomy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Laparoscopic total gastrectomy is more risky and technically more demanding than laparoscopic distal gastrectomy because of the requirement of an esophagojejunostomy. </p><p>The patient is placed in a supine or modified lithotomy position, depending upon surgeon preference. The author favors a five-port technique that involves three 12-mm ports and two 5-mm ports. Typically, the central 12-mm camera port is positioned at the level of the umbilicus or just above, depending upon the length of the torso (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F111497\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef111497 \">figure 1</a>). The patient is placed into a slight reverse Trendelenburg (head up) position. </p><p>Assessment of the peritoneal cavity for micrometastatic disease is performed upon establishing pneumoperitoneum. If metastatic disease is identified and confirmed with frozen section biopsy, resection is aborted.

Dissection proceeds cephalad along the greater curvature of the stomach until all of the short gastric vessels have been divided, the fundus of the stomach is fully mobilized, and the left diaphragmatic crus is identified. Dissection then proceeds caudally along the distal aspect of the stomach toward the pylorus. The right gastroepiploic artery and vein are stripped of lymphatic tissue and divided either between clips or with a vascular stapler (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F58218\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef58218 \">figure 2</a>). This allows for skeletonization of the inferior aspect of the pylorus. The posterior wall of the stomach should be dissected off the anterior aspect of the pancreas (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F111498\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef111498 \">picture 1</a>). The gastroduodenal artery can be identified posterior to the pylorus, along the duodenum. </p><p>The gastrohepatic ligament is then divided to facilitate dissection along the lesser curvature. The right gastric artery is divided at its insertion into the pylorus (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F58218\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef58218 \">figure 2</a>). The superior aspect of the pylorus is skeletonized and dissected free until it can be elevated off the pancreas; this may necessitate mobilization of the duodenal bulb superiorly from the retroperitoneum. </p><p>The duodenum just distal to the pylorus is transected with an Endo GIA stapler. Retraction of the stomach inferiorly exposes the lesser sac space. The common hepatic artery is identified. The lymph nodes overlying the common hepatic artery are dissected free; this dissection proceeds distally until the takeoff of the gastroduodenal artery. With anterior elevation of the stomach, the left gastric artery is identified. The left gastric artery and vein are cleared of lymphatic tissue, and the vessels are divided close to the celiac axis. Similarly, the origin of the splenic artery is identified and cleared of lymphatic tissue.</p><p>Once lymphadenectomy has been completed in the lesser sac space, the dissection proceeds along the lesser curvature cephalad toward the phrenoesophageal ligament. The right diaphragmatic crus is identified. The phrenoesophageal ligament is divided, and the esophagus is mobilized circumferentially. The esophagus just proximal to the gastroesophageal junction is transected with an Endo GIA stapler (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F111499\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef111499 \">picture 2</a>), and the entire stomach is placed into a specimen bag and retrieved. The author favors performing frozen section analysis of the proximal margin. An omentectomy is also performed prior to reconstruction of the alimentary tract.</p><p>The jejunum is transected 20 to 30 cm distal to the ligament of Treitz. The distal end should be able to reach the esophageal stump without tension, in an antecolic fashion. Esophagojejunostomy reconstruction can be performed either handsewn or with a circular EEA stapler. The author utilizes an EEA stapler with an anvil that is passed transorally (the OrVil device). The staple line to the distal jejunal stump is removed to allow insertion of the stapler handle. After the spike of the stapler is driven through the jejunal bowel wall, it is connected with the anvil and the stapler fired to create a circular anastomosis (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F111500\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef111500 \">picture 3</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F111501\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef111501 \">picture 4</a>). The stapler handle is removed, and the jejunotomy is closed with an additional firing of the Endo GIA stapler, creating a small jejunal pouch distal to the anastomosis (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F63448\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef63448 \">figure 3</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F111476\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef111476 \">figure 4</a>). A 50- to 60-cm Roux limb is measured, and a side-to-side jejunojejunostomy is created with an Endo GIA stapler. Distal to that, a feeding jejunostomy tube is often placed, in accordance with surgeon preference. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H557363444\"><span class=\"h2\">Laparoscopic distal gastrectomy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A laparoscopic distal gastrectomy is performed with similar ports and liver retraction methods to those of a laparoscopic total gastrectomy. Depending on the location of the tumor, it may not be necessary to completely mobilize the fundus or divide the left gastric artery. The stomach is transected with the aim of achieving a 5-cm gross margin in the proximal stomach. After a similar lymphadenectomy and omentectomy have been performed, the gastrointestinal tract is reconstructed with a Billroth II gastrojejunostomy or Roux-en-Y gastrojejunostomy (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F89669\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef89669 \">figure 5</a>). Feeding tubes are typically not required for distal gastrectomy.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3837708486\"><span class=\"h1\">POSTOPERATIVE CARE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Following LG, patients are admitted to the regular surgical floor unless more intensive monitoring is required. Enhanced recovery programs for minimally invasive procedures should be followed, with emphasis on early mobilization and preference for non-narcotic analgesia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/laparoscopic-gastrectomy-for-cancer/abstract/30,31\" class=\"abstract_t\">30,31</a>]. Compared with conventional care, enhanced recovery programs were associated with earlier time to ambulation and oral intake, shorter length of hospital stay, and comparable morbidity and mortality [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/laparoscopic-gastrectomy-for-cancer/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. </p><p>It is the author's practice to routinely use prophylactic nasogastric tube decompression following total gastrectomy but not following distal gastrectomy. In total gastrectomy, the nasogastric tube is placed across the esophagojejunostomy as a transanastomotic &quot;stent&quot;; the tube is typically removed following a negative swallow study performed on postoperative days 4 or 5. A swallow test is not routinely performed in patients undergoing distal gastrectomy. </p><p>Diet is typically advanced as tolerated from postoperative day 1 or 2 following distal gastrectomy and following a negative swallow study for those undergoing total gastrectomy.<strong> </strong>Because oral intake is often not enough to sustain hydration and nutrition after a total gastrectomy, the author initiates trickle jejunal tube feeding 24 hours after surgery with slow advancement until the combination of oral intake and jejunal tube feeding becomes sufficient to sustain hydration and nutrition. </p><p>Once the patient is taking in sufficient oral intake to maintain body weight, the jejunal feeding tube can be removed in the office.

Specifically, patients reported better global health and functional quality of life; less appetite loss, pain, and reflux; fewer emotional problems; and improved body image at three months after LG than after OG. </p><p>Continued follow-up of the same group of patients, however, showed that the differences in quality of life mostly disappeared by approximately 24 months after surgery, with two exceptions: the dysphagia symptom score remained higher in the OG group, and the dyspnea symptom score remained higher in the LG group [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/laparoscopic-gastrectomy-for-cancer/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3392903337\"><span class=\"h1\">MINIMALLY INVASIVE ALTERNATIVES</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3134045317\"><span class=\"h2\">Robotic surgery</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Since the early 2000s, robotic gastric surgery has emerged as an alternative minimally invasive technique to LG. In Western countries such as the United States and Europe, however, robotic gastric surgery remains an emerging technology; further studies are required to fully understand and realize its role in treating gastric cancer.</p><p>In one of the few studies on robotic gastric surgery with long-term follow-up, 98 patients underwent neoadjuvant chemotherapy followed by robotic gastric resection including a D2 lymphadenectomy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/laparoscopic-gastrectomy-for-cancer/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>]. The five-year overall survival was 100 percent for stage IA disease, 84.6 percent for stage IB disease, 76.9 percent for stage II disease, and 21.5 percent for stage III disease, all comparable to reported survival rates of gastric cancer treated with OG or LG. Conversion to open surgery was required in 7.1 percent of patients, and postoperative complications occurred in 12.1 percent. Although disease recurrence occurred in 24.5 percent of patients, including 18 percent local recurrences, no port-site recurrence was observed. </p><p>Compared with conventional LG, robotic gastric surgery has the advantages of three-dimensional high-definition visualization, wristed and articulated movements, and improved ergonomics, with the surgeon able to sit during the operation.

By contrast, LG is underutilized in Western countries, partly due to the lower prevalence of the disease. (See <a href=\"#H3638818782\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above and <a href=\"#H3892592126\" class=\"local\">'Eastern versus Western experience'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The surgeon performing LG must be experienced with both complex gastrointestinal and advanced minimally invasive procedures and be supported by staff and hospital resources of equal competence. Patients with early gastric cancer who are free of significant cardiopulmonary comorbidities, obesity, and previous upper abdominal surgery are the best candidates for LG. (See <a href=\"#H4178591148\" class=\"local\">'Patient selection'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Laparoscopic total gastrectomy requires port placement, liver retraction, dissection along the greater and lesser curvature of the stomach, lymphadenectomy, vascular division, duodenal and esophageal transection, and esophagojejunostomy reconstruction. (See <a href=\"#H1039478236\" class=\"local\">'Laparoscopic total gastrectomy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Laparoscopic distal gastrectomy follows the same general steps of a total gastrectomy but may not require full mobilization of the fundus or division of the left gastric artery depending on the location of the tumor. A gross margin of 5 cm in the proximal stomach is required. Reconstruction is typically by a Billroth II gastrojejunostomy or Roux-en-Y gastrojejunostomy. (See <a href=\"#H557363444\" class=\"local\">'Laparoscopic distal gastrectomy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Enhanced recovery programs for minimally invasive procedures should be followed, with emphasis on early mobilization and preference for non-narcotic analgesia. In the author's practice, nasogastric tube decompression across the anastomosis and jejunal tube feeding are routinely used after total but not distal gastrectomy. (See <a href=\"#H3837708486\" class=\"local\">'Postoperative care'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Compared with open gastrectomy (OG), LG has superior or equal short-term patient outcomes and comparable long-term oncologic outcomes. Patient undergoing LG also reported a better quality of life in the early postoperative period, but the difference disappears after two years. (See <a href=\"#H1898550978\" class=\"local\">'Outcomes'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Alternative minimally invasive techniques of treating gastric cancer include robotic gastric resection and endoscopic resection.
